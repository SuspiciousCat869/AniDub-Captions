-No.

337
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:51,414
I mean, uh, I'm alone.

-Come on, you guys.

340
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,747
Are we going to eat or what?

341
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,081
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Oh, great.

342
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:00,914
I'm so tired, I forgot to eat.

And I'm so weak, I can

daddy, is him tired?

SOUN: Excuse me, hello?

347
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,547
I'm Akane's daddy.

348
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,481
Mm.

349
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:32,014
Feels good.

350
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:33,214

Hello.

You OK?

00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:04,614
Akane.

363
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:06,614
Be my bride.

Akane.

Ryoga.

What do you think you're doing?

or you're going to be sorry.

RANMA (VOICEOVER): That
shouldn't have happened.

376
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:30,181
Ryoga's much tougher than that.

377
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:32,347
It's like he's a
whole other per--

[mystical sounds]

379

-Thanks for nothing,
you big bully.

380
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,581
You nearly knocked me right out.

381
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:43,547
-Oh, no.

382
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:44,614
Not you again.

00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:47,414
-The ghost cat.

384
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:48,847
I should have known.

385
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:51,914
-So he was in Ryoga
the whole time.

386
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:52,581
-Yep.

387
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,047
I she sure was.

388
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:57,247
I was hoping you wouldn't
notice, but since you have,

389
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:59,814
I'm hoping you'll be
able to forgive me.

-I-- I-- I get it.

393
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,147
So that's why you didn't want to
eat nothing but-- but cat food,

394
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:08,914
right?

395
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,281
-Huh?

396
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,447
-Not to mention running
around on all fours

397
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:14,647
and curling into
a ball to sleep.

398
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:15,847
-Sure.

399
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,181
And why he'd rather use
sand instead of a toilet.

400
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:21,247
-Uh, yeah, man.

401
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:24,147
So, uh, so-- so don't worry
about trying to kiss Akane

402
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,981
and-- and proposing, and junk.

403
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,747
Because that was
the cat and not you.

-I feel faint.

405

-I was only trying
to do you a favor.

-Embarrassing me like
that in front of everyone.

407
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,147
Why I ought to--

408
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,381
-You never would have been
able to propose without me.

409
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:45,914
-Shut up.

410
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:46,581
-OK, then.

411
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:47,614
How about your feelings?

412
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:50,247
You could never have
confessed to Akane

413
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:52,681
if it hadn't been for
me, isn't that right?

your lips on Akane, not mine.

-Just think about
how great it would

420
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:07,447
be if you were to
team up with me.

where that ghost cat is?

it would be too soon.
