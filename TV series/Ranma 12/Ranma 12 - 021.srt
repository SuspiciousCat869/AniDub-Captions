GIRL RANMA: "I Am A Man.

4
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:49,922
Ranma's Going Back to China!?"

5
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:51,355
-Hey.

6
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:53,055
So what do I do now?

7
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:54,522
-You're going back to China?

8
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:56,622
Ranma, how can you even
think of going there

9
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:57,688
at a time like this?

10
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:58,955
-It's your fault.

11
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,255
None of this would have
happened if you hadn't insisted

12
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,555
on going there in
the first place.

13
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,655
-Foolish boy, haven't
I always taught you

14
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:07,355
that a true martial
artist can turn

15
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:10,655
any experience, no matter
how terrible, into training?

16
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:13,322
How can you expect to carry
on the School of Anything Goes

17
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:15,455
Martial Arts unless you train?

18
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:17,322
-You call this training?

19
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:21,022
What's the big idea of dragging
me to that place anyway, huh?

20
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:23,122
What did you expect
with a name like that?

21
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:24,055
GUIDE: Here, sirs.

22
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:25,755
We come to famous
training ground

23
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:27,188
of Cursed Springs, Jusenkyo.

24
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:32,288
-Ranma, follow me.

25
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:33,588
-Right behind you.

26
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:35,488
-Hey, sirs, what are you doing?

27
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,355
I have not finished
my tragic story.

28
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:40,322
-I won't go easy on you, Ranma.

29
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:41,755
-That's just the way I like it.

30
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:45,955
-Please, sirs.

31
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:50,455
Very bad you fall in spring.

32
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:51,488
-Hey, Pop.

33
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:52,088
What's up?

34
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:53,222
We done already?

35
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:05,355
What-- what the hell is that?

36
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:08,555
-That one, Shonmaonichuan,
"Spring of Drowned Panda."

37
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,255
Very tragic story of panda
who drowned 2,000 year ago.

38
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:16,788
The legend say whoever fall
in spring take body of panda.

39
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,322
-Hey, buddy, you never said
anything about that to us.

40
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,088
-Oh, too bad.

41
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:30,822
You fall in Nyannichuan,
"Spring of Drowned Girl."

42
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,055
There very tragic
legend of young girl who

43
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,555
drown in spring 1,500 year ago.

44
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:39,188
Now, whoever fall in the spring
take a body of a young girl.

45
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:47,622
[scream]

46
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:50,755
-Oh yeah, some great training
ground you brought us to,

47
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:51,655
wasn't it?

48
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:53,188
The only technique
I learned there

49
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,155
is one that turns me
into a girl and makes

50
00:03:55,188 --> 00:03:56,822
me ashamed to be a guy.

51
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:59,722
-Well, that was caused by
your own sloppiness, boy.

52
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:01,655
You should be thanking
me, because you still

53
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,255
have your life.

54
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:04,955
-What are you talking about?

55
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:08,255
My life is one thing, but
my manhood is another story.

56
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:10,488
-You sound like a girl, Ranma.

57
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:13,422
You know you can't spend
your life living in the past.

58
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:15,588
At this rate, you're
never going to inherit

59
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,788
the Tendo Anything Goes Martial
Arts Training Hall for sure.

60
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:20,922
-Well, who the heck
said I wanted it?

61
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:23,855
The one who came up with that
stupid fiancee thing was you.

62
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,088
It was your dumb idea.

63
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:29,288
-Well, now.

64
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:32,322
Your problem isn't so
terrible after all.

65
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,088
-Look.

66
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:34,755
My oldest daughter Kasumi.

67
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,055
She's 19.

68
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:38,722
My middle daughter,
Nabiki, she's 17.

69
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:41,355
And my youngest daughter,
Akune, she's 16.

70
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:42,588
Pick any one you want.

71
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:44,822
She'll be your new fiancee.

72
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,855
-Akane would seem
the wisest choice.

73
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:47,955
-Couldn't agree more.

74
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:48,622
-What?

75
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,755
You must be joking.

76
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,155
Why would I be?

77
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:52,922
-Because you hate
boys, don't you?

78
00:04:52,955 --> 00:04:54,722
-Well, I guess you're
in luck, Akane.

79
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:55,822
Ranma's half girl.

80
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:58,422
-Me marry that pervert.

81
00:04:58,455 --> 00:04:59,155
Never.

82
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:00,022
-Hey, wait a minute.

83
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,088
What do you mean pervert?

84
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,955
-You saw me in the
nude, you letch.

85
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:03,855
-Hold it.

86
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:04,788
Just a second.

87
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:06,155
You walked in on me.

88
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:09,388
-Oh yeah, well, it's different
when a girl looks at a boy.

89
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:10,322
Pervert.

90
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:10,822
Peeping Tom.

91
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:11,788
-See.

92
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:13,088
They're already
the perfect couple.

93
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:14,488
-We are not a couple.

94
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,788
We're fighting.

95
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:18,755
There's no way in the world
I could ever marry someone

96
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:19,688
like that.

97
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:20,388
-Oh yeah.

98
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:21,588
My sentiments exactly.

99
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:22,588
Goodbye.

100
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,988
-Ranma, where are you going?

101
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,622
-I'm going back to China.

102
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,155
I have to find a way to
change back for good.

103
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:33,555
This is no time for fiancees.

104
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:37,555
By the way, I noticed that you
took a pretty good look at me

105
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,388
too.

106
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,322
And I'm better built to boot.

107
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:47,655
RANMA: OK.

108
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:49,622
So maybe I overdid
it a little, but she

109
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:53,022
didn't have to hit me so hard
with that table, now did she?

110
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,222
-She's a little energetic.

111
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,655
Don't tell me you think
that's a bad thing.

112
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,355
-What?

113
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,555
Energetic is one thing.

114
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:00,322
She's more like a
short-tempered tomboy

115
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:02,322
with the charm of a warthog.

116
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:06,455
-So you say, but me thinks the
boy doth protest a trifle too

117
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:07,955
much.

118
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:08,922
-What do you mean?

119
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,488
-Woo.

120
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:12,455
You're blushing.

121
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,055
-Grow up, Pop.

122
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:17,622
-You need to be more truthful
with yourself now, Ranma.

123
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,688
No doubt your insincerity
stems from a basic lack

124
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,355
of self-discipline.

125
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:25,488
-Well, I guess we got more
in common than I thought.

126
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:29,788
-Ranma, how dare you speak
to your father that way?

127
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,755
-Hey, I'm the victim.

128
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:33,922
Thanks to you I got
weirdos following me

129
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:36,955
around town challenging me
to duels at school and stuff.

130
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:43,622
-Oh.

131
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:48,022
-"But earthlier happy is the
rose distilled than that which

132
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:52,488
withering on the virgin
thorn grows, lives,

133
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:55,655
and dies in single blessedness."

134
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:57,188
You there.

135
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:59,955
Aren't you being awfully
familiar with Akane?

136
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:02,655
-Well, yeah, but--

137
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,555
-Yeah, but what, Ranma?

138
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:06,622
-Who do you think you
are, insolent whelp?

139
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:09,088
Tell me how you know Akane.

140
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:09,788
-Well, I'm--

141
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:11,288
TATEWAKI: Wait.

142
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:14,488
Is it not the custom to
give one's own name first?

143
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:15,255
Fine then.

144
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:16,588
Mine I shall give.

145
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:19,455
I am the undefeated captain
of this school's kendo club,

146
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:22,288
the rising new star of the
high school fencing world.

147
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,288
The sound of my
voice strikes fear

148
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:25,522
into the hearts of my enemies.

149
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:30,255
My peers call me the Blue
Thunder of Furinkan High.

150
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:33,588
Tatewaki Kuno, age 17.

151
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:34,922
-Hey, Ranma.

152
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,422
Just what are they teaching
you at that school of yours?

153
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:39,155
-Oh, it don't make
any difference.

154
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:41,055
It's not like I can
concentrate on learning

155
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:43,688
while I've got this
stupid curse on me.

156
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:47,922
You wouldn't believe the
stuff that happens to me.

157
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:50,688
GIRL RANMA: He's late,
and he's the one that

158
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:52,122
picked the time and everything.

159
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:53,288
What a loser.

160
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:03,922
-"For it so falls out that what
we have we prize not the worth

161
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:07,488
whiles we enjoy it, but
being lacked and lost,

162
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,388
why then we rack the value.

163
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,988
Then we find the virtue
the possession would not

164
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:14,655
show us whiles it was ours."

165
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:19,288
It is I, Tatewaki Kuno,
who has beckoned you to me.

166
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:20,522
-You still don't get it.

167
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:21,755
Do you, pal?

168
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:25,222
Hey, where's that stick
you're always waving around?

169
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,122
-I have no need of it.

170
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:30,988
-Pretty confident, ain't ya?

171
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:35,622
-Confident enough
to give you this.

172
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:38,988
-Huh?

173
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:52,722
-Pig-tailed girl, I love you.

174
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:01,655
I love you.

175
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,922
-Chasing me around
wherever I go.

176
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:06,322
I tell you, asking me
for dates and stuff.

177
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:10,022
I've never been so
embarrassed in my entire life.

178
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:12,288
And then there's that
twisted sister of his,

179
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:13,955
Kodachi the Black Rose.

180
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,422
She's as bad as he is.

181
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,455
-Silly boy, don't you
remember article five,

182
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:22,622
item three of the code of the
Saotome School of Anything Goes

184
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:24,555
Well?

185
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:26,555
-We've got a code?

186
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:29,222
-Ranma, you break
your father's heart.

187
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,222
Have I spent the last 16
years of my life bringing up

188
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:33,588
a crybaby?

189
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:36,522
Have I not tried to teach
you honor and discipline?

190
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,755
What have I ever done to
deserve such a pathetic excuse

191
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,988
for a son?

192
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:43,488
-You think I like it, old man?

193
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,188
You think it's fun being a girl.

194
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:46,455
You don't know what it's like.

195
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:48,422
Don't tell me I
got no discipline.

196
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:52,322
For crying out loud, I wore a
pink leotard to a fight once.

197
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:59,222
-Impudent woman dares
take my beloved's name.

198
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:02,655
For that the Black Rose
will bring you to justice.

199
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:05,255
-If you won't listen
to reason, I'm

200
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:09,488
going to have to beat
some sense into you.

201
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:10,422
-Hm.

202
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,388
How utterly ridiculous.

203
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:16,488

of a thousand clubs.

Challenger Ranma Saotome
blocks with a pig.

212
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,288
The pig seems to be angry,
but that's to be expected.

00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:02,722
-Hey, what do you want me to do?

214
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:03,722
-An opening.

215
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,588
-I can play that too.

216
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:14,022
-Oh no.

Oh, Champion Kuno

00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:28,322
-It's just not fair.

220
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,188
I didn't become a
martial artist so I

221
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,988
could become a champion of
girls gymnastics, you know.

Come on.

got no discipline?

Well, now you know what it feels
like to be in a tight spot.

-I got it.

I got it.

Let me go.

00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:10,617
-It's like everybody's always
mad at me or something.

Calm down, boy.

You're just imagining things.

Answer me this.

Why is it me who
always ends up having

to pay for your
mistakes, old man.

You don't.

You're just thinking
about it too much.

Just stop and relax.

Like your accident with that
little black pig in China?

Do you remember that accident?

There a very tragic legend
of piglet that drowned

there 1,200 year ago.

A very terrible legend, sir.

Now, whoever fall in spring
take a body of black piglet.

I think maybe this one come from

-Nyu-chieh what?

325
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:30,150
What kind of food is that?

326
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:31,084
-Ooh, sirs.

327
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:33,050
This is town of Amazon womans.

328
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,917
-Huh?

329
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,417
-Oh, very lucky.

330
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,150
Today, the women's
have tournament.

331
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,784
GIRL RANMA: That's a woman?

332
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:44,517
GUIDE: Here.

333
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,084
That one more pretty, no.

334
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,484
You watch this one, sirs.

335
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,750
Win tournament is
a very good honor.

336
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,317
-That girl's got some
serious strength.

337
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,017
-Ooh, sirs.

338
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,684
What you eating there?

339
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,417
-Hm?

340
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,650
[speaking chinese]

341
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,150
-Well, if I defeat you,
you've got no problem, right?

342
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:52,017
-Ah, too bad.

343
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,517
He win.

344
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:13,350
-Ha.

345
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:13,750
Ha.

346
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:14,317
Ha.

347
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:14,950
That's my boy.

348
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:16,917
Like father, like son.

349
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,784
-You know that it's
your fault for setting

350
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:21,617
a bad example, old man.

351
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,484
-It's not just me.

352
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:25,650
Don't deny you've brought
your own share of trouble

353
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:26,384
into this house.

354
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,817
-Ranma, I kill.

355
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:33,150
Ranma.

356
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:39,150
-When he's a boy,
she just wants him.

357
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,450
When he's a girl,
she wants him dead.

358
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:42,317
-Come on.

359
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,184
Be reasonable.

360
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:47,550
-Ranma!

361
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,350
-Somebody help me.

362
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:49,984
Help me please.

363
00:18:56,784 --> 00:19:02,184
-You know, Saotome, with you
and your son in this house,

364
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:03,917
there's never a dull moment.

365
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,850
I'm so glad you're here.

366
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:07,750
I'm so glad you're here.

367
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:16,650
-Your unresolved relationship
with that Chinese girl

368
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:19,317
is the reason for all the
trouble around here lately.

369
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,217
Have you ever thought
about how hard

370
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,850
this must be on the Tendos?

371
00:19:23,884 --> 00:19:27,617
-What does that have
to do with anything?

372
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,917
-And then think about this.

373
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,917
If you go to China, where
does that leave Akane?

374
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:36,950
-She'll, uh--

375
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:38,317
-Go on, son.

376
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,050
What will she do?

377
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:41,017
-Ah.

378
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,850
You scared me.

379
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,517
-Did my ears deceive
me, or did you just

380
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,350
say you intend to toss aside
my little girl and go to China?

381
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:53,550
-Uh, toss?

382
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:54,417
No.

383
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,717
That's not what I meant to say.

384
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,517
-Then, what exactly do
you mean, huh, Ranma?

385
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,117
-Don't tell me you've
already had your evil way

386
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,417
with that Chinese girl.

387
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:10,884
-Wait.

388
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:11,917
You didn't lose.

389
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,750
It was an accident.

390
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:17,050
-Be a man and take
your kiss of death.

391
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:27,250
-Wo ai ni.

392
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:28,617
-Love.

393
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,117
-Huh?

394
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:35,384
-Ranma, you didn't really
allow that girl to seduce you,

395
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,717
did you?

396
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,884
-Saotome, what kind of father
instills such loose morals

397
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,017
on his son?

398
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,517
I don't want my little
girl near that pervert.

399
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,317
-Will both of you just
shut up for a minute?

400
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,084
I told you.

401
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:46,117
It's not like that.

402
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,650
Why doesn't anybody
ever listen to me?

403
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,017
-Oh, Ranma.

404
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,750
Are you and Shampoo
really planning

405
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,017
to elope and move to China?

406
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,117
It can't be true.

407
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,550
-You and Shampoo?

408
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,884
Does this mean you
won't be marrying Akane?

409
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,750
-Ranma, if you think I'm going
to let you go off to China

410
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:10,750
and find a cure by yourself,
better think again.

411
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,550
-Ranma, fleeing the country and
leaving the score between us

412
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,450
forever unsettled?

413
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:18,350
That is a sad
miscalculation indeed.

414
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:20,617
Let us settle it now instead.

415
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,950
-Ranma, darling.

416
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:25,317
China, my love, you mustn't.

417
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,384
Wherever shall I go?

418
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,817
Whatever shall I do?

419
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,850
-Uh, Kodachi.

420
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:30,950
Uh.

421
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:33,584
-Well, well, Ranma.

422
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:37,184
I hope that you and Shampoo
have a wonderful life together

423
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:38,350
in China.

424
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:41,517
Think of this as my
wedding gift to you both.

425
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,817
-Wait a minute, Akane.

426
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,917
I can explain everything.

427
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,050
Hey.

428
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:46,817
AKANE: Ranma, I never
want to see you again!

429
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,750
SOUN TENDO: Ranma, I
will never forgive you

430
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:50,084
for eloping with that girl.

431
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:51,050
You got that.

432
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:52,284
RANMA: I just want
to be normal again.

433
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:55,050
KODACHI: Oh my darling Ranma.

434
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:57,117
TATEWAKI: Pig-tailed
girl, I love you.

435
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,111
GIRL RANMA: I am a man.
