Maybe someone's trying
to frame me or something.

you should practice

You think it's a side effect
from your alter ego medicine?

It's an alter shadow

00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,011
-I win.

334
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,845
-Bravo, Ranma.

335
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:43,678
You got rid of him.

336
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,745
-Way to go, boy.

337
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,778
-But I don't understand
how the shadow suddenly

338
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,345
became so vulnerable.

339
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:52,078
-It's because the shadow
was in love with Akane.

340
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:52,619
-Huh?

341
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,619
-What?

342
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,452
-You see it was Ranma's shadow.

343
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:56,752
Right?

344
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:59,286
Well, we all know Ranma's
far from pure and innocent.

345
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:02,986
And when Akane spurned his
love, he became vulnerable.

346
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:06,186
-Pure and innocent,
the two qualities

347
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:08,519
that Ranma lacks most.

348
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:09,060
-Akane!

349
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,060
Hey, look everyone!

350
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,560
I've got my shadow back.

351
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,893
I'm normal again!

352
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:21,493
-You're right.

353
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:23,093
It's back.

354
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:25,260
-I almost forgot.

355
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:25,801
Adios!

356
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:34,634
-You know, it's kind of nice
to see Ranma back to normal

357
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,834
again, if you can
call Ranma normal.

NARRATOR: Kuno's been attending
the parent teacher conference

361
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,690
for Kodachi for
years, until now.

362
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,156
What's he going to do?

363
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:28,556
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"Dear Daddy, Love Kodachi."

364
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:32,156
We'll see you there.
