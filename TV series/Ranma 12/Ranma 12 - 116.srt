THEME SONG: (SINGING
IN JAPANESE)

2
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,300
I want the sweet bread.

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,833
I'll have a sandwich, please.

4
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,833
Hey, give me the curry bread.

5
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,733
WOMAN: Just hold your horses.

6
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,766
[chatter]

7
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh man, they're
gonna run out again.

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,933
Hm?

9
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:58,474
Huh?

10
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,833
Secondary school store.

11
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,033
Well that's news to me.

12
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,066
That sign back there
must have been a joke.

13
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:42,966
Ah!

14
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:44,333
[crash]

15
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:48,733
Me sensing the trouble.

16
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,600
What's going on here?

17
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,141
Huh?

18
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,066
No entry sign?

19
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:03,633
Where am I?

20
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,033
That's it!

21
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,541
Hm?

22
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,833
The place is deserted.

23
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:22,766
Oh man.

24
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:26,407
Huh?

25
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,666
Ah!

26
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:38,500
Are you looking for something?

27
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,666
Ah!

28
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:43,533
I just came down here to
look for something to eat.

29
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,600
TORAMASA: It's right there.

30
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,141
Huh?

31
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,200
What is this?

32
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,766
It looks like it used to be
a sweet roll or something.

33
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,200
That creeps giving
me the creeps.

34
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,900
I'm outta here!

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,833
That's enough.

36
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,133
Ranma Saotome, you
be sticking your nose

37
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:18,033
where it don't belong.

38
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,733
The Secret Don
of Furinkan High.

39
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,300
STUDENT 1: Did you hear?

40
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,766
There's another school
store at Furinkan.

41
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:26,533
STUDENT 2: Really?

42
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,733
I wonder where it is?

43
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,100
I heard rumors about it,
but I doubt if they're true.

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,300
Come on, let's go find out.

45
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,966
[chatter] out.

46
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,200
He thinks it's true?

47
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know.

48
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,133
I think it's somewhere--

49
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,933
Could be true.

50
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,700
I don't know.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,866
What are you all talking about?

52
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,233
That school store
ripped me off.

53
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,400
I went in and bought a
sandwich, and the whole thing

54
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,166
was covered in mold.

55
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:53,300
I bought a pair of
gym shorts and look.

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,033
Ah, man.

57
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,100
Talk about retro.

58
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,500
Yeah, check out these sneakers.

59
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,900
They're old work sandals.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,933
[chatter]

61
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,700
Whining about it to each
other won't change anything.

62
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,700
Why don't you tell
the principal?

63
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
NABIKI: That's a
pretty lame idea.

64
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,133
BOTH: Hm?

65
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,033
OK then.

66
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,333
What's your idea, huh Nabiki?

67
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,333
NABIKI: I've heard tales
about the other school store,

68
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:23,733
but the real story is about
the vendor who worked there.

69
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,933
They say there's an old
man who lives down there,

70
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,966
and the rumor is that,
if you get too close,

71
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:33,066
he can cast a bad
luck curse on you.

72
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,966
I suggest you all forget
about, as if the place never

73
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,200
existed at all.

74
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,366
That's just a stupid
fairytale, right guys?

75
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,633
Yeah, it's just a fairytale.

76
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:47,900
Everyone, calm down please.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,766
Students of Furinkan High, if
you have absolutely nothing

78
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:57,066
to fear with the brave
Tatewaki Kuno here.

79
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:02,600
I will debunk these
rumors once and for all!

80
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,141
Ah!

81
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,000
[screaming]

82
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,266
So, the story's true.

83
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:15,766
The old vendor is
back to haunt us.

84
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,000
No!

85
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,000
And I still don't have a
thing to wear to gym class.

86
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,566
[crying]

87
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,100
This is stupid.

88
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,333
Huh?

89
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,800
Now it's my turn.

90
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,333
No!

91
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:29,300
Wait, Akane!

92
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,233
Hey, Akane!

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,066
Akane!

94
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,066
Are you--

95
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,000
Ranma?

96
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,733
Uh, what are you doing?

97
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,100
You see, Toramasa doesn't
have any relatives,

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,700
and he's not feeling well.

99
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,533
[coughing]

100
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:52,074
Huh?

101
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you all right?

102
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,333
Oh, don't worry.

103
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,166
I'm fine, Akane.

104
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,233
OK, what's going on here?

105
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,900
I thought this place was
supposed to be haunted.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,266
That's just a rumor, and it's
the principal who started it.

107
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:14,633
Yes, he wanted to put
me out of business.

108
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,600
For years now he's had
a grudge against me.

109
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,566
I'd say you put yourself
out of business by selling

110
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,300
moldy old sweet rolls.

111
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,700
[coughing]

112
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,066
Toramasa!

113
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,133
Ranma!

114
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,666
Could you at least
show a little respect?

115
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,033
He is your elder.

116
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,200
Eh.

117
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,600
Old man, you must pay
for what you have done.

118
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,000
No one embarrasses me
and gets away with it!

119
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,233
What do you think
you're doing, Kuno?

120
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:42,774
Ah!

121
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,200
[crash]

122
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,233
TORAMASA: It pains
me to think that you

123
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,300
are the cream of the Furinkan
High martial arts crop.

124
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,966
Wha-- wha-- what?

125
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:57,300
Well, back in my day, men
were men, but not today.

126
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,533
[scoffs]

127
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,800
Oh no, everything has
changed for the worst, what

128
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,566
with your rock and roll, wasting
your time dating, and the boys

129
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,900
who look like little girlies.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,733
This whole school
has gone to pot.

131
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,666
What's this world coming to?

132
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:14,600
[crying]

133
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,333
Boys who look like
little girlies?

134
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,033
You think he means me.

135
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,166
Ha!

136
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,833
You are nothing but a
senile old man, old man.

137
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:23,966
Ha!

138
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:27,700
Being in charge of the
store was only a cover.

139
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,933
Hm?

140
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,533
I was the martial arts
instructor at Furinkan High

141
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,566
ever since the first
principal, and you

142
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,966
may have heard of my legend.

143
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:40,433
I am Toramasa
Kobayakawa, and the time

144
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,566
has come for me to do my job!

145
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:49,233
Now show your respect!

146
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,966
Yes, master.

147
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,766
Please, I beg of you,
forgive me my insolence.

148
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:59,200
Well, I guess his
cough cleared up.

149
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,366
I think you're right.

150
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,066
He looks a lot better now.

151
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,933
Hey punk, you better
watch your mouth.

152
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:05,766
Ha!

153
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:06,966
Make me.

154
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,633
Well then, you won't
mind if I show everyone

155
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:10,433
your little secret?

156
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:15,974
Ah!

157
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:24,133
You don't think you
can get away with this.

158
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:28,400
Why don't you try and stop me?

159
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,166
Hey, where are you going?

160
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,400
TORAMASA: And you
think you're so smart?

161
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,366
[laughter]

162
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:34,800
RANMA: Come back here!

163
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,341
Ranma!

164
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Where the heck did
he disappear to?

165
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,366
[laughter]

166
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:46,433
TORAMASA: I may be old, but
I'm not as feeble as you think.

167
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,700
[laughter]

168
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
Now you're starting
to get on my nerves.

169
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,033
Huh?

170
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,466
Stand aside.

171
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:59,966
Ranma Saotome, I will not
allow you to fight to Toramasa.

172
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,533
I shall be the one to
smite you in his stead.

173
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,600
Hiyah!

174
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,800
No thanks.

175
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,166
I'd rather take it out on
the old geezer than you.

176
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:10,733
TORAMASA: I like
your footwork, Ranma.

177
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,466
[laughter]

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,066
Oh man.

179
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,266
Where's the little
freak hiding anyway?

180
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:19,533
Huh?

181
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:23,033
TORAMASA: It's like the
chicken hunting the fox, Ranma.

182
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,433
You'll never find me!

183
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,233
[laughter]

184
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:29,400
Da!

185
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,366
What was that you were saying?

186
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,000
Whoa, you're good.

187
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,300
Well, I'd love to stay and
chat, but I gotta bail.

188
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,033
Where'd that come from?

189
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,366
I wonder what's
with the old goat.

190
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:49,566
Half the time he sounds like
he's half dead, except when

191
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,033
he talks about Furinkan High.

192
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:52,733
That's right.

193
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,533
Ah!

194
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,333
I hate it when you do that!

195
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,366
My dear boy, I
believe now is the time

196
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,066
that I told you about the
glorious history of Furinkan

197
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,300
High School.

198
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,566
Centuries ago in
Japan, there was

199
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,966
much chaos between all
the different tribes.

200
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:17,766
Oh, go on.

201
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:19,500
And during this
time of upheaval,

202
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,566
it was our very
own Furinkan High

203
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,200
School that saved the world.

204
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,833
Under the banner of
the Furinkan High flag,

205
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:30,166
both teachers and students
battled against fierce foe

206
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:31,233
after foe.

207
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,966
The wars raged on
over many, many years,

208
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,000
but none of our enemies
were strong enough

209
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,566
to defeat the mighty
boys from Furinkan.

210
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,533
Finally, with the country
once again united,

211
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,933
we rode on into the capital.

212
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,833
Oh, why has history
been so cruel to me?

213
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,266
If only I were born
in another era,

214
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,800
I surely could've been a hero.

215
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,766
Don't stain the carpet, Kuno.

216
00:11:57,866 --> 00:12:09,000
But sadly, as our troops
approached the city of Kyoto,

217
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,866
we found it under attack.

218
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:17,000
We were too late, as World War
II was well under way by then.

219
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
What an interesting
slant on history.

220
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,766
Yeah, it might even
make a good action flick.

221
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,700
Would you shut up?

222
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,100
Huh?

223
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,866
Where is it?

224
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:26,400
Where is it?

225
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,700
Where is it?

226
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,100
Hm.

227
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,633
Ah great, me wonder where that
foolish old kahuna hid it at.

228
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,366
So what do you
think you're doing?

229
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:35,907
Hm?

230
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,200
Oh boy, oh boy, cakey.

231
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,700
Yeah, you sure scared me.

232
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,933
Yeah, well, me just be
mopping up the place.

233
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:45,500
That's all.

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,133
Just mopping.

235
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:46,671
[nervous laughter]

236
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,633
What was that all about?

237
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:52,100
Me most get rid
of the old kahuna

238
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,666
if it be the last thing me do.

239
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:11,674
Aloha students of Furinkan.

240
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,141
Me decided to call
everyone to this assembly

241
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:16,674
to announce to you that
we be ridding ourselves

242
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:19,107
of that old vendor
once and for all.

243
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:20,941
ALL: Yeah!

244
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,774
Toramasa, what
are we going to do?

245
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:25,707
The principal is on his way
with a horde of students.

246
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,341
Ha, that's my cue.

247
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:29,307
I guess I'll see you around.

248
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:32,841
Hey, just where do you think
you're going, you freak?

249
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:35,807
There's but one way
to win this fight,

250
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:38,107
and that's the
element of surprise.

251
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:41,274
It reminds me of when my
brave warriors and I fled

252
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:44,074
to China to hide out during
one of our campaigns.

253
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:46,841
There we created the
Mongolian empire,

254
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:48,841
which even the Europeans
couldn't conquer.

255
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:49,807
You're an idiot.

256
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:57,641
I have lost face, and
that leaves only one thing

257
00:13:57,741 --> 00:14:01,307
for Toramasa to do--
commit harakiri.

258
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,407
What are you saying?

259
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,107
Please don't try
and stop me, Akane.

260
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:05,807
Don't worry.

261
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:06,807
We won't.

262
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:08,574
Allow the sword
of Tatewaki Kuno

263
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:11,041
to do the honor of
being your second.

264
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,507
Ah!

265
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:13,574
Hey!

266
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:14,807
Are you out of your
cotton picking mind?

267
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:16,507
But-- I thought--

268
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,041
Ranma, we both
know Toramasa can't

269
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,307
win this fight all by
himself, so we're just

270
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:22,907
going to have to help him.

271
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:26,841
Ha, give me one good reason
why I should help the old goat.

272
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,941
Ah!

273
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,107
All right, I get the picture.

274
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,041
OK, me fine young
cakies, it be time

275
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:41,141
to get the show on the road and
do away with the evil vendor.

276
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:49,507
Halt, fellow
students of Furinkan,

277
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:52,207
I order you to cease
your futile offensive.

278
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,407
If you do not, I will be
forced to deal with you each

279
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:56,407
individually.

280
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:57,907
And I shall triumph!

281
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,274
[yelling]

282
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:09,174
No, no!

283
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,374
No!

284
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,307
D-- d-- don't you dare
take another step forward

285
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:16,107
or it will be your last!

286
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,074
Ah!

287
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:19,441
[screaming]

288
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,074
Ugh, that hurts.

289
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,274
Ah!

290
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:32,907
Look out!

291
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,507
All right, men.

292
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:38,048
Retreat!

293
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:48,307
And now it's time
to make you dance!

294
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:55,341
Hey!

295
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:56,774
Would you quit shoving?

296
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,774
I think my pants are on fire!

297
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:07,341
[boom]

298
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:13,507
Huh?

299
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:14,048
Huh?

300
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,507
Well, we sure showed them, huh?

301
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:29,341
You two cakies
think you beat me?

302
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:32,207
Then you got
another ting coming.

303
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:34,007
Well, we stalled
'em for now, but

304
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:36,407
what are we supposed to do
for an encore, Toramasa?

305
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:42,374
Look at the way
he's dressed, Ranma--

306
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:44,974
like he's ready for battle.

307
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:46,307
I wouldn't bet on it.

308
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,907
Would you look at this?

309
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:57,407
He's sitting here sipping tea
while we're out defending him.

310
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:59,007
Yeah, what's up with that?

311
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:00,874
Ha, there is an
old proverb which

312
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,407
says you must become
friends with your enemies

313
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:04,774
before you fight them.

314
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,107
Right.

315
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,741
And I say that you're too
much of a coward to face 'em.

316
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:10,207
[rumbling]

317
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:10,748
BOTH: Hm?

318
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,141
[crash]

319
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:28,041
Wha-- what the heck
is going on out here?

320
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:32,074
Aloha to my two little cakes
and a wrinkled old nincompoop.

321
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:35,274
Me have a little present
to give to you three.

322
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:38,141
What would we do with
a stupid giant cat?

323
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:40,807
It be not the cat,
but what be inside.

324
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:45,507
Ah!

325
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,474
[yelling]

326
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:52,482
BOTH: Ah!

327
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:07,341
[screaming]

328
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,641
OK, now I be mad.

329
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,907
Suck on this, suckers.

330
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:16,574
Ah!

331
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:17,474
What are you doing?

332
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,441
[boom]

333
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,441
Oh no!

334
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:20,982
Oh!

335
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:21,482
Huh?

336
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:21,989
Ah!

337
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:22,448
Ah!

338
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:25,374
[boom]

339
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:26,341
AKANE: Ah!

340
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:27,341
Ranma!

341
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:27,882
Akane!

342
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:32,641
[chuckling]

343
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,107
No!

344
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,507
That be far enough,
Ranma Saotome.

345
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:39,241
Hey, don't you be
nobody's fool now, OK?

346
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:42,041
Or else the cakey's
hair gets it.

347
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:45,607
And don't think me not
be doing to her either.

348
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,541
Ranma.

349
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:48,974
You!

350
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:52,641
You let go of her now!

351
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:56,041
The girl doesn't have
anything to do with our fight,

352
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:59,041
so be a man and release her now.

353
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:00,907
Okie dokie, you got it.

354
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,941
I wonder what the deal is with
the principal wanting to get

355
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,441
rid of Toramasa so quick.

356
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:32,174
What-- what's happening, Ranma?

357
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:35,341
I think they're showing each
other how much power they have.

358
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,774
Let's do it!

359
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,974
Look out Toramasa!

360
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,774
It's time to get rid of you!

361
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:55,741
Oh no.

362
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:59,207
Don't tell me you had it with
you the whole time, old man?

363
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:01,907
That's right, and here it is.

364
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:04,007
What is it?

365
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:08,241
What the-- it's just some
dumb old report card.

366
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:08,941
Huh?

367
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,241
This is the principal's.

368
00:20:13,274 --> 00:20:14,074
[laughter]

369
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:15,574
Man this is wicked.

370
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:20,174
The principal never graduated
'cause he got an F in English.

371
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:24,874
Hey, you give that
report card back to me!

372
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,774
Huh?

373
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:27,707
[laughter]

374
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:30,041
I have destroyed the proof!

375
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,807
Think again.

376
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:33,141
That was just a copy.

377
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,707
I got tons more here,
and here, and here.

378
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:37,941
I've even got the original.

379
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,574
PRINCIPAL KUNO: I'm ruined.

380
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:45,941
I thought he was American.

381
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,907
I'd say it looks as
though he was just pulling

382
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:51,774
a fast one on all of us.

383
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:55,474
I be vet sorry, Toramasa,
and because you win,

384
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:56,907
you can stay at the school.

385
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,007
Good.

386
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,741
Now that things are
back to normal again,

387
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,207
I can run the school store.

388
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:03,841
Oh, revenge is so sweet.

389
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:06,241
[laughter]

390
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:09,974
Listen!

391
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:13,074
It is with great pride that
I announce the grand opening

392
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:14,374
of the new school store.

393
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,474
So, are you gonna sell
moldy sweet rolls again?

394
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:21,474
You kids are all spoiled,
not like in my day.

395
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:23,741
Back then we had to
hunt for our own food.

396
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:26,541
Why, I remember having to
stalk the great woolly mammoth

397
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,374
during my lunch hour
here at Furinkan

398
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:29,741
just to make myself a sandwich.

399
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:32,041
Sure has a wild imagination.

400
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,507
No kidding.

401
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:36,074
And to think, now we
get to listen to him

402
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,674
babble on every day.

403
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,264
RANMA (VOICEOVER): With oil
drums strapped to their backs,

404
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,264
Ranma, Ryoga, and Mousse
head deep into the mountains.

405
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:24,530
What could they be up to?

406
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,364
Next time on "Ranma 1/2," back
to the way we were, please.

407
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:30,530
We'll see you there.
