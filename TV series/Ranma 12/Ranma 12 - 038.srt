flawless, all right.

Those belong to me.

You put those back where
you found them right now,

104
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,929

with this, Ranma.

108
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,129
So how do you propose
to punish him?

109
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:12,296
-Maybe we should sew him into
a sack, load it with rocks,

110
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,829
and dump him into the ocean.

111
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:15,996
I think that ought
to cover his tracks.

What do you think?

113

-Too late to be nice to me
now, you ungrateful fool.

Too late.

You'll be sorry.

-They what?

120
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:53,896
You mean they deliberately
provoked the master's anger?

121
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:56,362
It's the thing I
feared the most.

sneak around, anyway?

You don't know
what you're saying.

138

You have yet to experience

-True wrath of the master?

Come to think of
it, I never have

he can unleash on all of us.

The last fight is going to
seem like a training exercise.

Son, what have you done?

148
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,262
What in heaven's
name have you done?

00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:08,429
-Come on, how bad can it be?

150
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,829
I'm not afraid of him.

151

00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,262
Bet you think you're
pretty funny, don't you?

165
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,862
-Ha ha, I've got your undies.

166
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:47,862
Ow!

167
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:49,362
Hey, but it wasn't
me who wrote that.

168
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:51,629
-Are you going to
pay me or what?

169
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:52,962
-Son, they're waiting.

170
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:54,462
RANMA SAOTOME:
But I didn't-- no.

171
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:55,396
Why should I?

172
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:56,996
I didn't order nothing.

173
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,229
-Oh, you didn't, eh?

174
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,129
-Look, buddy.

175
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:02,529
I don't care who did it.

176
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:04,996
But somebody owes me for
50 orders of pork cutlet,

177
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,529
and I ain't leaving
till I get it.

178
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,529
RANMA SAOTOME: But
it wasn't me, I said.

179
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:10,029
I ain't got the money
to pay for that.

180
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,129
-I got orders to bring back
an escaped [? panda. ?]

181
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:14,529
-You give me back my
underwear, you little creep.

182
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,829
RANMA SAOTOME: Hey!

183
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,129
I'm going to get you
for this, you old freak.

184
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,829
-Well, at least we know what
you meant by true wrath now.

185
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:45,229
-His revenge is,
well, diabolical.

186
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:46,629
-It's so pathetic.

187
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,662
Though I can't find it
in my heart to blame him.

188
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:56,662
Be that as it may,
Daddy, don't you

189
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:59,529
think it's time to
put a stop to it?

190
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:01,396
-Even if he is our
master, I can't just

191
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:05,296
sit idly by and watch
this destruction.

192
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:09,196
I've stood all I can stand,
and I can't stand no more.

193
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:10,729
-Is that so?

194
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:14,629
-Master, allow us not to stand
but to bow down before you

195
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:15,996
in most humble obedience.

196
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,396
-Oh, get up.

197
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:21,529
-Pathetic, yet
strangely effective.

198
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,862
-Isn't there one more?

199
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:28,996
There's one other ingrate who
should be bowing before me.

200
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:32,629
All that person would have to
do is admit that he's wrong

201
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:34,629
and all would be forgiven.

202
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:37,829
No, he'd rather let
everyone else suffer,

203
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:41,529
sacrificing everything
for his own pride.

204
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:42,162
Admit it.

205
00:09:42,196 --> 00:09:43,129
Come on.

206
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:44,029
-No way.

207
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:45,896
I'd rather die than--

208
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:46,596
No.

209
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,929
I don't bow to nobody.

210
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,962
-But son, you wouldn't
really be bowing to him.

211
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:52,329
It would all be pretend,
just to sooth his wrath.

212
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:55,929
-I told you.

213
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,129
I bow to nobody.

214
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:08,796
-Look, either he bows to me or
the reign of terror goes on.

215
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:09,796
Got it?

216
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,231
-Perhaps it's best if you
laid low for awhile, Son.

217
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:37,598
-Poor Ranma.

218
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:38,964
-Come on, It's not so bad.

219
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:41,731
Think of it as a vacation.

220
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:45,164
-He throws a fit and
I'm out in the cold.

221
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:46,498
Really cold.

222
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:47,531
Hey, Akane.

223
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,664
-Thought you might be hungry.

224
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,431
-Great.

225
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:51,098
Thanks a lot.

226
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:54,098
-Don't you think
you're-- I mean,

227
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:56,631
why not just get it over with?

228
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,131
-No way.

229
00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:59,998
I'd rather take my chances
and stay out here and freeze

230
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:03,198
to death than give that little
freak of nature what he wants.

231
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:04,931
Besides, I think I've
come up with a way

232
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,531
to fix that freak's
little red wagon for good.

233
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:09,231
-You mean you've got a plan?

234
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:10,531
-Well, yeah.

235
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:12,731
But I don't think I can pull
it off without you, Akane.

236
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:16,831
[whispering]

237
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:18,164
-No, don't!

238
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:18,998
Ow, that hurts!

239
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,798
Do you have to do it so hard?

240
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:23,764
-Then stop squirming around
and I won't poke you.

241
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,264
-Akane, your lap is so warm.

242
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:29,264
I could stay here for--

243
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:31,498
Hey, you did that on
purpose, didn't you?

244
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:33,198
-You want me to do this or not?

245
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:36,864
-Well, what if I rested my head
just there for a little while.

246
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:39,231
Now that wouldn't be
so bad, now would it?

247
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,164
-Promise me you'll
be good or I'll stop.

248
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:42,364
-I'll be good.

249
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:43,331
-All right.

250
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,931
-But I didn't do anything!

251
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:51,531
-I'm warning you!

252
00:11:51,564 --> 00:11:52,798
-OK, OK.

253
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:55,498
This time I promise
for real, all right?

254
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:56,098
-Honestly.

255
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:00,631
-Sewn by her own little hands.

256
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:03,064
What a happy day.

257
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,298
-It probably won't even work.

258
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:08,231
-I'm telling you,
it's 100% foolproof.

259
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:08,798
-But how?

260
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,898
I mean, what?

261
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:11,398
-Shampoo gave this to me.

262
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,798
It's got some dumb Chinese
name which I can't remember.

263
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,331
But she calls it Girl Away.

264
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:16,298
-Girl Away?

265
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:17,631
-Yeah.

266
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:19,731
It's like a tear gas, see,
except it only works on girls.

267
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:22,264
The old freak won't
know what hit him.

268
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:25,231
Shampoo said it was developed by
some weird empress in China who

269
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:28,664
wanted to punish guys
who ticked her off.

270
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:31,431
-OK, but why would
she give this to you?

271
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:34,131
-She said it was to protect me.

272
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,664
-Protect you from
what, I wonder?

273
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:39,231
-Well, let's just hope it works.

274
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:40,431
-Don't worry, it will.

275
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,164
-There you go.

276
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,398
-I knew the womanly arts
weren't wasted on you, my dear.

277
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:50,831
This is excellent work.

278
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:52,098
-You really like it?

279
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:53,831
-Cutest little piggy
wig I've ever seen.

280
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:56,864
-It's a dog.

281
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:59,198
-But Tendo, shouldn't
we-- you know--

282
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:03,564
-He who runs away lives
to fight another day.

283
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:05,631
-Oh, yeah.

284
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:06,664
Get a load of this.

285
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:09,631
Akane just made it for me.

286
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,898
-Yes, Master.

287
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,331
That's quite a
distinguished patch there.

288
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:13,331
-Quite nice.

289
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:14,731
-Ain't it, though?

290
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,064
Well, I'm off.

291
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:17,564
There's a lot of ladies
out there waiting for me

292
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:18,864
if you know what I mean.

293
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,698
-You will look but not
touch, right Master?

294
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:24,164
-What do you think, stupid?

295
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:26,731
How long have you been
my student, anyway?

296
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,531
-If they link the
Master to those crimes,

297
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:30,064
we're done for, Saotome.

298
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,231
-We'll move.

299
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:32,431
-Will it do any good?

300
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:33,731
-Probably not.

301
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,598
Master, come back!

302
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:37,364
-Really?

303
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:38,864
You're kidding.

304
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,398
-Hey ho, girlies!

305
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,764
Hey, what's the matter with you?

306
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:47,298
-Stay away from me!

307
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:56,998
-Oh yeah!

308
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:59,764
What is it, my cologne?

309
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,964
-Stay back!

310
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:05,931
-Huh?

311
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:11,331
I just don't-- you
like me, don't you?

312
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:17,664
-Gee, Gramps, what
did you do to them?

313
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:18,931
-They ran away from me.

314
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:21,464
They ran away from me.

315
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,464
P-pretty l-lady.

316
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:33,198
-Wow.

317
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:35,564
So it really does
work after all.

318
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:37,998
-Yo, Gramps.

319
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:39,498
Hey, what you crying for?

320
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:41,898
-Oh, Ranma.

321
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:45,264
-Say, I guess that Girl Away
is working pretty good, huh?

322
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:46,598
-Girl Away?

323
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:49,998
-You know, like garlic and

325
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:54,831
-So that's why all the pretty
ladies ran away from me.

326
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,698
Now you've really done it.

327
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,631
Ranma, how dare you?

328
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,931
-Not much sense in
going on, eh Gramps?

329
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,298
-Why didn't you just kill
me while you were at it?

330
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:04,364
It would have been kinder.

331
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:13,498
-Hah, there's a taste
of your own medicine.

332
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:14,464
-Foolish boy!

333
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,498
-No!

334
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:16,664
-You've really done it now, son.

335
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,064
-You were very good,
boy, but you've

336
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:19,664
got a lot to learn
about strategy.

337
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:23,131
Why, I'd say the master has got
you right where he wants you.

338
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:25,931
Even now, he's probably
planning to-- excuse me,

339
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:29,431
boy-- planning to turn
this to his own advantage.

340
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:30,198
OK.

341
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:30,898
So I was wrong.

342
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,764
-Look, he's unconscious.

343

Teach you to poke holes
at my screen door.

344
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,264
-You get him, boys.

345
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:43,530
You want I should start
in on the other rooms?

346
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:44,363
-Master.

347
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:46,130
-Oh, thank heavens you're safe.

348
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,663
-And you, Ranma.

349
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,730
I expect a certain amount of
playfulness from these two,

350
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:53,330
but-- well, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

351
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:56,997
-OK, now you've done it.

Come back here, you runt.

-Catch me if you can, Ranma.

-Hey, why'd you-- huh?

355

-Pretty ladies.

356

Pretty ladies.

357

I need some pretty ladies!

Anybody?

363
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:35,930
Just a little--

00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:41,263
-What's wrong with him?

365
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:42,230
-The master--

366
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:43,730
-He's in withdrawal.

367
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:45,297
-What did you say?

368
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,063
-The master isn't
just another pervert.

369
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:47,863
He's an addict.

370

-That's right.

371
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:50,263
For him not to be
able to touch a woman

372
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:53,097
is like not being
able to breathe.

-What are you two doing?

-We're express mailing
you to the North Pole.

-Where you can ruin someone
else's house for a while.

-I'll be good.

-Why would he--

381

-It's not that I saved you
or nothing, you got that?

382
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:18,463
I just can't stand the idea
of somebody being so helpless.

-Ranma.

Let's get you out of there and
take that stuff off of you.

-Listen to you.

396
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,230
No true martial artist

That Girl Away stuff

meantime, maybe you

No, don't do it.

Not the patch dear
Akane sewed on for me.

You wouldn't dare!

-How could a third
grader's sewing job

409
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,797
be so hard to pull off?

410
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,763
Next time, this third grader
won't help you at all.

411

How's about that, Ranma?

412

-Now look what you did.

The old freak has run off.

Huh?

I can get out just the same.

go to the bathroom.

Yeah.

kind as to untape me and--

-Leave this to us.

No surrender.

No mercy.

Are you sure you want
