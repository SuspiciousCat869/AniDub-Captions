00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:42,415
Oh.

4
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:44,648
It's closed today.

5
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:47,682
I really had my heart set on
one of those cherry blossom rice

6
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:49,348
cakes.

7
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:51,115
Just my luck.

8
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:53,248
Huh?

9
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:54,248
Huh?

10
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,448
This is your lucky
day, young missy.

11
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:07,982
I know a cherry
blossom rice cake

12
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,815
that would be perfect for
a young lady like yourself.

13
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:11,648
You don't say.

14
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:12,982
No, wait!

15
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:16,815
Young miss, I sense that
you're lost in love.

16
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:17,915
No, I'm not.

17
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,515
Now hold your horses!

18
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:20,282
[panting]

19
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,748
I know for certain that your
love life is troubling you,

20
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:27,215
and my premonitions have
never failed me yet.

21
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,948
AKANE: Fortune telling with
cherry blossom rice cakes?

22
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:33,782
Get the man you love to eat
your homemade cherry blossom

23
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:35,315
rice cake.

24
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:37,582
And if that man is,
in fact, destined

25
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,982
to fall in love with you--

26
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:40,982
Mhm?

27
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:43,015
Then just like
magic, cherry blossoms

28
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:46,015
will begin to
appear on his face.

29
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:47,182
Huh?

30
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:49,048
Come on.

NARRATOR: Wretched
Rice Cakes of Love.

32
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:58,682
(VOICEOVER) This is so stupid.

33
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:00,148
Like this is ever going to work.

34
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,282
[gasp]

35
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,215
Hey.

36
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,415
Wait in the living
room, and I'll

37
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:08,315
bring you some in a minute.

38
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,482
GIRL: Tea's ready, everyone.

39
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:16,848
Now that's tea.

40
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:18,482
I like green tea the best.

41
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:21,482
I don't know what all the
hoopla about coffee is.

42
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:22,748
[laughter]

43
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:24,748
Oh, look at this
pattern in my tea leaves.

44
00:03:24,782 --> 00:03:26,682
That means something
good is going to happen,

45
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:29,115
like you'll get proposed to.

46
00:03:29,148 --> 00:03:30,248
Huh?

47
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:31,915
SOUN: Uh, Kasumi, can
I have some more tea?

48
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:34,915
KASUMI: Oh, Father, don't
fill yourself up with tea.

49
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,815
Why don't you have one
of Akane's rice cakes?

50
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,048
SOUN: Well, it's just
that I'm so thirsty.

51
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,615
NABIKI: Yeah, I
know what you mean.

52
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:42,348
I'm totally parched.

53
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:43,382
Oh, that reminds me.

54
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:46,482
I have to take in the laundry.

55
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:47,115
Oh.

56
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:47,815
[groan]

57
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,582
Oh, an A cup, a B cup.

58
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:52,582
Give me a C cup.

59
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:53,548
[laughter]

60
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,182
Cherry blossom rice cakes.

61
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:58,148
Akane just finished making
them herself, Master.

62
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:00,282
Oh, forget it.

63
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:03,015
Not so fast.

64
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:04,882
Aren't you forgetting
something, Master?

65
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:06,982
I see you haven't
tried one yet.

66
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:07,548
Ah!

67
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:08,982
Just forget it!

68
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,282
I'll eat every one of
these rice cakes by myself!

69
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:12,515
No, you won't.

70
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:16,515
Master would love to have one.

71
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,648
Huh?

72
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:18,282
[groan]

73
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:22,582
Oh, that cherry blossom rice
cake is making my head spin.

74
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:23,615
Sure, whatever.

75
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:25,348
But how does it taste, Master?

76
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:27,248
Awful.

77
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:28,048
[gasp]

78
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,382
What happened to your face?

79
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,782
An X mark on his face?

80
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,482
Then just like
magic, cherry blossoms

81
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,282
will begin to
appear on his face.

82
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:39,748
And you'll know without
doubt that your destiny

83
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:41,682
is to be with that man.

84
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,982
And if you're not
destined to be with him,

85
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:48,882
an X mark will appear.

86
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:53,448
(VOICEOVER) So this
really does work.

87
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:54,415
[groan]

88
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,982
Well, so much for that brick.

89
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,115
Huh? (VOICEOVER)
Here comes trouble.

90
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:04,948
Ranma, do you want
some rice cakes?

91
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:05,715
Oh.

92
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:08,048
AKANE: Oh, no, you don't!

93
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,248
Bullseye.

94
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:10,048
[scream]

95
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:11,848
Here.

96
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:12,582
Help yourself.

97
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:13,782
Help myself.

98
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,615
Don't tell me.

99
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,615
You didn't make these
yourself, did you?

100
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,482
Yep.

101
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:20,815
Another bullseye.

102
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,448
What are you running away from?

103
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:24,782
Hey, if you really want
me to spell it out for you,

104
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:26,082
then no problem.

105
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:28,215
Taste isn't the only
thing that matters here!

106
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,315
You wish!

107
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:32,115
I'll partake of Akane's
handmade delicacies.

108
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,215
Bring them on!

109
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:35,715
Those aren't for you!

110
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:38,082
I wouldn't advise that.

111
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:38,882
[gasp]

112
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:41,715
Well, don't say I
didn't try to warn you.

113
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:43,982
Thanks for nothing.

114
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:45,948
Akane Tendo, your
love is a rash

115
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:47,582
that demands to be scratched.

116
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,815
Huh?

117
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,182
Another X, thank god.

118
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:51,982
Thank goodness.

119
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:53,615
What's the deal here, Akane?

120
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:54,748
Nothing.

121
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:56,815
This is some kind
of trick, right?

122
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:57,548
I told you.

123
00:05:57,582 --> 00:05:58,548
It's nothing.

124
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:00,215
Let us go steady!

125
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:01,582
[gasp]

126
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:04,048
Akane Tendo, you sculpted a
mountain of cherry blossom rice

127
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:06,482
cakes to express your
monumental feelings for me.

128
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:09,148
So now that it's out in the
open, let's make it official

129
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:11,382
and go steady.

130
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:12,348
[scream]

131
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:15,982
Akane, quit goofing around
and spit it out already.

132
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:21,982
Fortune telling with
cherry blossom rice cakes?

133
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,315
Yep.

134
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:26,348
I mean, it was our parents
who decided we'd get engaged,

135
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:28,948
after all, wasn't it?

136
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:29,948
So--

137
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:32,182
What are you getting at?

138
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:35,182
Uh, whether we
were meant to be.

139
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:36,115
That's stupid.

140
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:37,015
[groan]

141
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,148
What?

142
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:39,515
What what?

143
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,715
I'm saying that if we're not
destined to be together, then

144
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:43,715
I'm breaking off the engagement!

145
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:45,682
Yeah, well, that
would be a relief.

146
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:47,582
Then eat one, and
let's find out!

147
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,548
[groan]

148
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:53,248
Forget it.

149
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,582
Now what's your problem?

150
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,682
The idea of a cherry blossom
rice cake deciding my future

151
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,315
totally creeps me out.

152
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:00,182
Ranma.

153
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:03,182
There's only one thing
that scares me even more.

154
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,348
The thought of
eating your cooking!

155
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:11,448
Come back here, Ranma!

156
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:13,048
You're not getting away!

157
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:15,015
Am so!

158
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,015
[squeal]

159
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:21,682
AKANE: Ranma, come
here, you wimp!

160
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:24,782
Get those things away
from me, will you?

161
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:25,982
[grunting]

162
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,382
[squeal]

163
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:41,982
[yelling]

164
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:43,582
What do you think
you're doing, trying

165
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,715
to force an innocent guy to eat
those disgusting cherry blossom

166
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:47,015
rice cakes?

167
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:48,115
Ryoga.

168
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,148
Huh?

169
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,315
Ryoga, when did you
eat my rice cakes?

170
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:54,215
Did you seriously think
they tasted that bad?

171
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,348
Oh, don't tell
me you made them.

172
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:57,348
Well, yeah.

173
00:07:57,382 --> 00:07:58,248
[gasp]

174
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:59,648
Now it's making sense.

175
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:02,415
Those cherry blossom rice cakes
were the most delicious things

176
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,582
I've ever eaten.

177
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:04,182
Huh?

178
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:09,182
(VOICEOVER) Cherry blossoms?

179
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,748
On Ryoga's face?

180
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:15,382
Oh, no, that means
he's my-- oh, no way!

181
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:18,115
That can't be.

182
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:19,082
What a taste.

183
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:23,315
[groan]

184
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:24,815
Not going to try one?

185
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,682
What are you afraid of?

186
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,615
Uh.

187
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:29,382
Come on.

188
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:30,382
I'm not afraid.

189
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:32,782
And you've got your answer.

190
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,482
Wait, Ranma.

191
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,848
Hm.

192
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,348
It's not easy admitting
something like this,

193
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:41,615
but Ryoga's not so bad.

194
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:44,048
Yeah, sure.

195
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:44,815
Let's see.

196
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:45,948
He's a lot nicer than you.

197
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:46,515
Hm?

198
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:47,715
And he's honest.

199
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:48,915
[groan]

200
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:54,082
Well, I'm glad we got
that out in the open.

201
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:54,564
Uh.

202
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:01,315
Huh?

203
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:04,082
Come to think of it, you two
would make an unreal couple.

204
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:06,182
What are you
talking about, Ranma?

205
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:08,415
I'm sure you heard
me the first time.

206
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,748
The world's ending.

207
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,248
Mount Fuji's gonna blow!

208
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:13,182
Run for your lives!

209
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,182
[scream]

210
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:15,215
I can't take this!

211
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:17,248
Are you saying Akane
actually likes me?

212
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:18,848
She's fallen head
over heels for me?

213
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:21,448
I didn't go quite that far.

214
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:22,482
[scream]

215
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:25,082
Why do I let him do it to me?

216
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:25,564
Oh.

217
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:32,482
Get the man you love to eat
your homemade cherry blossom

218
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:33,815
rice cakes.

219
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:36,115
And if that man is, in
fact, destined to fall

220
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,982
in love with you,
then just like magic,

221
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:41,915
cherry blossoms will begin
to appear on his face.

222
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,315
I can't be bothered to
make them so how about

223
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:45,548
giving me some?

224
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:46,515
[gasp]

225
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:52,715
Hm.

226
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:54,182
[purring]

227
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:57,148
Aha.

228
00:09:57,182 --> 00:10:00,148
Hm.

229
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,115
[meowing]

230
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,282
How about that?

231
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:07,482
I guess the marks
wash off with water.

232
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:12,782
You idiot, Ranma.

233
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:15,815
You don't even care about me.

234
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,248
Anyway, what's the big deal?

235
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:20,282
All he has to do is eat a
stupid rice cake, right?

236
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:24,182
[groan]

237
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:25,715
Blah!

238
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:26,548
That's disgusting!

239
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:31,348
[gasp]

240
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,215
[animal sounds]

241
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:46,449
[groan]

242
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:48,416
Oh, no.

243
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,116
Now what am I going to you?

244
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,816
[gasp]

245
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:51,649
(VOICEOVER) OK.

246
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:52,716
Hang on a minute.

247
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,083
I'm not going to marry myself.

248
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:57,049
So I'm supposed to get an X.

249
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:57,583
[groan]

250
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,416
Ah!

251
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,416
You idiot, Akane.

252
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:00,616
How could you be so stupid?

253
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:07,531
Hm?

254
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:13,583
Huh?

255
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:16,749
Hey, it's gone.

256
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,116
(VOICEOVER) It's only
a stupid rice cake.

257
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:29,216
I can get one down.

258
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,216
I have the steely
will to do this.

259
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:33,683
I've trained for this moment.

260
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:34,583
[groan]

261
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,783
It's only a stupid rice cake.

262
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,283
Ranma!

263
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:43,216
Are you really going to eat
one of Akane's rice cakes?

264
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:44,083
[scream]

265
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:47,583
Stop sneaking up
on me like that!

266
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:50,649
(VOICEOVER) I've got to get this
over with before someone else

267
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:51,249
interrupts.

268
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:56,349
[groan]

269
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,549
SOUN: Ranma, my boy.

270
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,716
I'm the only one who knows
exactly how you feel.

271
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:01,183
[crying]

272
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:05,549
You don't have to force
yourself to choke one down.

273
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:18,983
(VOICEOVER) Ah, no one will
be able to interfere here.

274
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:21,316
Now let's see if I get
an X or a cherry blossom

275
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,383
when I eat this thing.

276
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,383
Ah.

277
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:24,949
Uh.

278
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,216
I can't do it.

279
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:28,483
Maybe if I drink
some more tea first.

280
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,449
[groan]

281
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:47,716
Nabiki, are you sure Ranma took
one of my cherry blossom rice

282
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,483
cakes with him?

283
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:50,949
Positive.

284
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,183
Well, I wonder where he
could have gone with it then.

285
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:55,283
Maybe he's under the
house as we speak.

286
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,249
Give me a break.

287
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:58,516
Wherever he is,
I don't think you

288
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:01,483
and Ranma should get too serious
about those cherry blossom

289
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:02,383
rice cakes.

290
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,149
Wait.

291
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,316
How do you know about it?

292
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,149
About what?

293
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:06,816
Nothing.

294
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:07,783
Just forget it.

295
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:09,049
Love the one you're with.

296
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,749
Then it won't just
seem like an eternity.

297
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,449
It'll be an eternity.

298
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:14,316
[sigh]

299
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,483
I can't believe Ranma
keeps running away.

300
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:20,183
I just want to find out the
truth about our relationship.

301
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,016
That's all.

302
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,249
You had your chance.

303
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:23,649
Now I'm really going
to fall for Ryoga.

304
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:27,483
[scream]

305
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,283
Uh, Ryoga.

306
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:31,349
Uh.

307
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:33,349
You didn't hear what
I said now, did you?

308
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:35,583
These are for you.

309
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,283
They're beautiful.

310
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,683
See ya!

311
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:40,383
[humming]

312
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,383
RANMA: Nice going, Akane.

313
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:47,216
You and your destined
one are hitting it off.

314
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:48,183
Yeah.

315
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:51,016
Now that you're
leaving us alone.

316
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,516
I sure had you all wrong.

317
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:55,316
Switching to Ryoga over a
stupid cherry blossom mark.

318
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:57,283
Well, that's what you
get for not eating one.

319
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,083
As if it can
predict the future.

320
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:03,283
AKANE: By the way, Ranma, what
you got in your hand there?

321
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,916
Uh.

322
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,049
Nasty little rice cakes.

323
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,716
They have a way of
sticking to you.

324
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,716
I see you still
haven't tried a bite.

325
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,616
Uh.

326
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,316
You're such a coward.

327
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:15,483
So you're afraid to find
out what the answer will be!

328
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:16,983
No, I'm not.

329
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:19,116
Then what's stopping
you from trying one?

330
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:29,416
All right then.

331
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:30,749
We'll do it your way.

332
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:33,683
Sure you won't
regret this, Akane?

333
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:35,216
Uh.

334
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,749
I might get a cherry blossom.

335
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:39,349
I might get an X.
But no hard feelings.

336
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,649
[gasp]

337
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,549
[gasp]

338
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:56,683
Ranma actually swallowed
one of my rice cakes.

339
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:58,683
Revolting.

340
00:14:58,716 --> 00:14:59,549
Oh, the pain.

341
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,749
The pain of it all.

342
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,083
(VOICEOVER) If a
cherry blossom shows up,

343
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:04,349
he's the one I'm
destined to be with.

344
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:07,949
But if an X shows up--

345
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:10,016
Ranma, choose one of
my lovely daughters

346
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,416
as your own-- anyone you like.

347
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:13,683
He'll choose Akane.

348
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:15,549
Yeah, they're perfect together.

349
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,583
Get real.

350
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,083
Why do I have to go with him?

351
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:20,383
You're not really
big on guys, right?

352
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,216
Ranma's half female so
it's a perfect match.

353
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:24,716
He's a freak.

354
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:25,549
I'll pass.

355
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:35,516
(VOICEOVER) If an X shows
up on Ranma's face--

356
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:36,216
Ready, Akane?

357
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:42,616
I'll turn around at
the count of three.

358
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,549
[gasp]

359
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:48,183
One, two, three.

360
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:49,549
[scream]

361
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,149
I don't want to see!

362
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:03,583
(VOICEOVER) My dear Akane, at
last I understand how you feel

363
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:04,749
about me.

364
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:06,249
[scream]

365
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:07,916
[groan]

366
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:09,449
I need a mirror.

367
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,049
Oh!

368
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,949
You're going to
regret that, Ranma!

369
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:29,483
You ruined my letter to Akane!

370
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:32,783
Tell someone who cares, buddy!

371
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:36,783
I need a mirror!

372
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:37,483
Huh?

373
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:38,849
I'm black?

374
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:40,883
Why is my face all black?

375
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,583
It's because you did
a faceplant in my ink.

376
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,016
[groan]

377
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:53,616
No cherry blossoms?

378
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,216
No Xes?

379
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:55,916
Nothing.

380
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,249
The mark disappeared!

381
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,249
I didn't have a
chance to see it.

382
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,549
Now I'm going to have to
eat another rice cake!

383
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,683
Hey!

384
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:03,683
I don't know what
your problem is,

385
00:17:03,716 --> 00:17:05,416
but you're not making sense.

386
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,449
Quiet, pig boy.

387
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,416
I need time to think things out.

388
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:10,316
[squeal]

389
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:12,383
P-chan?

390
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,083
Are you in here?

391
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,316
[gasp]

392
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:15,949
It's Akane.

393
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,616
P-chan?

394
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:21,583
[squeal]

395
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:23,449
Oh, how'd you get in here?

396
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:26,616
I told you not to wander
around on your own.

397
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,149
[groan]

398
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:30,683
Huh?

399
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,516
[sigh]

400
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:33,649
(VOICEOVER) What's going on?

401
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:36,516
How can I have no
mark on my face?

402
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:37,716
Wait a minute.

403
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:39,549
So the mark disappears
when you wash.

404
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,849
Hang on.

405
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:42,583
Then what about Ryoga's
cherry blossom mark?

406
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:49,949
Oh, P-chan.

407
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:53,816
Should I really spend the
rest of my life with Ryoga?

408
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:55,083
[squeal]

409
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,649
Cherry blossoms are
supposed to show up

410
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:58,816
on the guy I'm
destined to marry.

411
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:02,183
And cherry blossom marks
showed up on Ryoga's face.

412
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:03,149
[whimper]

413
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,016
What's the matter, P-chan?

414
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:06,183
How come you're crying?

415
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:31,283
[sigh]

416
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:33,783
Huh?

417
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:36,449
I heard about the
fortune telling.

418
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,349
And the rice cakes.

419
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,449
Oh, man.

420
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:41,449
I think I know exactly
how you feel, Ranma.

421
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:42,983
I don't know what to do, either.

422
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,949
What do you mean?

423
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,916
Once Akane and I
get married-- what

424
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:48,183
do you think I should call her?

425
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:51,749
Honey, darling, sweet
cheeks, baby doll?

426
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:54,349
Put a lid on it.

427
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,849
So what's a little black
eye on a day like this?

428
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,916
Maybe I'll just keep calling
her Akane for a while

429
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:00,249
and see how that goes.

430
00:19:00,283 --> 00:19:03,249
And maybe Akane can call
me Ryoga for a while.

431
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:05,583
Or perhaps even my
beloved husband.

432
00:19:05,616 --> 00:19:06,616
Nah.

433
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,183
That's a bit too stiff, I guess.

434
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:11,283
So how about something more
casual like darling or honey?

435
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,416
Ooh, that's sweet.

436
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,649
Or maybe something
original like pudding pie.

437
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:15,383
Akane.

438
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,416
Pudding pie.

439
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,149
Akane.

440
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:17,716
Pudding pie.

441
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:18,449
Akane!

442
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:19,249
Pudding pie!

443
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,349
Pudding pie!

444
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:23,583
Pudding pie, anything
for my pudding pie!

445
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:24,549

446

00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:28,283
Ow!

00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:29,116
[scream]

449
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:31,449
Get away from me, you crazy pig!

450
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,383
[squeal]

451
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,316
[grunts]

452
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,349
Ranma!

453
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,349
What you doing?

454
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:41,383
None of your business.

455
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,616
Now would you leave
me alone for once?

456
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,549
[gasp]

457
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,549
Ranma, look at the
cherry blossoms.

458
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,816
What?

459
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:52,283
But they weren't there
a few minutes ago.

460
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,983
(VOICEOVER) Hang on.

461
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:55,516
They're P-chan's hoof marks.

462
00:19:58,616 --> 00:19:59,783
All right.

463
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:02,949
Now it's all starting
to make sense.

464
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:05,883
Akane's rice cakes
tasted horrible.

465
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,016
So painfully horrible that
P-chan was hoofing himself

466
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,649
in the forehead to get
the taste out of his mind.

467
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:14,816
And the hoof marks were so dark
that they stayed on his face,

468
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:19,383
even after P-chan
turned into Ryoga.

469
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,916
Hm.

470
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:24,183
So you've got the cherry
blossom marks on your face, too.

471
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:28,149
But it looks like you've got
a lot more than Ryoga had.

472
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,216
Too bad.

473
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,449
Just when I thought
that it was finally

474
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:31,783
all over between you and me.

475
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:33,049
You idiot.

476
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,383
These marks on Ryoga
and me are P-chan--

477
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,949
But since you've got at
least twice as many blossom

478
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,516
as he had, I can't
exactly call it off.

479
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:41,516
Huh?

480
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:42,516

00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,449
RANMA: Oh, well.

483
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,616
I guess there's no point
in going out of my way

484
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:54,349
to tell her the truth.

My handmade potato cakes.

488
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,049
You're awfully chipper, Akane.

489
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,783
Got some good news to share?

490
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,116
Not really.

491
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:08,616
Ranma's very lucky
having Akane cook for him.

492
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,149
Wish I was so lucky.

493
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:13,316
I'll make something
for everyone tomorrow.

Come on.

Eat up, Ranma, and tell
me how you like it.

tell her the truth before

she kills me with this stuff.

You have some, too.

504
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:29,149
Here you go.

00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:17,521
GIRL (VOICEOVER): Mold?

509
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:20,021
As in, something you use
to make sculptures with?

00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:21,321
No?

511
00:23:21,354 --> 00:23:23,821
Then you mean it's--
next time on Ranma 1/2--

We'll see you there.
