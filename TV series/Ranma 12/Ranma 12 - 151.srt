Not bad, if I do say so myself.

7
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:03,967
Busy practicing
again, brother dear?

8
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,301
I've brought you a
nice cup of hot tea.

9
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:08,701
Thank you.

10
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:13,367
There's something I want
to ask you, brother dear.

11
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,034
I'm missing a life-size
poster of Ranma

12
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:17,067
that I had in my bedroom.

13
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,667
Look no further, dear sister.

14
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:23,934
I just disposed of it.

15
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:26,601
Oh, you don't
say, brother dear.

16
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:28,834
No need to thank me.

A tooth for a tooth.

23
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,334
It's family tradition
to get revenge

24
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,634
when we've been wronged.

25
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,834
Now what shall I do
with your photo album?

26
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:50,667
No.

27
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,001
Anything but that, dear sister.

28
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,901
Those are my best shots
of the pig-tailed girl.

29
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:56,801
It took me years to put
that collection together.

30
00:02:56,834 --> 00:03:00,867
Well, I'll put it aside
and weigh my options.

Please?

32

Forgive my man if he's
caused you any inconvenience.

I knew you had to
be behind this.

52
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:54,301
I can't begin to
express how sorry I am.

[scream]

54
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,134
Here's something
to be sorry about.

55
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,467
Did I hear you right?

56
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,234
You mean, you want me to
settle a problem between you

57
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,234
and your sister, Kodachi?

58
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,734
I am at a loss,
and I believe you're

59
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:11,034
the only one who can calm my
sister down at this point.

60
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,201
Uh-huh.

61
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,067
Can I count on your help?

62
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,767
What's in it for me?

63
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,767
I could let you
see my spicy photo

64
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,401
album of a pig-tailed girl.

65
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,867
Huh?

66
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:24,501
Then again, maybe I should
just keep those to myself.

67
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,701
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:29,667
How did you get
spicy pictures of me?

69
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,201
As if I'd ever
want a collection

70
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:33,934
of spicy photos of you!

71
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:34,467
Uh.

72
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:35,234
Wait a sec.

73
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,201
Did I say of me?

74
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,267
Because I didn't mean to.

75
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,534
Let me see them.

76
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:39,501
I take it back.

77
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:40,467
They're for my eyes only.

78
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,601
Those photos belong to me.

79
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:44,934
I mean, you need me to
get them back for you.

80
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:48,467
At long last, you've accepted
your fate as my servant.

81

Now you've gone way too far!

00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:53,067
You leave me no other choice.

00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,367
Wait a minute.

86
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,734
What about those spicy pictures?

87
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:05,867
What if they're like this?

88
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,934
Or like that?

I've brought some
hot tea for you.

00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:29,501
Please help yourself.

99
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:41,734
She seems in a
good enough mood.

100
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:45,067
Are you sure she's
really mad at you?

101
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:45,934
Yes.

102
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:46,701
Now drink your tea.

103
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,201
Ah, my beloved dog, Armadillo.

104
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,534
Perfect timing.

105
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,634
Who's a good boy?

[laughter]

107
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:11,067
Nothing like a poison tester.

00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:12,567
How dare you, Kodachi!

109
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,667
Have you no regard
for man's best friend?

110
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,334
Are you so lonely
that you would stoop

111
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,201
to such a fiendish undertaking?

112
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:20,534
Don't take that
personally, Kuno.

113
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,767
But I gotta get those
pictures of mine back.

[barking]

115
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:33,501
I should be grateful to my
brother for bringing you here

116
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:36,234
to visit me, Ranma, darling.

117
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:37,934
You two having a
fight or something?

118
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,001
My, how would you
know about that?

119
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:41,434
Uh, well, just a guess.

120
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:45,134
You seem to know a great
deal about me, Ranma.

121
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,267
Whoa.

122
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:47,834
Um, you don't
think I could take

123
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,234
a quick look at those spicy
photos of the pig-tailed girl,

124
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:50,867
do you?

125
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,034
Pardon?

126
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:53,534
It's for a social studies
project for school.

127
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:56,334
Well, if it's that
important to you, Ranma.

128
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,267
Here you go.

now I can get a look for myself

133
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:06,834
Huh?

134
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:12,401
Aw.

135
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,834
Not exactly what
I was expecting.

136
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,934
How dare you abscond with
my precious photo album?

137
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,767
What kind of closet sicko are
you, taking these pictures?

138
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,501
It's none of your business.

139
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,167
Wrong again, pervert!

140
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:26,067
Pervert?

141
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,301
I have eclectic taste.

142
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:28,334
Eclectic?

143
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,367
The only taste you have is bad!

144
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,567
As in, rancid cabbage bad!

145
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:35,734
I'm innocent, I tell you.

146
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,101
[scream]

147
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,434
Give me that!

148
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:42,634
[gasp]

149
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:44,734
I'll just liberate
these pictures,

150
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:45,501
seeing that they're
mine, anyway.

151
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,934
[laughter]

152
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,167
Ha!

153
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:57,201
Nice try, gal.

154
00:07:57,234 --> 00:07:58,967
Oh, my beloved pig-tailed girl.

155
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,101
I was just talking about
you, and you're here.

156
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:03,067
[groan]

157
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:04,767
Poison black roses trick.

158
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:08,967
My twisted sister has
done it to me again.

00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:09,467
[groan]

[laughter]

161
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,801
You won't steal this
away from me that easily.

162
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:14,901
Right.

163
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:16,567
I'll just give up on
that one and make myself

164
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:17,634
a new photo album.

165
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,301
Not if I can help it.

166
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:20,201

[chatter]

169
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:33,234
How did Kuno take all those
pictures of me in first place?

170
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:34,234
Huh?

171
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,134
These are the new pictures.

172
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,167
So you want them?

173
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,767
I should've known.

174
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,667
[chatter]

175
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,101
Well, that's all
I have for today.

176
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,467
But I'll have more again soon.

177
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,101
So you're the one
who's behind this.

178
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,267
Uh oh.

179
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:49,001
All right.

180
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,001
I hear you.

181
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,834
I'll give you 25%,
and my cut is 75.

182
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,201
The camera came out of
my pocket, after all.

183
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,734
So it's only fair, right?

184
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:57,601
[groan]

185
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,901
I'm not looking
for any cut here!

186
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:04,001
You know how
embarrassing this is?

187
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,367
Hm?

188
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,334
Huh?

189
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:07,901
[laughter]

190
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:16,001
Greetings, ladies
and gentlemen.

191
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,801
Ranma, I can't tell you what
a pleasure it was to have you

192
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,501
visit my house the other day.

193
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:23,201
I just had to come here
and thank you in person.

194
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:24,501
Well.

195
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:27,067
It's not at all what
you're thinking, Nabiki.

196
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:27,701
90%.

197
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,501
Huh?

198
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,001
I'll take 90% of the profit.

199
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:32,067
And in exchange, I'll
keep your little secret.

200
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,834
The point is I don't want
you selling those pictures!

201
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:35,701
[gasp]

202
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,401
I have captured
him for you, Master.

203
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,267
Fine.

204
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:40,501
Nicely done, Sasuke.

205
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,234
I've captured Ranma
for you, Kodachi.

206
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:44,301
Now hand over my photo album.

207
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,101
RANMA: Hey!

208
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,067
All right.

209
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,301
I'll take Ranma from you.

210
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,667
You can't treat me
like a trading card.

211
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:52,067
Brother, dear, we
might have a deal.

212
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,501
But you forget.

213
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:55,901
I insist on an apology.

214
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:57,201
[gasp]

215
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:59,767
In other words, you give a
nice apology to your sister,

216
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,934
and it'll put an end to
this whole ugly affair.

217
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,301
No, you apologize.

218
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,467
Do what?

219
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:07,167
If I'm not going
to get my apology,

220
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,801
then you leave me no choice.

221
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:09,434
STUDENTS: Aw.

222
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,401
The pig-tailed girl.

223
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:12,667
That's my photo!

224
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,301
It's my picture, plebian.

225
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:16,034
It's a long story,
but trust me.

226
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:17,334
That picture belongs to me!

227
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,401
Not you or your sister!

228
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:20,701
[gasp]

229
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,201
KODACHI: Make up your
mind, brother, dear.

230
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,734
[scream]

231
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:26,767
[laughter]

232
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,267
KUNO: Two can play
at that game, sister.

233
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:29,901
[gasp]

234
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:32,834
Let's just see how you feel
about a certain poster getting

235
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:33,767
crumpled.

236
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,667
How dare you do
that to my poster.

237
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,834
Then I guess you
won't be needing this.

238
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:39,201
[laughter]

239
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,167
[thunder]

240
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:04,367
Brother, dear, we may
have grown up together.

241
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:08,501
But there are some things that
even a sibling cannot pardon.

242
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,301
I couldn't have expressed
that better myself.

243
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:13,601
Say goodbye to your
pig-tailed girl.

244
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:15,634
Because soon I'll be
done with you both.

245
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,434
Done with us both?

246
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,301
And you bid your Ranma
adieu, because when

247
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,967
I'm done with you
both, you won't even

248
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,334
recognize each other.

249
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,234
Oh, yeah.

250
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,334
This is out of control.

251
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,867
Come on.

252
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:28,167
What do you say we go for a
donut and talk things over?

253
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,734
[animal sounds]

254
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,043
Black roses?

255
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:52,609
Not her again!

256
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,509
[grunt]

257
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,576
Say your prayers, Akane Tendo.

258
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:58,509
[groan]

259
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:00,476
[scream]

260
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:05,243
What do you want from
me, anyway, Kodachi?

261
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,576
You're mistaken.

262
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,476
This has nothing to do
with the likes of you.

263
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,109
I'll put an end to
you, you barmy woman.

264
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:14,143
How dare you threaten
my beloved Akane Tendo!

265
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:15,309
Oh, how brave.

266
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,543
What does this
have to do with her?

267
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:18,043
I thought you were
going to fight

268
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:19,276
me and the pig-tailed girl!

269
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,309
I did say, and I
haven't changed my mind.

270
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:22,976
I'm going after you and
the pig-tailed girl,

271
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:26,109
just like you're going after
me and my darling Ranma.

272
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:27,243
Precisely.

273
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:28,643
What do you mean,
and what does it

274
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:32,976
have to do with Ranma
and the pig-tailed girl?

275
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:37,409
Akane Tendo, please step
back and let us settle this.

276
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:38,309
[groan]

277
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:39,643
[laughter]

278
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,909
You may be a witless wonder,
but you're still my sister.

279
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:46,376
I wouldn't do this unless
I absolutely had to do it.

280
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:48,243
You've left no choice.

281
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:50,043
You may be a
brainless beefcake,

282
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,509
but you're still my brother.

283
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:54,443
I wouldn't do this unless
I absolutely had to do it.

284
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,443
You've left no choice.

285
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,209
[gasp]

286
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,376
[chatter]

[chatter]

290
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:13,409
RANMA: Kodachi and Kuno were
hocking my pictures around.

291
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:14,876
Do you think anybody saw them?

292
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:17,109
Only half the school, plus
all those guys rushing out

293
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:18,676
behind us.

294
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:19,676
Huh.

295
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,209
It'll be old news
by this afternoon.

296
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:23,643
So you're just going to
sit here and do nothing?

297
00:13:23,676 --> 00:13:24,876
Come on.

298
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:28,543
It's not like they'd be
totally outrageous pictures.

299
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,409
Mhm.

300
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,776
Huh?

301
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,743
[groan]

302
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:34,643
[groan]

00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:37,576
[laughter]

304
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,243
How could you be
such a playboy, Ranma?

305
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:41,643
RANMA: Come on.

306
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:43,176
They're obviously computer
generated or something.

307
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,143
You want me to
believe you don't even

308
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:45,676
remember them being taken?

309
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:46,509
That's right!

310
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,376
Because they never were taken!

311
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,343
Wow.

312
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:50,976
He could make a
living doing these.

313
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:52,709
Huh?

314
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:54,243
[laughter]

315
00:13:57,076 --> 00:13:57,943
Don't miss it!

316
00:13:57,976 --> 00:14:00,576
The scandal of the year!

317
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:01,909
[laughter]

318
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:03,743
Here you go.

319
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:04,309
Here.

320
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,976
Have a picture.

321
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:07,176
Here.

322
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,109
KUNO (VOICEOVER):
This'll teach her.

323
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:10,509
Here.

324
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:12,543
KUNO (VOICEOVER): It'll be
the scandal of the year.

325
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:13,476
Whoa.

326
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:14,209
Unreal.

327
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:15,776
[chatter]

328
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:18,876
Poor Akane.

329
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:21,143
She used to be the most
popular girl in class.

330
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:22,343
What?

331
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:23,876
Ranma replaces you
with Kodachi, then

332
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:26,009
Kuno with that pig-tailed girl
and hangs on to her photos

333
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:28,043
like his life is
depending on it.

334
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,176
[laughter]

335
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:30,343
Don't think of it
as being dumped.

336
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:31,843
Think of it as being replaced.

337
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:33,009
[yelling]

338
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:35,676
[scream]

339
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,509
Now who's getting the
last laugh, funny boy?

340
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:41,543
[chatter]

341
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,443
I'll just have to
talk to Kuno and get

342
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:44,776
him to apologize to Kodachi.

343
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,243
This one, too?

344
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,043
How dare she expose
such tender moments

345
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:55,376
to these vulgar animals.

346
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:56,809
Are you all right, Kuno?

347
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:59,743
Now everyone knows about
the pig-tailed girl and me.

348
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:00,943
I have no other choice.

349
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:03,476
I would like to announce
officially my relationship

350
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:05,476
with the pig-tailed girl.

351
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,309
I don't think so, you jerk!

352
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:10,909
Oh, pig-tailed girl, you've
come to my side at last.

353
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,443
[groan]

354
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,709
Drop it, Kuno, because it's
just never going to happen.

355
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:18,809
Oh, how can I carry on
after such a scandal?

356
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:21,009
Those photographs
will destroy my life,

357
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:23,443
so please just apologize to--

358
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:24,609
I'll take responsibility.

359
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:26,843
Now please let's
talk about our date.

360
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:27,843
[groan]

361
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:28,609
Hm.

362
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:30,076
On to plan B.

363
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:30,676
Hm?

364
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:34,943
[laughter]

365
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:38,909
Kodachi.

366
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,443
Ranma, darling.

367
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,743
Kodachi, it's tearing me up
to see you and your brother

368
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,809
fight like this.

369
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,176
I want you both to
apologize to each other.

370
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,343
[gasp]

371
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:48,876
Ranma, darling,
then you're actually

372
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:52,076
admitting that you've been
worried about me all this time?

373
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,376
Hm.

374
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:54,843
It's the album that
really has me worried.

375
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:55,876
Come on, Kodachi.

376
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,776
Hand it over to me, will you?

377
00:15:57,809 --> 00:15:59,043
Of course, darling.

378
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:00,643
I promise to take
good care of it.

379
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:01,909
AKANE: Ranma!

380
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:02,743
Huh?

381
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:03,843
Ranma!

382
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,043
I've got to deal with
that busybody again.

383
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:07,809
We'll finish this
conversation later.

384
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,709
Uh, let's finish it now.

385
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:10,576
Later.

386
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,109
Kodachi!

387
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:13,043
Don't worry, darling.

388
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,943
We'll meet again soon.

389
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,443
[laughter]

390
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,909
Can't you stay away from
her for even a few minutes?

391
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:21,176
Thanks for butting in.

392
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,509
If it weren't for you,
I'd have the album

393
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,309
and this whole
thing would be over.

394
00:16:24,343 --> 00:16:25,843
Don't you dare
talk to me like that

395
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:28,243
when I went out of my way to
save you from that evil girl

396
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:29,476
and bring you something!

397
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:30,876
What did you bring
that's so important?

398
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:32,143
Hm.

399
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:32,743
Huh?

400
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:36,643
[gasp]

401
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:39,743
Hm.

402
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:43,476
This is really starting
to get out of control.

403
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:46,376
How are those two coming
up with all these new photos

404
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,809
and me and-- huh?

405
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,009
[grunt]

406
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,676
This one didn't work out right.

407
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,409
You can tell they've
been doctored.

408
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:06,043
That's more important
than ruining my life?

409
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,676
I didn't do this.

410
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,243
I would never pull a
cheap trick like this.

411
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,343
It was obviously an amateur.

412
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,609
An amateur like
who, for instance?

413
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:15,909
I don't know.

414
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:16,809
Huh?

415
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:18,476
Uh, excuse me, Nabiki.

416
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:19,809
Huh?

417
00:17:19,843 --> 00:17:23,943
I came to buy more pictures
for making those fake-- oh.

418
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:24,976
Uh oh.

419
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,309
Oh.

420
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,343
Now I'm starting to
make sense of it all.

421
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,376
So Nabiki wasn't
lying after all when

422
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,143
she said she wasn't the one
making all those fake pictures.

423
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:34,543
[sigh]

424
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:37,509
A profitable business, and
it's all down the tubes.

425
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:38,876
[scream]

426
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,843
[fighting sounds]

427
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:43,009
[groan]

428
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:01,076
Fight!

429
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,843
Kuno and Kodachi are
going to duke it out!

430
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,243
[laughter]

431
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:10,143
It seems that you've lost
your supply of photographs

432
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:11,676
to pass around.

433
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,076
[groan]

434
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:16,876
You've run out of ammo, so just
surrender and apologize to me.

435
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,209
But be warned.

436
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:23,243
If it doesn't come
across as sincere enough,

437
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,309
I'll be forced to drop
some of these extremely

438
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:27,743
compromising pictures.

439
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,143
I dare you to try me.

440
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,876
Extremely compromising?

441
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,243
Man, that could only mean--

442
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:33,943
It's just got to be--

443
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:35,576
A picture of Kuno and her--

444
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:37,409
Kuno and the pig-tailed girl--

445
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:40,076
Caught red handed
and pink-bottomed.

446
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:42,576
I'm so glad I didn't skip out.

447
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:43,058
Uh oh.

448
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,658
What could be more compromising
than the ones we've already

449
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:50,191
seen?

450
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:52,225
It wouldn't be like this.

451
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:55,191
Or like that.

452
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,025
No!

453
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:56,658
Anything but that!

454
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,558
[laughter]

455
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:09,125
No, please, don't!

456
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:09,891
[scream]

457
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,291
Why don't you apologize
to your sister

458
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,825
so I can have my
honor restored, huh?

459
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:16,758
Hm.

460
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,425
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Ranma, I don't

461
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,658
know what's going on here,
but please don't give in.

462
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:23,991
Please, Kuno.

463
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,858
Apologize to your sister for me.

464
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:31,091
The only thing I want to
have is an unending supply

465
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,691
of the pig-tailed
girl's spicy photos!

466
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:35,425
[groan]

467
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,158
You're not a human.

468
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,491
You're a pod.

469
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:39,991
And that bonehead Ranma
you're in love with--

470
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,291
That's enough!

471
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:44,225
Now you've gone too far.

472
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:46,191
You asked for it, brother, dear.

473
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:48,291
Oh, no, you don't!

474
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:49,258
Get out of my way.

475
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,825
[chatter]

476
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,658
Me, me, me, me.

477
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:55,625
[chatter]

478
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:59,225
Keep the photos from
these vulgar low-lifes,

479
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:01,191
pig-tailed girl.

480
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:02,791
Huh?

481
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:03,791
Hm.

482
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,391
[scream]

483
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,391
What?

484
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:11,758
Where's the skin?

485
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:18,125
Ugh.

486
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:19,558
Huh?

487
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:23,658
It's me and a-- it's me
and that little black swine!

488
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:24,791
Here goes!

489
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,525
Anything goes!

490
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,058
Two-in-one two face attack.

491
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:29,658
Oh!

492
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,358
Hm?

493
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:37,525
What's Kuno's deal?

494
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:39,358
He's as stiff as a marionette.

495
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:43,958
Kodachi.

496
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:46,358
Yes, brother, dear, what is it?

497
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:49,325
Kodachi, I'm sorry.

498
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:50,725
Now that wasn't hard.

499
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:52,491
You should have apologized
sooner, and none of this

500
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:54,858
would have happened.

501
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,758
Huh?

502
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,091
[laughter]

503
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,625
I won!

504
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:02,625
[laughter]

505
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,491
[barking]

506
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:29,958
It's a shame, but I suppose I
can afford to lose one album.

507
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,758
Right, Sasuke?

508
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,991
Oh, yes, Master.

509
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:33,991
How very true.

00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:17,614
GIRL (VOICEOVER):
In order for Sentaro

512
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,248
to be Sentaro and for
Satsuki to be Satsuki,

513
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:22,448
they have to put
everything on the line.

514
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:26,248
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
Battle for the Golden Tea Set.

00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,614
We'll see you there.
