What's her problem, anyway?

All I did is be honest with her.

00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:53,055
-Just shut up.

341
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:54,955
-I shall never accept defeat.

342
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:58,155
Whether that cretinous Ranma
Saotome kicks me 100 times

343
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:02,722
or 200 times, it matters
not to Tatewaki Kuno.

[gasps]

345
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:04,755
-Hey!

346
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,588
Who are you calling cretinous?

347
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:07,955
Admit it!

348
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:09,488
I beat you fair and square.

349
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:10,388
-Hey, wait a minute.

350
00:16:14,922 --> 00:16:16,455
-Pig-tailed goddess,
it is no other.

351

-Hey, you creep!

352
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:17,622
-Oh, boy.

353
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:24,355
-That honeyed voice!

354
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:27,688
-Don't forget, it's Akane you're
supposed to be in love with.

355
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:28,455
-Well, of course.

356
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,688
-Well, she's watching us.

357
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,288
-No, she's not.

358
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:34,188
-Hey!

359
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:36,022
Watch us already, will you?

360
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:36,688
-I never knew.

361
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:41,655
If Upperclassman Kuno
is really in love

362
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:47,155
with that pig-tailed girl,
I--, I won't put up a fight.

363
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:48,122
-Akane!

364
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:49,522
Have you gone insane?

365
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:56,588
-You are too noble
for the world.

366
00:16:56,622 --> 00:17:00,255
And yet, I can not
bear to part with me!

367
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:03,088
Aah!

Farewell.

-Give our
congratulations to Ranma.

-Wow, he's amazing!

382
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:47,155
-From what I hear,
Ranma went abroad

383
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:49,555
to study acrobatics
in China, you know.

384
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:52,988
-It's Kempo, not acrobatics.

385
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,088
-OK, here it comes!

386
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,088
-All right!

387
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,088

have you got with Akane?

00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:07,388
-Huh?

392
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:08,422
-Don't play innocent.

393
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,622
You're her fiance.

394
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:11,255
-Did you do it?

395
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:12,322
-Yeah, you know.

396
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:15,155
-I'll bet you at
least did-- you know.

397
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,388
-Are you kidding?

398
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:18,055
With that tomboy?

-She is not.

410
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:42,122
Besides, she's already
got somebody she likes.

411
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,022
Oh!

412
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:46,288
-Oops!

413
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:48,288
-Hey, I thought you
were a martial artist!

414
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:52,088
Couldn't you have caught that
or dodged it or something?

415
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:53,455
-I had something on my mind.

416
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:02,155
-I'm sorry.

417
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:03,655
Does it still hurt?

00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:04,988
Oh, forget it.

419
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:07,388
I have apologized to you
enough times already, Ranma.

-It'll never work--
never, never, never.

-Hmm?

-Isn't that your father?

-Pop!

-School over already?

426
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,488
Let me introduce Mr. Saotome.

427
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:30,155
He started working
here this afternoon.

428
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:36,788
Do you know each other?

429
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:38,022
You don't say!

430
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:40,088
Ranma's father?

431
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:41,822
Not much family resemblance.

-How thoughtful.

435
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:50,555
Here's my cup, Akane.

436
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:53,122
Ranma, whatever
happened to your face?

437
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:54,855
-It was in PE class.

438
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:57,622
-Seems like you're always
being hurt, doesn't it?

439
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,555
Did someone throw
something at you?

440
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:00,522
-Uh--

441
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:02,255
-Looks like the
marks of a softball.

442
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:02,988
-You've got it.

443
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:04,055
Now that you mention--

444
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:06,022
-Uh, Dr. Tofu, your
tea's getting cold.

445
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,522
-Be right there.

446
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:10,255
Ranma, I'll go get
something for your face.

447
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,188
-Nyah!

448
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:14,588
-Hmm!

you answer that for me?

Hello.

456
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:34,455
May I ask who's calling, please?

457
00:20:34,488 --> 00:20:36,855
-What's the big idea, picking
up the phone when you can't even

458
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:37,655
talk?

459
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:38,588
-Oh!

00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:39,855
-If you're going
to be a panda, you

461
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,288
should learn to act like one.

00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,288
-Yes, I see.

463
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:42,955
OK.

464
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:44,355
Bye.

465
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:46,422
-Who was it?

466
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,955
-I'm going home.

467

-Huh?

00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:52,222
Akane, wait!

00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:53,255
-Leave me alone!

470
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,255
-Tell me who that
was on the phone, OK?

471
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,022
-Forget it.

472
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,355
It was nobody, all right?

473
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,555
-What's your hurry, then?

474
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,955
From what I
understand, I thought

475
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:02,055
you were in love
with Doctor Tofu.

476
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:02,855
-Shut up!

477
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,122
You don't know anything!

478
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:06,388
Dr. Tofu already has
someone he likes.

479
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,222
That was her on the phone.

480
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:18,722
She said she was coming
right over here, Ranma.

-Hello, everybody.

-Idiot!

-Running errands today, Kasumi?

-I'm going to Doctor Tofu's.

Who's Doctor Tofu in love with?

RANMA: Tell me!

00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:51,755
Why won't you tell me who it is?

00:21:56,655 --> 00:22:00,588
-You'll know soon enough.

AKANE: Doctor Tofu
really is in love

497
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:43,618
with my older sister, Kasumi.

498
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:47,498
Even Ranma should be
able to figure that out.

499
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:50,498
I've got to blow off some steam,
or I'm going to hurt somebody.

Next time, on Ranma
1/2, Akane's Lost Love.

These things happen, you know.

502
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:57,632
See you there.
