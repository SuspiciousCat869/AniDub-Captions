1
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:41,008
Meet Ranma Saotome
of the Anything

2
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:42,242
Goes School of Martial Arts.

3
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:43,675
-Hey, let go!

4
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:47,442
NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

5
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,842
The two have been engaged to
marry by their loving parents.

6
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,942
-I didn't ask for this.

7
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:53,308
-Who asked you?

8
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:58,608
NARRATOR: As for the cause of
poor Ranma's suffering, when

9
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:01,842
Ranma is splashed with cold
water, he becomes a she.

10
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:10,442
NARRATOR 2: Close Call!

11
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,842
The Dance of Death on Ice

12
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:16,608
-For the first time in
my life, I'm really mad!

13
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:31,708
How about it?

14
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:34,375
Let's fight, or are you
just going to stand there?

15
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:37,375
-I don't know what your
grievance is with me,

16
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,375
but damaging the rink
is a serious crime.

17
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:42,108
I accept your challenge.

18
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,342
Come on.

19
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,675
-I'm going to make you sorry
you were ever born pal.

20
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:50,575
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
(WORRIED) Ranma.

21
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:56,808
-Hey, Mikado!

22
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:04,342
For humiliating
me like that, I'm

23
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,342
going to pay you back
a thousand times over.

24
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:14,142
[screaming]

25
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:17,875
[explosion]

26
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:19,642
-Ranma!

27
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:22,408
[laughter]

28
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:24,775
-Wow, that was one
major league head-butt.

29
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,675
-Idiot.

30
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,242
Only a fool would attempt
to launch a suicide

31
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:37,208
strike against his opponents
so early in a battle.

32
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:39,642
How-- How did you get up?

33
00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:06,242
Hm.

34
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,275
You do have some fight in you.

35
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:11,842
I regret using non-amateur, but
I see you left me no choice.

36
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,742
Now, behold The Dance of Death.

37
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,108
-Woah!

38
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:24,875
The Dance of Death, we hardly
ever get to see him do that.

39
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:33,508
-You don't impress
me you big jerk.

40
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:48,042
AKANE: 118.

41
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:48,975
119.

42
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:49,475
120.

43
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:49,975
121.

44
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:50,775
122.

45
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:52,008
123.

46
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,008
-No one's ever broken
free of that spin before.

47
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:04,542
AKANE: 41.

48
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:05,242
42.

49
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:05,742
43.

50
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:06,675
44.

51
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,175
45.

52
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:07,675
46.

53
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:22,775
501.

54
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:23,475
-What an athlete!

55
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,608
-Ranma, can you stand up?

56
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:47,575
-I guess Mikado won the match.

57
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:49,608
-Nope, afraid
Ranma won that one.

58
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:50,108
-Huh?

59
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,575
Ah, you're right!

60
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:04,475
He's fainted!

61
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:09,742
Let's doodle on him!

62
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:13,675
Doodly-doo Doodly-doo.

63
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,842
-Hey, man I want to doodle too!

64
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,608
-Let me draw some!

65
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:28,042
RANMA: Ow!

66
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:36,208
-Oh, honestly Ranma, did you
really have to him 501 times

67
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:37,942
to win that fight?

68
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:40,075
-(ANGRILY) Quiet!

69
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:45,908
After what that jerk did to
me, why why he got off lucky!

70
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:46,575
-Oh my!

71
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:49,708
What did he do to you?

72
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,108
Huh?

73
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,542
Uh nothing.

74
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:53,575
RYOGA: Look at you Ranma.

75
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:54,942
You're a mess.

76
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,308
-Hm?

77
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:57,775
-Ryoga?

78
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:01,442
-You know, I would never have
let such a thing happen to me.

79
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:02,442
-Shut up man!

80
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:04,342
If it weren't for
those dumb skates,

81
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,508
I never would have been--

82
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,042
-Oh?

83
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:06,808
Never what?

84
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:07,775
Been kissed?

85
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:09,408
Hm?

86
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,908
-Ranma were you kissed?

87
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:14,375
-So who did the dirty deed?

88
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:17,275
-Well, at least he was
a good-looking rascal,

89
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:18,442
wasn't he Ranma?

90
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:19,708
-Why you!

91
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:22,975
-(SHOCKED) It was a guy!

92
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:25,008
-Oh, you're worrying
over nothing.

93
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:28,108
-Yeah, it doesn't even count if
you get kissed by another guy.

94
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:44,342
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Aw man.

95
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,642
Now, they're all
making fun of me.

96
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,642
Nobody cares how I feel.

97
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:53,242
AKANE: You're wide open, right?

98
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:55,808
Pay attention!

99
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,175
Oh, honestly, aren't
you finished pouting.

100
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,908
And here you call
yourself a guy.

101
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:03,842
-Oh go ahead and laugh
at me if you want.

102
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:08,642
Hey, what are you laughing at?

103
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:10,508
-Oh nothing.

104
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,275
-Well, for one thing--

105
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:16,242
-Well, for one thing, it's your
own fault that he kissed you.

106
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:21,275
You got to realize you left
yourself wide open Ranma.

107
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,442
-And I suppose you think you
could have done better, huh?

108
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:26,508
-Of course I could've.

109
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,008
Huh?

110
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,475
-Well, look who's talking!

111
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,342
Huh?

112
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,708
Ew!

113
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:39,475
Hey, look!

114
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:40,742
Relax Akane.

115
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,675
It wasn't like I was
going to try and kiss you

116
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,975
or anything I mean.

117
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:44,608
I wouldn't.

118
00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:47,208
-Huh?

119
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,108
Well, I wasn't worried.

120
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:51,508
I know you don't have
the guts to do something

121
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:54,575
like that anyway.

122
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:55,875
-Oh yeah?

123
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:58,675
Well, you keep talking like
that, maybe I just might.

124
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,842
-Oh yeah?

125
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,375
You just go ahead
and try it Ranma!

126
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:04,242
-You sure?

127
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:05,342
-Well, sure.

128
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,075
I dare you to do it
if you think you can.

129
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,908
-OK.

130
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:12,042
I'll do it, but only
because you told me.

131
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,942
Close your eyes.

132
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:18,408
-OK.

133
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:33,275
Um, shouldn't you kind
of like save this stuff

134
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:36,308
for you know like the people
that you really like and stuff

135
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,142
like that you know?

136
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,375
-I see!

137
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:42,808
I'm not good enough
for you is that it.

138
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,575
-(ANGRILY) Akane,
that's not what I meant!

139
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:53,342
I I just meant that if you
don't mind, then I don't mind.

140
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,308
You know what I mean?

141
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:13,442
Hm?

142
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:14,708
[screaming]

143
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:15,508
-Come on!

144
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,808
We don't have all day.

145
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,408
Are you going to do
it, or aren't you?

146
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:19,575
We don't have all day.

147
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:20,708
-(SADLY) Oh Ranma, Ranma.

148
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:21,208
Ranma.

149
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:38,042
MIKADO: (BITTERLY)
Ranma Saotome,

150
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:42,475
you, you did this to me, me the
pride of the high school figure

151
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,908
skating world.

152
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,375
No one makes a fool
of me and lives.

153
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:49,208
The day of our match,
five days from now,

154
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:50,675
will be the day you die!

155
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:50,172
-Francoise, tomorrow is the
day Charlotte comes home

156
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:52,839
to live with us
forever and ever.

157
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:56,372
You're waiting for Charlotte
too, aren't you Francoise?

158
00:11:56,406 --> 00:11:57,939
Good girl!

159
00:11:57,972 --> 00:12:01,039
Katherine, you'll be
cheering Azusa on, won't you?

160
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:03,739
Sweet dreams Katherine!

161
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:06,672
Sweet dreams now Antoinette!

162
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,039
Sweet dreams Marlene!

163
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:11,139
Sweet dreams Michele!

164
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:13,972
Sweet dreams Felicia!

165
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:16,372
Sweet dreams Georgina!

166
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:17,906

ROBES-PIERRE: It's almost time
to leave for the competition

184
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,472
Miss Azusa.

185

-I made it!

188
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,906
Good thing I gave myself
five days to get here.

189
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:32,539
No matter what it
takes, I'm going

190
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,939
to be the one to
pair up with Akane.

191
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:35,439
Me!

Rama!

193
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:45,006
-Hey Charlotte, what are you
doing around this part of town?

194
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,239
-No you don't!

195
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:09,072
-Don't worry Charlotte, me
and Akane will be just fine.

196
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,072
You just sit back and
enjoy the show, OK?

197
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:30,372
-The natural look
is the real me.

[humming]

199
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:40,572
Hm?

200
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:45,506
Mr. Saotome, you
finally made it.

201
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,939
-Yo, MIkado the
Molester, how's it going?

202
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:48,706
-Uh!

203
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:50,006
That's Sanzenin, you idiot.

204
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,039
-Your boo-boo's all better now?

205
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:58,072
-I merely let my guard
down for a moment.

206
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,172
That's all.

207
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:02,339
The real match will
be a different story.

208
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:05,006
Your charming
partner, Akane Tendo.

209
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,006
Isn't that her name?

210
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,506
-Mhm.

211
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,639
-I still haven't given your
partner my special greeting.

212
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,806
-Greeting?

213
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,806
-The girl hasn't
been born that hasn't

214
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,739
welcomed my special greeting.

215
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:19,006
-Your greeting?

216
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,639
You don't mean--

217
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:22,172
-One more.

218
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:25,472
One more and I shall
have kissed 1,000 girls,

219
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:28,606
each one more gorgeous
than the last.

220
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,372
-No you don't!

221
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:33,306
-You will hear me out.

222
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,739
Sometime during today's
match, I shall surely

223
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:38,306
steal a kiss from the
lips of Akane Tendo.

224
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,972
-A man, don't you ever
think of anything else

225
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,039
than trying to kiss girls?

226
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:46,972
-Well, what else is there
worth thinking about?

227
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:49,306
-Geez, this guy's scary.

228

[sneezing]

229
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:51,606
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
I never believed

230
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,772
that bit about sneezing when
somebody gossiped about you,

231
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:54,306
but now.

232
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,406
-Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the first annual Charlotte

233
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:27,206
Cup, the Anything Goes martial
arts figure skating fight

234
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:29,439
to the finish to determine,
once and for all,

235
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,406
who owns the pig
known as Charlotte.

236
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:34,006
And now let me introduce
our competitors.

237
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,239
Representing Kolkhoz
High in the Charlotte Cup

238
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:39,706
is the Golden Pair, the
undefeated Emperor Senzanin

239
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:42,339
and, his lovely consort for the
light folk, Azusa Shiratori.

240
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:15,572
-Chant it!

241
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:16,072
-Azusa!

242
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:16,572
Azusa!

243
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:17,072
Azusa!

244
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:30,939
-Hm, look at those lousy
showoffs out there.

245
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:32,772
Well, come on Akane.

246
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:34,039
They won't forget about us.

247
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:42,639
-And here for Furinkan High is
Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo.

248
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:51,106
-OK.

249
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,972
That's enough.

250
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,372
-You know, we
haven't even started,

251
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,239
and Charlotte is
practically Azusa's already.

252
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:01,439
-Oh, no.

253
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:04,506
There's now way I'm
letting Pee-chan go.

254
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:05,572
-And there's the bell.

255
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:08,172
The battle for the
pet black pig begins.

256
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,072
Remember this is
a no holds barred,

257
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:12,239
single match competition people.

258
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:17,272
-Come on Ranma!

259
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,139
Winners strike first,
and we're going to win.

260
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,106
-May I say you're looking
very lovely today?

261
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:36,972
-Woah, Emperor
Zensanin wastes no time

262
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:38,706
in launching his
famous kiss attack.

263
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:46,306
-Oh no you don't.

264
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,772
-Ranma, look!

265
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:48,272
-Huh?

266
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:58,772
-He's such a nuisance.

267
00:18:58,806 --> 00:18:59,439
-So are you!

268
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:11,939
-Imagine refusing
my kiss like that.

269
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:14,472
She must be very shy.

270
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:16,872
-Maybe you just make her sick.

271
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,539
Come on Ranma, hang in there.

272
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:23,739
The match has just started.

273
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,339
-Now, Akane brace yourself.

274
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:28,039
I will have my kiss.

275
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,006
-Akane, get ready to fly.

276
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:04,439
-(SCARED) Look out!

-I can't stop!

281
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:28,872
-Mickey, does him hurt here?

282
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:29,672
Huh?

283
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,039
Here?

284

Here?

00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:36,639
Here?

286
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:37,272
-Yes, it hurts.

287
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,906
It hurts, I said.

288
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,106
I told you it hurts!

289
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:44,039
Stop hitting me there
you silly witch!

290
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:46,472
-But Azusa was only worried.

291
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:54,439
-It is rare that I'm
ever brought to my knees.

292
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:56,739
You will regret it.

293
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:58,639
-You pull that junk
with Akane again

294
00:20:58,672 --> 00:21:01,639
and I'm going to do more
than bring you to your knees.

295
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:03,039
-Oh really?

296
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,106
Such as?

297
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,572
-Such as putting your
Lady Killing butt

298
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:06,939
straight into a coffin.

299
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,139
Got it?

300
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:10,206
Akane is my fiance.

301
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:12,539
You touch her and I'll kill you.

302
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,306
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
I don't believe it.

303
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:21,972
In front of all these people.

304
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:23,272
-Fiance's aren't forever.

305
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:29,706
I, Mikado Sanzenin, will take
it as a personal challenge

306
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:30,539
to break those ties.

[music playing]

308

AKANE (VOICEOVER): What can we
do to defeat the Goodbye Whirl?

309
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,430
Can it even be done?

310
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,896
Hey, what's Ryoga doing here?

311
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,996
Next time, on
Ranma 1/2, Pee-chan

312
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,396
Explodes, The Icy
Fountain of Love.

313
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,563
See you there.
