00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,900
Sure, why not?

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,233
Well, it seems that one's
appeared at a seaside resort.

5
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,700
They were nice enough
to invite us to take

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,133
care of their problem for them.

7
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,266
Hm.

8
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:52,366
Now you three be sure
and come back safely.

00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,733
But, uh--

ALL: We will!

00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:58,133
(SINGING) Ho hi, ho hi,
we'll make the monster die.

12
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,766
We'll eat his brain
and drink champagne.

13
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,333
Ho hi, ho hi.

14
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:04,233
I wish I were going
to the hot springs.

15
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,166
I don't like this.

16

Have a good trip.

[laughing]

24
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:34,566
The monster's called the
marauding octopus pot?

25
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,933
That's what they say.

26
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,633
We'll know more once we meet
with the town council members.

Get your rice cakes!

00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,433
From the monster's name,
one assumes it must be a type

of octopus or--

32
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,166
Four rice cakes for me, please.

Hey, no fair, Tendo.

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,566
Give me some rice wine.

The octopus pot.

Sunk deep in the

46
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,366
are used to trap and
retrieve sleeping octopi.

Quickly.

Defeated them all.

Man, that's one
fast octopus pot.

00:03:56,966 --> 00:04:00,200
Hm, now this is weird.

Searching for something?

59
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,266
Oh, just an octopus pot.

60
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:07,900
Yes, we're the experts
hired to bring the marauding

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,233
octopus down, actually.

62
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:16,033
Dear me, you mean that
monster's on the prowl again?

63
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,100
How scary.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,300
Scary?

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,800
When you've got two strong
martial artist like us,

66
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,666
monsters are a specialty.

67
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,900
Now that we're here, you
can just sit back and--

some nice rice cakes.

Who was that?

That, son, was a girl whose
house is covered in shells.

We could say more,
boy, but you're

89
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,766
far too young to understand.

ruining relationships,

Business in town
is falling off.

go bankrupt withiN--

Um, are you listening?

98
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:40,800
Should we charge them for food?

99
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,566
You can leave everything to us.

100

are as good as gone.

artist, I you my word.

Supposedly the
octopus is in here.

That's right.

150

No monster.

151
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,066
Just your run of the
mill human being.

152

But, son, surely
no normal human

153
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,000
can fit inside such
a small container.

No normal human, no.

And you don't mean to suggest--

That it might be--

Well, time to go.

172
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,233
WAITER: It stole my sashimi!

173
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,800
Sounds like they're onto me.

174
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,966
SOUN (VOICEOVER): Not good.

175
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:58,333
If they discover our
connection to the Master--

176
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,766
GENMA (VOICEOVER): This could
be the end for our heroes.

177
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:10,066
Tell me, has the octopus
pot come through here?

178
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,466
May we help you?

179
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:12,766
WAITER: The octopus pot.

180
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:14,033
Is it in here?

181
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,066
What gave you that idea?

182
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:16,633
There!

183
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:17,966
On the table!

184
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,433
That sign on the platter.

185
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,566
What's it say?

186
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,148
Hm.

187
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,233
How did that--

188
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:30,466
That's the sashimi just
stolen a few moments ago.

189
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:33,533
Tendo, look how
contentiously he treats us.

190
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,300
The octopus pot
must be close by.

191
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,866
We'll crush that
pesky 'pus yet.

192
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,066
BOTH: Crush him dead!

193
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:40,933
Crush him dead!

194
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:44,000
[maniacal laughing]

195
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,000
Here we go again.

196
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,266
There.

197
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,900
Thanks, Kasumi.

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,833
I wonder if the
three of them are OK.

199
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,233
Well, seeing as
the three of them

200
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:02,266
are practically monsters
themselves, I wouldn't worry.

201
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,000
Nabiki!

202
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Hey, a good omen.

203
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:28,422
SOUN: Yo, octopus pot!

204
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:31,455
GENMA: Come out, come
out, wherever you are.

205
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:32,922
You can't hide, you know?

206
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:37,722
You ran away because you
were scared, didn't ya?

207
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,355
WOMAN: Did you hear that, dear?

208
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:40,988
The octopus is back.

209
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:44,555
MAN: But those martial
artists will protect us.

210
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:45,355
Hey, octopus pt.

211
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:46,555
Where you at?

212
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,622
[bouncing]

213
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:51,822
SOUN: Hello?

214
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:53,522
Octopus pot?

215
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:55,755
[interposing voices]

216
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,855
Where could that thing be?

217
00:10:58,955 --> 00:10:59,488
HAPPOSAI: Here.

218
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:00,055
Right here.

219
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:01,388
Where are you?

220
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:02,755
I'm right here.

221
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:03,655
Here.

222
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:05,788
Here!

223
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:08,322
If you want me so bad,
why don't you catch me?

224
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:15,222
SOUN: Penalty kick!

225
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:21,122
Look!

226
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,222
Up in the sky!

227
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:23,055
Well, I'll be.

228
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:24,855
Could that be the octopus pot?

229
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:27,022
GENMA: It got away.

230
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:28,855
SOUN: My goodness, it's fast.

231
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:29,755
GENMA: What a shame.

232
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:37,988
Ah, curse that stupid
Soun and Genma anyway.

233
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,622
Pretending not to know me.

234
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:42,322
Don't think I don't know that
that's what the two of you

235
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:44,088
are up to.

236
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:48,255
I think I know just how
I want to deal with that.

237
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:51,722
[screaming]

238
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:54,222
Gah!

239
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,955
[laughing]

240
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:58,222
Let's see them not try and
pretend not to know me now!

241
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,022
OK, now you happy?

242
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:05,822
How dare you!

243
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:07,722
Have you forgotten your place?

244
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:08,688
Uh-oh.

245
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:11,188
Allow me to remind you.

246
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:12,022
Hey, everybody!

247
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,555
Listen up!

248
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,122
He doesn't want
you to know this,

249
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:17,022
but this kid and
I are Master and--

250
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:22,755
Talk a little
louder why don't you?

251
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:23,622
Hey, hey!

252
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:24,955
What are you doing?

253
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:25,755
Let go of me!

254
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:27,088
We're leaving town is what.

255
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:29,222
But are you sure you want
to let the old freak get away

256
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:30,288
like that?

257
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,022
SOUN: Let who get away?

258
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:33,755
GENMA: Who, that perv in a pot?

259
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:34,755
Never met him.

260
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,488
[laughs] Let's go.

261
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:38,888
Hey, at least let
go of the hair.

262
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:39,888
Come on!

263
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:41,388
That does it.

264
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:42,888
[thunderclap]

265
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:44,355
[exclaims]

266
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:46,222
The three of you
have disrespected me

267
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:47,588
for that last time.

268
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,355
Prepare to face
the consequences.

269
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:51,822
Happo Fire Burst!

270
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:58,288
[screaming]

271
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:03,988
And if that weren't enough,
Happo Rapid Fire Bursts!

272
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:07,455
[exclaiming, screaming]

273
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:17,222
You're all dead to me now.

274
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:18,088
Do you hear?

275
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:19,822
Why do I need you anyway?

276
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:22,755
I've got someone special.

277
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:24,755
Someone special?

278
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:26,788
No time for that now, Tendo.

279
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:28,522
We'd best make our escape.

280
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:30,455
Right as usual, Saotome.

281
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:34,088
WAITER: Leaving so soon?

282
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:34,622
Oh, oh.

283
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,088
Um, uh, we--

284
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:38,522
Wish you were as good
about getting results

285
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:42,488
as you are with making
us a pile of bills.

286
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,555
Not trying to escape, are ya?

287
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:45,588
Oh, no, no.

288
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:46,655
No.

289
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:48,888
And you've never met
that octopus before?

290
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,088
What, are you kidding?

291
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:51,822
No, never.

292
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,122
Tendo, you hear that?

293
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:56,022
This man thinks we
know the octopus pot.

294
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:57,955
Know the octopus?

295
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:00,022
Why, we've never even met him.

296
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:01,555
Have we, Saotome?

297
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:02,488
GENMA: No, never.

298
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,222
[nervous laughter]

299
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:05,655
Now that's a good one.

300
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:09,322
We must redouble
our efforts, Saotome.

301
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:10,588
Come on, boy.

302
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:11,255
We're going.

303
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:11,788
Hey!

304
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:12,688
Not so hard!

305
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:13,788
Ow!

306
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,622
Come on, I told you not
to yank on the hair!

307
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,922
Talk about you being
stuck between a rock

308
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:25,288
and a hard place, hey, Saotome?

309
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:26,855
Somehow, we--

310
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:30,355
So why don't you just
gravel like you always do?

311
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:31,588
Foolish boy.

312
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,855
He's so mad at us right
now, he's just as likely

313
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:38,422
to pluck our heads off
like petals on a daisy.

314
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,488
Basically, you just
want to be paid.

315
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,955
BOTH: Yeah, of course.

316
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:45,288
RANMA: Well, I guess you'd
better find him then,

317
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:46,322
hadn't you?

318
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,222
Well, he did mention
a special someone.

319
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,722
Didn't he, Saotome?

320
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,088
I believe he did, Tendo.

321
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:53,622
Yes.

322
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:54,522
[chuckling]

323
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:56,788
CUTE GIRL: You're so nice to me.

324
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:57,688
HAPPOSAI: [inaudible]

325
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:58,229
Hmm?

326
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,622
That shell-covered house.

327
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:03,655
Where that girl lives.

328
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:05,422
The one who sells seashells.

329
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:08,288
You know, down by the seashore.

330
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:11,188
BOTH: It's her!

331
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:15,588
RANMA: So, this is where that
little stink pot's been hiding.

332
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:18,288
One might even
call it his lair.

333
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:23,622
Hm, you don't
suppose the Master--

334
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:24,922
Prepare to be boarded.

335
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:26,422
Aha!

336
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:28,922
[scream]

337
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,855
That is disgusting!

338
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:37,755
We've got to stop him
before it's too late.

339
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,122
It's not so bad.

340
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,022
BOTH: It's not?

341
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:42,288
HAPPOSAI: Look here, dear.

342
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:45,355
See what I've brought
to make you feel better?

343
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:48,088
How can I ever
thank you? [coughing]

344
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,322
Have whatever you like.

345
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:52,355
Some fish cakes,
perhaps, or dumplings.

346
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:53,055
My goodness.

347
00:15:53,155 --> 00:15:54,722
There's so much.

348
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:55,622
[coughing]

349
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:56,688
Oh, my dear!

350
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,088
Are you all right?

351
00:15:58,188 --> 00:15:58,629
I--

352
00:15:58,688 --> 00:15:59,988
[coughing]

353
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:01,322
I'm just so afraid.

354
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:05,288
I don't know how I'd
get by without you.

355
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:07,755
Well, you needn't
worry on that account.

356
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:12,288
I'll always be here
for you no matter what.

357
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:17,788
I knew somehow that you'd
always look after me.

358
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:18,388
I will.

359
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:18,929
I swear.

360
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:26,988
Such a mack daddy, you mean.

361
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:28,688
SOUN: Ranma, be nice.

362
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,288
Isn't there anything
else I can do for you?

363
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:31,829
Oh, no.

364
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:32,555
I--

365
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:33,488
[coughing]

366
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,255
I would like some
melons, though I

367
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:38,155
don't care for what they have
around here seeing as they're

368
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:40,022
covered in pesticides and--

369
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:41,788
[coughing]

370
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,955
If that's what
you want, then I--

371
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:44,955
Oh, no.

372
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,822
It's not that I--
although I am ever

373
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:50,022
so fond of organic produce.

374
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,455
Then I'm off, my
dearest, to steal--

375
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,688
I mean, to buy you your melons!

376
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,055
And you're sure
it's no trouble?

377
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:59,322
[giggling]

378
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:00,155
HAPPOSAI: All right.

379
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:00,955
I'm off.

380
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:01,688
Be back soon.

381
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:08,188
Aha!

382
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,288
Gotcha!

383
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,022
And what do you think
you three are doing?

384
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:12,588
Well, it's obvious, ain't it?

385
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:16,388
Now stay still
while we tie you up.

386
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:19,288
Kiss my crockpot!

387
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,255
Oh, no!

388
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:24,588
I don't think so.

389
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:27,188
Come here!

390
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:28,455
Don't let him get away!

391
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:31,588
Our reputation-- no, our
honor-- depends on it!

392
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:32,322
Yeah, yeah.

393
00:17:32,422 --> 00:17:33,855
I'm chasing him, ain't I?

394
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,488
Now, Master?

395
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:38,788
We warned you.

396
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:41,455
You're the ones who
ought to take warning.

397
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:42,955
Now take this.

398
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:44,422
Happo Fire Cannon!

399
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:50,855
[screaming]

400
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:54,355
[laughing]

401
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:56,088
I told you, didn't I?

402
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:57,555
RANMA: OK, freak.

403
00:17:57,655 --> 00:17:59,488
Now me!

404
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:01,888
Hi-ya!

405
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:03,822
Darn!

406
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:04,555
Gotcha.

407
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:05,096
Come here!

408
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:09,729
You little--

409
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:17,588
Now, that's just great!

410
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,388
Now which way did he--

411
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:20,222
Here I am.

412
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:21,588
Over here!

413
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:24,622
Over here, look!

414
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:25,822
Here!

415
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:27,222
Over here.

416
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:28,055
Come on.

417
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:30,288
Peek-a-boo!

418
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:33,155
Aha!

419
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:34,655
There, Ranma.

420
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:36,155
How'd you like that?

421
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:39,022
Anything goes special
attack octo-pot.

422
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:41,488
(MUFFLED) Get it off!

423
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,488
And now for the big finish!

424
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,955
Let go of me!

425
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:50,955
I don't think so!

426
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:52,455
Wow!

427
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:53,922
Where did you get those?

428
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:00,455
What?

429
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:01,888
Oh, big mistake.

430
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,722
I-- I'm blown up.

431
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:15,488
So much for the
marauding octopus pot.

432
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,722
HAPPOSAI: Hey,
it's dark in here!

433
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:18,488
Let me out!

434
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:20,655
Way to go, Ranma, my boy.

435
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:25,155
We're safe now from
dishonor and the food bill.

436
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:28,255
That's not why I did it.

437
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:28,988
Ranma!

438
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:29,529
Soun!

439
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:30,688
Genma!

440
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:33,955
BOTH (STUTTERING): Yes, Master?

441
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:36,588
Won't you please have a heart?

442
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:37,722
BOTH: What?

443
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:40,455
With me tied up, I won't
be able to get around

444
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,288
to get her the thing she needs.

445
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:45,255
She's gonna starve!

446
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,655
Who, that girl?

447
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:47,788
She needs me.

448
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,088
ALL: Octopus?

449
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:56,188
[coughing]

450
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:59,622
Please, you mustn't
worry about my welfare.

451
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:02,255
It's true, I'm too weak
to rise from my sick bed,

452
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,922
but that's no excuse to impose.

453
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:07,155
Although I do believe
I'd feel ever so much

454
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:10,288
better after a little
foie gras or caviar.

455
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:12,755
Or-- [coughs]

456
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:19,622
You really are too kind.

457
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:21,288
Well, what do you know, Gramps.

458
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,622
You've been replaced
by a cephalopod.

459
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,555
Now that, my friends, is sad.

460
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:27,655
This can't be happening.

461
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:31,388
Fine!

462
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:33,022
If that's the way things are!

463
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:40,088
Master, what is all this?

464
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:41,855
Souvenirs, obviously.

465
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:44,488
Can't come back from a
trip empty handed, can I?

466
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:45,755
He's got a point.

467
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:47,988
I'll leave it to you
to get them out of town.

468
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:48,922
You what?

469
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:53,288
WAITER: I knew not to trust you.

470
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:57,488
Just what kind of fools
do you take us for here?

471
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:58,222
Calm down.

472
00:20:58,322 --> 00:20:59,388
No need to hate.

473
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:02,855
Don't be looking at me.

474

were there, too.

476
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,088
Your move.

477
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,122
Check mate.

478
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:18,122
Here you go, grandfather.

479
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:20,222
HAPPOSAI: There's no
better care for being tired

480
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,222
than a cup of your tea.

481
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,688
KASUMI: Uh-huh.

482
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:26,288
So, did you put
down the monster?

483
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:27,122
No, not yet.

484

AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Step right up!

486
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:17,279
Come and see the
magical paper dolls!

487
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,312
Just write a command
on it and then place it

488
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:20,745
on the target and presto!

489
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:22,712
Your wish is my command.

Next time on "Ranma 1/2"--
"Gosunkugi's Paper Dolls

We'll see you there!
