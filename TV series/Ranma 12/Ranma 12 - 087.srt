[theme song in japanese]

2
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:53,496
-Ah, here we are.

3
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:58,963
What a day.

4
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,463
What a day.

5
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:01,629
Hmm.

6
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,963
The air is fine, the
cherry trees are blooming,

7
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:06,063
there's peace in my
household, and all

8
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:07,329
is right with the world.

9
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,163
What could possibly go wrong?

10
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:17,637
-Aaah.

11
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:21,563
-Hmm?

12
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:23,729
Well, good morning, Father.

13
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,996
-Uh, hello.

14
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:28,063
She's not cooking
breakfast is she?

15
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:29,429
-Oh, no.

16
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:30,496
-Thank heavens.

17
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:32,229
-She's asked to
borrow the kitchen.

18
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:35,263
It seems she's finally ready
to begin bridal training.

19
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:38,263
-Ah, that's wonderful.

20
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,629
-Go away, Dad, you're
distracting me.

21
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:45,170
-Sorry.

22
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:49,570
Hmm?

23
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:53,970
Potstickers.

24
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:57,563
AKANE: Ranma,
you're such a jerk.

25
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:03,329
-Everyone, it's time to
come in for breakfast.

26
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,629
-Don't mind if we do.

27
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,063
-Morning.

28
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:10,663
-Good morning.

29
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:14,396
-Akane, don't you
forget to eat now.

30
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:15,096
AKANE: I can't.

31
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,229
I'm too busy.

32
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,429
-What is she doing
in there anyway?

33
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:19,129
-Bridal training.

34
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:24,296
-She's whipping up something
delicious all for you, Son.

35
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:25,729
What do you think of that?

36
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,929
-You're a lucky kid.

37
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,896
-I hope you appreciate it.

38
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:32,996
-Well, if you're all so
excited, why don't you eat it?

39
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:35,196
-No.

40
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,737
No, no.

41
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:36,237
-Hmm.

42
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,229
-Give me the pickles,
you little freak.

43
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,463
-Get your own.

44
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:45,796
You got Akane.

45
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:49,929
-So give me back the
pickles, and you can have it.

46
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,196
-And why should I have to die?

47
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:55,996
-Come here.

48
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:56,963
-I don't wanna.

49
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,496
-Ah, OK, now he's done it.

50
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,996
Ha, now I've got ya.

51
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:06,504
Aaaah.

52
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:24,770
-Oh.

53
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:30,263
-Uh, Akane.

54
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:36,196
I-- I-- I swear it
was an accident.

55
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:37,763
Akane, you gotta believe me.

56
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,596
-Don't smell like
potstickers to me.

57
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:48,829
-Can't you see we're
being serious here?

58
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,096
-What'd you hit me for?

59
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:51,529
Besides, it wouldn't
have happened

60
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,596
if you hadn't hogged
all the pickles.

61
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,763
-Do you know how long
that took to make?

62
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:01,663
-Look, I said I was sorry.

63
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,729
And besides, there's no use
crying over spilt milk, right?

64
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:05,363
-Here, here.

65
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:17,763
-Kasumi, dear, we're
out of soy sauce.

66
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,063
-Oh, all right.

67
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:21,063
Akane, serve the rice.

68
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:22,129
-Can I have seconds?

69
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,129
-Seconds, please.

70
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,063
Ah, eh.

71
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:42,563
-Well, I'm glad it's not
me who ticked her off.

72
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:43,763
-Oh, come now, Akane.

73
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:45,896
Isn't it time you gave
poor Ranma a break?

74
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:47,563
Forgiveness is a virtue.

75
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,496
Isn't that what
they say, Saotome?

76
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:53,096
-Ah, but arguing is what
couples do the best.

77
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:56,129
-I'd rather be coupled to
an ox, thank you very much.

78
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:00,929
-Say what you want, Ranma,
it's not like I care.

79
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,629
Excuse me.

80
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,696
-Guess this means the
engagement's over.

81
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:10,163
-Oh, but, but then we'd
be out on the street.

82
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:12,229
-Ah, but you'd still
have your pride.

83
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,463
-Here, Father, soy sauce.

84
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:22,029
-Stupid Akane could have
got me up before she left.

85
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:26,129
-Hey, boy.

86
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:27,863
Boy, you forgot your lunch.

87
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,163
Come back.

88
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:34,996
Or if you don't want
it, then I'll-- Uhhh.

89
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:48,329
-Uh, I forgot my lunch.

90
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:52,596
Akane won't share hers.

91
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:53,696
Ukyo's absent from school.

92
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:57,929
Maybe I could ask
Hiroshi or Daisuke.

93
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,329
Ah, that's it.

94
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:04,429
Good thing I remembered
to bring money.

95
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:08,696
-So what's wrong
with Ranma today?

96
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,263
-I don't know, and
I really don't care.

97
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:12,263
-Did you have a fight?

98
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:13,363
-Not at all.

99
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,096
-I got dibs on the
Korean noodle bread.

100
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:21,763
No way.

101
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:23,629
No way.

102
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,563
VOICEOVER: Dear
customers, in order

103
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:28,196
to attend the All Japan
Okonomiyaki Concourse,

104
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:31,029
I'm taking the next
three days off.

105
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,029
[inaudible]

106
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:32,570
-Oh.

107
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:37,263
I ain't even got enough
for octopus puffs.

108
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:45,863
-I'm home.

109
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:48,129
-Akane.

110
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,796
Thank goodness you're back.

111
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:51,163
Father and Mr.
Saotome, they're--

112
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:51,704
-Hmm?

113
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:55,163
-This would never
have happened if you

114
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:57,096
trained your son correctly.

115
00:07:57,196 --> 00:07:58,729
-Like you never made a mistake.

116
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:01,896
-Oh, honestly.

117
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:03,196
Now what is it?

118
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,329
-Akane, thank
goodness you're here.

119
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:08,196
Your father says he's
protecting your honor.

120
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:10,429
-Thanks, Dad, but
you needn't bother.

121
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,129
-I'll be the judge of that.

122
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,396
Standing up for his little
girl is a father's duty.

123
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,063
-Oh, man, I'm hungry.

124
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:20,796
-That's right.

125
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:23,763
And so is defending
his son's honor.

126
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:24,829
-Defending his son's what?

127
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:27,496
Uh, never mind.

128
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:28,163
Forget it.

129
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:28,963
I take it all back.

130
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:31,229
-No, Son, you mustn't stop me.

131
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:33,929
What I do, I do for your sake.

132
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:34,470
-Aaah.

133
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:39,363
-What are you doing?

134
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:40,663
Don't just stand there.

135
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:41,596
Stop them.

136
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:44,570
-Saotome.

137
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:46,263
-Tendo, at last.

138
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:47,629
This is it.

139
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:53,863
-Dad, don't!

140
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:56,596
Aaah.

141
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,696
-Aaaah.

142
00:08:57,796 --> 00:08:58,729
150 yen?

143
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:01,563
But, but Saotome.

144
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:04,829
-Ah, we'll finish the
play later, Tendo.

145
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:06,229
-The play?

146
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,229
-What play would that be?

147
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,163
Tell me, Pop.

148
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:12,929
-Uh, well, you see,
we-- um, uh, um.

149
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:16,129
-Oh, save it, Dad.

150
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:16,670
Hmph.

151
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:18,629
-Give me that.

152
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:21,763
-Genma, you idiot.

153
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:23,263
They would have
fallen for it if you

154
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,129
haven't blown your character.

155
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:25,929
Ah.

156
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,929
-And we were so close, too.

157
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,896
-Go, before I get--

158
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:30,437
-Aaah.

159
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:31,296
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:39,463
-Oh, my Father, do cheer up.

161
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:40,663
-I'm listening.

162
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,729
My pot, are you--

163
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:43,270
-Yessum.

164
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:55,963
-May I be excused?

165
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,596
-No, you may not.

166
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:58,663
-What?

167
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:00,329
-If you'd just listen
to reason, Akane,

168
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:05,496
you'd know that Ranma's
very sorry, and he-- Akane!

169
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,063
Please, please listen to reason.

170
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:09,663
I swear, I'll never make
fun of your cooking again.

171
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:10,863
I promise.

172
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:11,829
-Man, this is bad.

173
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:17,229
Akane, I'm sorry that I--

174
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:19,929
-Forget it.

175
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,296
-Hmm?

176
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:21,963
Good idea.

177
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:23,196
Just make a new one.

178
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:27,996
-Oh, I can just make
a new one, stupid.

179
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:31,829
The one you wrecked I made to
celebrate you and your dad's

180
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:33,596
coming here two years ago.

181
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,763
But if you're too
dumb to appreciate it,

182
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:39,529
then I-- I guess I shouldn't
even have wasted my time.

183
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,529
You know what you are?

184
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:42,529
A jerk!

185
00:11:08,863 --> 00:11:10,996
-Oh, I wish Akane were--

186
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:11,663
-She's what?

187
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:14,696
Akane is gone?

188
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:17,563
-She's not in her room,
the Dojo, the bath.

189
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,396
Oh, where can she have gone?

190
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:22,629
-You don't think she--

191
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:23,529
-Could have possibly--

192
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:29,863
-Akane, run away from home?

193
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:31,396
Perish the thought.

194
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:32,329
-True, true.

195
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,663
But where else could she be?

196
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:35,763
-And who's fault is that?

197
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,496
No, no, it can't be.

198
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:41,996
I won't believe it.

199
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:43,996
You should've taken me with you.

200
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:46,663
Whatever will I tell your
poor deceased mother?

201
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:49,329
-I'll never get to
sleep on her lap again.

202
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:51,929
-So quit crying,
and do something.

203
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,296
-Ah, I made it, and before the
expiration date on these bean

204
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,829
jam buns, too.

205
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:58,429
Oh, Akane, I--

206
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:00,229
-Akane.

207
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:00,770
-Akane.

208
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:05,329
-What's going on?

209
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,429
Did something happen to Akane?

210
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,563
-Ryouga.

211
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:09,104
-Huh?

212
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,529
-Akane.

213
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:12,196
Ranma.

214
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,596
Where are you Akane?

215
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:16,729
Ranma, why won't you answer me?

216
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:17,270
-Akane.

217
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:17,770
Akane.

218
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,163
Akane.

219
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:22,704
Akane.

220
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:24,670
Akane.

221
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:39,004
-Akane.

222
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:40,996
Akane.

223
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:41,896
There she is.

224
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:43,863
After her, I say.

225
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,404
Faster.

226
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:48,829
Don't go.

227
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,829
Don't go, Akane, please.

228
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:51,929
I take it all back.

229
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,863
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:54,429
Wait.

231
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:55,796
Wait up, please.

232
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:58,696
Akane.

233
00:12:58,796 --> 00:12:59,237
Akane.

234
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,496
Don't forsake me.

235
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:05,696
Please, Akane.

236
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:06,363
-Huh?

237
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:07,263
-That's not my name.

238
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,229
I'm Noriko.

239
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,096
[clock chiming]

240
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:26,996
-Akane.

241
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,129
-Akane.

242
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:29,496
-Akane.

243
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,996
You did something
to her, didn't you?

244
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:33,229
-What's done is done.

245
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,196
I couldn't help myself.

246
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:38,529
And besides, the idiot didn't
have to overreact like that.

247
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:42,263
-The only idiot here--

248
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:42,804
-Huh?

249
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,729
-Is you.

250
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:46,329
-Hey, get it out.

251
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:51,396
Ranma, this time you've
really gone and done it.

252
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,729
You have really done
it this time, you jerk.

253
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:56,496
-Look, I made a mistake, OK?

254
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,896
-You think it's a joke?

255
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:03,096
You call the disgusting thing
you did to her a mistake?

256
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:05,896
-What are you talking about?

257
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:07,329
-That does it.

258
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:12,229
-[inaudible].

259
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:16,129

Akane.

262
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:27,204
-Any luck?

263
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:29,529
-No, not yet.

264
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:33,504
Akane.

265
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:40,596
Not in here, is she?

266
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:44,296
-Akane.

00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:44,837
Akane.

Akane.

-Back off.

270
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:10,929
We can finish this later.

-Hey, where you going?

273
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:25,896
-Look, I ain't got
the time for this.

274
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:27,163
-Silence.

275
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:30,529
First you get yours, then
I go find Akane by myself.

276
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,363
-Oh, yeah?

277
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,596
You and what sense of direction?

278
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:33,429
-Shut up.

279
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:34,896
-Are you crazy?

-Ryouga.

283
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,496
Oh, geez, what a blockhead.

284
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:58,396
Come on, snap out of it.

285
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:01,637
Ryouga.

286
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,696
-Get off of me, man.

287
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,129
Get off of me.

288
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:09,670
Dah!

289
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:10,363
Get up.

290
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:11,663
This is no time for a nap.

291
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,596
Get off of me.

292
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:18,663
Stupid jerk.

293
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:48,696
Oh, man, that was a close one.

294
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:50,896
Uh, wait a minute.

295
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:51,437
Don't break.

296
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:51,937
Aaaah.

297
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:56,929
-She's still not back?

298
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,963
-I guess she was serious.

299
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,429
-Once she makes up her
mind about something.

300

-Kasumi is she-- Well, there's
not much else to search.

301
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:17,996
-Do you think maybe
she's left the area?

302
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,363
Wait for me.

303
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:31,129
-I guess maybe I can find
a few more places to check.

304
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,329
-Oh, good job, stupid.

305
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:57,829
Now you've done it.

306
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,796
Akane could have run off
almost anywhere by now.

307
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:07,629
Still not back.

308
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:09,063
Oh, Akane, you idiot.

309
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,963
Where did you run off to?

310
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:19,429
Don't you know that without
you, I'm just-- Huh?

311
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:24,396
AKANE: Achoo.

312
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:24,937
-Akane?

00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:28,537
Akane?

314
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,663
You mean, you've been
up here the whole time?

315
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,863
What's the matter with you?

316
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,629
You had the entire
family thinking

317
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:40,463
you'd gotten into
some kind of accident.

318
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:42,429
-And what gave you that idea?

319
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,963
-Now wait a-- Huh?

320
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,263
Come here.

321
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:54,129
-Hmm?

322
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:55,829
-You want to get
down, don't you?

323
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:58,263
You're going to catch a cold.

-I don't need your help.

Aaaah.

00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:04,604

-So you don't need my help, huh?

00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,696
-Hey, what do I know?

331
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,929
I'm just an idiot, remember?

332
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,729
-Oh, well, that was
just, uh, you know--

-It's OK.

334
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,796
How can I stay
mad at someone who

335
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:28,363
admits he'd be lost without me?

336
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:29,596
-But I never--

337
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:34,604
-P-chan.

338
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,696
Hey, cut it out.

339
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:41,796
What did P-chan ever do to you?

340
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:43,696
You poor baby.

341
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:46,563
How'd you get that
bump on your head?

342
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,996
It was Ranma who
did it, wasn't it?

343
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:51,229
You are so pathetic.

344
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:55,929
-Well, he had it coming, OK?

345
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,096
-There, there, baby.

346
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,396
Don't worry.

347
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:00,296
Mommy will beat him up for you.

348
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:01,963
I'm sure he's got
it coming, too.

349
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:08,396
-Oh, poor Father's
still out there.

350
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:10,196
Oh, well, it's time
to start breakfast.

351
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:13,263
-You what?

352
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:14,829
-The whole night?

353
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,863
-On the roof all along.

354
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:22,096
-Do you know how hard
I tried to find you?

355
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:24,763
The sewers I had
to crawl through?

356
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:26,096
-You poor thing.

357
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:28,496
You must be exhausted.

358
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:29,063
Here.

359
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:30,629
Have some soup.

360
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,163
-So all your worrying
was for nothing.

361
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:35,596
-There, Pop, did you hear that?

362
00:20:35,696 --> 00:20:37,996
-And what'd we ever do to you?

363
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:40,329
-Are you saying
we had it coming?

364
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:41,996
-I'm cutting school today.

365
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:46,996
-I'm sorry you guys, but look,
I made you some potstickers.

366
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:50,563
Have some.

367
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:56,729
What?

368
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,963
You're not hungry?

369
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:00,763
Here, Ranma, you try some.

370
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:01,429
-Huh?

371
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:02,796
-Come on, have some.

372
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,096
-Hmm, yeah, great.

373
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:06,496
-Ha, ha, very funny.

374
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:11,063
Come on.

375
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:12,263
Help yourself.

376
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:18,129
-Uh, uh, uh, Akane,
you, uh, you wouldn't

377
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:20,563
mind running away
again, would you?

378
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:21,104
-Huh?

379
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:24,529
You jerk.

380
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,296
How come you're always
so sensitive, huh?

381
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:27,996
-Look, you got it wrong.

382
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:31,096
I'm just being
honest, that's all.

383
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:32,563
-[inaudible].

384
00:21:32,663 --> 00:21:33,163
-Ow.

385
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:33,596
-Come on!

386
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:34,529
Hold still!

387
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:37,996
-OK, stop it.

388
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:46,945

389
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,778
AKANE: Ranma, what's
this Dragon Whisker?

390
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:21,145
And what's it got to
do with your pigtail?

391
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:24,911
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Give me that pigtail.

392
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:27,645
We'll see you there.
