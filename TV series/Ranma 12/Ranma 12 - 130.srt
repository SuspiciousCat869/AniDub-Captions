00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:54,100
Uh, Ms. Akane?

4
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,966
I'm sorry I'm late.

5
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:59,100
Mr. Sentaro, I'm
really sorry, too.

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,933
But I don't think that
we should see each other.

7
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:03,033
What are you saying?

8
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,333
[sobbing]

9
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,600
Mr. Sentaro, how could you?

10
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,833
You were just toying
with my affection!

11
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,000
No, Ms. Akane!

12
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,866
That's not true, honestly!

13
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,500
My love for you is far greater
than all the cherry blossoms

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,733
in springtime.

15
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,666
That's sweet.

16
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:22,366
But how do I know
it's the truth?

17
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,300
You must believe.

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,766
My love for you is boundless.

19
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:27,933
I am so happy.

20
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,300
Let's seal our love
with a kiss, Sentaro.

SENTARO (VOICEOVER): Akane--

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,533
Forgive me for
asking, but how come

23
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,866
you're hugging a lawn ornament?

24
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:41,833
Look at you.

25
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,333
You're completely irresponsible.

26
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,600
So how in the world do
you expect me to put you

27
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,800
in charge of our school?

28
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm too old for this.

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,133
Mark my words.

30
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,333
You've got to pull yourself
together and start planning

31
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:58,366
for your future, or
you'll end up a bum!

32
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,466
There's not much hope.

33
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,933
Special training
begins tomorrow!

34
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,366
And you had better be ready.

35
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,433
No, wait, grandmama.

36
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,700

[squeaking]

What was that?

00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,133
Who's out there?

40
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,766
What is going on out here, huh?

41
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,566
Ah!

Huh?

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,600
Who are you, anyway?

45
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,466
I demand that you untie her!

[giggling]

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,233
What do you want with
my grandmama, anyway?

48
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:51,866
And don't think you
can get by me, either!

49
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,533
You bring her back!

50
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,433
They stole Grandmama.

51
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,200
Oh, no.

52
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,333
What am I going to do now?

53
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:05,633
AKANE (VOICEOVER): The Missing
Matriarch of Martial Arts Tea.

Oh, man, am I hungry.

56
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,700
You wanna grab something to eat?

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,933
Oh, wow, Ranma.

58
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:17,300
Are you actually
offering to treat me?

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,433
Of course not.

60
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,433
We're going Dutch.

61
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:20,733

MAN: If you're smart, Ms.
Akane, you'll take my advice

63
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,566
and dump Ranma.

64
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,200
Trust me, you'd be much
happier with a guy like me.

RANMA: I've got a
craving for noodles.

67
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,533
AKANE: Yeah, I could
go for noodles.

68
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:40,733
Gee, I wonder what Sentaro
wanted this time around.

69
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,133
Ah, forget it.

70
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,133
I don't wanna get involved with
him or martial arts tea again.

71
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:48,600
Every time he shows up nothing
good winds up happening to us.

72
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,033
Yeah, I guess you're right.

73
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:52,266
MAN: You must listen
to me, Ms. Akane!

74
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,000
Huh?

75
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,333
I'm serious.

76
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,933
Get lost, you freak.

77
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,466
Please, you don't understand.

78
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,566
You must listen to me.

79
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,600
Oh, please!

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,166
Gee, it sounds like
you're in trouble.

81
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,066
Oh, Ms. Akane.

82
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,766
I knew you'd listen.

83
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,000
Only someone like
you would understand.

84
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,533
You are so full of it.

85
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:11,933
Right now in my life
is in extreme danger.

Akane, I've had
just about as much

89
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,866
as I can take of this jerk.

90
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:21,866
Hey, don't leave me!

91
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,466
I'm coming with you!

92
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:24,033
Wait!

93
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,133
You can't-- agh!

94
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,733
What'd you do that for?

95
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,700
Not so fast.

96
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,533
Pay up, kid.

97
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:32,500
Ahh!

98
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,966
Strike three!

99
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,466
You're out!

100
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:36,933
[cheering]

101
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:41,100
Oh, no.

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Not you again.

103
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,466
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,033
But is that the way
you talk to someone

105
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,500
whose life is in danger?

106
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,133
I have had enough
of your yapping!

107
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,800
Hey, I'm really
sorry about that.

108
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,133
Oh, don't worry.

109
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:58,933
He'll be all right.

110
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:03,333
Ha.

111
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:05,900
Uh, thanks a lot, lady.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,633
You may not believe
this, but that baseball

113
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,266
was really intended for me.

114
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:12,333
Don't be an idiot!

115
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,133
You've gotta believe me.

116
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,666
I'm not making this stuff up.

117
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,100
I really am in danger.

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,866
Honestly.

119
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,833
You can't leave me!

120
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,733
Are you all right?

121
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,200
[honking]

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,633
Not again.

123
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,100
Akane.

124
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,566
Oh, man.

125
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,500
What's going on?

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,041
Whoa!

127
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:55,600
So now do you finally
believe me, Ms. Akane?

128
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Well, you might believe
someone's out to get you.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,300
But I think Ranma's just
having a bad day, that's all.

130
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,033
Didn't I tell you that
creep was bad news?

131
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,766
You've got to help me.

132
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,533
I have nowhere else to turn.

133
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,966
You're my only hope.

134
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,933
Well, I don't think
it can get any worse.

135
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,966
I don't know how to thank you.

136
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,033
RANMA: Your grandma
was abducted?

137
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,533
Are you serious?

138
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:21,633
Mm-hmm.

139
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,466
And then they turned
their sights onto me.

140
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:26,733
But I bravely managed to escape
just in the nick of time.

141
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,766
But why was she kidnapped?

142
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,300
So they can take over the
School of Martial Arts Tea

143
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,300
ceremony.

144
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,166
Is that true?

145
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:40,600
Your Backyard is
aesthetically pleasing.

146
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,533
You'd better not
be messing with us.

147
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,200
No, please.

148
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
I could tell you who did it.

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Well, then, it shouldn't
be too hard to find her.

150
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,066
Tell us who did it!

151
00:07:50,166 --> 00:08:02,233
Uh, well-- it's so terrible,
I can't even say it!

152
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,800
Ugh.

153
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,500
I guess the best thing
is to see for ourselves.

154
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,833
Ranma, you're gonna go?

155
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:11,133
Well, I figure whoever could
kidnap that old grandma has

156
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,533
to be pretty tough.

157
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,200
And I just love a challenge.

158
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,600
Oh, thank you, Ranma.

159
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,466
Thank you!

160
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:17,633
This is wonderful.

161
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,933
Now we can start our
wedding plans, Akane.

162
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:20,515
Agh!

163
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,133
RANMA: Oh, man.

164
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,833
This place looks
completely deserted.

165
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,800
SENTARO: If the students find
out about the kidnapping,

166
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,033
it would cause turmoil.

167
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,766
AKANE: I guess you're right.

168
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:38,566
SENTARO: Come.

169
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,700
I'll show you Grandmama's room.

170
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,933
WOMAN: Where have you been?

171
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,233
Please, don't
scare me like that.

172
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,433
Oh, it's just the old
trio from last time.

173
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,033
Ranma, your manners!

174
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,100
So, Sentaro, I hope you haven't
said anything to your friends

175
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,300
that you shouldn't have.

176
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,633
Please forgive me.

177
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:03,866
But I did.

178
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:05,766
We came along with
him because we thought

179
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,433
we might be able to help.

180
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,233
We don't need any
help from you, girl.

181
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,700
This matter concerns
the Daimonji family,

182
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,566
and no one else.

183
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,333
It's none of your business.

184
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:17,700
Don't sweat it.

185
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,433
These are people who were able
to kidnap Sentaro's grandma.

186
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:25,433
There's no way Sentaro
could deal with them alone.

187
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:25,966
Mm-hmm.

188
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:26,866
Nincompoop!

189
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,433
Hey!

190
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,600
What did I do?

191
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,800
Goodness gracious.

192
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,933
What will become of
the Daimonji School

193
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:35,466
if you don't stand up and be
a man for once in your life?

194
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,133
WOMAN: Take a look at this.

195
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:37,674
Huh?

196
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
What are they?

197
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,833
The boar, the deer, and
the butterfly cards?

198
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,700
WOMAN: I found
them in this room.

199
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
From the Japanese card game?

200
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,600
Correct.

201
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,166
These depict Inoshishi the
boar, Sheikah the deer,

202
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,066
and Chocho the butterfly.

203
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,733
I didn't know that the
old bag liked to gamble.

204
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,566
Those cards you hold are a
challenge to you, Sentaro.

205
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,666
That's right.

206
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:05,100
From the Shadow School
of Martial Arts Tea.

207
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,466
You said Shadow School?

208
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,366
What the heck is that?

209
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,566
I've never heard
of this, either.

210
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,533
For centuries, martial
arts tea ceremony

211
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,333
was practiced by two
opposing schools.

212
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:20,466
One is the Daimonji School
of Martial Arts Tea Ceremony.

213
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:21,600
This you know.

214
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,900
The other school
of the tea ceremony

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,433
is the Miyako Oji School.

216
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,966
The Miyako Oji School.

217
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,200
[music playing]

218
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,266
Onward.

219
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,733
Go to it.

220
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:04,333
You see, these two schools have
fought over many generations,

221
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,966
trying to better the other over
years of training and practice.

222
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:22,266
This was one of the
most fearsome rivalries

223
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:23,800
in all Japan.

224
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,800
But after many
years of struggling,

225
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,633
they soon ran out of
money and disappeared.

226
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:33,366
But since then, the Miyako
Oji clan had gone underground

227
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,766
and has been continuing
to practice as the Shadow

228
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:38,366
School of Martial Arts Tea.

229
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:41,000
It has been a
long, terrible feud.

230
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,600
Sounds like a kids' fight.

231
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,566
The reason why they have
kidnapped the matriarch

232
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,000
of the Daimonji School--

233
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,266
--is so they can take over
our school and become the one

234
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:54,233
and only school of
martial arts tea ceremony.

235
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,133
But what do these carts mean?

236
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:01,233
Those cards represent the three
elders of the Shadow School.

237
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,733
Ino, the boar.

238
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,100
Sheikah, the deer.

239
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Cho, the butterfly.

240
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,766
So they are the ones who
kidnapped your grandma?

241
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:13,233
And that's why we don't
have time to waste.

242
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,133
That's right.

243
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,533
You must hurry.

244
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,800
You must go and show them that
the true school of martial arts

245
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,333
is the Daimonji School.

246
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,966
Uh, well, Sentaro?

247
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,033
So, are you coming?

248
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:26,574
Huh?

249
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,866
Unfortunately, I cannot.

250
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:33,833
What?

251
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:34,733
Huh?

252
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,274
Huh?

253
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:41,800
I can't believe this.

254
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,333
Are you too chicken to
save your own grandma?

255
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:45,733
Yeah.

256
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,266
Up to now, I was beginning to
think you were actually brave.

257
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,366
They cannot trick me.

258
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,533
What do you mean?

259
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,100
My grandmama was kidnapped
by the three elders

260
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,966
from my very own family.

261
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:58,866
What are you saying?

262
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,966
This is all just
an elaborate plan

263
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:02,433
they've devised to test me.

264
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:02,974
Huh?

265
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,233
[cackling]

266
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,433
SENTARO: I saw them
with my own eyes.

267
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,133
Well, I guess the
question is, can you

268
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,200
be sure that it was them?

269
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,766
Are you positive that it was?

270
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:15,133
Yes, I'm positive.

271
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,633
Then what's with all
the family feud stuff?

272
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,933
My grandmama is testing me.

273
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,133
She wants to see if I'm worthy
enough to carry on the school.

274
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,266
OK.

275
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:25,900
Then how do you explain
those cards you found?

276
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,500
You know, the deer, the
boar, and the butterfly?

277
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,533
I'm telling you, this whole
thing is just a pack of lies.

278
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:34,133
You said that your
life was in danger!

279
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,200
I overreacted.

280
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,433
Why, you--

281
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,400
The best thing for us to
do right now is nothing.

282
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,333
The most important
thing now is to show

283
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:44,600
that I won't easily fall
for their sinister schemes.

284
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,141
Ha ha-- ha!

285
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,833
So, do you think that he's
telling the truth this time,

286
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:55,966
Akane?

287
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,833
Oh, I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

288
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,300
Whoa!

289
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,266
Ugh.

290
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:04,233
Hey, look.

291
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,700
It's one of those old bags.

292
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,566
Are you all right?

293
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,333
[shouting]

294
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,133
Hey, what's going on?

295
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,066
[cackling]

296
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:27,266
Why, you-- ah!

297
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,133
[cackling]

298
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
Ranma, look at this.

299
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:48,166
I just can't figure this out.

300
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,866
So, how they doing?

301
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:50,933
They're sleeping.

302
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,300
The three of them
looked pretty serious

303
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,533
fighting those other three.

304
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,633
I guess Sentaro's grandmother
really was kidnapped.

305
00:14:58,733 --> 00:14:59,733
So what's the deal?

306
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:04,166
Say something!

307
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,766
SENTARO (VOICEOVER):
I'm going to do it.

308
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,900
I will be the one
to save my grandmama

309
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,666
and prove that Sentaro
Daimonji is truly a man.

310
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:37,566
Sentaro.

311
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,600
You need a little help?

312
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, do you?

313
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,366
Miss Akane, Ranma--

314
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:45,000
Hey, I don't think this is the
right time to be thanking us.

315
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,233
Right, Akane?

316
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:46,774
Yeah.

317
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:50,700
Kind words.

318
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,633
But I must thank you both.

319
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:53,866
For everything.

320
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:01,166
From my research, this is the
home of the Miyako Oji family.

321
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:01,766
Whoa.

322
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:03,500
Quite the digs.

323
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,133
I thought they were flat broke.

324
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,600
I'd say this place is like
10 times the size of yours.

325
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,800
My name is Sentaro Daimonji.

326
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,266
I demand to be heard!

327
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:14,166
Now open this door!

328
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,633
I command you to open it now!

329
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:17,866
[creaking]

330
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,274
What the--

331
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,266
Oh, man.

332
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:31,533
It looks like some
kind of giant maze.

333
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,533
Where's Sentaro's grandmother?

334
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,866
[laughter]

335
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,400
WOMAN: She is inside.

336
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,600
If you want to see
her, you must enter.

337
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,733
WOMAN: But first
you must negotiate

338
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,766
the Labyrinth of Confusion.

339
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,833
Hey, where are you?

340
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,433
Hm?

341
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,233
Leave them to me.

342
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,566
And you two, head for the house!

343
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,633
But-- but--

344
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,766
I think we should
listen to what he said.

345
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:56,833
Come on, let's go!

346
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:57,866
I'm so sorry.

347
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:59,266
You cannot pass.

348
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,833
If you wish to proceed,
you must first--

349
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,200
Defeat the three elders
of the Miyako Oji School

350
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,133
of Martial Arts Tea Ceremony!

351
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,500
Ahaha!

352
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,666
They look just like
our three elders.

353
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:11,933
Yeah, you're right.

354
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,866
Let's get it on, you
trading card witches!

355
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,866
OK, you two go on ahead.

356
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:17,733
All right.

357
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,600
Who's my first victim?

358
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,500
Listen, bub.

359
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,400
Don't you dare--

360
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,233
--underestimate--

361
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,366
--our power!

362
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:31,433
What happened to
staying seated?

363
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,466
Only the other school
worries about staying seated.

364
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:38,400
The Shadow School prefers to
have a more freestyle approach

365
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,266
to combat.

366
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,500
WOMAN: OK, girls.

367
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,766
Let's show him our stuff.

368
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:42,300
Hm?

369
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,133
Hiya!

370
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:46,466
This attack is old now-- oof!

371
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,007
Ahh!

372
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:51,433
Oh no.

373
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,133
WOMAN: If you move,
it will break.

374
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,366
Then you'll fall
right through the ice.

375
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,566
[laughter]

376
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:58,774
Impossible!

377
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,933
Ms. Akane, I'm sure we've
been this way before.

378
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,533
I wonder if she's even here.

379
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,566
If who's here?

380
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,500
Your grandma.

381
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,433
Who did you think I
was talking about?

382
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:15,100
Oh, right.

383
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,633
Grandmama.

384
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,400
I completely forgot.

385
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
How could you forget?

386
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
Whenever you are
near to me, Ms. Akane,

387
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,233
nothing else seems
to matter but you.

388
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,866
You're full of it.

389
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:29,333
But that's OK, because
as long as we're together,

390
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,933
I don't care if I fall
to the depths of he--

391
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:35,900
Fall by yourself!

392
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,033
Oh, that really hurt.

393
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:39,574
Huh?

394
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:43,800
Why, Grandmama!

395
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,500
That's it.

396
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,466
You had better keep running if
you know what's good for you,

397
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:52,007
sonny.

398
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:12,733
I could very easily have
escaped here any time

399
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,366
my little heart desired.

400
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:16,900
But I don't understand
why you didn't try.

401
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,166
Because I was waiting
for you to rescue me.

402
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:21,233
Can we please go home now?

403
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,800
Well, it isn't that easy.

404
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,233
There is still the little matter
of the feud between the two

405
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,966
families that has
to be cleared up.

406
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,766
And you must accept
their challenge

407
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:36,766
on behalf of the
entire Daimonji School.

408
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:38,233
What-- what do you mean?

409
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,200
But I still don't understand.

410
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,500
Well, as the only male
successor in our family,

411
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
it is up to you to
accept the challenge.

412
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,800
You're not serious?

413
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,133
Tell me you're not!

414
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,033
Yep, I'd say she's serious.

415
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,833
Good luck, Sentaro.

416
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,400
Please, allow me to
introduce your opponent

417
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,700
for the challenge.

418
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,533
Please enter.

419
00:19:58,633 --> 00:19:59,074
Huh?

420
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,933
WOMAN: Satsuki,
remove your hood.

421
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,800
She is next in line to carry
on the Shadow School of Martial

422
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,933
Arts Tea Ceremony.

423
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:21,533
Her name is Satsuki Miyako Oji.

424
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:24,566
Man, I think
Sentaro's in a coma.

425
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,566
Ye-- yeah.

426

[rooster crowing]

427
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,600
You are so beautiful.

428
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,500
Let's get married.

429
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,033
Then we can carry on both
schools of martial arts tea

430
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,300
ceremony together.

431
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,233
Mm-hmm.

432
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,500
What's going on?

433
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,100
Can't you see that
they're in love, Ranma?

434
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,866
Well, I must say,
my work is done.

435
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:15,400
Hey, Ranma, we got a letter
from Sentaro and Satsuki.

436
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,900
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I just wanted
to thank you for everything.

437
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,533
We've officially
announced our engagement,

438
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:24,833
although our paths shan't--

439
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,666
Well, I didn't think our
paths would e cross again.

440
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,900
I hope we're not imposing.

441
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,366
Why, you stupid moron!

442
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:34,733
I never wanna see
you, ever again!

AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Before I could react,

446
00:23:18,254 --> 00:23:19,554
I'd fallen off the balance beam.

447
00:23:19,654 --> 00:23:22,587
And now everyone's dragging
me off to Dr. Tofu's.

448
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:26,287
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Akane goes to the hospital.

449
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:28,121
We'll see you there.
