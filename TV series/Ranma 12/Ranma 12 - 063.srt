RANMA (VOICEOVER): Ranma goes
back to Jusenkyo at last!

00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,676
[crow cawing]

4
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:36,217
-Huh?

5
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,243
It's Jusenkyo!

6
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:00,176
Jusenkyo!

7
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:02,176
After all these years,
I finally made it!

8
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:04,543
At last, I can get
rid of my curse!

9
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,509
All right!

10
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:12,017
No.

11
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:14,776
No fair!

12
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:16,176
That's no fair!

13
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:20,809
-It's the middle of the night.

14
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,009
What's wrong with you?

15
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,243
-Huh?

16
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:25,443
It was just a dream.

17
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:27,309
-Stupid boy.

18
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:32,643
[snoring]

19
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,609
-Pop!

20
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,909
-Wha?

21
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,509
Snap out of it!

22
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:39,576
-But-- but Pop!

23
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:40,976
Jusenkyo was all dried up!

24
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:44,543
-It was what? [laughing] It's
just another silly dream, boy.

25
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:46,709
-But listen, if those
cursed springs dry up,

26
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,376
we're stuck with
these dumb bodies

27
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:50,043
for the rest of our lives!

28
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,443
-But it was just a dream.

29
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,376
-And if it wasn't?

30
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:54,576
-Hm.

31
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:56,709
Hm.

32
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:59,943
Then I guess we'll have
to do some research.

33
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:02,509
-All China Training
Grounds Travelogue?

34
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,609
Hm.

35
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:04,776
You think that book
will be able to tell us

36
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:05,876
what we're looking for?

37
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:07,176
-Hm.

38
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:10,243
-You better not say again
that you can't read Chinese.

39
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:10,809
-Ding dong!

40
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:15,809
-Well, if you couldn't
read it, why'd

41
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:19,043
you even bother looking
at it in the first place?

42
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:21,843
I guess the only thing
left is to go to China.

43
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:22,909
Pops, gimme cash.

44
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:23,676
-Foolish boy.

45
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,509
I'm way ahead of you.

46
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:29,276
Don't you think I plan
for every contingency?

47
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,209
-Whoa.

48
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:31,176
Way to go, Pop.

49
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:37,743
-Boy, do your stuff.

50
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,309
-328 yen?

51
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,576
Ugh!

52
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,676
-Now, don't you worry yourself
about your old dad, son.

53
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:45,676
Oh, sure, you're taking
his life savings,

54
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,243
but he'll muddle
through somehow.

55
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,343
Doesn't he always?

56
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:54,343
-Why I oughta--

57
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:54,943
-Boy, wait!

58
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:55,743
-Huh?

59
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:57,209
-I just got me an idea.

60

-[snoring]

61
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,209
-But what if he's
already thrown it away?

62
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:14,043
-Once that little troll
gets hold of something,

63
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,809
he never lets go of it.

64
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:20,276
-[snoring]

65
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:34,076
-Jeez, I didn't
need to see that.

66
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:34,617
-Eureka.

67
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:42,043
-Huh?

68
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:44,409
What do you want?

69
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,209
-Ha!

70
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:46,609
The old goat's magic mirror.

71
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,676
I bet he even forgot
that he had it.

72
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:50,876
-Now we can go
anywhere, anywhen,

73
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,776
and it won't cost
us a stinking yen.

74
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,476
-Aha!

75
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:58,776
Stealing an old man's magic
mirror while he sleeps!

76
00:05:58,876 --> 00:05:59,909
You oughta be ashamed.

77
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,243
At the very least, you
better take me with you.

78
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:05,176
-Quick, Pop, get the onion!

79
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:05,717
-The onion?

80
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,209
-[laughing]

81
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,743
-I wanna go 10 years
into the future.

82
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:21,209
-Wha?

83
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:24,709
-[screaming]

84
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:33,809
-Where the-- hey, we're in
the same place we started!

85
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:34,709
-I don't know.

86
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:37,143
Something seems strange.

87
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:39,543
-Now that you mention it, the
place does look kind of run

88
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:40,076
down.

89
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:40,517
-Yes!

90
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:41,309
I knew it!

91
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,509
We're 10 years into the future!

92
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:46,376
-Hush, somebody's coming.

93
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,209
-That's odd.

94
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:52,243
I could've sworn I
heard voices in here.

95
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:52,784
Honey!

96
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,709
-Honey?

97
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:57,509
-You see?

98
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:59,376
We are 10 years into the future.

99
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:01,643
Akane and I have become an item.

100
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:06,409
[laughter]

101
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,243
-Akane, where are you?

102
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,376
-Ryoga?

103
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:13,976
-So here's where you kids are.

104
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:17,276
Why don't you go ask
Grandpa to play with you?

105
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:21,709
[laughter]

106
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,009
-Somebody shoot me.

107
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,809
-Oh, Akane, how
could you betray me?

108
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:26,876
-Giddyup, horsie!

109
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:27,417
Giddyup!

110
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:31,309
-Again?

111
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,943
What the-- is that me?

112
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:36,443
-Panda!

113
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:39,409
Panda!

114
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:42,009
-Now boys, don't play too rough.

115
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:42,843
-That's right, kids.

116
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,843
Grandpa's an old panda.

117
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:47,576
-Anyway, dear, I'm off
to do some shopping.

118
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,509
Keep an eye on the
boys for me, will you?

119
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:51,309
-Piggyback ride!

120
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,009
Yeah, yeah!

121
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:52,909
-One at a time, kids.

122
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,243
I-- whoa!

123
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:05,476
-Well, now.

124
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:06,743
I guess that
answers the question

125
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:08,243
of whose kids they are.

126
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:08,776
-No fair!

127
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:09,709
No fair!

128
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:11,709
I don't want to
be old like that!

129
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:12,843
-You think I do?

130
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:14,576
-Well, hey, you guys,
what are we waiting for?

131
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:19,243
Let's get out of this crazy
future and go to Jusenkyo!

132
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:21,109
-Here you go, boy.

133
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,409
-Hey, that's enough already!

134
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,676
-I want to go back to
the same day we first

135
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:26,509
arrived at Jusenkyo!

136
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,043
-What-- no fair!

137
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,476
You stupid bird, come back here!

138
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,409
Huh?

139
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,743
Pop, come quick!

140
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:48,409
-Huh?

141
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:49,209
-Look!

142
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,209
Jusenkyo's right over there.

143
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:51,143
I'm sure of it!

144
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:53,609
-Huh?

145
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:54,676
-Well, I'll be.

146
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:56,676
If it isn't the Bayankala Range.

147
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,309
-What are we waiting for, pop?

148
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,809
Let's go!

149
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:00,609
-Not so fast!

150
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:01,176
-Huh?

151
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,276
-Now what is it?

152
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,143
-Look at that!

153
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,776
-We're almost there, boy.

154
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,576
-Are you sure you can read that?

155
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:17,276
-Oh, ye of little faith.

156
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:19,209
Of course I can't read it!

157
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,909
Oof!

158
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:21,809
Kicking your father.

159
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:22,976
You should be ashamed.

160
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,276
-Oh, shut up, old man.

161
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:26,676
-Why you little--

162
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:29,643
-Do you realize this means we
haven't fallen in Jusenkyo yet?

163
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:31,676
-True, but there's
still no time to lose.

164
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:33,076
We've got to stop them!

165
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:34,043
-Let's go.

166
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,209
-Hey, why do I gotta
help you stop them?

167
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,176
Why should I care if
they fall in or not?

168
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:44,776
-Because if you do, I'll set you
up with some girls' underwear.

169
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,443
That's why!

170
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:47,443
-Woohoo!

171
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:47,984
Yahoo!

172
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:54,709
-Come back, boy!

173
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,243
-This way to Jusenkyo.

174
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:57,825
Yah!

175
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:02,376
-I said wait up, boy!

176
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,509
-Nyah nyah, catch me if you can!

177
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:05,643
-Why you--

178
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,009
-That was close.

179
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:15,509
-When I catch you, I'm gonna--

180
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:18,176
-Hey, you went the wrong way!

181
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:19,476
-There goes that idea.

182
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,509
-OK, looks like it's up to me.

183
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:28,543
-Hahaha!

184
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:29,876
Whoa!

185
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:34,343
-[growling]

186
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:35,576
-What the heck are you?

187
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,576
-Handsome fellow for a panda.

188
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:43,243
You hungry, boy,
or is it just me?

189
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,976
-Yeah, I'm starving, actually.

190
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,143
It's been kind of slim
pickings lately, hasn't it?

191
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:55,343
-[growling]

192
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:57,143
-Come back here,
you pile of protein!

193
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,743
-So much for plan B. Well,
I guess it's all up to me.

194
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:22,898
-Come on, pop, slow
down a little, huh?

195
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:25,431
It's not like Jusenkyo's
gonna go anywhere.

196
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,698
-Foolish boy!

197
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,898
With it finally being so
close, how could you not run?

198
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:30,665
-Hey!

199
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,198
Hey, slow down, will you?

200
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:39,931
-Hm?

201
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,065
Boy, look!

202
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:41,965
-What is it, pop?

203
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:42,865
-Take a look at that!

204
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:49,265
-Is that Jusenkyo?

205
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:50,565
-You ready, Ranma?

206
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:52,298
-Oh yeah.

207
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:53,265
-Help me!

208
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,531
-Hey.

209
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,465
Are you all right?

210
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,431
RANMA (VOICEOVER): It's
a kind of weird feeling,

211
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,731
looking at yourself.

212
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:07,698
-What's this?

213
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,831
Boy, that girl
looks just like you.

214
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:10,831
-Oh, yeah, right.

215
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,798
--[nervous laughter]
Oh, my stomach!

216
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:18,931
-Gee, lady, when's the
last time you ate anything?

217
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,065
-I was saving this for
an emergency, but here.

218
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:23,798
-[screaming]

219
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:24,598
-What's the matter?

220
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:25,798
You don't like snake?

221
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:28,131
-I thought I told you get
rid of that thing, pop.

222
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,865
What are you still
carrying it around for?

223
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,398
-Let's get a move on, boy.

224
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:32,331
-Right behind you!

225
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:32,998
-But I--

226
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:34,331
-Now what?

227
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,965
-I'm being pursued
by some bad guys.

228
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:39,831
I could be wrong, but I think
their camp's back there.

229
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:42,165
-Sorry, lady, but
we're headed thisaway.

230
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:45,198
-Well, you can come with us
to Jusenkyo, if you want.

231
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,298
-And why the heck do you
want to go there, you morons?

232
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:50,798
-Hey, there's no
need to be rude.

233
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:51,831
Shall we go, pop?

234
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:52,698
-But you can't!

235
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:53,398
Come back!

236
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:55,465
There could be bad guys!

237
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,931
Ugh, for crying out loud!

238
00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:58,765
Huh?

239
00:12:58,865 --> 00:12:59,306
-Ranma!

240
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,065
-We ain't got time for that, OK?

241
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:04,731
-Ranma, baby!

242
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:05,931
How long's it been?

243
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:06,998
-Not long enough.

244
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:07,765
-Wait!

245
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:08,998
-What?

246
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:11,198
-Why don't you let your old
gramps handle this, huh?

247
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:14,831
I's got me an idea.

248
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:15,898
-Listen, old man.

249
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:17,598
Once we get to Jusenkyo,
you're gonna pay!

250
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,598
-Yeah, right, boy.

251
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:25,631
But you're about 100 years
early for this old ma-- man!

252
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:29,098
-Heya, Genma.

253
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:30,165
How's it going?

254
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:32,431
-M-m-m-master!

255
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:33,898
GENMA (VOICEOVER): It can't be.

256
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:37,931
We left him resting peacefully
in the mountains of Hida.

257
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:38,631
-Hey, pop.

258
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:39,665
Who's the old man?

259
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:40,865
-Show some respect, boy!

260
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:41,431
-Ow!

261
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:42,665
What did I do?

262
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:46,498
-M-master, I never expected
to see you-- I mean, uh.

263
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:49,931
-Genma, I bring you
tidings of great joy.

264
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:50,831
-You do?

265
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,231
-You see this?

266
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,931
Genma Saotome, on this
day, you are hereby

267
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:58,665
graduated from the Anything
Goes School of Martial Arts

268
00:13:58,765 --> 00:13:59,765
with honors!

269
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:01,565
In other words, you are
no longer a student.

270
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:04,231
You may now return to Japan
a fully accredited member

271
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:07,031
of the Anything Goes School,
free to do as you please.

272
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:10,198
So you see, there's no need
to go to Jusenkyo at all.

273
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:12,498
In fact, I'd turn
back-- how dare

274
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:14,531
you treat your master that way?

275
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:16,098
-Be quiet, you impostor!

276
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:17,531
-I-impostor?

277
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:20,465
-My real master would
never be that nice.

278
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:23,098
Why, he hasn't a kind
bone in his entire body!

279
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,398
He lives to drag others
down to his own level,

280
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,098
even to the depths of hell!

281
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,898
My master would never do
anything to make another happy!

282
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,231
-That's not true!

283
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,831
-So who is he?

284
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:34,265
-One of the little
people, maybe?

285
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:35,065
Doing mischief?

286
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,231
-I am not a little person!

287
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,331
-Say, boy, you hungry?

288
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:40,698
-Sure I am, pop.

289
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:43,531
-What do you say
we make us a stew?

290
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:44,998
-Now we're cooking.

291
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:48,398
-[crying]

292
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,798
-The nerve of that
jerk, eh, pop?

293
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:55,798
-You gotta get up pretty
early in the morning

294
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,031
to fool Genma Saotome.

295
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,598
[laughing]

296
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,231
-Those miserable little cowards!

297
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,631
Why, if they hadn't teamed
up on me, I would've--

298
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,531
--[inaudible], we come to the
training ground of the cursed

299
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:15,231
spring Jusenkyo.

300
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,331
-This is it, boy.

301
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:17,298
Are you ready?

302
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:19,098
-This place ain't so impressive.

303
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:20,731
-You very strange one, sirs.

304
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,498
Yes?

305
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:23,531
This place very dangerous.

306
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,131
Nobody use now.

307
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:28,031
Is more than 100 spring
here, and each one

308
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,665
have own tragedy happen there.

309
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,065
-Ranma, follow me.

310
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:35,398
-Right behind you!

311
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:37,565
-Uh, sirs, what are doing?

312
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:38,998
I no finish my tragic story!

313
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:40,198
You no go there!

314
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:42,565
-I won't go easy on you.

315
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,198
-That's just the way I like it.

316
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:48,898
-Please, sirs!

317
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:51,398
Very bad you fall in spring!

318
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:58,598
-That starnge.

319
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:01,131
Why do you think they did
not fall in cursed spring?

320
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:05,639
-Whoa!

321
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:12,065
-[shouting]

322
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:17,865
-Say, Pop, let's stop now, OK?

323
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:18,998
-Sure, why not?

324
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:20,965
I was getting kind
of bored anyway.

325
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,365
-Good, good.

326
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:27,131
You keep going, and sooner or
later, someone fall in spring.

327
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:30,531
Was somebody there?

328
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:31,898
-I knew it!

329
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:34,131
So it was you who kept
us from falling in?

330
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:35,065
-Aiya?

331
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:35,898
-Aw, man.

332
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:37,065
What a letdown.

333
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,465
Legendary training
grounds my butt.

334
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,398
-Well, we'll just have
to find another place

335
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,565
to train, eh, boy?

336
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:46,631
-But sirs, it no was my fault!

337
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:48,331
Sirs, wait!

338
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:50,698
It no was me, I-I tell you!

339
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:52,365
Sirs!

340
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:53,731
-All right!

341
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:56,131
Those two losers will never
have to go to Jusenkyo again!

342
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:59,565
You better enjoy being a panda
while you still can, pop,

343
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,498
because after this,
it looks like Saotome

344
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:03,265
and son are back to normal.

345
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:05,031
-Does this mean
that you won't turn

346
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,531
into a girl anymore, Ranma?

347
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:12,065
Does this mean these will
be gone with you, too?

348
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,598
No, no, no! [crying]

349
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,431
-Get off of me,
you little pervert!

350
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:19,631
-[screaming]

351
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,831
-Shall we go back to
our own world now, pop?

352
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:25,398
Aw, not the onion again.

353
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:25,939
-Ranma!

354
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,131
No!

355
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:32,231
Don't leave me!

356
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:32,772
Traitors!

357
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:34,498
Traitors!

358
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:35,598
You left me behind!

359
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:50,198
-[panting]

360
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:53,498
-I guess this means we
finally made it back, huh?

361
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:54,365
Hey!

362
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:56,498
Pop, you know what this means?

363
00:17:56,598 --> 00:18:00,431
-Even when we're soaking wet,
our bodies no longer change.

364
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:02,898
[laughing]

365
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,398
-[laughing] All right!

366
00:18:06,498 --> 00:18:08,065
All right!

367
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:08,606
Woohoo!

368
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,865
-They'll be here any minute.

369
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:18,465
The two of them have been on
a training journey, actually.

370
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,331
I hear they even did
some training in China.

371
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:22,965
-Ooh, China.

372
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:25,031
-So they trained in China.

373
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:25,698
Wow.

374
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:27,065
Big deal.

375
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,065
-So how old is Ranma, father?

376
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:30,365
-Is he cute?

377
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:33,131
-Younger men are so young.

378
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:35,198
-What kind of guy is
this Ranma, anyway?

379
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:39,898
-[laughing] I-- I don't know.

380
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:41,731
-You don't know?

381
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:45,198
-I've never met
the lad, you see.

382
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:45,739
-I'm home!

383
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:51,798
-Ooh, it must be Ranma!

384
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,598
-Ah, Saotome, my friend.

385
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:54,565
How we've been waiting!

386
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:55,698
-Please let him be older.

387
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:58,165
-I think I hate him already.

388
00:18:58,265 --> 00:18:59,231
-Yo, Akane!

389
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:00,931
-Get me a drink, will
you, Kasumi, dear?

390
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:06,331
-What the--

391
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,798
-So you're Ranma?

392
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:12,431
-Huh?

393
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:13,698
Ha ha, Mr. Tendo.

394
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:14,865
Very funny.

395
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,431
-Hey, don't talk to
my dad like that!

396
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,365
-Butt out, will you?

397
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,331
You'll never catch a
husband at this rate.

398
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:23,331
-Well, for a complete
and total stranger,

399
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:26,131
you sure act like you've been
around this family before.

400
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,165
-So I'm a complete and
total stranger, then, am I?

401
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:30,631
I've been living
in this house ever

402
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:33,065
since-- hey, Akane, what
happened to that short haircut

403
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:34,065
you had?

404
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:36,631
-It's always been
long, you moron!

405
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:40,631
Besides, who are you to call
me by my first name, anyway?

406
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:44,431
-Psst, old man, come here!

407
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,465
I think maybe we came
back to our own world

408
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:48,731
a little too early, don't you?

409
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,098
-Looks like it.

410
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:52,431
That would explain why no one
here seems to recognize us,

411
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:53,331
anyway.

412
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:54,998
-What a pain in the butt.

413
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:56,098
-Don't worry, boy.

414
00:19:56,198 --> 00:20:00,431
They'll just get to
know us all over again.

415
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:04,165
[clears throat] I'm Genma
Saotome, and here's my son.

416
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:04,965
-Ranma Saotome.

417
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,298
It's, uh, nice to meet you.

418
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:10,365
-Come on, put me down, will you?

419
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:12,365
-Sounds like more visitors.

420
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:13,598
-What's all the fuss about?

421
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:20,998
-[gasp]

422
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:22,465
-Mm?

423
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:23,931
-Oh, come on, pop!

424
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:24,931
Put me down!

425
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:27,398
You're scaring them spitless!

426
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:29,365
-Who is it?

427
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:30,998
It can't be!

428
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,431
-Augh!

429
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,198
-Friends of yours, daddy?

430
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,831
-Not-- not mine.

431
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:37,031
Saotome, speak up!

432
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:39,365
Tell them that these are
your friends, will you?

433
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,998
-I, uh, I've never
seen them before.

434
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:45,198
-[cackling]

435
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:46,665
-M-m-m-master!

436
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:47,598
-Whoa!

437
00:20:47,698 --> 00:20:49,465
-If you hadn't
let me back there,

438
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,331
things now wouldn't
be so messed up!

439
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:54,298
Listen here, Ranma,
no matter what you do,

440
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:56,231
you can never change history!

441
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:59,165
Don't you know that? [cackling]

442
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:01,131
-But-- but that's no fair.

443
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:05,031
After everything we went through
to get here, it's not fair!

444
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,465
It's not fair!

445
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,865
-It's the middle of the night.

446
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:11,965
What's wrong with you?

447
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:12,698
-Wha-- huh?

448
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:13,765
Pop!

449
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:14,631
It's Jusenkyo!

450
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,731
I-- ow!

451
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:18,365
-Don't you realize
what time it is?

452
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:19,731
-I'm trying to sleep here.

453
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:20,798
Do you mind?

454
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:22,098
-Ugh, what's the matter
with you, anyway?

455
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:26,498
-Now I get it.

456
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:28,898
I was dreaming, right?

457
00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:30,231
Oh!

458
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,165
[laughter]

459
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:35,531
Wait!

460
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:38,931
What if this is a dream,
and I'm dreaming right now?

461
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,059
[theme song]

462
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:16,880
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Because of you,

463
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,680
the English version
of Ranma 1/2 has

464
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,080
become one of the most
popular anime series ever!

465
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,547
And coming soon,
there's gonna be

466
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,613
yet another whole new season.

467
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,947
If you thought we had some
crazy characters last time,

468
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:27,913
you just wait!

469
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:31,513
We'll see you there.
