Comes Ranma's Mom."

CLOWN: Hurry!

00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:47,733
Hurry!

00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:48,933
Step right up!

00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,566
The greatest show in
Furinkan is about to begin--

00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,700
with thrill rides for the
brave, side shows the curious,

and free balloons for the kids.

Hurry!

Hurry!

Step right up!

12
00:01:58,633 --> 00:01:59,233
Here you go, kid.

13
00:01:59,333 --> 00:01:59,933
Yellow OK?

14
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:03,248
What?

15
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:05,574
-En garde!

16
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:06,166
-Oh yeah?

17
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:06,800
Take this.

[grunting]

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,100
-Say uncle!

20
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,166
Say uncle!

21
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,066
Uncle!

22
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,600
You've been a bad boy, Ranma.

23
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,533
Haven't you realized yet
that making me punish you

24
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:35,233
is like punishing my so-- Oh!

25
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,433
-No can do, Pops!

26
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:40,866
-Hey, haven't you ever
heard of recycling?

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,133
-Sure I have, old man.

28
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,733
Metal and glass separate, right?

29
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,966
Be seeing you.

30
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,400
-No so fast, boy.

31
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,100
-Do you think you're
poor old dad has finally

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,733
lived to see the day when his
one and only son has finally

33
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,533
become a man?

34
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,633
-Yeah, yeah.

35
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,666
Can we go home and
get some food now?

36
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:08,207
-Gotcha.

37
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,366
-I knew it!

38
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,166
I just knew you were
going to try that.

39
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,966
-Look, a 100 yen piece.

40
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:16,300
-Look, right in front
of you, a 500 yen piece.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,533
-It must have fallen out of my--

42
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,033
-Oh, like you really
have that much.

43
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,633
-Think you can take me, huh?

44
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:24,666
-You know it old man.

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,733
-Why you gotta be
so disrespectful?

46
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,733
-Hey, you're the
one who started it.

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,100
-Oh.

[grunting]

00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,133
-Uh, Ranma, would you
mind moving from my seat?

50
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,500
-Haven't you two been
fighting long enough?

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,866
-Why don't ask him?

52
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,566
-As soon as he
apologizes, I'll--

53
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,966
-I what?!

54
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:52,800
-I'm waiting.

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,966
WOMAN (OUTSIDE): Anyone home?

56
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:55,866
KASUMI: Coming.

00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,500
[growling]

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,166
-Mr. Saotome, you
have a visitor.

59
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,166
-Who, me?

60
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,933
-Knowing you, it's
a bill collector.

61
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,666
-That would not surprise me.

62
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,033
KASUMI: Actually, it's an
attractive older woman.

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,166
-Say it ain't so.

64
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,700
There's got to be
some kind of mistake.

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,700
Right, Kasumi?

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,333
My old friend,
Saotome, the recipient

67
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,033
of an attractive female visitor?

68
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,466
Has the world gone mad?

69
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:18,266
-Gee, Daddy.

70
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,033
What's the matter?

71
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,600
Are you jealous?

72
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,033
-Well, um, [clears throat],
um, you know.

73
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,866
HAPPOSAI: What's with all
the bowing and scraping?

74
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:37,300
Why don't you show
some guts for a change?

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,466
Well, are you a man
or are you a mouse?

76
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,366
Personally, mice have
their advantages.

77
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,066
-Cut it out, will you?

78
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,933
-You won't let me
speak with him then?

79
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,166
-Huh?

80
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,266
-I'm sorry, but I'm not
sure it's such a good idea.

81
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:55,000
-But I-- Ranma, dear,
I need to talk to you.

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,233
-Hey, why'd she
just call you dear?

83
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,633
-Jeez, what are
you asking me for?

84
00:04:58,733 --> 00:04:59,266
-P-- please!

85
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,166
Wait!

86
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,966
Ranma's in the dark about this.

87
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:05,266
It'll be better if I can
break it to him in my own way.

88
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:06,433
-I'll only take a minute.

89
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,633
Please, you've got to--

90
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:08,700
-I'll let you talk to him.

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,733
OK?

92
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,633
Just let me soften
him up a bit first.

93
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,466
-Dear!

94
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,933
GENMA: Oh, for crying out loud.

95
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,466
Ranma, I gotta go
out for a while.

96
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,766
I'll explain when I get back.

97
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,033
WOMAN: Ranma, dear!

98
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,833
-So what was that all about?

99
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,000
Whatever it was, he
is up to no good.

100
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,733
HAPPOSAI: His past has
caught up with him.

101
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,566
Of course, Genma was but
a mere youth at the time.

102
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,433
As I've told you many
another time, the three of us

103
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,166
walked the earth in order
to polish our skill.

104
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:54,066
As it so happened,
Genma fell in love.

105
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,300
The name of the young maiden was
Sakura, as in cherry blossom.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,166
Nature took it's
course, and in due time

107
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,000
the beautiful
Sakura was delivered

108
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,033
of a healthy baby
boy whose name was--

109
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,400
-Wait, you don't have to say.

110
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,866
It was Ranma, wasn't it?

111
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:09,966
-Huh?

112
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,400
-Fate, however, had
not finished with it.

113
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,100
The girl's parents
opposed match and decided

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,933
that they should be separated.

115
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,700
Genma and the baby
went back on the road

116
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,300
while Sakura stayed
behind, forever by herself.

117
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,766
Their union was
reckless and impulsive.

118
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:34,166
However, I cannot find it
in my heart to blame them.

119
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,466
-Odd how I've never
heard that story before.

120
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,366
-Yeah, you know, I'm
surprised that Pop never

121
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,033
said nothing about it.

122
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,933
-Oh Ranma, it's it obvious?

123
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,433
I'm sure he just wanted
to spare you the misery.

124
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:46,800
-Well, jeez.

125
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,433
I mean, if he was going to go
to all the trouble of being

126
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,466
a single father, at least he
got to sow the wild oats first,

127
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,166
right?

128
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:52,900
Don't you agree Akane?

129
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:55,766
-Be quiet.

130
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:59,033
-In other words, she has come
to reclaim her long lost son.

131
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:02,266
-No wonder she was so
desperate to see Ranma again.

132
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,933
-How could she remarry
after something like that?

133
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,400
Imagine being alone
all these years.

134
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,166
-We've got to do
something to help her.

135
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,533
-I agree.

136
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,500
Somehow we've got to bring those
three together as a family.

137
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:18,833
-You can count on me.

138
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,100
-On me too, son.

139
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,233
-On my too.

140
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,833
-Why, you must be the
luckiest boy on Earth.

141
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,466
-Hip hip hooray for me.

142
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:26,400
-Oh, you cynic, you.

143
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,266
-Stop wasting time
and go straight

144
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,066
to your mother's bosom.

145
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,433
RANMA: Akane, wait up!

146
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Hey, I said wait up.

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,066
-Hey, Akane.

148
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,133
There's a new
movie, just opened.

149
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,166
Do you want to go see it?

150
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:44,707
-Mm.

151
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:47,707
-Huh?

152
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,066
-Jeez, Akane.

153
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,333
If that's how you're going to
be, next time I won't bother.

154
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,033
-I know it's hard
on you right now,

155
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,133
but don't you think
it might be smart

156
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:59,066
for you to lie low for a while?

157
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,866
-Why are you making such
a big deal out of this?

158
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,300
TATEWAKI: I heard
the whole thing.

159
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,333
If you think to escape the
rightful wrath of my most

160
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:12,033
puissant self with your feeble
plots and schemes, think again.

161
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,033
-I'm not trying to--

162
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,733
-I don't care what
trouble you're in.

163
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,633
You're not leaving until
we settle the score.

164
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:17,700
You got that?

165
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,033
-Ryoga.

166
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,600
MOUSSE: Yeah, who gave you
permission to go sneaking off?

167
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:25,600
-Listen up.

168
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,333
I don't know what's gotten
into you all of a sudden,

169
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,433
but if you want
to fight, come on.

170
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,800
KODACHI: Ranma, honey!

171
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:33,966
-Ranma, honey, is it true?

172
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,633
Are you really going away
to live with your mother?

173
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,066
-Some day, she be
Shampoo mother too.

174
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,900
Why you no introduce
so far, Ranma?

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,433
-I'm not in the mood for--

176
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:46,800
-You know I'd follow you
anywhere, don't you darling?

177
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,333
-Come on.

178
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:48,300
Let him go.

179
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,366
He's turning blue.

180
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,466
-Silence, you insolent wench.

181
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,400
What knowest you of a
woman's finer feelings?

182
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,333
-Plenty, you snob.

183
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,633
-After all, he was
my fiance first.

184
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,100
-What you talking?

185
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,500
He belong Shampoo
as much as you.

186
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:01,933
-I can't breathe.

187
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:02,900
Akane, help me.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,033
I can't breathe.

189
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,466
-But Ranma, why do you
need me when you've got

190
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:09,233
those three cute fiances.

191
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,133
TATEWAKI (VOICEOVER):
Now wait a second.

192
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,933
If he's going to
be leaving anyway,

193
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,300
why don't we let him go?

194
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,700
Once the current Saotome
is out of the picture,

195
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,033
Akane Tendo will become
mine-- physically, mentally,

196
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:25,574
inevitably.

197
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:31,533
-He must be set free!

198
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,100
-He must be kept here!

199
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,866
-Give him liberty!

200
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,066
-Or give death.

201
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,100
It don't matter because--

202
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
-It works either way.

203
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
All for one, and one for all.

204
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,266
-We guys gotta stick together.

205
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:43,233
-Will you please
quiet before I hit you

206
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,933
upside the head with my spatula?

207
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:46,300
-Let's solve this
democratically.

208
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,166
All those in favor of
Ranma taking a hike,

209
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,366
raise your hands.

210
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,933
Sorry girls, the majority rules.

211
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,800
-Oh, give us a break.

212
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,800
-What a bunch of losers.

213
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,566
How are you gonna beat
me when you can't even

214
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,466
beat a bunch of girls?

215
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,700
-Ranma, darling?

216
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,300
-Ranma, honey!

217
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,266
-Ranma!

218
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,933
HAPPOSAI: Stop right there.

219
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,466
-Grandfather Happosai?

220
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:11,900
-Listen here, girls.

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,633
Helping to choose a
future daughter-in-law

222
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,566
is the sacred duty of
all Japanese mothers.

223
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,166
Don't tell me you're trying
to take that privilege away

224
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:20,266
from her.

225
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,700
-Do you really think
she'd choose one of us?

226
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,900
-I'd say that's
entirely up to you

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,900
and how willing you are to be
an obedient daughter-in-law.

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,800
-I will be the most dutiful
daughter who ever lived.

229
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,600
-I'll set a world
record for humility.

230
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,500
-Shampoo make Ranma proud.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
HAPPOSAI: Listen
carefully, girls.

232
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:44,900
In order to better your chances,
the role of Ranma's mother

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,033
will be played by yours truly.

234
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:47,700
To work!

235
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,766
Oh my, my.

236
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:52,333
Would you look at that?

237
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,600
Girls these days, I tell you.

238
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,066
Nothing wrong with them a
good switching wouldn't cure.

239
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:02,300
[panting]

240
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,300
Chop chop, girls.

241
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,000
The floor isn't going
to clean itself.

242
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,433
[panting]

243
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,066
Over here.

244
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,466
You missed a spot.

245
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,633
What about over here?

246
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,933
And what are you
doing here, my child?

247
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,133
-What do you think?

248
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,433
-Well, bless your heart, dear.

249
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,933
And the very best
of luck to you.

250
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,100
Why aren't you working?

251
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,133
-I'm done.

252
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,200
-What, already?

253
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,866
You can't have done
a very thorough job.

254
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh yes, well what
about this, then?

255
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,233
What's this I see?

256
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,500
You're not disrespecting
me, are you?

257
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,500
I'd simply hate to pull
you from the competition.

258
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:46,200
-What a lucky girl am I to
have a mother-in-law who

259
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,900
cares for me so.

260
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,133
-That's it, girls.

261
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:51,200
Put some back into it.

262
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,966
If there's one thing
mothers-in-law hate,

263
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,700
it's sloppy housekeeping.

264
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,700
Why, when I was a
girl, we didn't even

265
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
have feather dusters.

266
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,033
We had to go out into the forest
and fetch ourselves pine bows.

267
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,100
True, the sap stuck
to everything.

268
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,700
But it sure did smell nice.

269
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,933
[laughing]

270
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,433
RANMA: Aw, man.

271
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,833
I thought they'd never go home.

272
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,833
What was the old
freak thinking anyway?

273
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:27,166
AKANE: You've got more
important things to worry about.

274
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:27,733
-Oh yeah?

275
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,133
Like what?

276
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:32,700
-Like maybe the fact that your
mother seems to want you back.

277
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,333
And it's only natural she'd
want you to go live with her.

278
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,433
Will you quit that?

279
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,633
She's not going to
go away, you know?

280
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:43,533
-Yeah, yeah.

281
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:44,866
I know.

282
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:47,300
-Then why won't you agree to
meet with her and talk over

283
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,000
your--

284
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,766
-Is that what you want?

285
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:55,266
If it is, I'm sure that I--
th-- th-- that we can-- is

286
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:56,833
that what you want
me to do, Akane?

287
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:57,374
Leave?

288
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,500
-It's just that your
mother hasn't seen you--

289
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,233
-Fine then.

290
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,000
I read you loud and clear.

291
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
I should've known an
uncute girl like you--

292
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
-Oh, here we go again.

293
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,833
Whenever you get
upset about something,

294
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,666
I end up being called uncute.

295
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:14,000
It's none of my business
what you do anyway,

296
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,433
so you may as well live
with whoever you want.

297
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,066
-Fine then.

298
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:17,866
Maybe I will.

299
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,500
[howling]

300
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,666
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I'll never
fall asleep at this rate.

301
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,633
[grunting]

302
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,100
AKANE: Ranma.

303
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,666
-It's hard on him too, you know.

304
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,766
He tries hard to
hide it, but I'm

305
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,266
sure it must be getting to him.

306
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:01,500
-Hey, and where the heck
have you been all this time?

307
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,333
-If I had to guess, I'd
say on a quest seeking

308
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:05,800
that which he most desires.

309
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,566
-Is it me, or is he
putting on weight?

310
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,633
-One might think he's
binging in secret, hmm?

311
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,133
-Thanks for the food.

312
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,041
-Huh?

313
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,766
-[sigh]

314
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,866
-Hey, where are you going?

315
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:23,800
Hm?

316
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,766
Oh!

317
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:27,133
-Mr. Saotome seems sad.

318
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,566
-Tell me, girls,
how would you feel

319
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,766
about asking Ranma's mother
to come live with us?

320
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,866
-Why, daddy, you are a genius.

321
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,466
That way he and Akane
needn't be separated.

322
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:38,766
Right, Akane?

323
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:41,200
-Well, I'd say that's not
really my decision to make.

324
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,533
Right, Dad?

325
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,600
-The next and then
is a man-to-man talk.

326
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,933
-This I've gotta hear.

327
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,733
-I can't take it anymore.

328
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,800
Pop, it's time that you and I--

329
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,033
-Think before you speak, son.

330
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:05,266
-But why can't I?

331
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,300
-It's not that I don't know
these past few days have

332
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,900
been rough on you, son.

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,533
But they've been pretty
hard on your dad too.

334
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:14,200
You say you can't take it
anymore, but what about him?

335
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,500
Have you bothered to think
what it's been like for him,

336
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,400
knowing that your mother was
back but afraid to tell you.

337
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Please, son, do the right
thing and let me handle this.

338
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:30,333
Fine weather we're
having, hey, Saotome?

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,300
Look the truth is, it's about
this woman from the other day.

340
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,233
Most you really go
off with her or--

341
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,266
-[snore]

342
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,066
-It's like that.

343
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,600
You intend to help out
with the family business?

344
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,733
Then I guess our
job is to find a way

345
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,266
to accept your
decision no matter

346
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,366
how much we don't like it.

347
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:59,533
-Mr. Tendo, I'm sorry, but
I'm not just going to sit here

348
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:00,666
and listen to all of this--

349
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,433
-[snoring]

350
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,833
-That's the old man for you.

351
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,133
-[groaning] Saotome!

352
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,500
Why is it that every time
I put myself out for you,

353
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,700
you end up making
me wish I hadn't?

354
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,300
-Hm?

355
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,833
What the heck kind of bamboo
leaf is this supposed to be?

356
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,300
-I'd say it must be imported
all the way from China.

357
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,600
-Don't want to be late
for a very important date.

358
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:30,900
-What date is that?

359
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,766
-I've got some talking
of my own to do.

360
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,633
-Dad told me the whole thing.

361
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,433
Guess you'll be
moving out soon, huh?

362
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,266
-The old man will anyway.

363
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:51,000
-There you go again, putting
on that stupid Mr. Cool act

364
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,533
like it really impresses anyone.

365
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,266
-Listen, I'm not
trying to impress any--

366
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:55,533
-Then what are you doing?

367
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,333
-Why do you even
care anyway, huh?

368
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,066
-I don't for you, but your dad--

369
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,933
-Jeez, why don't you just
go and marry him then, huh?

370
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:02,900
-OK, Ranma.

371
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,500
Now you're really being stupid.

372
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,433
-Ranma!

373
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:06,366
-Ranma, honey!

374
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:07,300
-Ranma, darling!

375
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,733
-Take Shampoo with you.

376
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:11,733
Great-Grandma to say OK.

377
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,500
-I can run my shop
from anywhere.

378
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,533
You know that.

379
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,000
-So long as we have
love on our side,

380
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,566
no matter how strict your dear
mama may be, we can't fail.

381
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,900
-Oh, just what I needed.

382
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,900
Man, as if one girl yelling
at me wasn't enough.

383
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,166
-Maybe we just fight to
decide once and for all.

384
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:30,733
-Winner goes off to live
with Ranma and his mother?

385
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,200
Sounds good.

386
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,566
-Ranma, darling, it'll
take but a moment.

387
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,966
-Hey, doesn't anyone here
want to ask me what I think?

388
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:38,507
-Kiai!

389
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:42,933
-Just leave me out of it, OK?

390
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,400
Just settle it
amongst yourselves.

391
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,400
Hey, watch it.

392
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:45,933
Ow!

393
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,366
[screaming]

394
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,866
-What have I ever
done to deserve this?

395
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:00,766
Huh?

396
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,366
Hi, Pop.

397
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:05,333
-It's time we had a
father-to-son talk.

398
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,000
-Gee, no kidding, genius.

399
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,533
Tell me, why did it take you
until now to figure that out,

400
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,074
huh?

401
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:13,374
-Ranma?

402
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,600
-Tell me, Ranma, have you any
memories of the woman at all?

403
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,366
-It's got nothing
to do with me, Pop.

404
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,033
So why don't you just
leave me out of it, OK?

405
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,333
-Son, you couldn't
be more wrong.

406
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:29,066
As it turns out, you've got
everything to do with it.

407
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,733
Then you mean, you
and her aren't gonna--

408
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,500
-Oh, no, no, no.

409
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,066
Helping her get you
is all I'm good for.

410
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,666
-Did-- did she really
say that to you?

411
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:43,133
-Son, I meant to
keep you out of it.

412
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,100
I really did.

413
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,866
Then she started crying.

414
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:48,666
And then I knew
what I had to do.

415
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:51,400
She got through to me, boy.

416
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,633
Promise you'll meet her.

417
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,400
Just listen to what
she has to say.

418
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
Then if you don't like
it, you can just--

419
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,500
-I--

420
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,866
-You mean you'll do it?

421
00:18:58,966 --> 00:18:59,633
You will?

422
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,400
I don't know what to say.

423
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,766
-[gasp]

424
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:05,300
-I'm your son, ain't I?

425
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,166
This is where she works?

426
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:23,133
-Yup.

427
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:23,666
-Yoohoo!

428
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:25,433
Ranma, dear.

429
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:26,366
Over here, sweetheart.

430
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,333
So does this mean
you'll come with me?

431
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:35,033
-I-- uh, I'm kind of not
sure how I should feel.

432
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,066
I mean, I'm glad
you're Mom and stuff,

433
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,566
but it's kind of
hard to leave where

434
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,500
I am since I don't
really know you.

435
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,100
-Ranma, you make as much
sense as your father.

436
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,366
Speaking of whom, there
he is now over there.

437
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:47,866
-Hey, panda, you're gonna have
to do better than that if you

438
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,533
want this bamboo.

439
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:50,866
-Hey, it's that same bamboo.

440
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,033
-Ranma, think about it.

441
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,633
Have you any idea
how much people

442
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,466
would pay to see a
shape-changing girl or panda?

443
00:19:58,566 --> 00:19:59,900
-Girls being
preferred, of course.

444
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,133
-Is that what you
call performing art?

445
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:06,966
Do it again!

446
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,266
Don't you give me that.

447
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:10,833
I, sir, am an artist.

448
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:14,633
-Hey, what's going on here?

449
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,833
It says, it was your ability
to change into a girl

450
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:21,000
when splashed with cold
water that the circus wanted

451
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,033
all along.

452
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:23,633
Knowing that you
were also needed

453
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:26,733
to carry on the Anything
Goes school of martial arts,

454
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,666
I tried to take your place.

455
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,666
But unless they can
balance atop balls,

456
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:33,433
it seems they have no interest
in transforming pandas.

457
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,300
Why, I ought--

458
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:41,033
[screaming]

459
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,900
Now tell me what you're
really up to, Pop, or I'll--

460
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,966
-Ta-da!

461
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,733
There it is-- the
boy turns into a girl

462
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,666
when splashed with
cold water trick.

463
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:55,266
Name your price Mr. You
can have all the bamboo

464
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:56,666
leaves that you want.

465
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:57,207
-A-ha!

466
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,066
-How dare you make
my tender feelings

467
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,033
the butt of your jokes.

468
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,900
[scream]

469
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,866
-Did somebody say butt?

470
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,833
-And you, you disgusting,
lying little pervert.

471
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,500
If it hadn't been for that
lame forbidden love story,

472
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,333
I'd never have come
here in the first place.

473
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,800
-Genma lied too!

474
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,800
-Come here!

475
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,466
-[sigh]

476
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:21,100
-All's well that ends well.

477
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,033
-In what way did this end well?

478
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:23,574
Huh?

479
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:24,433
Tell me.

480
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,566
-Oh, come on.

481
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,600
Don't be that way.

482
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,033
-Excuse me?

483
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,033
-I forgive--

484
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,500
-That's right, run.

485
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,400
You're going to think balancing
on balls is heaven on Earth

486
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
when I'm through with you.

ANNOUNCER: Oh,
Ryoga, are you really

489
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,521
that bothered by the past?

490
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:20,621
Huh?

491
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:22,187
What do you mean you've
come to a decision?

492
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:25,421
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
"From Ryoga With Love."

493
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:27,421
We'll see you there.
