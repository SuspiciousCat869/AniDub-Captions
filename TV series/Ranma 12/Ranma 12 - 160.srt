00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:40,928
Akane?

5
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:43,262
Akane?

6
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:46,162
What are you doing
sitting over there?

7
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:48,462
[sniffling]

8
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:51,428
MRS. TENDO: Oh, dear,
you're all dirty now.

00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:51,944
[tuts]

10
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,362
Oh.

11
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:54,295
Huh?

12
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,695
I got a flower
for Mother's Day.

13
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:57,795
[sniffling]

14
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:01,595
But now your flower's broken!

15
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:03,062
[cries]

16
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,328
MRS. TENDO: Oh, there,
there, you poor thing.

17
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:07,795
You fell down, didn't you?

18
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,928
Don't cry.

19
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,495
The flower's still pretty, see?

20
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,295
Oh!

21
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:18,628
MRS. TENDO: Thank you, dear.

22
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:20,428
It's beautiful.

23
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:23,428
You're such a nice little girl.

24
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,228
YOUNG AKANE: I love you, Mommy.

25
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,095
Morning, Akane.

26
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:35,395
Time to wake up and
get ready for school.

27
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:38,795
Mm, huh?

28
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:39,828
SOUN: Come on, everyone.

29
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:40,728
Let's get a move on.

30
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:46,528
AKANE (VOICE OVER): Boy
Meets Mom, Part One.

31
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,695
Come on, Akane.

32
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:05,428
Oh, right.

33
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,162
Here you are, Mom.

34
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,762
I know they're not
really in season,

35
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:20,228
but I got them since
they're your favorite.

36
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:21,628
Hello, Darling.

37
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:24,495
We're all doing just fine,
so don't worry about us.

38
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,928
I was wondering, Akane, do
you remember your mother?

39
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:43,528
Mhm.

40
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,962
She passed away when I was only
about four or five a year old,

41
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:48,862
but I can still remember her.

42
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,895
She was pretty and kind.

43
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:53,062
She was a wonderful mother.

44
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:54,362
Yeah?

45
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:57,228
NABIKI: What about
your mom, Ranma?

46
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:58,395
You've never mentioned her.

47
00:03:58,428 --> 00:03:59,828
Tell us what she was like.

48
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:01,195
Uh.

49
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:02,895
NABIKI: You must remember
something about her.

50
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:03,495
Mm.

51
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:04,762
Oh.

52
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,362
GENMA: [soft growl]

53
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:10,895
And just where do you
think you're going?

54
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:12,395
[growls]

55
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:21,428
Yeah, it's about
time you told us.

56
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,795
[growls]

57
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:32,328
Don't you mean that
mom ran out on you?

58
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:34,495
So, she ran out on them.

59
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:35,762
She must have.

60
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:37,395
She left them, huh?

61
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:55,028
Funny, I didn't notice before.

62
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:59,362
I don't think I've ever really
sat down and thought about Mom.

63
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:01,895
Well, I can't blame
her for leaving

64
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:04,095
with a husband like Pop.

65
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:06,528
She must have been a
freak anyway to marry him.

66
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,010
Ah!

67
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,128
Man, that was a little
too close for comfort.

68
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,695
[panicked noises]

69
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,462
[yelling]

70
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:25,828
Just what I needed.

71
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:27,962
NODOKA: Are you all right, miss?

72
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,195
Uh.

73
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,395
Uh, yeah, thanks.

74
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:36,128
NODOKA: Here, hold onto this.

75
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:38,795
Come on, grab hold.

76
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,328
OK, got it.

77
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:45,428
Ah!

78
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,628
[yelling]

79
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:52,095
Uh, uh, sorry.

80
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:53,395
I feel terrible.

81
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:54,995
NODOKA: You're a little
clumsy, aren't you?

82
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:55,762
Huh?

83
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:56,862
NODOKA: [laughs]

84
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:01,795
I suppose that's OK for a
tomboy like yourself, though.

85
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,795
Well, take care!

86
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:08,228
I have to be going now.

87
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,228
RANMA (VOICE OVER):
What a nice lady.

88
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,128
Hi, I'm home!

89
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:20,428
[running sounds]

90
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:21,928
[grunting]

91
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:23,128
Whoa!

92
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:24,595
[groaning]

93
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:32,662
Come on, Ranma.

94
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,795
We're leaving right now!

95
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:35,428
RANMA: What?

96
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,095
Wait!

97
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:36,928
Hang on, Pops!

98
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:37,795
Where's the fire?

99
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:39,062
No time to explain.

100
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:39,962
Let's just go!

101
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:41,095
Ah!

102
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:42,695
At the very least,
don't you think

103
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,195
your old friend deserves some
kind of explanation as to why

104
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:45,495
you're leaving so suddenly?

105
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:46,762
[yelling]

106
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,895
Huh?

107
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:54,195
NODOKA (VOICE OVER): I hope
this letter finds you well.

108
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:55,195
I'm coming for a visit.

109
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,062
Signed, Nodoka.

110
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,595
Mr. Saotome started
acting weird as soon

111
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,762
as this postcard came.

112
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,628
Why are you so upset
about this, Mr. Saotome?

113
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:07,262
Tendo, I'm begging you
to untie me and let me go.

114
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,628
Don't make me explain,
just let me go!

115
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,195
Please, Tendo, ah!

116
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:14,028
Calm down, Saotome,
you're not making sense.

117
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:16,228
Take your time and tell
us what the problem is.

118
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:17,728
GENMA: That's the whole point!

119
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:19,162
There isn't any time.

120
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:21,462
I've just got to get out
of here before she arrives!

121
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:22,095
Ah!

122
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:23,462
Nodoka.

123
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,362
So, it's a woman
coming to see him.

124
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:26,195
Oh.

125
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:27,928
So who is this Nadoka person?

126
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:29,595
Who is she?

127
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,595
That's none of your
business, is it?

128
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:32,595
Hey!

129
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,862
Did you stiff a
waitress or rob a bank?

130
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:37,162
I think it's time that you
told me what's going on.

131
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:38,995
Whatever could you
be talking about?

132
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:40,328
I know you, Pops.

133
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:42,128
You've done something
terrible, and now you're

134
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,462
trying to run away
before you get caught.

135
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:45,595
Oh.

136
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:47,628
How dare you speak to
your father that way?

137
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:48,995
I know!

138
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:50,628
You borrowed some money off her
and she's coming to collect.

139
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:53,095
Or maybe she saw you the
night you robbed her house,

140
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:55,428
and she fell in love
with you a first sight.

141
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:58,295
I bet she's the waitress
you stiffed at a restaurant!

142
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:59,295
No!

143
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:02,328
You're all wrong!

144
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:08,295
She's-- she's--
Nodoka is Ranma's--

145
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:09,662
Huh?

146
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:10,962
She's my what?

147
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:11,962
Out with it!

148
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,228
Uh.

149
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:14,728
WOMAN: Hello?

150
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:15,428
Anyone home?

151
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,095
Ah!

152
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,062
She's here!

153
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:18,062
Forgive me, mother!

154
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,362
I never met to harm anyone.

155
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:19,928
Huh?

156
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:20,728
Huh?

157
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:21,595
Huh?

158
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:22,628
Oh!

159
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:24,562
SOUN: Saotome, did
you just say mother?

160
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:28,595
Answer him!

161
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:29,695
What'd you just say?

162
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,428
He called her mother.

163
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,328
You mean she's your wife?

164
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,695
Well, this is a very
pleasant surprise indeed.

165
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:37,095
You must be Saotome's wife.

166
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:38,962
DELIVERY WOMAN: Speedy sushi.

167
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:40,995
I'm here to pick up
your sushi plates.

168
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,028
Hey, Tendo, come here.

169
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,728
She's not my wife.

170
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:46,862
Hm?

171
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:48,362
All right.

172
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,528
So the woman who wrote you
this mysterious postcard is?

173
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:51,828
[yelling groan]

174
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:53,528
The woman who's coming is--

175
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:57,628
That woman's got to
be Ranma's mother.

176
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,462
Mhm.

177
00:08:59,495 --> 00:08:59,985
Huh?

178
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:16,695
Th-- this woman is my mother.

179
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:20,162
Hm.

180
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:21,495
Lucky you, Ranma.

181
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:28,828
Ranma!

182
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:29,828
Hm?

183
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,195
Aren't you happy?

184
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:33,228
You'll finally be
able to meet your mom.

185
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:34,362
I don't know how to feel.

186
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:36,928
This is all happening so fast.

187
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:39,328
Besides, I've tried to
remember something about her,

188
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,495
but it's just no use.

189
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:40,985
Huh?

190
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:46,095
The dragon flies must
have left for the season.

193
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:50,962
Is anyone home?

194
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:52,528
AKANE: Coming!

195
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:53,195
Huh?

196
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:54,895
Ah, come on!

197
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,462
[giggles]

00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:01,728
Huh?

199
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:02,995
Listen, Ranma.

200
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,662
I've been doing a
lot of thinking.

201
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:07,128
It must be hard having
a father like me.

202
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:08,128
[struggling noises]

203
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:09,995
And it's going to get worse!

204
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,528
Ahh!

205
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:12,010
RANMA: Ah!

[gasping for air]

207
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:19,495
What'd you go and do
that for, old man?

[growls]

209
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,462
I don't know what
you're blabbing about,

210
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,595
but I don't
appreciate the fact--

[growls]

212
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,495
NODOKA: Hello.

213
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,295
I was wondering if
you could help me.

214
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:38,128
I'm looking for a Genma
Saotome and his son.

215
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:39,628
Please, won't you come in?

216
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,662
AKANE (VOICE OVER): This
lady is Ranma's mom.

217
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,362
Hey, that's the
lady from the river.

Hm?

224
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:39,406
NODOKA: So, as I was saying,
I'm looking for Genma and Ranma

225
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:40,139
Saotome.

226
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,472
Ahem, yes.

227
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:46,006
However, unfortunately--
unfortunately,

228
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,239
the two of them--

229
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:49,272
GENMA: I'm begging
you, old friend.

230
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:52,406
Tell her that Ranma and
I aren't here any longer.

231
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:55,839
Our very lives are
on the line here.

232
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:58,672
I'm begging you.

233
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:00,906
Genma and Ranma are
away on a journey

234
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,106
to work on their martial arts.

235
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:02,872

[sharp inhale]

237
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:04,839
Oh, I see.

238
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,306
RANMA: Enough's enough, Pops.

239
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:11,239
Now, just tell me
what's going on.

240
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,272
GENMA: [growls]

241
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:13,906
You haven't said anything!

242
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:17,606
Tell me who that lady is and
no more dodging the issue.

243
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,639
GENMA: [growls]

244
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:25,106
In your dreams, maybe.

245
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:27,439
Someone like her have
to be pretty hard up

246
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:29,872
to even think of marrying
a loser like you!

00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,806
Then that lady
really is my mother?

Huh?

253
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:06,306
My mom.

254
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:08,339
NODOKA: So, Mrs. Saotome.

255
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,739
You were left alone while
Ranma and his father

256
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,872
were on their journey to
improve their martial arts?

257
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:14,872
Yes.

258
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,139
I've been waiting for them.

259
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,872
SOUN: That must have
been hard for you.

260
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:20,939
NODOKA: It was, but--

261
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,306
But what?

262
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,006
Being separated from them
was difficult, of course,

263
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,506
but it was nothing compared to
the day Ranma was taken away

264
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:31,839
from me.

265
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:32,806
Please don't go!

266
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,139
Don't take my baby!

No, stop it, Nadoka!

This is for us!

00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,439
Don't take Ranma away from me!

271
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:40,139
Enough!

272
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:41,539
Let go!

GENMA: Please, Nodoka.

00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,272
Ranma must learn to be a
true master of the Anything

282
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:05,439
Yes, dear, I understand that.

283
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,439
Then understand,
Nodoka, that Ranma

284
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,806
must be raised away
from distractions

285
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,506
such as a mother's love.

286
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,439
Please, Nodoka, let
me take the boy!

287
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:15,872
Do it for Ranma's benefit!

288
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:18,739
Do it for Ranma's benefit?

289
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:19,739
For Ranma.

290
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:25,139
SOUN: I see.

291
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:27,739
So you gave Genma
custody of Ranma.

292
00:14:27,772 --> 00:14:31,106
That must have been
tough as Ranma's mother.

293
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,472
NODOKA: I trusted my husband.

294
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:39,906
Uh-oh.

295
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:40,639
OK, pops.

296
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,506
Hm?

297
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:42,988
Hm?

298
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:51,272
I have no idea what
you're so afraid of here,

299
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:54,439
but I'm not going to run
and hide any more, old man!

300
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:55,572
Uh!

301
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:58,972
NODOKA: Before my husband
left on his journey,

302
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,039
he made a promise to me.

303
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:02,072
He did?

304
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:02,672
AKANE: Oh.

305
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,372
What promise?

306
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,106
What exactly did he promise?

307
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:08,872
Tell us.

308
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,139
Well, he said--

309
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:11,739
[fighting noises]

310
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:12,906
Huh?

311
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,306
NODOKA (VOICE OVER):
Who's that boy?

312
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,539
RANMA: Let go of me, old man!

313
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,406
NODOKA (VOICE OVER):
Could it be Ranma?

314
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:17,672
[growls]

315
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:23,139
NODOKA: It's you, again.

316
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,106
The girl from the river.

317
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,306
RANMA: [groans]

318
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,106
I've had enough you,
stupid, old man.

320
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,439
NABIKI: Hm.

321
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:37,739
Young ladies oughtn't hit people
or use foul language, dear.

322
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:42,439
Hey, wait a minute, I
was just telling him-- eh!

323
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:46,572
Um, Mrs. Saotome, what were
you saying about that promise

324
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:47,372
before?

325
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,739
Oh, yes, that's right.

326
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:51,206
[happy giggle]

327
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,306
GENMA: I'll make
you this promise.

328
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:57,806
I'll raise Ranma to be
a true man among men.

329
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,339
If, for some reason, I
fail to do just that--

330
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:03,906
YOUNG RANMA: [happy giggles]

331
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:11,372
GENMA: If I fail
him, Nodoka, then I

332
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:14,572
promise we'll both
commit ritual Seppuku.

333
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,472
Oh, my darling!

334
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:19,339
Would you really do that for me?

335
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:27,188
Se?

336
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:27,672
Ppu?

337
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:28,639
Ku?

338
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,639
Seppuku.

339
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:32,206
[nervous noises]

340
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,839
I used to hear from my
husband often after they

341
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,306
left for their long journey.

342
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,072
But the last I heard,
they were headed

343
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:43,139
for an elite martial
arts training center

344
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:45,539
deep in the heart of China.

345
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,072
SOUN (VOICE OVER):
You poor woman.

346
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,939
AKANE (VOICE OVER): How tragic.

347
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:50,606
But, Mrs. Saotome,
you'd never really

348
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,072
take them up on that vow
to commit Seppuku, right?

349
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:53,672
Idiot.

350
00:16:57,772 --> 00:16:59,239
[nervous growl]

351
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:01,739
A sword.

352
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,039
Whoa!

353
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,539
[yelling]

354
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:16,572
I'm terribly sorry, you two.

355
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:17,906
How clumsy of me.

356
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,339
Here, let me get that.

357
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,072
About that Seppuku.

358
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,972
You're not serious, are you?

359
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,439
This is our written oath
that our word is good.

360
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:41,406
Here, Ranma.

361
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:45,772
Put your hand print on the paper
and promise to your mother.

362
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,306
YOUNG RANMA: [giggles]

363
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:53,872
Ranma, your mommy's
brave little boy.

364
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,339
NODOKA: I finally understood.

365
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:04,539
As the wife of a martial
arts expert, I relented.

366
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:15,039
If Ranma doesn't become
a true man among men--

367
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:19,672
I will indeed have
them honor their oath.

368
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:22,906
I brought this secret
family sword with me.

369
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:25,872
And it my husband hasn't
lived up to his promise--

370
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:32,739
[nervous grunts]

371
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:37,606
But I'm sure you find
this all very boring.

372
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,572
[nervous laughter]

373
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:39,939
[nervous giggle]

374
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:45,239
There.

375
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:47,739
I've made you a nice cut
of tea, Mrs. Saotome.

376
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:49,639
Oh, thank you.

377
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,972
Kasumi, wasn't it, dear?

378
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:52,639
That's right.

379
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,472
It's a shame.

380
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:08,372
I only wish that I could have
seen my Ranma just once more.

381
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,106
RANMA: Um--

382
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13,472
Huh?

383
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:14,106
I just--

384
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:14,839
[nervous growling]

385
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:17,006
Yes, what is it?

386
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,106
Uh, I, just-- uh--

387
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:20,406
That reminds me.

388
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,539
We haven't properly
introduced ourselves.

389
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:23,939
What's your name, young lady?

390
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:27,006
Uh, my-- my-- my name--

391
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,272
[growls]

392
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:32,272
My name is--

393
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:33,806
[deep breath]

394
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,339
RANMA: Ranma!

395
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,039
AKANE (VOICE OVER): Are you
going to tell her your name?

396
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:39,806
You can call me Ranko.

397
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,506
I'm Akane Tendo's cousin.

398
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:42,872
[growls]

399
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:47,472
My, what an adorable
name you have, Ranko dear.

400
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:48,606
[giggles]

401
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:50,506
I guess he's re-thinking
the whole Seppuku thing.

402
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:50,988
Hm.

403
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:57,106
You're very kind.

404
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:59,339
It's so nice of you
to offer me a place

405
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:02,306
to stay here even though
my husband is still away.

406
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,639
You're welcome to say
in our house any time.

407
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:05,572
Kasumi is right.

408
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,539
You can stay as
long as you like.

409
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:08,506
[laughs]

410
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:12,872
What were they thinking,
inviting her here?

411
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,572
Now she'll find out for sure.

412
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:17,206
Things are going to get
worse before they get better.

413
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:20,472
You always see the worst
in things, don't you?

414
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:21,806
[sighs]

415
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,739
[splashing water]

416
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:28,972
[humming]

417
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:32,506
RANMA: Hey, Pop?

418
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:34,806
Pop!

419
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,106
What is it?

420
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:38,406
How could you make
such a promise?

421
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:40,706
And why did you drag me into it?

422
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,206
What kind of couple
would do such a thing?

423
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,039
GENMA: Let me tell
you about your mother.

424
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:49,506
She's a woman that holds honor
and loyalty in high esteem.

425
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,706
If she knew the truth, it
would be the end for sure.

426
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:56,106
Because I doubt if she'd want
to be married to an old panda.

427
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,072
[laughs]

428
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:58,872
Knock it off, Pops!

429
00:20:58,906 --> 00:20:59,972
NODOKA: Ranko?

430
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:01,306
Are you in there?

431
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,906
Shall I rinse off your back?

432
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:03,672
RANMA: Ah!

433
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:04,939
I'm coming in!

434
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,539
RANMA: Ah!

435
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:10,139
Huh?

436
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:12,439
I'm really sorry about
that, Mrs. Saotome.

437
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,206
I didn't mean to
get you all wet.

438
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,772
That's very peculiar.

439
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:20,406
I thought I-- It must be my
imagination, but for a second

440
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:22,739
there, I could have sworn I
saw a teenage boy in the tub

441
00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:24,906
with a strange old
man wearing glasses.

442
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:26,806
Funny how the mind works.

443
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,306
[growling]

444
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:31,072
Funny, isn't it?

445
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:32,539
[giggling]

446
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:35,739
[music playing]

447
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:47,110
[theme music]

448
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:16,565
AKANE (VOICE OVER):
Ranma, how can

449
00:23:16,598 --> 00:23:18,832
you just-- your mom's here now.

450
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:22,265
Don't you think that, well--
I mean, doesn't she deserve--

451
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:25,732
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Boy Meets Mom Part Two,

452
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:27,098
Some How, Some Day.

453
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,865
We'll see ya there!
