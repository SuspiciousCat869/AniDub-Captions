AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Back to the Happosai.

3
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,322
-Step right up.

4
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,288
The treasures of the
Orient lay before you.

5
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:21,888
-Don't you got
any game software?

6
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:23,688
-Well, I got Chutes and Ladders.

7
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:25,388
-Ah, it's nothing but junk.

8
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:26,955
-Come on, let's go.

9
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:28,388
-Punks.

10
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,122
You just watch what
you're calling junk,

11
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:32,788
you little-- heya, baby.

12
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:33,888
-Huh?

13
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,488
-You'll buy something
from me, won't you?

14
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,622
-What?

15
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:37,822
-I'll gladly take
underwear in lieu of cash.

16
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,622
-Oh, please.

17
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:40,888
Hmph.

18
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:42,822
-Hey, I thought girls were
supposed to like shopping.

19
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:44,288
-Yo, Gramps, what'cha doing?

20
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:46,588
-Business, obviously.

21
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:47,288
-Business?

22
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:49,088
-What kind of business?

23
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:50,588
-Oh, I get it.

24
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:53,655
You're selling off all that
underwear you stole, ain't ya?

25
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,055
-Ha!

26
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:57,888
I'd sooner sell a kidney than
part of my precious collection.

27
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,388
SHAMPOO: Delivery.

28
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:00,922
-What?

29
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:01,888
A delivery?

30
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:02,855
That's weird.

31
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:03,888
I didn't think we'd
order anything.

32
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,822
-Great Grandma to
bring brand new kind

33
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:08,222
of ramen for free
taste test today.

34
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,788
-Hey, you didn't put
nothing in it, did ya?

35
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:12,955
Another dose of that
love potion or something?

36
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:13,988
-Sorry.

37
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,655
Only it's just ramen
noodle this time.

38
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:16,688
It's too delicious.

39
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,555
-Would you look
at all this junk.

40
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:19,488
-Do you mind?

41
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:21,688
I'm right here.

42
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:22,488
Oh, come on.

43
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:23,588
What do you say?

44
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:25,288
What if I give you my
word, I'll be good.

45
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:25,955
-Hmph.

46
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:26,622
-RANMA: Yeah, right.

47
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:27,855
-OK, OK, already.

48
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:29,622
SHAMPOO: Everything's so old.

49
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:38,055
Grandmother, this
one is nice antique.

50
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:39,988
Maybe I buy it.

51
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,888
-Hey, how'd this get
into my junk drawer?

52
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,555
I thought it was long gone.

53
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,255
-I give you 10 yen for it.

54
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,655
-My magic mirror's not for sale.

55
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:50,288
-Magic mirror?

56
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:51,555
-You got it.

57
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:54,488
I'm told it was once owned
by Alexander the Great who

58
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,955
brought it to Japan
along the Silk Road.

59
00:03:57,055 --> 00:04:01,522
Why, I wouldn't part with
it for all the tea in China.

60
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:02,888
-Do tell.

61
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:05,355
Next thing, you'll be
telling us it was a gift.

62
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,222
-Wherever it came
from, it's beautiful.

63
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:09,488
-Yeah, I wonder where
he stole it from.

64
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:10,988
-Bite your tongue.

65
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:13,688
It was more like--
well, more like a gift.

66
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:14,422
Yeah.

67
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:16,388
-What'd I tell you?

68
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:21,555
-At the time, I was but
a lad of 18 summers.

69
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:25,222
I was traveling in China
on a training journey.

70
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:31,855
And then one day, I came
upon a virtuous maiden.

71
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:35,222
But our love was not to be.

72
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:38,722
My warrior's heart had
no time for romance.

73
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:39,888
-Farewell.

74
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,555
-Oh, my Lord Happosai,
at least take

75
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,722
this in remembrance of our love.

76
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:50,888
-At least-- [sigh] At least I
have this to remember her by.

77
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:55,688
Hey, I'm taking here.

78
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:56,255
-Yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,055
We're listening.

80
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:59,422
Then what happened?

81
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:02,188
-And then I never
got to see her again.

82
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:03,288
-Wow, that's too bad.

83
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:09,222
-She remembers me
still, I'm sure of it.

84
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,888
Pining for me in her
lonely spinsterhood.

85
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:13,288
Oh, how could I have done it?

86
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,155
How could I have
left her behind?

87
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:15,696
[laughter]

88
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:17,555
-Oh.

89
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:19,388
Oh, that's a good one, Gramps.

90
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:20,788
Why don'tcha tell
us another one?

91
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,022
-Not even pine tree
pine for that one.

92
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,655
-No kidding.

93
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:26,688
Why waste over some
teen romance when

94
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:30,388
she's moved on with her life?

95
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:31,522
-Pah.

96
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,488
That's the problem with
you youngsters today--

97
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:35,022
no romance in your soul.

98
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:39,122
-Now that you mention it,
this story does seem familiar.

99
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,788
Something very similar once
happened in my village.

100
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,555
However, in my version.

101
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,855
-Wo ai ni!

102
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:52,022
GRANDMOTHER (VOICEOVER):
This so-called fool

103
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:55,622
for love made passes at
every girl in the village.

104
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,555
Then he plundered
all our valuables

105
00:05:57,655 --> 00:05:59,488
and headed for the hills.

106
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:00,355
-Come back, thief!

107
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:00,896
-My jewelry!

108
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:01,555
-Thief!

109
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,822
-What do you mean thief?

110
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:05,988
Sounds more like an
adventurer to me.

111
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:06,822
-No.

112
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:09,288
When I say thief, I mean thief.

113
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:13,955
-Simmer down, will you?

114
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:15,788
You're acting like you're
the one that got dumped.

115
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,555
-Stop it.

116
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:19,388
-My-- my-- my wall!

117
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:21,388
Why can't you two
just get along?

118
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:22,722
-What did we miss?

119
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:25,622
-And you, Grandmother, you're
old enough to know better.

120
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:27,988
-Enough of this nonsense.

121
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,588
Give me my mirror.

122
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:30,988
-Well, I'll be.

123
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:33,955
It's not the mirror
that's the antique here.

124
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:35,788
It's you, the owner.

125
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:37,388
Don't tell me you're Cologne.

126
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:41,188
-Nice to see you too, Happy.

127
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:42,688
-Did she say Happy?

128
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:43,622
-Cologne?

129
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:44,622
-What?

130
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,155
You know know Grandma
the real name?

131
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:48,155
-The only way that you
could know that nickname

132
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:50,755
is if you were there,
live and in person.

133
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,422
-Happy, she says.

134
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:55,722
-Cologne, he says.

135
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:57,488
-Great Grandmother,
why you never

136
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,155
say you know him before now?

137
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:02,188
-It's not the kind of thing
one likes to dwell on,

138
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,288
if you know what I mean

139
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:04,655
-What's your excuse?

140
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,055
-Call it a mental block.

141
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:11,555
Is it my fault I didn't realize?

142
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,688
It was long ago.

143
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:16,655
All this time, I've been
living on hopes and dreams,

144
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:18,688
praying for the day
when I could be reunited

145
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:21,922
with the young girl who
took charge of my heart.

146
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:24,522
Who could've known that that
beautiful girl would grow up

147
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:26,955
to look like the crypt-keeper?

148
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,222
Ah, the tragedy.

149
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:33,555
Farewell, oh, light-hearted
days of youth.

150
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:40,222
-Uh-oh.

151
00:07:40,322 --> 00:07:40,763
-Wha--?

152
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:41,263
-Huh?

153
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:42,155
-Oh.

154
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,322
-Wha-- what the heck's going on?

155
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,388
-Huh?

156
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:48,822
-Now you've done it.

157
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:02,555
KASUMI: OK, everyone.

158
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:04,622
Time for lunch.

159
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:05,163
Huh?

160
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,788
Hm, now that is really odd.

161
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:12,755
I could've sworn I
heard them talking.

162
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:23,122
RANMA: Somebody wanna tell
me what's going on here?

163
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:25,522
-You don't think
it's a dream, do you?

164
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,722
-What do you make
of it, Saotome?

165
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:30,288
-So what are you
asking me for, Tendo?

166
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:31,322
Master?

167
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:33,088
-Uh--

168
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:36,655
-Oh, just as I feared,
the very worst has come.

169
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:38,688
-What worst is
that, Great Grandma?

170
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:41,188
-We've traveled back
in time to China.

171
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,222
-What?

172
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,988
Back in time to China?

173
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,322
GRANDMA: Just so.

174
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:48,622
If, while holding
the magic mirror,

175
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,188
a tear should happen
to fall, a window

176
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:53,555
opens up to the
bearer's heartland,

177
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:57,088
bringing him or her back
where they'd most like to be.

178
00:08:57,188 --> 00:09:00,222
Like I said, the worst has come.

179
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,088
-Worst?

180
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:01,622
What are you?

181
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:02,488
Kidding?

182
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:03,722
Since we've come
all this way, we

183
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:05,655
might as well look
around a bit, eh?

184
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:07,088
-Hey, Ranma, you're right.

185
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,522
Maybe we can pick up
a souvenir for Kasumi.

186
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,655
-You don't suppose
they'd have hot springs?

187
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:12,988
-Why not live it up?

188
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:15,322
-Say, I could really
use a long soak at--

189
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,755
[screaming]

190
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,088
-He's following us.

191
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:19,522
-Where you going, girls?

192
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:21,455
I'm offering you all
this marriage here.

193
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:24,788
Be reasonable.

194
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:27,188
Stingy.

195
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:28,255
-What a moron.

196
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:29,088
Serves him right.

197
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:30,722
-Say hello to young Happosai.

198
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:31,422
-What?

199
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:32,822
-Don't make me laugh.

200
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:39,422
In the past, I looked like--
why'd you do that for?

201
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:42,388
-Do we look like we just
fell off the turnip truck?

202
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,488
-It's me, I tell you.

203
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:44,122
Me!

204
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:45,555
-Hear that, Tendo.

205
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:48,555
-Sure did, Saotome.

206
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,855
-Wh-- why are you looking at me?

207
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,622
-Prepare yourself.

208
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:53,822
-En garde.

209
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:56,322
Prepare for your final
reckoning, you evil runt.

210
00:09:56,422 --> 00:10:00,055
-What are you doing?

211
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:01,688
-We did it.

212
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:04,522
We beat the evil master.

213
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,055
-Justice comes at last.

214
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:09,755
-Don't make me laugh.

215
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,688
Why, you two little ingrates.

216
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,188
Don't you know
there's no difference

217
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:14,922
between hitting
him and hitting me?

218
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:15,655
-Oh, yeah?

219
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:17,055
You don't say.

220
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:20,622
-But we thought
you looked like--

221
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:23,788
-You go, Tendo.

222
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:25,488
-You there, weakling.

223
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:26,488
On your feet.

224
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:28,188
Are you a man or a mouse?

225
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:29,288
-Back off.

226
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:33,388
What's an old fart like
you gonna teach me?

227
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:35,955
-Old-- old fart, you say?

228
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:37,722
Big words for an amateur.

229
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,288
What's the matter
with you anyway?

230
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,188
Chasing after sweet and
innocent girls like that.

231
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:46,055
Don't you know that kind of
stuff's bad for your character?

232
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,022
-I'll say.

233
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:50,188
-You'll get no argument here.

234
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,388
-Butt out, Gramps.

235
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:54,322
Wow, hey, baby.

236
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:55,722
What do you say we get hitched?

237
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:03,388
What are you doing?

238
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,522
Let me go.

239
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,622
-I'm gonna teach you the
error of your evil ways.

240
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:10,988
-Aw, but I like my evil ways.

241
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,922
-Teaching himself to be good?

242
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:14,422
Now this I gotta see.

243
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:28,155
-And here's the house
where I grew up.

244
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,422
-Wow, really?

245
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,455
-It seems like only
yesterday that-- look.

246
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:35,888
There's me when I was 18.

247
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:39,555
Would you mind making your lies
a little less obvious please?

248
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,455
-If you think I'm
lying, watch this.

249
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:44,355
Hey, Cologne.

250
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:45,522
-You called?

251
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,622
ALL: Oh my god.

252
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:50,322
-There.

253
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:52,222
That ought to teach you
the error of your ways.

254
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:52,955
Now, once more.

255
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,055
-Give me a break.

256
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:55,955
I pooped.

257
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:58,322
-You really are
pathetic, aren't you?

258
00:11:58,422 --> 00:12:00,122
You want to end up
a dirty old man?

259
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:01,255
-Speak for yourself.

260
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,588
Some of us are still in
the prime of our youth.

261
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,822
-And what would you
know about youth?

262
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:09,022
What you say and do now
affects the rest of your life.

263
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:09,855
Don't you know that?

264
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:13,755
What?

265
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:16,088
What you looking at?

266
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:17,222
-Be honest.

267
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,755
Which would you prefer--
a long training journey

268
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,422
or stealing women's underwear?

269
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:22,822
-Stealing underwear.

270
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,355
-Which do you think is
more fun-- training so hard

271
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:27,222
you peer into the
mouth of hell itself

272
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:28,955
of looking at women in a bath?

273
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,688
-Looking at women.

274
00:12:33,388 --> 00:12:34,155
You're right.

275
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,822
I got nothing to teach you.

276
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,988
-I already told you that.

277
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:42,855
Go back to where you
came from, you old fart.

278
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:43,622
-Come back.

279
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,479
-Please to drink.

280
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,546
Maybe fathers prefer
rice wine instead?

281
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,379
-What a charming hostess.

282
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,179
-You said it, Saotome.

283
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,446
-I feel awful.

284
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,912
Here we are, complete
strangers, and yet--

285
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:10,046
-Oh, no.

286
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:13,412
I have crazy feeding we
meet somewhere before.

287
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,679
-Boy, I'll say.

288
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:15,246
-Sorry?

289
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,946
-Uh, nothing.

290
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:18,879
-Cologne.

291
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,012
-Why you here, Happy?

292
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,112
-Come on, baby.

293
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:22,346
Don't be that way.

294
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:23,412
-Go home.

295
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:27,412
-But Cologne, I only--
ah, now I get it.

296
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:29,479
This is your way of
showing affection.

297
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,712
Throwing tea is some kind
of Chinese tradition, right?

298
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,512
-Jeez, how clueless can you get?

299
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:35,246
-Go away.

300
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:35,787
Shoo.

301
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:36,879
-No.

302
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:39,046
I'm not leaving until
you say you'll marry me.

303
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:42,146
-But I--

304
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:42,979
-What's the matter?

305
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,346
You heard the lady.

306
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,612
-You'd best go, or we'll be
forced to hurt you, little man.

307
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:47,912
-Why I ought to--

308
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:50,812
-You want to start something?

309
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:51,946
-Mark my words.

310
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:54,246
Someday, I'll be the
one bullying you.

311
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,946
-Say, you really care
about him, don't you?

312
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:08,346
-While everyone eat appetizer,
I go make main course, OK?

313
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:09,212
-All right.

314
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,846
-I knew it.

315
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,179
She really does care
about the little guy.

316
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:15,846
-What?

317
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:16,812
You mean the freak?

318
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:19,079
-Well, Great
Grandmother, is true?

319
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:22,546
-Well, I-- I don't actually hate
him, if that's what you mean.

320
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,012
-Wish I could say
I was surprised

321
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:36,879
but-- aw, quite moping
around, will you?

322
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,912
I told you I'd help you, but
first, get me some more rice.

323
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,212
-You just ate it all.

324
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:41,753
[clatter]

325
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,579
Huh?

326
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,446
Hello?

327
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:46,679
Hey.

328
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,846
Huh, what's this?

329
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,612
Hey, what do you know?

330
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:51,246
Pork buns.

331
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,479
-I knew it.

332
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,312
-Maybe we can help get
those two together.

333
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:03,146
-Well then, time to
inventory my collection.

334
00:15:03,246 --> 00:15:03,979
-C-- collection?

335
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:08,712
-How sweet it is.

336
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:11,412
How very sweet.

337
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:12,446
Hands off.

338
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:15,079
No fair touching
the merchandise.

339
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,579
HAPPOSAI (VOICEOVER): If I was
this much of a pervert at 18,

340
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,146
then what does that make me now?

341
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,279
-Time for a crash course.

342
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:24,279
-Come on, let me go.

343
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:25,746
-I won't let go
unless you follow me.

344
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:27,479
-No fair, you old fart.

345
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:29,179
-Thanks to you and
your perversity, women

346
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,379
think I'm a freak.

347
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,646
You've got to straighten
out before it's too late.

348
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:34,979
-What are you talking about?

349
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:36,379
Huh?

350
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,679
Oh.

351
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,679
What's this?

352
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,179
"Meet me by the lake.

353
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,846
I'll be waiting for you.

354
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:43,912
Cologne."

355
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,212
She wants to meet me.

356
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:50,979
-"To my dearest Cologne, there's
something I must tell you.

357
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,712
Please meet me by the lake.

358
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:53,479
Happy."

359
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,246
-Oh, sound very important.

360
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:56,512
-You'd better hurry.

361
00:15:56,612 --> 00:16:00,246
You don't want to keep him
waiting too long, do you?

362
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:01,712
[sigh]

363
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,312
-But I no can go.

364
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:06,894
-Huh?

365
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:08,079
Why not?

366
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:11,979
-Because I no like Happy.

367
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,112
-You're lying.

368
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:15,579
Why can't you just be
honest with yourself?

369
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,012
-Why you no be
honest about letter?

370
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:19,746
-Wha--

371
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,379
COLOGNE: Everyone know
Happy no can write Chinese.

372
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:22,912
SHAMPOO: Huh?

373
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:23,453
AKANE: Oh.

374
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,479
So much for that idea.

375
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,479
-What were you two thinking?

376
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,079
You trying to cause some kind
of time paradox or something?

377
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,712
If it was meant to
be, don't you think

378
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,579
she would have married
him the first time?

379
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,979
-Well, I suppose so.

380
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,612
-To be in love is
important thing.

381
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:54,146
Womans can be happy
whole life with that.

382
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,412
-Isn't that the truth.

383
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:56,912
-Right?

384
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:57,779
-Hm?

385
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,079
Hey, Granny, where you going?

386
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,812
-I-- I've been thinking, if
she won't go to meet him,

387
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,546
maybe I should.

388
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:04,087
-What?

389
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:15,946
[rustle]

390
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:16,487
-Happy.

391
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:32,412
-Ni hao.

392
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:32,961
GRANDMA: Ugh.

393
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,346
HAPPOSAI (VOICEOVER):
How dare he

394
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:39,879
try to take my
place with Cologne.

395
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:46,246
Hey, since when can
Cologne write Japanese?

396
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,546
WOMAN 1: Curse you, Happy.

397
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,246
WOMAN 2: Hey!

398
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:49,579
WOMAN 1: Come back here.

399
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,579
-Hey, it's the villagers.

400
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,246
-Where is he?

401
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:55,246
Did you see him?

402
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:56,212
-He must've run away.

403
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:58,546
-I swear, when I
get my hands on him,

404
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,179
he's going to pay
for those vegetables

405
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,046
he stole if it's
the last thing I do.

406
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:11,279
-What are you going
to do with that?

407
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:15,646
-This mirror been in Cologne's
family for many generation.

408
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:17,812
To sell it pay for
many vegetable.

409
00:18:17,912 --> 00:18:19,712
-Come on, don't be stupid.

410
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,246
Why would you want to do that?

411
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:24,279
-Maybe you not know Happy
so well as you think.

412
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:25,346
-Huh?

413
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,046
You know something
about him that I don't?

414
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:32,212
-If you could have
seen him on that day.

415
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:37,546
What is wrong?

416
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:43,612
-She needs you more than I.

417
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:45,746
COLOGNE: Here is Happy
on brink of death,

418
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:48,479
and all his worry
is for little bird.

419
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:52,412
Cologne never meet such
kind person in whole life.

420
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:54,179
-A stuffed animal?

421
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,512
Whoa.

422
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,979
You know, I'll give him credit
for nerve if nothing else.

423
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,312
-You no understand.

424
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:01,079
Because he too
tired from training,

425
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,912
he mistake toy
bird for real one.

426
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,579
-If you like him so
much, why be so mean?

427
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,412
Why don't you just
marry him then?

428
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:11,146
-Right now, he hard at training.

429
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,879
He no have time for
someone like me.

430
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:15,046
-Cologne

431
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,246
-Happy.

432
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:18,279
-I knew that letter was a lie.

433
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:22,246
How can you date someone like
him when you've already got me?

434
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:23,279
-Oh, shut up.

435
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:24,712
-Come outside if
you're man enough.

436
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:28,046
-If I'm what?

437
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:29,079
-Honestly.

438
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,679
-Oh, I feel sick.

439
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:32,446
-Hmph.

440
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,512
Not half as sick as I feel.

441
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:36,246
-Wah!

442
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:37,079
Why you--

443
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,079
-Oh, no you don't, you little--

444
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,946
-What you doing to my Happy?

445
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,246
-Cologne

446
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:48,512
-Happy.

447
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:50,746
-Cologne!

448
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:52,212
-Happy!

449
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:54,679
-Cologne!

450
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:55,579
Oh, wait a minute.

451
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,579
I'll be right back.

452
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:57,546
Hey, babe!

453
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:06,179
Cologne, you know you're
the only one for me.

454
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,646
Hey, oh, somebody help me.

455
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:15,046
[villagers screaming]

456
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,146
-Oh, great.

457
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:17,746
Now even Cologne is
running me out of town.

458
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:24,812
-Give me back my magic
mirror, you little thief.

459
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:25,779
HAPPOSAI: Nya, nya.

460
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:26,346
Sorry.

461
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:27,746
I'm out of here.

462
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:30,212
COLOGNE: Give me back my mirror!

463
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,479
-Gee, why is it
I'm not surprised?

464
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,212
-Eh, so I exaggerated a little.

465
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:35,346
Who cares.

466
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:37,512
The important thing is
I got the magic mirror.

467
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,646
-Shame on you.

468
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:39,612
-Bad man.

469
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:41,946
-And you call
yourself our master.

470
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:43,479
-Maybe we should find a new one.

471
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,020
-Miscreant.

472
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,746
-No fair.

473
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:53,212
It's not fair that you all gang
up on me like that, you know.

474
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,012
I want to go home.

475
00:21:04,412 --> 00:21:05,279
Give it back, thief.

476
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:06,712
-Don't be ridiculous.

477
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:08,246
It's my mirror.

478
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,246
-I've gone through too
much to give it up now.

479
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:11,712
-That's not my problem.

480
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,846
Besides, you can't have it.

481
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:14,112
I won't let you.

482
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:16,246
-Man, doesn't he learn anything
from his past mistakes?

483
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:17,646
-Speaking of which,
why didn't you

484
00:21:17,746 --> 00:21:20,079
visit Jusenkyo while
you were in China, son?

485
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,012
-Ah!

486
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:23,412
Give me that mirror!

487
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:24,412
-Why this always happen?

488
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:25,279
RANMA: Give it to me.

489
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:25,879
Give it to me.

490
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:26,446
-You got me.

491
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,012
-No!

492
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:28,079
-Give it back.

493
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:28,620
Give it--

494
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,246
-Are you guys having
a garage sale?

495
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:35,446
What a bunch of junk.

496
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:47,301
[ending theme]

Just who do you

00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:21,649
What do you mean you're
Ranma's new bride?

Next time, on "Ranma 1/2"--
