AKANE (VOICEOVER): Case
of the Missing Takoyaki.

3
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,533
NARRATOR: This is Ramna Saotome,

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,833
Akane Tendo, 16 and a freshman.

00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:57,900
Nabiki Tendo, 17 years of
age and a high school junior.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,933
Kasumi Tendo, 19 years
old, occupation, homemaker.

8
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:09,933
Soun Tendo, mid 40s, manager
of the Tendo Training Hall.

Genma Saotome, also in his mid
40s, occupation, freeloader.

10
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:20,866
Happosai, age estimated at 400
years, he too is a freeloader.

11
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:23,066
These are our main characters.

12
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,400
-Hey, Kasumi, perfect timing.

13
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,733
-Good morning.

14
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,633
I just got in a fresh shipment
of Takoyaki octopus buns.

15
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,766
-I'll take I'll six-pack
if you don't mind.

16
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:43,600
-And because you're so pretty,
I'll throw in an extra one.

17
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,141
-Thanks.

00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:53,233
I'm coming.

21
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,533
NARRATOR: And this is how
the Tendo Seaweed Sprinkle

22
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,566
Incident began.

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,833
-OK then.

24
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:06,382
Goodbye.

25
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,166
Huh?

26
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,500
[scream]

27
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,900
-I assume you're
all wondering why

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,400
I've called everyone
in our little household

29
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
to this meeting today.

30
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,900
A situation has been
brought to my attention that

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
must be dealt with
straightaway, a situation

32
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,466
so grave it could
possibly jeopardize

33
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:03,600
the future of this family and
destroy relationships among us.

34
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,433
Sometime this morning,
Kasumi purchased

35
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,566
a pack of fresh Takoyaki,
but somehow those

36
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:17,200
octopus puffs have vanished.

37
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,866
Our only witness to
the crime is Kasumi.

38
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:23,666
She was the last person to
see the missing Takoyaki.

39
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:28,633
-Uh, well, It was around 3:00
when I came into the kitchen

40
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:29,900
to start dinner.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,700
About 10 minutes later, I
went to answer the phone.

42
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,100
Then when I returned
the Takoyaki were gone.

43
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
The back door had
been left half open

44
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,466
and a cup of water on the
table had been tipped over.

45
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,333
It was dripping onto the floor.

46
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,833
Maybe there is a
simple explanation.

47
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:57,566
However, I thought
I'd ask you all first.

48
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,333
If anyone has eaten
them or knows who did,

49
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,266
now is your time
to step forward.

50
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,133
-Um, well--

51
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,533
-Huh?

52
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,833
-It's not like I
saw him taking them,

53
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:15,533
but I did, in fact, see
Ranma in the kitchen.

54
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,933
-Huh?

55
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:21,433
-So are you accusing me of
eating the Takoyaki, Nabiki?

56
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,200
Huh?

57
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,000
-Please, Ranma, sit down.

58
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,366
Nobody's accusing
you of anything.

59
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:29,600
So before you get upset, let's
hear what Nabiki has to say.

60
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,733
-Yeah.

61
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,333
Let's here it.

62
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,800
-Well, a little after
3:00, I came home

63
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,000
and went into the kitchen.

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,541
Hm?

65
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,966
Huh?

66
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:47,507
Ranma?

67
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,100
I wondered why she
was in such a hurry.

68
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,100
What's this?

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,641
Huh?

70
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,633
Aha!

71
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,500
-I just went into the kitchen
to get a drink of water.

72
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,233
-And was that all?

73
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,533
-Aha!

74
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,900
Then it with you who came
in through the back door

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,433
and left it open.

76
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:17,466
-Excuse me, but you still
haven't answered my question.

77
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,033
-What question?

78
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,233
-I was wondering why
you were in such a hurry

79
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,533
when you ran out of the kitchen?

80
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,933
-Huh?

81
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:28,533
Listen, when I went in there,
the Takoyaki was already gone.

82
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:31,966
I saw the empty pack myself.

83
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,500
-Hm.

84
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,041
Hm.

85
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,733
Oh, I just thought of something.

86
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,274
-Hello?

87
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,266
-Ah!

88
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:52,233
The Takoyaki!

89
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:52,766
Someone.

90
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,200
Stole them.

91
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,133
-It's a possibility.

92
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,766
-Hm, hm.

93
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,433
-So did you eat them?

94
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:00,400
-Oh please.

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,600
Don't worry.

96
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,100
I still haven't played
my trump card yet, Akane.

97
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
-What do you mean
by that, Nabiki.

98
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,666
like

99
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:13,466
-Oh come on tell us what your
trump card is, for Pete's sake.

100
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,700
-All right, I will.

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,766
And to back up my
story I have evidence

102
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:20,433
to prove that what
I'm saying is true.

103
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,933
And here's the proof.

104
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:24,466
-Huh?

105
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:25,133
-What is it?

106
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,533
-Ah!

107
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:28,100
-Oh.

108
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,666
-Akane, tell us.

109
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:33,333
-It's the wrapper from Takoyaki.

110
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,733
-Where did you get that?

111
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,566
-Let me explain it to you.

112
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,766
Ranma was thirsty and decided to
go get a drink of water, but--

113
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,700
-Ah, man.

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,241
Takoyaki.

115
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,733
Awesome.

116
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,200
But I'm still hungry.

117
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,866
Hey.

118
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:02,200
I've got it.

119
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,000
If I become a girl, my stomach
will shrink I'll be full.

120
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,766
-Oh yeah, that did the trick.

121
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,300
-So, it was you after all.

122
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
-Wait a second.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,600
All she showed you was
the wrapping paper.

124
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,800
-Duly noted, Ranma,
but personally,

125
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,200
I believe your defense
to be rather weak.

126
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,200
-I have to agree with Happosai.

127
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,433
-Come on, Akane.

128
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,200
You gonna take that
pervert's word over mine?

129
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,666
-Why don't you just confess?

130
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,800
After all, you do
admit that you changed

131
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,600
into a girl in the
kitchen, right?

132
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,233
Well, did you?

133
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,000
-Huh?

134
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,433
I didn't want to say this
but, you left me no choice.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,533
I confess I saw everything.

136
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:47,866
-OK.

137
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:51,266
It's time to give Ranma the
chance to tell his version.

138
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:56,900
I remember right
after my workout,

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,566
I went into the
bathroom and a shower

140
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,766
and then after I was
finished, I noticed

141
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:05,500
some running down the hallway.

142
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,366
-Huh?

143
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:07,907
Akane.

144
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,333
I wonder, what's her rush, huh?

145
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:20,600
She must have dropped
this rubber band.

146
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,100
-It seems as though
we may have yet

147
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,100
another suspect in
our little mystery.

148
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,833
Uh.

149
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:38,500
-Oh, how dare you even
include me as a suspect?

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,766
-But, Akane, you know I didn't
make the whole thing up.

151
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:46,633
Just tell us the reason why
you were running up the stairs.

152
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:50,600
-Well, I guess I was
in a hurry, that's all.

153
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,533
-Akane, to avoid any
misunderstandings,

154
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,900
why don't you tell
us your alibi.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,400
-How come you're on
Ranma's side, Dad?

156
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,466
-Hold on there.

157
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm not on any one's side.

158
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,066
Can't you see I'm just
trying to be fair?

159
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,366
-Fair?

160
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,866
Then explain to me what you
were doing in the kitchen.

161
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:06,407
-Oh?

162
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,733
-Huh?

163
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,000
-But, Dad.

164
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,433
-During the afternoon
in question,

165
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:15,600
I was busy doing some
intense research.

166
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,533
[phone ringing]

167
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,400
-Oh, I'll get it.

168
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:30,566
[chewing noisily]

169
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,841
Ah!

170
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:48,633
All that remained at the scene
of the crime, was a toothpick.

171
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:52,633
It was the one piece of
evidence that Soun left behind.

172
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,500
-Big deal if there
was a toothpick

173
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,033
on the floor in the kitchen.

174
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,866
It doesn't mean anything.

175
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,733
Way to go, Sherlock.

176
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,666
-Why you little--
here's the evidence.

177
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:06,000
[gasps]

178
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,133
EVERYONE: It's seaweed.

179
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,233
-That's right.

180
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,800
And as we all know,
you can't have Takoyaki

181
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
without seaweed on top.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,100
-OK we can see that, but
what's your point exactly?

183
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,466
-Whoever used that toothpick
ate the top Takoyaki.

184
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:20,833
-Bingo!

185
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,100
At first I couldn't believe
that the head of this household

186
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,766
could stoop so low.

187
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:27,800
But the evidence clearly
shows us otherwise.

188
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,133
I rest my case.

189
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:30,700
-No.

190
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,266
It wasn't me.

191
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,633
Really.

192
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,174
Ah!

193
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,366
-Well, I wonder who the
real culprit is then.

194
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:44,633
-Hey.

195
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:45,300
-What?

196
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,800
-On Happosai's lip.

197
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,341
-Huh?

198
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:05,094
There's seaweed
on Happosai's lip.

199
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:07,394
Take a look.

200
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,494
-Huh?

201
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,427
-Huh?

202
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:09,968
-Huh?

203
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:17,827
-There must be some
kind of mistake here.

204
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:19,561
I--

205
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:20,494
-Get him.

206
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,494
-I swear.

207
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:25,427
I'm innocent.

208
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:26,727
I didn't do anything.

209
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,694
Innocent, I tell you.

210
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:31,427
-Why should we believe
a pervert like you?

211
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:34,061
-Yeah, we all know that
you're the one who did it.

212
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:36,461
-You're such a liar.

213
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:38,561
-I'm sorry, Master,
but as you can see,

214
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:40,161
we simply have no choice.

215
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:43,061
I suggest that you confess
your transgressions to us now

216
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:46,794
and just maybe we'll
go easy on you.

217
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:50,127
-Hey , why don't we tie him
up in a tree for awhile?

218
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,261
-Wait, Ranma.

219
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:53,894
Wait until you've heard
my side of the story.

220
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:55,627
-You mean more excuses?

221
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:57,194
-Stay away from me.

222
00:12:57,294 --> 00:12:58,594
-You know, maybe
we should listen

223
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,394
to what he's got to say,
at least for a laugh.

224
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:02,394
-I agree.

225
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:04,094
And from what I
understand of the law,

226
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:07,294
shouldn't we at least hear
him out before we hang him?

227
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,927
-Yeah, she's right.

228
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:09,761
-Oh, all right.

229
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:10,961
Let's hear it.

230
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:14,661
-It began a long time ago,
when I was just a lad.

231
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,561
There was an old
woman in out village

232
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:19,661
who told us a story
about a seaweed child.

233
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:21,894
It's The Seaweed Legend.

234
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:23,961
EVERYONE: The Seaweed Legend?

235
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:27,427
-The legend has it that the
child would steal anything

236
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:31,061
with seaweed on it, from
Takoyaki to Yakisoba noodles

237
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:35,661
to even Okonomiyaki

238
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:36,627
KASUMI: How scary.

239
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,161
[child giggles]

240
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,127
HAPPOSAI: If you think
that's scary, just listen.

241
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:54,361
The seaweed child was known to
put seaweed sprinkle on those

242
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:57,994
who were asleep to make it look
like they were the guilty ones.

243
00:13:58,094 --> 00:13:59,994
That kid was pure evil.

244
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:04,661
But to this day, no
one has ever seen him.

245
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,461
[giggling]

246
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:10,527
And from that, we can't
rule out the seaweed child

247
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:11,927
as a possible suspect.

248
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:13,027
Ah!

249
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,394
-We've heard enough
of your stupid story.

250
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:18,327
-How do we know the
seaweed child isn't you?

251
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:20,027
-I'm telling the truth.

252
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,094
-I don't know what
to believe anymore.

253
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,961
For someone who we
trusted as our master,

254
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,361
and to hear nonsense
is so pitiful.

255
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:31,494
Now you must face
about whip of justice.

256
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:32,961
-Not the whip of justice.

257
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:33,994
Ow, that smarts?

258
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:38,194
-Take that and that
and that and that.

259
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,294
-On, my.

260
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,427
-Ah, don't you think
he's had about enough?

261
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,561
-I know what it may look
like, Nabiki, but believe me,

262
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:47,061
it hurts him a lot
more than it does me.

263
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:49,661
-No, I was just
wondering what that was?

264
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:50,961
-Huh?

265
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:54,027
-Hey, Pop, look
this way for second.

266
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,361
-What do you think you're doing?

267
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,194
-Hold still.

268
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:56,994
Aha!

269
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:57,535
Look!

270
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,494
So, you and the old man
were in this together.

271
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:07,027
-You're disgusting.

272
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:08,327
-The horror.

273
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:10,827
To think of the
shame my own father

274
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,961
will bring to this
training hall.

275
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:17,527
The master and the pupil, guilty
of stealing Takoyaki and then

276
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:21,894
blaming it on some crappy
make-believe monster.

277
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,327
Ah!

278
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:28,061
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

279
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,961
-You should win the Oscar
for that performance.

280
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:32,061
-Why you.

281
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:34,494
-It was just a little
seaweed on my teeth

282
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:36,827
and you think I'm
guilty because of that?

283
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,061
Hey, just a few minutes
ago, you accused

284
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:42,794
Happosai based on the
very same evidence.

285
00:15:42,894 --> 00:15:45,594
-Now you've forced me to tell
you of a legend so horrible,

286
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,327
it's never been told before.

287
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:49,961
It all began many,
many years ago

288
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:53,494
when Takoyaki and Yakisoba
and even Okonomiyaki

289
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:56,494
began to go missing and who
was the culprit, you ask?

290
00:15:56,594 --> 00:16:02,527
Why, a repulsive monster who
ate anything with seaweed on it.

291
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,027
[evil laugh]

292
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:05,861
KASUMI: How scary.

293
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,461
SOUN: But what's even worse, is
the fact that he would sneak up

294
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:11,361
on unsuspecting villagers
AND put seaweed on them

295
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:14,527
as they slept, so they would
be blamed for his crimes.

296
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,827
And that's the legend
of the seaweed monster.

297
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:29,161
-Pretty scary huh?

298
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:32,061
-That's the same
story Happosai told.

299
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:34,261
-And we're sick and tired
of hearing about it.

300
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,561
-You two have some imagination.

301
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:42,427
-Look, everyone.

302
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,294
Up there.

303
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:46,094
-Hey, stop.

304
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:52,527
-All right, who are you?

305
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:53,994
-Sasuke?

306
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:56,561
HAPPOSAI: Good work, Akane.

307
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,461
The man servant from Kuno House.

308
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:01,061
-And why were you
hiding up on our roof?

309
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:03,027
-Sasuke, but why?

310
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:04,161
-But, but, but, I wasn't.

311
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:06,561
-Master, master, look.

312
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:08,461
-What's the problem?

313
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,694
-I found this in the kitchen.

314
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,227
-Let me see.

315
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:13,561
Look, the crest.

316
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:15,794
-Sasuke.

317
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,161
-I don't understand.

318
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:20,427
-Well, it looks like
we've got another suspect.

319
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:21,827
-He is not a suspect.

320
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:23,294
He is the one who did it.

321
00:17:23,394 --> 00:17:24,627
Ah!

322
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:26,827
[laughing]

323
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,094
-Guilty.

324
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:32,927
-And we have the irrefutable
evidence right here.

325
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:34,261
-The chopsticks case.

326
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:38,827
-And it has the crest of
the Kuno family on it.

327
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:39,761
[crying]

328
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,527
-And this proves,
beyond a shadow

329
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,194
of doubt, that's you
were in the kitchen

330
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:44,694
when the crime was perpetrated.

331
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:48,061
-We all know you're the one who
committed the heinous felony.

332
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:51,427
-It's time to punish
the filthy little thief.

333
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:52,494
-Please, wait.

334
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:54,594
I don't even know
what's going on here.

335
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:59,027
Would somebody please
tell me what I did?

336
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:05,461
[drumming]

337
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:11,127
-Sasuke,

338
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:12,194
-Please wait.

339
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:13,594
I don't even know
what's going on here.

340
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:16,394
You have taken the
Tendo family's Takoyaki,

341
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:19,694
and in so doing, you nearly
destroyed this household.

342
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:23,261
Leave this place and take
only your shame with you.

343
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,061
-I am still not getting this.

344
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:27,161
-Are you saying you're innocent?

345
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:28,394
-I don't know.

346
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:30,594
-Well let me put it
another way then.

347
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:34,427
Are you saying that you were in
the kitchen but no one saw you?

348
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:35,427
-I wish I knew.

349
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:41,427
-Then I think it's clear
to everyone here that

350
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:42,294
you're the guilty--

351
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:50,227
-You'd forgotten
about me, didn't You

352
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:51,827
-It's the pigtail girl.

353
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:54,261
-You remember.

354
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,894
-Ah, the pigtail girl.

355
00:18:56,994 --> 00:19:01,161
Oh boy, I can hand here for the
rest of my life and watch you.

356
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:03,461
This is a dream
come true for me.

357
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:04,027
-Who's there?

358
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:14,427
[blubbering]

359
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:16,961
-All right, you little creep.

360
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,627
You want to change your story?

361
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:19,261
-OK.

362
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:20,527
Hold on a minute.

363
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,327
Don't I get a chance to
speak in this kangaroo court?

364
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,661
You gotta at least give me the
courtesy of doing myself in.

365
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:26,527
-OK.

366
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,161
But hurry up and
spill your guts.

367
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:29,927
We generally like
to tar and feather

368
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:31,994
the guilty before dinner.

369
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:35,127
-Maybe I can help solve
this little mystery of yours

370
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:39,394
because I was hanging from
the ceiling the whole time.

371
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:40,527
-Oh.

372
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:43,061
And the key to your
puzzle are these photos

373
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,294
I hold before you in my hand.

374
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,494
Here see for yourself.

375
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,561
Well, what do you think?

376
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:58,794
Hm?

377
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:01,727
-I've had enough of this
mystery business for today.

378
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,194
-I think I'll just watch
some TV or read a book

379
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:06,961
or maybe I'll just sit.

380
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:09,961
-I think I'll join you, Ranma.

381
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:12,194
-But I thought you wanted to--

382
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,494
-Oh, Nabiki, wait up.

383
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,261
Maybe I'll join you
and Ranma and we

384
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,927
can watch a nature
show or something.

385
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:23,827
-So, Saotome, how about a
friendly little game of shogi?

386
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:26,561
-Why that sounds like
a great idea, Tendo.

387
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:28,561
-But this time, don't cheat.

388
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,761
-What do you mean, me cheat?

389
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,427
-Oh, that reminds me.

390
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,661
I must continue my
important research.

391
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:37,861
I don't want to fall
behind, you know.

392
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:42,661
-Hey where'd everybody go?

393
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:44,861
Kasumi, Oh, Miss Kasumi.

394
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,794
Did you see my lovely pictures?

395
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:48,727
Look familiar?

396
00:20:56,794 --> 00:21:01,527
-I suppose it's time I started
making dinner for everyone.

397
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,861
-But what about my photos?

398
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:05,994
Miss Kasumi, wait.

399
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:08,327
-Doesn't anyone want to
come see my pictures?

400
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:09,527
You wanted evidence.

401
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:10,894
I got evidence.

402
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:12,294
I've got negatives too.

403
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:14,261
I'll even blow them
up if you want.

404
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:15,294
Oh, please.

405
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:17,061
It's starting to
get chilly out here

406
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:19,694
and if I can't catch a
cold, it's all your fault.

407
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,227
Then I'll take pictures
of me with a thermometer

408
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:25,594
and improve it in
a court of law.

409
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:30,461
-Ah, never even had a chance
to score that Takoyaki.

410
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,327
-You can say that again.

411
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,127
[music playing]

412
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:17,983
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Ranma gets hold

413
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,016
of some Chinese
incense that allows

414
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:22,416
him to train against a
shadow image of himself.

415
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:25,016
What in the world
is he thinking?

416
00:23:25,116 --> 00:23:28,916
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Ranma versus Shadow Ranma.

417
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:32,516
We'll see you there.
