[music playing]

2
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:13,524
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): I brought
you some souvenirs, Akane.

3
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:15,657
This time I swear,
even if it kills me,

4
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,190
I'm finally gonna tell
you how I feel about you.

5
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:20,357
GIRL 1: Hey, did you
hear about Ranma?

6
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,257
GIRL 2: What?

7
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,257
About his other fiancee?

8
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,157
Sure, it's all over school.

9
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,124
GIRL 1: Incredible, huh?

10
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:26,790
-Don't you think
for someone who says

11
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:28,424
he's not interested
in girls, he's

12
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,190
sure got a lot of girlfriends.

13
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:31,924
-You can say that again.

14
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:33,524
Akane's the one
I'd feel sorry for.

15
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:35,024
GIRL 2: No kidding.

16
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:37,890
If he was my boyfriend, I
think I'd have him neutered.

17
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:42,224
ANNOUNCER: "Ryoga and
Akane: 2-Gether, 4-Ever."

18
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:44,957
-Didn't I tell you they'd
all be gossiping about us?

19
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,224
-Eh, sticks and
stones and all that.

20
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:48,357
-Hey, Ranma!

21
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,590
Ain't you the lucky one.

22
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:51,890
-Way to go!

23
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:53,690
-You don't know what
you're talking about!

24
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:54,957
-Don't blame me.

25
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,657
If she's got a crush,
that's her fault.

26
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,824
RYOGA: Ah, you're the
one who'll be crushed.

27
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:03,790
-Now what'd I do?

28
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:05,090
-Apologize to Akane!

29
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,557
-I didn't do nothing!

30
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,757
-There's lots of
people like you, Ranma!

31
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,190
-I can explain.

32
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:15,890
-Ryoga, please stop!

33
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:17,857
-It was the old man, I tell ya!

34
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,057
-No more excuses!

35
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,124
-C'mon.

36
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:27,257
I got enough trouble with the
uncute fiancee I all ready got.

37
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,557
Why would I want another--

38
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,624
-Go ahead and switch
to the cute one then.

39
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:32,690
Don't let me stop you.

40
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:34,890
-Come on!

41
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:38,124
-Even if your fiancee
looked like this.

42
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:39,790
Or even like this.

43
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:41,690
You'd still have no
excuse for the way you've

44
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:43,457
been treating Akane, you swine.

45
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:47,657
-Wait a minute.

46
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,057
Look at it from
my point of view.

47
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,690
I got two fiancees and I
don't want either of them.

48
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:53,257
-Don't listen to him.

49
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,557
Ranma's free to date the entire
student body for all I care.

50
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,157
-That's right.

51
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,890
-You still got no right to keep
stringing her along like that.

52
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:05,157
I'm going to punish
you for her own good.

53
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,424
Who's there?

54
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:10,557
-Sorry, sugar, but if anyone's
gonna punish my fiance.

55
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,557
-Ukyo?

56
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,724
-It's gonna be me!

57
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:21,624
-I don't know who you are,
but any friend of Ranma's is

58
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:22,557
no friend of mine!

59
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,490
-No, Ryoga!

60
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:24,424
Don't do it.

61
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,790
She's a girl!

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,390
-Good thing I'm not
so easily fooled!

63
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:39,624
-I'd take another look, stupid.

64
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:42,190
And while we're at
it, flower bomb!

65
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:50,424
-Got ya!

66
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:57,824
-Still think she's a boy?

67
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:05,290
-Why you--

68
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,690
-Heh.

69
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:12,390
You sucker.

70
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:13,424
Now what?

71
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:14,624
Would you have rather been hit?

72
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:15,957
-You jackass.

73
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,890
You didn't have to show
him my chest, you know?

74
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:18,726
-Ryoga?

75
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,690
Thank goodness.

76
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:34,357
I was beginning to
worry about you.

77
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,324
-Oh, hi there.

78
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:39,790
-You did it for me, didn't you?

79
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:44,490
-I-- I really hope that
you're not too angry at me.

80
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,290
-How could I ever
be angry at you?

81
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:53,457
-I-- Akane, I--

82
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,857
-Ryoga, I didn't know you cared!

83
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,990
-Honestly, why
can't he just leave

84
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:09,524
you alone Don't let
him get to you, OK?

85
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:11,890
After all, he's
not mature, is he?

86
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:13,657
I mean, not like you.

87
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,690
-Huh?

88
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:18,057
Yeah, well-- hm, mature, huh?

89
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:32,124
Oh, who am I kidding.

90
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:34,757
If I were really mature,
I'd just say it, and not

91
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,657
be such a, such a--

92
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,024
-And not be such
a wimp, you mean?

93
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:42,857
If you like her, just say so.

94
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,757
I'm on your side.

95
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,624
You're Ryoga, am I right?

96
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:50,857
I'm Ukyo, Ukyo Kuonji,
I'm Ranma's cute fiance.

97
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,924
-Oh, I can see why
he's kept you a secret.

98
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,724
A date with Akane,
are you crazy?

99
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:59,757
I'd do almost
anything if we could--

100
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,790
I know that she
would never say yes.

101
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:02,624
-Wouldn't she?

102
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:03,657
-What has she said?

103
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,990
Have you talked to her already?

104
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,190
-Watch out, that's
hot, you know.

105
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:11,057
You just leave
everything to me, OK?

106
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,357
Trust me sugar,
when she sees this,

107
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,324
she won't be able to stay away.

108
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:16,657
-I don't know if I'm ready.

109
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,390
I mean, a d-date
is kinda serious.

110
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:19,357
You know, I mean what--

111
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,524
-Hey!

112
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:23,057
Do you want to date
her or dontcha?

113
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,557
-Yeah.

114
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,357
-OK then.

115
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,890
-And here we go.

116
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:32,524
Akane Tendo, blah,
blah, blah, love Ryoga.

117
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:33,957
Tell me where she
lives, and I'll

118
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,457
deliver it to her personally.

119
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:39,124
Finally.

120
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:50,790
Leave it to that jackass Ryoga
to draw me a map that leads me

121
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:55,690
through half of Tokyo
before coming here.

122
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:56,990
And, it's almost dawn.

123
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:04,624
-Slept in Akane's bed again
last night, did you, Mr. P?

124
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:06,157
-Someone left this for me?

125
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,390
-I found it on the front step
first thing this morning.

126
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:10,457
-Wonder what it is?

127
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,724
-Wait up, you [inaudible]!

128
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:14,324
AKANE: Hey!

129
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:15,324
Hey!

130
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:16,790
What's the matter with you?

131
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:19,124
-I wish they wouldn't play
with other people's food.

132
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:19,657
-Huh?

133
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,857
What's this?

134
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,790
Akane Tendo, I'll
be waiting for you

135
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,590
at Ucchan's
Okonomiyaki today at 2.

136
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,157
A challenge letter.

137
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,524
[grunts]

138
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:29,690
RANMA: You what?

139
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:32,257
set Akane and
Ryoga up on a date?

140
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,357
UKYO: Sure did.

141
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,190
Delivered the invitation myself.

142
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,190
They're meeting this
afternoon at my restaurant.

143
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:40,490
-There's no way Akane is
going to go on some date.

144
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:42,357
UKYO (VOICEOVER):
He seems so certain.

145
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,890
-You don't know her like I do.

146
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:47,224
I mean, can't you just imagine
what she's up to already?

147
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:48,924
Ooh, what am I gonna wear?

148
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:51,824
Hope my workout doesn't
make me sweat too much.

149
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:53,124
Et cetera, et cetera.

150
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,457
Which is why this little
romantic plan of yours

151
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,924
is never going to work out.

152
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:59,024
UKYO (VOICEOVER): And here
they call me unfeminine.

153
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:01,390
Maybe I really am
the cute fiance.

154
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:03,390
I hope she takes
the bate anyway.

155
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,690
-Where's, uh--

156
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:16,090
-Who, Akane?

157
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,524
She left a while ago, and
she seemed very excited

158
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,557
about something.

159
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,957
-Excited?

160
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,557
-She also asked me to ask
you to leave her alone.

161
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,924
Let her handle it and stay
the heck out of her business.

162
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:28,457
-Heh.

163
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,057
Uh--

164
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:32,990
-What's wrong with him?

165
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:38,257
-Don't interfere, huh?

166
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,990
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
Nah, nana, nah, nah!

167
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:42,324
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Leave us alone, Ranma.

168
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:43,490
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Oh, Akane.

169
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:44,690
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Oh, Ryoga.

170
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:49,290
-Oh, no not if I can help it.

171
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:50,524
-Well.

172
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,390
-Akane, you decided
to come after all.

173
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:54,957
-And why wouldn't I?

174
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,590
-Well, I guess Ranma wasn't
kidding about you being uncute

175
00:09:57,624 --> 00:09:58,924
now, was he?

176
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:01,157
I at least thought you'd
shower before your date.

177
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,657
-My date?

178
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,590
What date?

179
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:03,590
-Never mind that.

180
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:06,124
You just sit yourself down--

181
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:08,257
-I-- I made it.

182
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,090
-Ry-- Ryoga?

183
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,757
RYOGA: Good thing I gave
myself plenty of time.

184
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,190
-What about your challenge?

185
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:15,990
-What challenge?

186
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:17,590
-I bought them on the way out.

187
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:18,990
-Thanks, I think.

188
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,457
-Now that you're
both here-- and so,

189
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,390
in honor of your very first
date, this one's on me, OK?

190
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:28,790
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Date, huh?

191
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:30,890
Now I get it, she's trying
to set me up with Ryoga

192
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:33,357
so she can have
Ranma for herself.

193
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,724
Think again.

194
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:37,257
And here she's got poor,
good-hearted Ryoga messed

195
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,290
up in this too.

196
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:45,724
-Eat up you two,
or it'll get cold.

197
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:47,690
-Mm, it's pretty good, huh?

198
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,290
-Uh, yeah.

199
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:51,224
-Ah, you crazy kids.

200
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:54,190
[music playing]

201
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:02,715
[music playing]

202
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:09,715
-What am I gonna do?

203
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:11,848
Should I tell her,
or-- here's my chance.

204
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,915
But, what if she doesn't--
if I don't do it now,

205
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:18,581
I may never get another
chance to tell Akane that--

206
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:20,548
that I love her.

207
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,281
-Ryoga--

208
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:22,281
-Akane, I--

209
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:28,315
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Where's
Ukyo when I need her?

210
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:29,348
-Hi, kids.

211
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:30,881
You two getting along?

212
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:34,581
I've got a quick errand to
run, so I'll see you two later.

213
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:35,915
-W-wait!

214
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:38,415
UKYO: You guys have fun now.

215
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,881
-Huh?

216
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,148
Hey-- hey, hold on!

217
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,915
You're not leaving?

218
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:45,015
-Of course I'm leaving, idiot.

219
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:47,081
I thought you wanted
to be alone with her!

220
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,648
-I do, I do, but
I need your help.

221
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,581
-It's a date in
case you forgotten!

222
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:52,181
-I know, but I--I can't.

223
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:53,415
I mean, she hasn't--

224
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:56,015
-Were you born stupid or
did you just grow that way?

225
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,115
-Excuse me, but if
Ryoga doesn't want to,

226
00:11:58,148 --> 00:12:01,015
I don't see any reason
why we have to force him.

227
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:01,548
-He wants to!

228
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:02,948
-I want to!

229
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,781
-Akane, from the very
first moment I saw you,

230
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:12,815
I knew that I was in--
Hey, who did that?

231
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:16,115
-Ryoga, darling, how could you?

232
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:17,981
How could you even
look at another girl

233
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:19,548
when you've got me, two-timer!

234
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,048
-I've never seen you
before in my life!

235
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:23,415
You must have me confused
with someone else!

236
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:24,948
C'mon, let me go!

237
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:27,415
You can't just come out of
nowhere and that stuff like--

238
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:28,281
-Huh?

239
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,415
-Hmm, alright.

240
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,081
Who are you?

241
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:32,448
-Who am I?

242
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:34,315
You don't know?

243
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:35,981
I am Ryoga's fiancee!

244
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:40,748
-(IN UNISON): Fiancee?

245
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,215
-I didn't know.

246
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:47,881
How long have you--

247
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:49,615
-I'm not surprised
you don't remember.

248
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,515
After all, we were
but babes when

249
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:53,481
our well meaning, yet
meddlesome parents

250
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:55,348
decided that we should-- ah!

251
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:57,148
-What is the matter with you?

252
00:12:57,181 --> 00:12:59,881
-Hey, we are in the middle
of a romantic moment here?

253
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,548
-Now I've known
you've gone crazy.

254
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,881
-What am I-- what am I gonna do?

255
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:05,448
-Stupid!

256
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,048
Snap out of it.

257
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:09,548
Are you gonna let some stranger
steal your one and only chance

258
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,615
for happiness?

259
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:12,281
-Yeah, that's right.

260
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:13,648
What on Earth was I thinking?

261
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:15,815
There's only one girl for me!

262
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:19,515
-Akane, I-- you're the one.

263
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,781
You're the only one--

264
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:26,681
-Wha?

265
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:27,648
What are you doing?

266
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,215
-I won't let you abandon me.

267
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:31,815
I won't, do you hear me?

268
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:39,581
-She can't just waltz in
here and do that everything

269
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,181
I've done to bring
them together!

270
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:43,981
C'mon, darling, let's
run away together.

271
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:44,996
-W--wait!

272
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:48,381
-No fair!

273
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:55,981
UKYO: Pretty sneaky ain't she?

274
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,715
But she can't have gone far.

275
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:00,748
Let's split up and
look for them, OK?

276
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:01,848
GIRL: Uh, sure.

277
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:06,081
-Hey, I didn't do nothing wrong.

278
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,281
Why do I have to sneak
around like some kind of--

279
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,348
-Sh!

280
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,215
-I won't!

281
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:11,048
Why should I?

282
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,615
I don't have to listen to you!

283
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:15,248
-Is there someone you're
in love with, P-chan?

284
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,015
-Wha?

285
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:17,709
Ahh--

286
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:22,181
-How do you know about the--

287
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:25,448
-Oh, but my darling, I
know everything about you.

288
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:29,215
Your likes, your dislikes,
that you turn into a pig.

289
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,215
-Mm, no.

290
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:33,281
And yet-- and yet
you still want me?

291
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:34,348
-I what?

292
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:35,381
-I'm so happy.

293
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:36,281
-Wait.

294
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:37,815
You didn't understand.

295
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:41,581
You don't think that I-- you
don't really think that we--

296
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,381
-That we were meant to be.

297
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,081
RANMA: Ah!

298
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:44,915
RYOGA: Ah!

299
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,048
What do you think you're doing?

300
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,015
Get off of me!

301
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:48,748
Hey, quit it!

302
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,181
I'm not that kind of girl!

303
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:55,581
Go away!

304
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:57,015
-Did he hurt you?

305
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:59,815
I'm so sorry you got
mixed up in all of this.

306
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:05,015
Why do you keep
torturing him like this?

307
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:06,615
-Gee, what's the matter, Akane?

308
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:08,515
Did I spoil your little date?

309
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:12,248
-Hey-- hey, you're
jealous, aren't you?

310
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,981
Aren't you?

311
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,296
-Jealous!

312
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:16,016
Who, me?

313
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,015
Of an alley cat like you?

314
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:19,748
-Ah, alley cat?

315
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:22,281
-One lousy love letter
driveled in sauce

316
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:24,115
and you're raring to go.

317
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:24,715
Huh?

318
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:33,048
-If you were any more rare
and to go, you'd be nude!

319
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:33,748
You pervert!

320
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:37,781
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Honestly, I thought

321
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,981
it was a challenge, not a date.

322
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:41,281
Fine, Ranma.

323
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,681
That's the way you want it,
that's the way you got it.

324
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:44,869
RANMA: Ah, man!

325
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:49,436
She didn't have
to flash me first.

326
00:15:49,469 --> 00:15:52,469
If I get caught wearing some
dress, I'll never live it down.

327
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,603
UKYO: I'm ready.

328
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,869
Thanks for waiting.

329
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:11,569
-Huh?

330
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,169
-Ryoga?

331
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:18,369
Betcha thought I'd
never come out, huh?

332
00:16:18,403 --> 00:16:22,403
-Oh, oh no, I,
uh-- well, I, uh--

333
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,336
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): This
has got to be a dream.

334
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:27,003
Why else would she--
that is unless she kinda,

335
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,103
sorta likes me too.

336
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:32,869
-Stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid!

337
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:33,769
-What?

338
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:34,703
Ryoga, wha-- what's--

339
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:35,769
-That didn't hurt.

340
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,136
That means it is a dream.

341
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:43,003
That one hurt a little bit.

342
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,703
It really is real, then.

343
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,336
-Let's get out of here, Ryoga.

344
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,836
-Sure.

345
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,903
-Ain't she all gussied up?

346
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:57,569
Yeah, whatever.

347
00:16:57,603 --> 00:16:58,603
-Ran-chan!

348
00:16:58,636 --> 00:16:59,969
What happened to you?

349
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,803
-I'll tell you later.

350
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:05,969
-Hey, do you want to make
them jealous for a change?

351
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:07,703
-Sure.

352
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,303
-Yes!

353
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,469
Gee, after the way
Akane treated you,

354
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:23,136
I thought this would
be the last place

355
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,603
you would want to come to.

356
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:25,603
-Hm?

357
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:26,203
-What is it?

358
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,969
RANMA: P-P-P-P-chan!

359
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:37,736
You little pig go oink, oink!

360
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:38,369
-Huh?

361
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:38,903
P-chan?

362
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,236
Where is he?

363
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,403
-You have all of these
right in front of you.

364
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,203
-Mom, would you but
out, we're busy.

365
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:45,069
RANMA: Oink, oink.

366
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:46,836
Oink, oink, oink, oink.

367
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:49,103
-I'm warning you, I mean it!

368
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,436
-You to just pretend
we're not here.

369
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:54,169
Ranma and I are on a date, too.

370
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:57,703
-So, after all the trouble
you went through to set us up.

371
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:02,836
Finally got what you wanted!

372
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:03,803
-Ranma, honey.

373
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,403
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Idiot.

374
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:08,203
That two-timer's got no right
to call himself Akane's fiancee.

375
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:15,369
- Who are you
calling a two-timer?

376
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,969
-You mean to tell you
everything you've said,

377
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:28,636
the precious moments that we've
shared have all been a lie!

378
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:30,669
-No, I mean-- uh--

379
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:31,803
-Face it, Buster.

380
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:33,336
I'm the only girl
you'll ever know

381
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,969
who doesn't mind that you
turn into a little black pig.

382
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:37,636
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): She's
right, she's right.

383
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,969
This may be my only
chance for happiness.

384
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:45,236
-You've interfered with me for
the last time, whoever you are!

385
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:47,536
Darling, we were
meant to be together.

386
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,736
You're the only man
for me, my love.

387
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:51,503
-Do you really mean it?

388
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:56,603
-I'd get while the
getting's good, Ranma.

389
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,603
-Did you say Ranma?

390
00:18:58,636 --> 00:18:59,403
-Ranma?

391
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:00,769
I don't see any Ranmas here.

392
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:02,936
Do you?

393
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:05,369
-I see one right here!

394
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:07,169
Ranma!

395
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:09,703
This isn't the first time
you've done this to me.

396
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:17,403
But it'll be the last.

397
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,969
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): No
matter how I look at it,

398
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:41,103
in my heart I've betrayed Akane.

399
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,436
-I don't believe you!

400
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:44,503
Are you proud of
tricking Ryoga like that?

401
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,003
Ryoga, I'm so sorry.

402
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,269
I really don't know why
he keeps teasing you.

403
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,736
RYOGA: Akane, it's OK.

404
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:51,703
I'm leaving.

405
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:54,469
This is our last goodbye.

406
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:55,903
-Huh?

407
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:57,469
-Wait!

408
00:19:57,503 --> 00:20:00,803
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): I no longer
have the right to love you.

409
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:01,903
-Ryoga!

410
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,436
-This is all your fault.

411
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,403
-Hey, I didn't know he was
going to take it this hard, OK?

412
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:18,869
-P-chan?

413
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:21,736
How in the world
did you get here?

414
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:22,336
Don't go!

415
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:26,703
Come here, baby.

416
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:34,003
-Where's Ryoga?

417
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:36,203
Gee, I hope he
hasn't gone too far.

418
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,936
-I sure wish we knew
where he was right now.

419
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:42,336
-Closer than you
think, as usual.

420
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:44,936
-Hey, you're not
really Ranma, are you?

421
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:46,236
-I'm not?

422
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:48,636
-My Ranma is twice the
man he ought to be.

423
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:51,869
Tell me what you've
done with him or else!

424
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:53,503
-You asked for it.

425
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:55,103
UKYO: Oh, poor baby.

426
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:56,503
You really had it rough.

427
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:02,836
But I have to admit, having
you this way is a lot more fun.

428
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:03,569
-For who?

429
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:04,969
-I mean it.

430
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:06,769
I want you to promise me that
you'll apologize to Ryoga when

431
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:08,669
he comes back from his trip.

432
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:11,969
And like other people I can
name, Ryoga is sensitive.

433
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,169
-You don't say.

434
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:16,169
-Your behavior was inexcusable.

435
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:19,536
-Well I don't think he's
going to hold it against me.

436
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,803
Do you, P-chan?

437
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:24,536
-I could keep doing
this for hours.

438
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:27,103
-I'm not a play thing!

439
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,069
-Don't be so selfish, Ran-chan!

440
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:30,169
Share the wealth.

441
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:33,103
-What did I do to deserve-- Hey!

442
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:34,603
You're in no position to laugh!

443
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,174
[music playing]

444
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,540
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ah!

445
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:18,307
Ranma, what do you
think you're doing?

446
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,407
How dare you grab me
like that and then try

447
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,807
to pin it on Shampoo!

448
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,374
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"Sneeze Me, Squeeze Me,

449
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:25,407
Please Me!

Shampoo's Recipe For Disaster!"

451
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:28,907
We'll see you there!
