Ryoga, The Eternal Lost Boy."

RYOGA (VOICEOVER): I don't
think that this is the place,

4
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,716
but I better go
and check anyway.

00:02:58,249 --> 00:02:58,716
-Agh!

6
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,516
This is a disaster!

7
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:05,483
A wild boar is coming!

-That boar's gonna tear
this here village to pieces!

12
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:34,749
Huh?

13
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:35,249
Hey, you!

00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:38,216
Look out!

00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:38,716
Run for it!

Huh?

17
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:58,449
-He stopped that wild boar
with a bamboo umbrella!

18
00:03:58,483 --> 00:03:59,283
-Well, hot damn.

19

-He's dang strong!

20
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,749
-Do you reckon he's human?

21
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:23,283
-Do y'all do the martial
arts or something?

Huh?

-Tell me, where is
Furinkan High School?

Hm.

Hm.

Hey, don't you know?

29
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:39,849
That there's a map of Tokyo.

00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:41,549
-Well, of course.

31
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,549
The school's around
here somewhere.

00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,516
-But this here's Shikoku.

-Shikoku?

34
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:53,583
Very well.

35
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:54,083
Goodbye.

36
00:04:58,649 --> 00:04:59,783
-What was that?

37
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,883
-This is a battle of
honor between men.

38
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,249
You won't hide
from me any longer.

Just you wait, Ranma Saotome!

NABIKI: Ranma, you
come back here!

41
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,816
Come back here, I said!

42
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:31,783
-No way.

43
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:32,749
Uh-uh.

44
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:34,149
Absolutely not.

45
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,349
-You can't keep running around
the house half-naked, you know?

46
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:41,916
-I'm a guy, OK?

47
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,949
There's no way I'm gonna let
you dress me up like a girl.

48
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:44,949
So forget it!

49
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:46,783
-But all your clothes
are in the wash.

50
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:49,383
It's only for a
little while, Ranma.

51
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,316
-I'm sorry, Ranma.

52
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,249
-Let me go draw you a nice bath.

RANMA (VOICEOVER):
There's no way. .

-Listen, Ranma.

55
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:59,649
Remember, you're a
guest in our house.

56
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:00,949
-Uh.

57
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,783
-Your hot baths are heating
us out of house and home.

58
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:06,416
We can't afford to
pay the gas bills.

59
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,749
You see what I'm saying?

60
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,449
-Yeah.

61
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:10,683
-OK.

62
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:12,283
So you'll wear this, right?

63
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:13,749
-OK

64
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,049
NABIKI: I think not, Kasumi.

65
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,949
KASUMI: But the frills
on this one are so sweet.

66
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:19,016
-I don't know.

67
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:21,083
I really think this
one is much better.

68
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:22,016
-But--

69
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,016
-Kasumi, you've
gotta be kidding.

70
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,383
-Hey, you guys.

71
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,449
Why does Ranma have to
borrow my clothes anyway?

72
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,216
-Forget it.

73
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,583
I ain't wearing no skirt.

74
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,116
No way!

75
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,016
-Look at that.

76
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,749
It's a perfect fit.

77
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:36,583
-Well?

78
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:37,583
-It's too tight.

79
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:38,683
Look at this.

80
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:40,383
It pinches my chest.

81
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,449
-What about the waist?

82
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:43,783
-Too baggy.

83
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:44,283
-Uh-oh.

84
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,349
-Ahh!

85
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:51,816
Die, Ranma!

86
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,349
RANMA: Hey, cut it out, stupid!

88
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:54,983
Let's not fight.

89
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:55,749
RANMA: I told you.

00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:56,716
I'm a guy!

91

-Furinkan High School?

92
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:17,116
This here ain't Tokyo, boy.

93
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,049
-This wouldn't be Hokkaido?

94
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:25,683
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Why?

95
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:27,683
Why can't I ever
get where I'm going?

96
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:30,883
What's wrong with me?

97
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,483
-That there road there,
boy, goes straight

98
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:35,583
to the Seikan Tunnel
just up the way.

99
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:38,149
Now if you really
wanna go to Tokyo,

100
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:41,316
y'all gotta go straight
down that there road.

101
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,383
-Go straight, you say?

102
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,849
-Yes, sir.

103
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:46,116
Straight as the
crow flies, you bet.

104
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,716
-Thanks for your help!

105
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,149
-Y'all come back now, you hear?

106
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,216
-Straight it is!

107
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,416
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): I can do it!

108
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,416
I can make it to Tokyo!

109
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:19,616

RANMA: No way.

114
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,449
Leave me alone!

115
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:03,349
-Stop running!

116
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:06,849
-Hold it a minute!

117
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:07,816
-Cut it out!

118
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:10,283
-Give it up, Saotome!

119
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,283
-Wait!

120
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,783
I told you I'm a guy!

121
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,583
-Who-- Whose crackpot
idea was that anyway?

122
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:41,249
-Maybe I'd better
ask for directions.

123
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:42,883
Where is Furinkan High School?

124
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,683
-Well, howdy there.

125
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:50,516
I didn't know you
was all still here.

126
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,249
-Sorry to bother you.

127
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,916
-I have a feeling
he'll be back again.

128
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:02,416
-Uh-huh.

129
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:02,916
Uh-huh.

130
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:08,649
-Damn it all!

131
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:11,749
It seems like I've
been traveling forever.

132
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:14,316
Why can't I make it to Tokyo?

133
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:17,416
Ranma Saotome, I will
never allow you to escape!

134
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:25,316
Just you wait, Ranma!

135
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:26,683
AKANE: Just you wait, Ranma!

136
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:43,849
-Which way you heading home?

137
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:44,649
-I'm going by the store.

138
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:45,383
Are you gonna come with me?

139
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,683
-Wait up, guys.

140
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,416
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Maybe I
should find out where I am.

141
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:58,249
-Hey, where is
Furinkan High School?

142
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,616
-Huh?

143
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,183
-I said, where is
Furinkan High School?!

144
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:20,049
Fu-rin-kan High School.

145
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:24,849
At last, I've-- I've
finally made it.

146
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,883
Tell me I'm not dreaming.

147
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,483
-Mm-hm.

148
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,583
Mm-hm.

149
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:31,183
-Now tell me where I
can find Ranma Saotome.

150
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:34,349
-Uh-- Saotome?

151
00:11:34,383 --> 00:11:35,016
-Wait, Ranma!

152
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,183
How dare you!

153
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:37,616
Come back here, you jerk!

154
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,845
You heard me!

155
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,779
-Ranma, prepare to die!

156
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:08,079
I found you, Ranma Saotome.

157
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,587
-Ranma.

158
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:25,969
-So I still you're still good
at running away, Saotome.

159
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:27,902
-You know this guy?

160
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,369
-I feel as though
I've been waiting

161
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:32,235
for this moment for
thousands of years.

162
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:33,969
-Hey.

163
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,269
You do know him?

164
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:38,369
-Are you still
feigning ignorance?

165
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:39,269
-Come on.

166
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:42,135
Do you know him or what?

167
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,569
-Hm.

168
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:44,535
-What?

169
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:45,869
You mean you really
don't remember?

170
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:49,935
-Ah!

171
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,402
-You remember?

172
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,902
-Do you remember?

173
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,102
-Uh--

174
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:57,835
-I wouldn't want you to
strain your brain, Ranma.

175
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:58,902
-Enough.

176
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:01,602
But answer me one
thing, Saotome.

177
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:04,802
Why didn't you come to fight
me at the appointed time?!

178
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:07,169
-A fight?

179
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,369
-Oh!

180
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:09,702
I remember.

181
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:13,202
You and I were classmates
in junior high, right?

182
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:16,302
It was uh-- um--

183
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,669
-It's Ryoga Hibiki!

184
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:18,935
-Yeah, something like that.

185
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:19,969
Yeah.

186
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,202
-Ryoga Hibiki?

187
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,902
-Long time no see!

188
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:25,835
Huh?

189
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,902
-Just answer my question.

190
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,502
Tell me!

191
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:33,202
Why didn't you
come to the fight?

192
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:37,835
-But I-- Ryoga, I waited
for you at the agreed place

193
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:39,269
for three days.

194
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:41,069
-Three days?

195
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,469
-Oh, sure.

196
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:46,044
You waited three days, but when
I got there on the fourth day,

197
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:48,677
you already turned tail and ran!

198
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:50,644
-Fourth day?

199
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:55,777
-Uh-- Ryoga, Let me
ask you a question.

200
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,977
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but the place where

201
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:00,111
we agreed to meet
for the fight was

202
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,477
the vacant lot behind
your house, right?

203
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:05,411
So why the heck did I have to
wait for three days for you

204
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:05,911
to show?

205
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:17,577
-Don't patronize me!

206
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:18,944
Do you think I
was just strolling

207
00:14:18,977 --> 00:14:20,977
around Japan for my health?

208
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,344
-So what were you doing?

209
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:26,811
-Listen, you have absolutely no
idea the troubles I've endured.

210
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:33,144
Ranma Saotome, today is
the day I shall break you!

211
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:45,411
-What?

212
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:47,944
No, this is Yamashima.

213
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:48,577
-No, you idiot!

214
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:49,477
This is Asakusa.

215
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,477
Can't you read a map?

216
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:55,111
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Where did
they move that cursed lot?

217
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:55,677
-What?

218
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:58,011
Are you nuts?

219
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,211
-You gotta be kidding.

220
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:00,177
This is Yokohama.

221
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:07,611
-I finally-- I finally--
finally made it.

222
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:08,577
Finally made it.

223
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,877
Damn you, Ranma Saotome!

224
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,777
You coward!

225
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:18,411
-No sense of direction, eh?

226
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:19,144
Can't read a map.

227
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:19,944
-What's with this idiot?

228
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:21,277
Can't find his way anywhere.

229
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:24,411
-You went and broke
a man to man promise.

230
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:26,944
And then you dare to run off
to China with your father?

231
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:31,477
-So let me get this
straight-- you came here

232
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:32,311
to finish the fight?

233
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:34,344
-I don't wanna to finish it!

234
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:38,177
The fight has just begun!

235
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:40,077
This is revenge!

236
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:40,844
-Revenge?

237
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:42,344
Revenge for what?

238
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:44,811
What did I ever do to you to
make you want revenge on me?

239
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:50,311
-Don't play dumb with me.

240
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:52,544
I'm going to destroy
your happiness.

241
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,177
You got it?

242
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,611
-My-- my happiness?

243
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:01,411
Akane, tell me something.

244
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:02,844
Am I happy?

245
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:05,377
-What are you asking me for?

246
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:06,844
Just what did you do to him.

247
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:08,944
Tell me, Ranma.

248
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:10,744
-That's what I'd like to know.

249
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,411
AKANE: This isn't any
old grudge, Ranma.

250
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:14,811
He's furious!

251
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:16,777
RANMA: Hm.

252
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,544
-Enough stalling already.

253
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,344
Let's fight, Ranma!

254
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:23,477
-Watch out!

255
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:26,744
-Ryoga.

256
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:32,044
-That's amazing.

257
00:16:32,077 --> 00:16:33,577
-Excuse me for a sec, huh?

258
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:35,477
Wait here.

259
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,211
-Hey, come back here.

260
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:38,411
-I'll be back in a sec!

261
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:42,577
-Ranma.

262
00:16:56,777 --> 00:17:02,544
-Mr. Saotome, you are
a very hard worker.

263
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:05,411
Oh,, what have you got there?

264
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,411
Ah, some bread.

265
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,377
You're the breadwinner,
aren't you?

266
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,211
-Curry bread?

267
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:15,811
What the?

268
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:16,977
Tell me, Saotome.

269
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:18,144
Now what are you?

270
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:18,977
-How's about it?

271
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:19,877
Forgive and forget.

272
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,744
What do you say?

273
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:23,644
-You mock me.

274
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:25,077
-Jeez, you're greedy.

275
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,244
OK, here.

276
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:28,377
Chow Mein bread, croquette
bread, melon bread,

277
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:30,611
cutlet sandwich, meat
bread, seaweed bread.

278
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:34,344
Happy now?

279
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:36,611
I didn't forget anything, did I?

280
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:40,111
-What do you take me
for, Ranma Saotome?

281
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,077
-Yeah, Ranma.

282
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:42,511
What do you take him for?

283
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:43,844
-Hm?

284
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:46,744
Oh well, I went to an all-boy
junior high school, Akane.

285
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:48,611
You got no idea what it's like.

286
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:50,777
Lunchtime was just
like a battlefield.

287
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:51,611
It was terrible.

288
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:05,544
-All right, boys.

289
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:06,644
That's it.

290
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:09,877
Here it comes, the last
curry bread of the day.

291
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:13,277
-Gimme some bread, please!

292
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:13,777
-I got it!

293
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:21,177
TEACHER: Five bean jam buns.

294
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,444
When these are gone,
there ain't no more.

295
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,844
Who wants 'em?

296
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:26,144
-How dare you?

297
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:27,011
Who are you?

298
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,744
-Ranma Saotome.

299
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,044
-Saotome, I will
never forgive you.

300
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:37,344
You stole my bread!

301
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,077
You lousy thief!

302
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:41,977
-You were blubbering
over a piece of bread

303
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:43,344
for crying out loud.

304
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:44,344
-Oh, shut up.

305
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:45,444
-But I don't understand.

306
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:47,877
I mean, bread's not
such a big deal, is it?

307
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:49,777
-Yeah, that's what
I thought, but--

308
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,644
TEACHER: Smell it
and weep, boys.

309
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,677
The last Chow Mein
bread of the day.

310
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:54,611
RANMA: And.

311
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:55,644
TEACHER: The last
croquette bread!

312
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,677
RANMA: And.

313
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:59,011
TEACHER: The last melon bread!

314
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:00,444
Cutlet sandwich!

315
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:02,044
Meat bread!

316
00:19:02,077 --> 00:19:04,511
-Let's see, seaweed
bread, egg bread--

317
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,377
uh-- salad sandwich,
soup bread-- no wait.

318
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:08,744
There's no such thing.

319
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:12,244
-Sounds like the straws
that broke the camel's back.

320
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,877
-Yeah, whatever.

321
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:18,344
-For your information, this
goes far beyond bread, Saotome.

322
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:19,144
-Does it really?

323
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:21,511
-Of course it does!

324
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,444
-So what is it now?

325
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:24,477
-Don't play dumb!

326
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:30,611
-Tell me what this is all about.

327
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:34,944
-Because of you,
Saotome, I've seen hell.

328
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:36,311
-I wish you'd just talk to me

329
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,144
-As if mere words could
convey my suffering.

330
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:47,211
I missed him.

331
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:51,911
Ranma, where are you?!

332
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:59,144
Ranma!

333
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,111
Ranma!

334
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:01,777
Where are you?!

335
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:02,677
Where are you?!

336
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:07,177
-Now where did he go to?

337
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:07,811
Is he lost?

338
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:12,944
-Ranma!

339
00:20:12,977 --> 00:20:14,277
where are you?

340
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,044
Where did you go?

341
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:23,111
Hey, watch where
you're-- A-- a panda?

342
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:31,444
[gulp]

343
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:33,344
-Now what do we do?

344
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:35,477
Where did everybody go?

345
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:37,577
-It seems they've all
gone home, I guess.

346
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:49,344
-Ranma, where are you?

347
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:03,211
I better ask for directions.

348
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:04,877
Where is Furinkan High School?

349
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,711
-Well, y'all came back.

350
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:19,477
You poor youngin.

351
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,211
-By the looks of it, y'all
must be halfway to starving.

352
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:23,177
-Uh-huh.

353
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:24,144
-Listen here.

354
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:26,111
Why don't y'all
forget about Tokyo,

355
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,344
and stay with us here
in this here village?

356
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:30,611
-Uh-huh.

357
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:31,111
-Ugh!

358
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:31,811
No way!

359
00:21:31,844 --> 00:21:32,877
Out of the question.

360
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:33,944
Sorry for bothering you!

361
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:40,211
-That boy could darn well
be this town's first tourist

362
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:40,977
attraction.

363
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:42,611
-Uh-huh.

364
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:44,544
-Curse that Ranma Saotome.

365
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:46,877
He's fled from me once again.

366
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:49,244
I'll get you for
sure by next week.

367
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:50,999
Just you wait!

368
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,477
Ow!

369
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:55,644

AKANE (VOICEOVER): Hey,
Ranma, what are you gonna do?

372
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,000
Looks like Ryoga
sent you a challenge,

373
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:43,400
and he looks so strong.

374
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:47,400
Doesn't it seem like everyone's
out to hurt you, Ranma?

375
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:50,466
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
"School Is A Battlefield.

376
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,433
Ranma Versus Ryoga"
See you there.
