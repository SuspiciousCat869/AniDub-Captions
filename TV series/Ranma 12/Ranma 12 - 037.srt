There's nothing for you
to be embarrassed about.

Oh, Akane, I was beginning to
think that you would never--

00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:43,455
That's salt.

AKANE: And vanilla extract?

They're no good either!

The smell of the

is overpowering everything.

The vanilla extract and garlic
I chopped into the dough

completely destroyed the hidden
notes of cherry and watermelon.

And for some mysterious
reason the corn starch

I dissolved in hot water and
blended in with the flour

brick-like consistency.

Ranma will never agree

-My, who knew you were
so fond of photos?

333
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:47,360
In that case, eat
your hearts content.

334
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:49,826
-Uh.

-(VOICEOVER) This
could go on forever.

336
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,793
I'm gonna have to
come up with a plan.

337
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,893
I'd much rather
eat the negative.

338
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,693
-All right, the
negative it is then.

339
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,493
But how shall I
prepare it for you?

340
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:00,626
-Uh, plain.

341
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,893
-Very well, my darling.

342
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,660
Look for it in the
collar of my dear pet,

343
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:06,960
Mr. Green Turtle, who
lives in Yonder Pond.

344
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,926
-Some kind of turtle, huh?

345
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,626
OK.

346
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,960
-Mm, not quite, darling.

-There it is.

The last one in's a rotten egg.

350
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:21,660
Huh!

351
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:25,226
OK, Mr. Turtle, come to mama.

352
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,226
Huh?

Mr. Green Turtle, huh?

356
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,860
Stay still, you, and give
me that negative or I'm

357
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:43,393
gonna have to-- ahh!

358
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:44,393
Uh, uh.

359
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:45,960
-Oh dear, I forgot.

SASUKE SARUGAKURE: The cry
came from the pond, Master.

-Oh.

365

-Here she lies, her beauty makes
this pond of feasting presence.

366
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,726
Thou art yet so fair.

Thy garments are still warm .

-Though the honey of thy
breath hath been sucked,

thou art not conquered.

00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,493
-I think I'll throw up now.

-Leave you no friendly
drop to help me after?

-Huh, you shouldn't have.

-That sounds like Akane Tendo.

You've come to date
with me, haven't you?

Oh!

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,593
-I'm looking for
Ranma, you idiot.

380

Where are you hiding him?

-Excuse me?

384
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,526
-Seeing as Ranma has come
to me of his own free will

385
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,642
he will want you to have these.

Uh.

-Oh yeah, where did
that dumb collar go?

-It is not dumb.

393

give that back you.

Ahh!

397

-Once it's fastened there's
no getting it off again.

00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:18,760
-What did you say?

399
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:20,093
-There is only one
way that the lock

400
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:23,226
can be disabled-- by
dousing it with hot water.

401
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,460
-How's about it?

402
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:25,993
I'll scrub your back
if you scrub mine.

403

-You and I together!

404
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
-Uh.

405
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:37,926
-But think of your
reputation, my love.

406
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,393
Think of the scandal
it would cause

407
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,626
if we were to be seen together.

408
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,626
Oh, you're mad to
even suggest it.

409
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,260
As a gentleman I
cannot allow it.

410
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:45,526
-This way, Master.

411
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,093
-Mixed bathing is for
moral degenerates.

Ah!

-Well it serves you right.

-You there, yes you.

418
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,160
-Huh?

419
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:04,960
-I'll bet you haven't even
kissed Ranma yet, now have you?

420
00:18:04,993 --> 00:18:06,926
-What?

421
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,460
-You haven't, have you?

Come on, you know it.

Don't try to lie to me.

-Maybe you should get some help.

-Mhm hm hm hm, have a
look at this, my dear.

crying out loud, now

in the buff or not,

just get in already.

be afraid again.

you think that I-- huh?

-You make a lovely couple.

Good bye!

-Wait, Akane.

-Why you Ranma Saotome!

450
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:07,426
What have you done with
the pig-tailed girl?

451
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,960
Admit it!

452
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,226
You've turned her naivete to
your own lustful ends, now,

453
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,093
haven't you?

454
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:13,760
You enemy of women!

455
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:17,493
Bring her back to me this
instant or you'll pay!

-(VOICEOVER) You dummy, Ranma.

458
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,893
Why did I even bother?

459
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,626
Maybe I'm not the
world's greatest cook,

460
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,526
but you didn't even
give me a chance.

461
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,826
I worked really
hard on those, too.

You dummy.

463

RANMA: Hey, Akane, I want
to show you something.

-What?

465
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:52,793
-Well take a look.

466
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,560
As you can see, it was
all a misunderstanding.

467
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:02,093
More like an accident.

468
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:05,726
So that means you can stop
being jealous now, OK?

469

-Jealous!

Of you?

You've got to be kidding.

-Then why are you so mad?

this off, then?

00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,393
Isn't there anything
else we can do?

497
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:12,826
-Just what is it you
ate, anyway, boy?

498
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,260
It must really be something to
upset your cast iron stomach.

499
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:19,693
-(VOICEOVER) That's odd.

500
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:21,760
Hmm, there must be something
wrong with the recipe.

NARRATOR: What are
we gonna do with him?

505
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,193
There's been nothing but
trouble since he showed up.

506
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,360
Lucky for us there's
a new Chinese remedy.

507
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:19,193
You can do it, Ranma.

508
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:21,126
Next time on Ranma 1/2, SOS!

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,322
The Wrath of Happosai.

00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,321
See you there.
