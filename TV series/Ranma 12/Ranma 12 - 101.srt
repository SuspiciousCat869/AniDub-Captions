UKYO: Well, don't be shy.

3
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:44,933
Eat up, Ranma.

4
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:47,974
Alley-oop.

00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:55,033
[laughter]

6
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,866
-Ukyo, you're too good to me.

7
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,733
Oh man, am I hungry!

8
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,500
-Ranma, take it easy, will ya?

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,266
I know it's good,
but you're, you're

10
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,100
going to make yourself sick.

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,266
Uh oh, speaking of
sick, what are they

12
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,500
feeding you over there?

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,266
You'd think you hadn't
eaten in a week.

14
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,166
-Well, excuse moi.

15
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:20,366
We may not be a restaurant,
but we eat just fine.

16
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:21,700
And you, Ranma.

17
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,500
Stop acting like such a pig!

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,433
-Dear me, if it isn't
his former fiancee.

19
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:31,366
-Former?

20
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,500
-Well, since I'm
the real one, that

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
makes you either
fake for former.

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,666
And I know how you hate fakes.

23
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:39,733
Right, Ranma, honey?

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,566
-Anyway, that's between you two.

25
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,366
Well, I hate to eat
and run, but can I

26
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,833
get an order of
okonomiyaki to go, please?

27
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,266
-Sure thing.

28
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:57,033
-You know, I just noticed,
business is kind of slow.

29
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:00,333
[sigh]

30
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,433
-Yeah, it's true.

31
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:02,866
It has been slow.

32
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,833
All my usual customers seemed
to have jumped ship and found

33
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,900
someplace else to eat.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
-Gee, you think they're
at the new place?

35
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,541
-What?

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,233
-What?

37
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,500
NARRATOR: Revenge,
raging okonomiyaki.

38
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,333
-There.

39
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,233
Do you see the truck?

40
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,466
They sell crepes.

41
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,933
And at school, it's the
only thing they talk about.

42
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,833
RANMA: They're from our class.

43
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:29,600
UKYO: They used to
be my customers.

44
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,400
CROWD: I want banana cream!

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,333
Make mine strawberry!

46
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,166
Red bean for me, please.

47
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:36,733
-No prob.

48
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,633
And be sure to check
out my technique,

49
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:42,433
because when the crepe
king cooks, people listen.

50
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,533
-It's like, it's like
a taste of spring time,

51
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:13,966
of the farm fresh strawberries
bursting with healthy goodness.

52
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:18,100
-Just note how the
fluffiness of whipped cream

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,933
brings out the taste of
banana to perfection.

54
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:24,000
-Jeez, what the heck
is this, Iron Chef?

55
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,266
-Ha ha ha.

56
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,433
OK, so who's up
for another crepe?

57
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,600
-Hm.

58
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,466
Mister, I don't know
where you learned to cook,

59
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:34,200
but where I come from,
you're not even on the menu.

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,741
-Really?

61
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:42,533
And I suppose the cooking
you do does count?

62
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:46,533
-All I know is, because of you,
my restaurant's half empty.

63
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,366
-And what restaurant's that?

64
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,400
UKYO: Ukyo;s Okonomiyaki.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,833
Crepe King, let's
see what you got.

66
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,200
-Ha, if you insist.

67
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,333
Give it your best shot.

68
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,633
-Ahh!

69
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,600
[grunting]

70
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,600
-Ready?

71
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,033
Crush.

72
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:33,433
But why are they-- hm.

73
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,366
-Hey, come on.

74
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,733
Cheer up, girly.

75
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,233
Just be grateful you've got any
customers in your restaurant

76
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,500
at all.

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:52,166
[laughter]

78
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,133
-Huh?

79
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,700
-I wonder if I might try a bite.

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,241
Hm.

81
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,966
Ah, delicious.

82
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:05,633
But there's more
to it than taste.

83
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,233
What's missing is ambition.

84
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,533
That, perhaps, is why you lose.

85
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:14,507
-Ambition?

86
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,400
-Come on, Ukyo.

87
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Cheer up.

88
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,700
Next time you'll beat
that creep for sure.

89
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,533
-Thanks for saying it, Ranma,
but we both know it's not true.

90
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,533
-You're not still thinking
about that monk, are you?

91
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,533
-Back when I was
angry at Ranma, I

92
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:40,033
cast aside my girlhood
to make okonomiyaki.

93
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,033
Now that that's over, I use my
skills to make people happy.

94
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,533
It makes me happy too.

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,100
If you take my okonomiyaki
away from me though,

96
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,066
what is it I have left?

97
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:54,833
I have no revenge.

98
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,166
I have no love.

99
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:59,500
No wonder my cooking
has something missing,

100
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,266
-You don't have to cry about it.

101
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:03,133
Your cooking's fine.

102
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:03,866
It's no big deal.

103
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,133
Don't let it get to you.

104
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:08,133
Who needs ambition anyway, huh?

105
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,633
-Oh, I get it.

106
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,933
Ambition's fine if
you're a boy, but I

107
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:15,900
suppose I should just give
it all up and be your wife?

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

109
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,400
Who said anything about wife?

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,266
-No, no.

111
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:20,700
You're right.

112
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,900
Who am I kidding?

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,466
I can't make decent
okonomiyaki to save my life,

114
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:27,566
and here I am thinking
of being your wife.

115
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,800
That's it, then.

116
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,433
I have got to train
to improve my cooking,

117
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:40,166
or I am not worthy of
being Ranma's fiancee.

118
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,466
Listen, Akane.

119
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:48,400
You'll take care of Ranma for me
while I'm training, won't you?

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,200
-Huh?

121
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,466
-See ya later.

122
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,007
-Ukyo, wait.

123
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,700
-Ranma, we can't just
let her leave like that.

124
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,366
-And what is it I'm
supposed to do, huh?

125
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,433
Akane, you know she's
just going to start up

126
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,133
with that wife stuff again.

127
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,566
-But still.

128
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:12,000
[bell ringing]

129
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,400
[grunting]

130
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,533
-Why bother?

131
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,166
It's no good.

132
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:26,866
I just don't feel
ambitious anymore.

133
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:31,866
It looks and tastes OK, but
inside my cooking's empty.

134
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:35,966
Ranma will never
love me at this rate.

135
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:36,507
Huh?

136
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:40,407
Huh?

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,533
-Young lady, you've
come to the right place.

138
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,633
Our temple here has a
many hundred year history

139
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:55,200
of being visited by
epicures and gourmands.

140
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,466
It was one such
man, in fact, who

141
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,833
gave us our most
sacred treasure.

142
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,066
[gasp]

143
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,533
For over 100 years, this
box has remained unopened,

144
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:13,533
the pulsating energy contained
within gone to waste.

145
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:17,733
All this time, the savory,
velvety sauce untasted,

146
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,000
the melt-in-your-mouth
seaweed on top passed over,

147
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,633
the humble cabbage
humiliated, the frolicking,

148
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:28,533
playful dried fish
flakes gone wasted.

149
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,933
-You don't mean it's--

150
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,066
-Mm.

151
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,333
The golden okonomiyaki,
a gift from our founder,

152
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:37,366
a man who reminds me of you.

153
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:38,866
-I knew it looked familiar.

154
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:42,966
My grandpa-- my great grandpa,
that is-- told me about it.

155
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,900
-If he was your
ancestor, then you

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,100
must be the descendant
of our founder.

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,266
That makes me more determined
to get you back on track.

158
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:54,466
You mustn't lose hope,
especially not now.

159
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:57,466
The golden okonomiyaki
is yours by right.

160
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:00,900
-If it'll help with my
ambition, I'll do it.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,733
Teach me, oh master, for I am
young and foolish and unworthy.

162
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,400
-The training will
be very difficult.

163
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,766
Are you certain?

164
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,200
-I'll do whatever it takes.

165
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:24,833
[laughter]

166
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,333
-I hope she's not too depressed.

167
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,100
-She may never come
back, you know.

168
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,833
-We should at least look
after her restaurant for her,

169
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,100
don't you think?

170
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,500
-Yeah right.

171
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,366
And who do you think's going to
do all the cooking here, huh?

172
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:37,700
Emeril Lagasse?

173
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,466
-You can laugh all you want,
but we've got to do something.

174
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:44,400
-And who's going to
bring in customers, you?

175
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,766
-I got a better idea.

176
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,600
RANMA: Ah, what'd
you do that for?

177
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,633
It's no fair.

178
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,133
-Wuh, wuh, welcome to--

179
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,200
-Ah, pigtailed girl!

180
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,433
So the rumors I
heard are true, you

181
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,633
are waitressing at this place!

182
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,333
Please, accept these.

183
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:00,766
-Gee, uh, thanks.

184
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:03,100
[laughter]

185
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,433
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Stupid Akane.

186
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,933
Still, it's for Ukyo,
so I guess I gotta--

187
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,533
-Come on in.

188
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:11,766
Would you like to hear
about today's specials?

189
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,233
They're really good.

190
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,300
-Akane Tendo, you too?

191
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,233
What have I done to
deserve such an honor?

192
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,566
We'll talk later.

193
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,400
So boys, what'll it be?

194
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,566
Eat hearty because I'm buying.

195
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,700
-OK, but if you got
complaints later,

196
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,133
I don't want to hear 'em.

197
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,233
-Tuh, take it easy, huh?

198
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,900
-You like it, huh?

199
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,200
-Good one.

200
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,166
-So what's the next exercise?

201
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,400
-No, that part of
this training's over.

202
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,066
Now begins the 100 okonomiyaki.

203
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,700
-98, 99, that 100?

204
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,266
-Of ambition, a
wise man once said,

205
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,466
only by losing everything
are we free to do anything.

206
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,700
You must lose yourself
in making okonomiyaki.

207
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,400
Only then will you
find what you seek.

208
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,533
-I'll do it.

209
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,900
If it means not losing
to that crepe guy again,

210
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,166
I'll cook okonomiyaki
100, 1,000, 10,000 times.

211
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,233
-Now, that is the spirit.

212
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:02,547
-I thought you said the kids in
our class were going to come.

213
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,281
-With the big discount
we're offering,

214
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:06,914
I would've thought
they'd be there.

215
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:08,381
Well, maybe they're outside.

216
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:13,614
Oh my go--

217
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:14,247
-What?

218
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:14,788
what?

219
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:22,181
-What are you guys doing?

220
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:22,747
-Oh.

221
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,314
Uh, hey, Akane.

222
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:26,447
Everyone was like,
already here, so we,

223
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:28,481
you know, we just kind
of, um, I don't know, uh--

224
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:31,281
-That jerk's got a lot of
nerve setting up his truck

225
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:34,581
in front of us.

226
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,214
-You've got me all wrong.

227
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:39,547
I set up here to help
you girls, not hurt you.

228
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:40,314
-Huh?

229
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:41,747
-You're in a slump, right?

230
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:43,381
Why don't you do
yourselves a favor

231
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:47,081
and become my first ever
Crepe King franchise?

232
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:49,647
Sounds pretty good to me.

233
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,814
-Nice try, pancake boy.

234
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,014
Why don't you just admit that
you're trying to take over?

235
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:56,914
-I admit no such thing.

236
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:59,981
Besides, there's simply
no fighting evolution.

237
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:02,147
If you're going to
lose to me anyway,

238
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:06,081
why not lose to me willingly?

239
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:08,781
-Crepe King, you come out
here and run your mouth,

240
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,081
but let me tell ya.

241
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,281
It ain't over 'til it's over.

242
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:13,581
-A match, huh?

243
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:16,514
And while we're at it, let's
make it losers leave town.

244
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:17,181
You game?

245
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,281
-Mister, I am the game.

246
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:22,281
-What is this, pro wrestling?

247
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:23,747
UKYO: 106.

248
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,849
107.

249
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:33,569
Here's 108.

250
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:40,047
What's that?

251
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,847
No more, you say?

252
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,881
If that's so, that
means ambition's finally

253
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:47,081
come back to my cooking.

254
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:47,947
Booyah!

255
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,247
Thanks for the training, teach.

256
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:53,514
-You're welcome.

257
00:14:53,614 --> 00:14:54,681
Just no more okonomiyaki.

258
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:05,514
-Come on, let's go already.

259
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:09,714
-Ranma, come on.

260
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:11,114
Think it over.

261
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:14,847
How can you be sure that this
isn't what he wanted all along?

262
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,614
-Jeez, give me some credit.

263
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:20,147
I must have a few
tricks, don't you think?

264
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,314
-And as if that
weren't enough, tempura

265
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,247
flakes mixed with gunpowder!

266
00:15:28,747 --> 00:15:31,581
Here, try this
cement batter too!

267
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:37,981
-Aw man, it's like glue.

268
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:44,381
-And now for Ukyo's
all new menu.

269
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:49,214
I learned the cement
part the hard way.

270
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,681
Not to mention these!

271
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,047
The noodles are kind
of rubbery, but--

272
00:15:58,147 --> 00:15:58,588
-Mistake.

273
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:04,381
Is that the best you've got?

274
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:06,381
-What do you think?

275
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,014
Gunpowder pellets.

276
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:08,714
-Crepe envelopes.

277
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:17,847
And that's not all.

278
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:20,547
I hope you enjoy these
tasty treats as well.

279
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,981
-Some kind of tear gas.

280
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:36,914
-Ranma, are you OK?

281
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:38,714
-Relax, I've just started.

282
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:40,781
That was only the appetizer.

283
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:44,147
And now for the main course,
the golden crepe of death.

284
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:57,014
-Nice try, but I'm not beat yet.

285
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,881
-Sorry, but considering
that crepe's

286
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:02,547
made of high tech unbreakable
fiber, I must disagree.

287
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:06,681
Also, there's the small matter
of the highly explosive C4

288
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:09,747
whipped cream that's
filling the inside.

289
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:12,714
-C-- C4 whipped cream?

290
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:13,255
-Yep.

291
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:23,447
Poor baby.

292
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:25,514
Don't you want to
ask for seconds?

293
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:27,747
-May I have another?

294
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,314
-Ranma, snap out of it.

295
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:31,647
If you lose, it's not just you.

296
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:33,447
It's Ukyo's store.

297
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:34,381
CROWD: Crepe King!

298
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:35,281
Crepe King!

299
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:35,814
Crepe King!

300
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:36,647
Crepe King!

301
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:38,181
-And now it's time for dessert.

302
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:43,781
-Ranma!

303
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:44,714
-How'd you--

304
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,214
-Tag out, Ranma, honey.

305
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:58,181
Time for okonomiyaki
Ukyo to take over.

306
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:02,681
-Come on, Ukyo,
bust him wide open.

307
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,481
-Don't you worry, Ranma.

308
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:06,947
I haven't been making
one after another

309
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:10,281
after another
okonomiyaki for nothing.

310
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,681
-Well, guess what, girly?

311
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:15,047
It doesn't matter how
many okonomiyaki you make.

312
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:17,047
-And I've got
something to tell you.

313
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:19,714
Just 'cause you say
it, don't make it so.

314
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,014
-We'll see about that!

315
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:21,555
Yeah!

316
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,314
-Wow.

317
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,414
I can really smell
what Ukyo's cooking.

318
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:49,514
-You can trash talk me all
you like, but you know what?

319
00:18:49,614 --> 00:18:51,881
When it's all over, when
the smoke's cleared,

320
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:56,447
and it's all said and done,
you don't have what it takes.

321
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:59,114
And I've got two words for you.

322
00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:00,081
Eat it!

323
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:14,714
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
OK, great granddad.

324
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:16,114
Help me out here.

325
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:25,014
-Guess that means I win.

326
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,181
-You're wrong.

327
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,281
It wasn't the death
crepe that just exploded.

328
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,547
It was Ukyo.

329
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:30,088
-What?

330
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:38,881
-What?

331
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:41,181
-Hey, isn't it time you
went out of business?

332
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:53,747
Ukyo, Kowanji, special martial
arts okonomiyaki attack.

333
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:58,714
Batter dragon!

334
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:11,747
-Bang bang.

335
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,814
-One loser to go.

336
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,714
-All right!

337
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:20,047
-I knew you could do it, Ukyo.

338
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:23,947
CROWD: Ukyo!

339
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:24,914
Ukyo!

340
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:25,881
Ukyo!

341
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:26,847
Ukyo!

342
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:27,814
Ukyo!

343
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:30,247
Ukyo!

344
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:31,347
UKYO: Well, Ranma?

345
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,814
What do you think?

346
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:36,514
You can taste the
ambition in it now, right?

347
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:37,947
-Gee, Ukyo, I don't know.

348
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,447
It tastes kind of
the same, actually.

349
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:42,447
-And just think,
if it hadn't been

350
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:45,447
for that monk, and my great
grandpa's golden 100 year

351
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:48,214
old okonomiyaki, I
would have never won.

352
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,447
-Great grandpa?

353
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:50,581
Golden okonomiyaki?

354
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:52,347
What the heck are you--

355
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:54,514
-Oh, never mind that, Ranma.

356
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:58,381
What's important is that I
finally got my ambition back.

357
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:02,914
Now I can make okonomiyaki
every single day for you.

358
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:04,314
-Every day?

359
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:05,914
-Well, sure, sugar.

360
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,447
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

361
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:09,481
Isn't it great?

362
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:12,247
Now, be a good boy
for Ukyo and say ah.

363
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:14,414
-Aren't you lucky, Ranma?

364
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,714
Just think of all the
money we're going to save.

365
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,547
-I give up.

366
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:29,347
My sushi just ain't as
good as it used to be.

367
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:33,381
-Before you give up, ask
yourself, have I truly hit

368
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:34,147
rock bottom?

369
00:21:48,981 --> 00:21:52,014
[theme music]

370
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:19,169
NARRATOR: Oh, yeah right!

371
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,336
Ranma's going around
hitting on girls?

372
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,069
You're kidding!

373
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,869
Aren't you?

374
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:29,436
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Ranma the lady killer.

375
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,169
We'll see you there!
