SENTARO: Now enters
the Noble Matriarch.

00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:18,000
We rejoice in your continued
health, Noble Matriarch.

Your venerable
presence honors us all.

-Noble Matriarch.

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,166
It is my duty today
to report to you

10
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:32,866
that the Daimonji School of
Martial Arts Tea Ceremony,

11
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:36,333
having met at its
regularly appointed time,

12
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:40,500
has determined that with the
annual Hydrangea Tea Ceremony

13
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,733
drawing nigh, we may wish to
consider the possibility of--

14
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,333
-That's enough.

15
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,500
Unlike you, I'll come
straight to the point.

16
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,900
The truth is it's well past
time for me to take a stand.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,933
-To take a-- but Matriarch,
that would mean that you--

-Mean I what?

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,466
-It's unheard of.

23
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:25,100
-For her to take a stand, it's--

24
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,566
-It's gonna be
the end of us all.

mean for the rest of us?

all of this time?

How can she?

tell us why you're here

-You mean after everything
that's happened,

00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,400
you actually feel sorry for me?

Oh, what did I ever do
to deserve such friends?

of your clan, right?

Isn't she supposed to do that?

reason she shouldn't?

tell you is no one,

not even me, her
grandson, has ever

ever since Grandmama

made her declaration
to take a stand,

-Maybe you should, Akane.

he'd appreciate it.

What did I tell you?

-Well, I guess that means
I'm coming along too.

115

After all, I wouldn't want to
miss Grandma taking a stand.

-Ah, no problem, man.

It's my pleasure.

And besides, if my guess
is correct, what you really

120
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:56,833
want is for me to take on the
Old Bat again, am I right?

her or didn't you?

-She, uh, kind of
brought a friend along.

-It doesn't matter.

138
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,400
-So what are you gonna
do with her anyway?

139
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,500
-We wonder, Sentaro, if you
know what the Matriarch's taking

140
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,466
a stand actually means.

-Young man, for your Grandmama
at her age to take a stand

143
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,233
means nothing less than
a change of direction

00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:17,266
for the entire Daimonji School
of Martial Arts Tea Ceremony.

-That, Sentaro, is your history.

153
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,500
In fact, it's a part
of all our history,

detailing not only
our clan's founding

00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,233
but its notable events.

156
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,233
It doesn't happen often--
only once, in fact--

157

but previous matriarchs
have also taken stands.

Naturally, there is chaos.

And at length, it
has been determined

can be asked to."

What's that?

168
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:14,333
-It means that then,
as in now, an outsider

169
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,566
such as your young
girl in the next room

170
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:20,833
must be offered up to ensure
the survival of the clan.

171
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:24,433
-Off-- offered as in sacrificed?

172
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,633
-What else can we do?

173
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:31,333
Without that girl out
there, our clan is finished.

174
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:34,633
-When you told me to bring
her, it wasn't for marriage?

175
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:39,033
-Poor Sentaro does what he's
told but doesn't know why.

176
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:43,000
I can see the future is
quite safe in your hands.

177
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,433
-I pity the girl.

178
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:45,666
But what's to be done?

179
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:49,466
It's for such a noble cause.

SENTARO (VOICEOVER):
I can't do it.

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,900
I can't.

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,600
Akane, a sacrifice?

184
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,000
No way.

185
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,433
-So what was her name again?

186
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,766
-It's Aka-- no, it's not.

187
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,133
It's Ranma.

188
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,733
The girl's name is Ranma.

189
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,300
-Is that right?

-I don't know about you, but
this place creeps me out.

00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,633
Do you think they're fighting?

-Well, if they are,
they shouldn't be.

194
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,700
I mean, what's the big
deal about making a point?

195
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,733
She's allowed to have
an opinion, ain't she?

196
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,900
-Sentaro says he
wants my support.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,033
But I'm not sure how.

198
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,133
What's he want me to do?

when Ranma's here instead?

I'm sure he'd feel the
same way if I asked.

If I didn't know better,
I'd think she-- oh!

Don't tell me you
spiked her tea!

Oh, I don't feel so--

It's their idea.

-Well, you know, the old ladies.

233
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:15,802
They took Ranma to their room
to use her as a sacrifice.

234
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,868
-To use her as what?

You don't know what
you're up against.

They've got guards,

else in there.

reach 100, that's it.

It's too late.

That's when the Matriarch

-89, I think.

We can help, but you
must do exactly as I say.

I know it's hard for you,
Akane, but you've got to.

00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:37,802
-It's too late, and
there's nothing you can--

331
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:39,002
-Let go of me.

332
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:40,335
Get your hands off of--

333
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:41,735
[gong]

334
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,205
-That makes it 100.

335
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:00,568
[chime]

336
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:04,576
-Ranma!

337
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:14,735
-Oh, Akane.

338
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:15,935
You're just in time.

339
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:18,002
Come here and give me a hand.

340
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:18,902
-Oh, that's it.

341
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:19,835
Right there.

342
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,402
-What?

343
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,102
To-- to do what?

344
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,635
-Oh, you know how it is.

345
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:26,435
You sit around all day
and your feet go to sleep.

346
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:29,068
Which they wouldn't,
you know, if you just

347
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,935
get up and walk around
once in a while.

348
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:35,302
-Remaining seated at all
times is an important part

349
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:37,968
of the Martial
Arts Tea Ceremony.

350
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:40,835
Besides, as Matriarch of the
clan, one has one's pride,

351
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:41,568
you know?

352
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:42,802
Oh!

353
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:43,868
There you go, dear.

354
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:45,602
Oh, that's the spot.

355
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:46,302
Lower.

356
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:46,868
Lower.

357
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,735
Oh, you're good.

358
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:50,068
-Yeah.

359
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:55,035
-Th-- then take a
stand means stand up?

360
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:56,768
-There you go, Gran.

361
00:19:56,868 --> 00:19:59,268
-Thank you, dear.

362
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:02,668
-Now, you'll give me that
match you promised, right?

363
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,935
-You don't really think
you can take me, do you?

364
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:06,968
-What do you mean think?

365
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:07,568
I know.

366
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:08,735
-Bring it on.

367
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,202
-Hey, you guys, calm--

368
00:20:10,302 --> 00:20:12,135
[neighing]

369
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:12,835
-Whoa!

370
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:14,102
Whoa there, Moonlight.

371
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,068
Calm down.

372
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,335
Moonlight.

373
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:27,735
Moonlight, come back.

374
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:30,835
-Sentaro, why must
it always fall to me

375
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:33,835
to provide instruction
and decorum?

376
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:36,035
I should have thought the
last round of discipline

377
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,168
was enough for
you, but so be it.

378
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:41,735
Ranma, my dear,
it seems you and I

379
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:44,335
shall have to meet another day.

380
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:49,002
And as for you,
Sentaro, come here!

381
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:51,702
-Ranma, Akane,
you've gotta help me!

382
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:52,602
Please!

383
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,102
Don't let her do this to me.

384
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:55,402
You've seen what she's like.

385
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:56,168
Please!

386
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,668
-So, you ready to go home?

387
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:58,902
-Oh, yeah.

388
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,735
[whining]

389
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,535
MATRIARCH: Stay still, I said.

390
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:03,468
Don't you listen?

391
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,368
-Oh, how wicked.

392
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:12,835
Oh, how terrible.

393
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,335
How wicked.

394
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,302
How terrible.

395
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:16,302
How wicked.

396
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:17,768
How terrible.

397
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:18,768
How wicked.

398
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:20,235
How terrible.

399
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:21,702
How wicked.

400
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:22,702
How terrible.

401
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:38,268
SENTARO (VOICEOVER): I hate
Martial Arts Tea Ceremony.

402
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:47,102
[theme music]

403
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:19,036
AKANE (VOICEOVER): For
Kodachi to be helping Ranma,

404
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,436
I'm sure it can't be good.

405
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:24,903
And what's with these three
sacred gymnastics treasures?

406
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,769
Next time on "Ranma 1/2," "A
Leotard is a Girl's Burden."

407
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:32,369
We'll see you there.
