with your name.

like that make you feel guilty?

would if I were you.

-Well, let me put it this way--
I'd rather feel guilty than eat

that you were betrothed
to such a violent man.

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,733
-That will leave a mark.

161

-I didn't want to,
yet Akane's fiance

162
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:23,200
leaves me no choice
but to use my powers.

So be it.

164

It is time to pay for
what you have done!

you wrecked her lunch,

00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:30,900
and stepped on my face!

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,633
For that, you vile
wretch, you will pay!

168
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,200
Mark my words!

169
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,133
[yelling]

170
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:44,300
[panting] Look, it's Gosunkugi.

171
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,300
-By the way, thanks
for the voodoo dolls.

172
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
-See you later, Gosunkugi.

173
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,700
[giggles]

174
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,600
-He is so weird.

175
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
-I know.

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,500
[laughter]

177
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,466
[yelling in pain]

178
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:07,133
-It's time to get
serious with that Ranma,

179
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,566
and make him pay for
his sins against Akane.

180
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,433
Then all will be
right with the world.

181
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,233
-Hey, what are you
doing this time?

182
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,666
-Maybe it's like a secret, and
he doesn't want us to ask him.

183
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,966
-We're sorry we bothered you.

184
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,733
-Good luck, Gosunkugi.

185
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,766
-You know, if this is here,
people might notice you.

186
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,300
I'll just move it for you.

187
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
-And I guess we'd
better cover it up too.

188
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,566
-I guess so.

189
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,400
Hey, wait, I'm still down here.

190
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,400
Um, I uh-- I can't see a thing.

191
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,533
-Hey there, Akane.

192
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:46,074
Wait!

193
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:57,466
Hey, I'm sorry I wrecked
your stupid lunch,

194
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:01,033
but I can explain.

195
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:03,233
-Hey, what did you do that for?

196
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:03,900
-Akane.

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,333
-Oh, what is it now?

198
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:06,933
-You gotta look
ahead when you run.

199
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,900
-A pitfall?

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,800
-Who in this day and age would
dig such an obvious trap?

201
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,100
-Yeah, and who'd
even fall for it?

202
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,900
-I appreciate all my admirers
who came to see me off.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I thank you all for
your loyal supp--

204
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,300
-Well, there's your answer.

205
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,366
-Imbecile!

206
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:33,133
I demand to know the meaning
of this little prank.

207
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,633
-It wasn't meant for you.

208
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,400
It was meant to
trap somebody else.

209
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,933
-I suppose in that case, I must
admit was quite the clever ploy

210
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,466
to even trick me this one time.

211
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:47,400
[laughter]

212
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,833
MALE SPEAKER: I think we
should cover it up again.

213
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:51,833
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I agree.

214
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:52,700
-Hey!

215
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,600
Someone!

216
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,833
Get me out of here!

217
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:55,374
Help!

218
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:16,575
-I'm home.

219
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,295
Huh?

220
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:24,462
-Akane, you back all ready?

221
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:26,662
Yeah, well, you
know, Saotome and I

222
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:29,062
were thinking that we hadn't
had takeout in awhile.

223
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,428
And, uh, well--

224
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,962
-It's not that we don't
love your lunches.

225
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:35,795
-I'm sorry.

226
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:38,595
I guess you guys are all
getting sick of my cooking.

227
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,928
-No, that's not
really it at all.

228
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,695
-How could you even think that?

229
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,195
-Nope, I've made up my mind.

230
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:45,428
I'm through with cooking.

231
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:50,062
-Maybe we shouldn't have
ordered in, Saotome.

232
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:51,762
-What are you talking about?

233
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:54,028
It was your bright idea.

234
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:55,962
-Oh, so all of a
sudden you think

235
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:58,062
this whole mess is
completely my fault?

236
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:00,162
-Well, you're the one
who picked up the phone

237
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,695
and made the call, Tendo.

238
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,695
-Yeah, well who
looked up the number?

239
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:05,562
-Don't try to pin this on me.

240
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:15,995
[yawn]

241
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,462
-I had the best sleep
last night, Kasumi.

242
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,162
-Here.

243
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:23,295
-Hey, Ranma, did you
say something to Akane?

244
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:25,595
-Not me.

245
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:26,562
-Oh.

246
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,728
Well, anyway, it
looks like we don't

247
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:31,628
have to worry about her
making our lunches anymore.

248
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,795
-Nabiki.

249
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,528
No breakfast?

250
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:36,069
-No, thanks.

251
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:39,828
[choking]

252
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:46,336
-Akane?

253
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:04,962
-He's here.

254
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:14,995
Well, hello, Ranma.

255
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,328
-Yeah, that's my name.

256
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:17,995
-What are you up to?

257
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,562
-(NERVOUSLY) Not much.

258
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:23,695
Got to go, see you later.

259
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:24,528
-What a weirdo.

260
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:31,095
-My plan is working.

261
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,962
I think I really rattled him.

262
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,428
[growling]

263
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,262
Nice doggy.

264
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:40,728
Ow, ow!

265
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:48,262
I showed him.

266
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:50,228
That's what he gets for
trying to outwit Gosunkugi.

267
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:59,028
-Huh?

268
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,295
He wants to meet?

269
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:03,195
-Yeah, Gosunkugi said to
meet him over in the gym.

270
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:06,262
You think he's holding a
grudge over Akane's lunch?

271
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,462
-You know, maybe
it's time I tell him

272
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:10,428
the truth about Akane's cooking.

273
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:19,095
-Yo, Gosunkugi.

274
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:22,028
-Oh, you're here
already, Ranma Saotome.

275
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:25,228
-For your information, I
haven't done anything to you

276
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:27,395
that you can hold a
grudge against me for.

277
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:28,895
Understand?

278
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:35,028
Do you have any idea what
Akane's lunch can do to a man?

279
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,295
-No.

280
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,462
-Here's what would have
happened to you if you do eat.

281
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,762
-Ah!

282
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:43,528
-I don't need to be told my
cooking isn't up to standards,

283
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:45,528
I already know that.

284
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,062
That is why I'm practicing.

285
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:50,062
-Well, I-- um--

286
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:52,895
-And then for you to go and
waste perfectly good food

287
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,962
is totally disgusting.

288
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:56,862
-I agree.

289
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:59,928
Just the thought of making
a meal for a loved one,

290
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:03,562
and then in return that person
simply pays no regard to them.

291
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:09,095
The first time I
may overlook it,

292
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:12,795
but twice and even my
patience would run out.

293
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:18,995
[laughter]

294
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,295
Interesting, you are
the first challenger

295
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,028
to trick me more than once.

296
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,628
But you will be the last.

297
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,628
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

298
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:45,762
-All right, all right,
I'll buy a stupid book.

299
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:50,728
Oh, yeah.

300
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:03,262
-Hey, you're not just
going to give up, are you?

301
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:05,628
-That's none of your business!

302
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:07,662
-I brought you something.

303
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:08,995
-What is it?

304
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:13,095
-Don't worry, you'll
figure it out.

305
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:14,095
-Oh, Ranma.

306
00:17:21,662 --> 00:17:23,528
[humming]

307
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:35,395
I'll meet you behind
the school at lunch.

308
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:36,428
Ranma.

309
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:38,662
How strange.

310
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,962
I'll meet you on
the roof at lunch.

311
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:41,962
Akane.

312
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,128
That's weird.

313
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:49,095
-I suspect you came
here to interfere.

314
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:52,762
I can only assume you are
here to spy on my rendezvous

315
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,028
with Akane Tendo.

316
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:55,895
-What are you talking about?

317
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:58,062
-(FEMALE VOICE) I'll meet
you on the roof for lunch.

318
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,062
Akane.

319
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:02,328
Now leave us be, or else.

320
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:06,562
-Sorry, but I'm running late.

321
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:07,895
Akane?

322
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:12,262
-I-- I will not let you alone
with my fair Akane Tendo.

323
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,828
-(FEMALE VOICE) I'm so glad that
the two of you could make it.

324
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:19,495
I want to give
this special lunch

325
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:24,028
to the winner of a fight between
the two of you big, strong men.

326
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:24,895
-Wait!

327
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,228
-Prize is all yours, Kuno.

328
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:28,962
-I told you to stay put.

329
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:30,962
-Oh, stuff it.

330
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:33,795
-Why don't you be a man and
heed my request to stay?

331
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,562
-Because I don't
want to interrupt you

332
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:37,428
on your stupid little date, OK?

333
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:42,662
-Oh, well.

334
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:44,895
I was hoping you'd
take each other out.

335
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:45,895
-You!

336
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:47,962
Not only do you
continue to trick me,

337
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,528
this time you dare
to insult Akane.

338
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,328
Stand up and fight like a man.

339
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:54,962
-Um, uh, that
wasn't my intention.

340
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:56,428
-Raaaah!

341
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:57,695
-Wait, sorry!

342
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:04,295
-You OK, Gosunkugi?

343
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:07,762
He nearly whooped
you pretty good.

344
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:09,395
[laughing]

345
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:13,928
-Did you see my power?

346
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,662
-What you mean your power?

347
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:17,028
You were lucky.

348
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:20,562
-Feast your eyes on the
power that is Gosunkugi!

349
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:33,228
-Don't mind me, but what
are you trying to prove?

350
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,195
I am your God.

351
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,395
-You're my what?

352
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:39,628
-And it is time to pass
judgment on Ranma Saotome.

353
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:40,169
Heeya!

354
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:50,728
I call upon the wind and
thunder to answer my prayer!

355
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:55,695
[maniacal laughter]

356
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:01,162
Observe the hammer of justice.

357
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:02,662
This is the end of you.

358
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:06,728
Say goodbye, Ranma.

359
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:08,828
Your time has come!

360
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:21,795
-Hey, Gosunkugi!

361
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:24,862
Wow, never seen a human
lightning rod up close before.

362
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:34,695
-Look, he's conscious.

363
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:36,962
-So, how do you feel?

364
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:37,895
-Good.

365
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:41,162
-That's good, and
this is for you.

366
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:42,662
Is that all right, Ranma.

367
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:45,328
I can't believe there's
actually somebody on this planet

368
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:49,128
willing to taste your cooking
of their own free will.

369
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:50,162
-Just ignore him.

370
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:53,795
I know my cooking's improved.

371
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:56,795
-Oh, and here's
something from me.

372
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:57,562
-What was that?

373
00:20:57,662 --> 00:20:58,462
-Ah, ah, ah.

374
00:20:58,562 --> 00:20:59,628
Just you never mind.

375
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:05,762
-Antacid pills?

376
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:07,595
-Gosunkugi?

377
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:10,295
Um, Gosunkugi?

378
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,362
Where could he be?

379
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:13,395
He just started a few days ago.

380
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:17,662
-Well, we saw yesterday.

381
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:19,695
He was fine.

382
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:21,595
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Well,
I guess those antacid

383
00:21:21,695 --> 00:21:24,362
pills weren't strong enough.

384
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:26,062
[moaning]

385
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:33,095
-I'll get you for this, Ranma.

386
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:35,995
Oh, my tummy.

387
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:36,995
Oh, mommy.

388
00:21:43,562 --> 00:21:46,462
[theme music]

389
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:18,724
FEMALE SPEAKER: So a
martial arts master

390
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:20,857
also needs to have
good handwriting?

391
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:24,090
Hmm, Ranma, maybe you
should practice a little.

392
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,890
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"Ranma's Calligraphy

393
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,990
Challenge."

394
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,790
We'll see you there.
