AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
"Nabiki, Ranma's New Fiancee."

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,533
-Give back my underwear!

00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,866
-Maybe when I'm good and ready.

-Oh.

00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:02,900
-Nice to see you, too, Akane.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,900
-I'm so sorry, Nabiki.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,333
Here, here, let me
try to get it out, OK?

19
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,266
-I don't need your kind of help.

20
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:14,533
-Nabiki, look at the mess
you made on your new blouse.

21
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,033
-It's not my mess.

22
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:16,966
-I'm sorry.

23
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,266
I'm so sorry.

25
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,800
-Would you knock it off?

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,066
It's no big deal.

27
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,866
Besides, it was your blouse.

28
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:24,166
-Oh, great.

29
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:26,066
NABIKI TENDO (INSIDE ROOM):
Would you give it a rest?

30
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,533
AKANE TENDO (INSIDE ROOM): But
that was my favorite blouse.

31
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:29,633
NABIKI TENDO: OK.

32
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,833
Take one of mine, if
it'll make you happy.

33
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:32,900
-Really?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,866
NABIKI TENDO: Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:36,766
-Oh, I always really
loved this one.

36
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,266
Hey, this is mine.

37
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,400
A-and that's mine.

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,300
Wha-- a-and so is this!

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,666
Ugh!

40
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,200
Everything in here is mine.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
-I think that lipstick was mine.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,833
-Coming in.

43
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,933
I don't know who's this is,
but I used it to clean a dojo.

44
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:53,866
-Huh?

45
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,233
-I thought is was
just an old rag.

46
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,600
So I'm sorry if I
got it all dirty.

47
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,266
-Oh, just chuck
that in the garbage.

48
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:01,433
-Give me that.

49
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,800
(WHINING) Ugh, do
you realize how long

50
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,000
it took me to stitch this towel?

51
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,266
-Your point?

52
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:10,066
-Oh, it's only my favorite
towel in the whole world!

53
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,333
-Did she misspell
the word "cat"?

54
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,833
-I think she forgot
to stitch on the "C."

-[growls]

56
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,333
-Huh?

57
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:17,633
What's wrong, Akane?

58
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,333
[bang]

59
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,800
-I really must
apologize for my sister.

60
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,866
-Apologize?

61
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:26,533
You're the one who
stole all my clothes,

62
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,466
and Ranma ruined my towel.

63
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:32,333
-Gee, your little fiancee
sure has got quite the temper.

64
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:33,366
-Mm-hmm.

65
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:35,666
-Ranma, whose side
are you on, anyway?

66
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,400
-I'm not sure.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,900
I guess you're happy your
best outfit is still OK.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
-Huh?

69
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,500
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
Ah, I have so many.

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,166
I wonder which one
he's talking about.

71
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,300
-Come on, you know
the one I mean,

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,133
the only one you look good in.

73
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:55,633
So it's no big deal
you've got a good outfit.

74
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:56,866
-Girls, you know the rules.

75
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,500
No fighting at the table.

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,733
-You're right, Father.

77
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,333
Fighting can put
off one's digestion.

78
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:02,874
-Hi-yaa!

79
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,233
-Ow.

80
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,666
-Excuse me, Ranma.

81
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,166
-Huh?

82
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:14,833
You want me to say
"I'm sorry" to Akane?

83
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,933
-Well, you are the
one she's mad at.

84
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:20,066
And I know you think
she's stubborn and clumsy.

85
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,333
And she has a temper, and
she yells at you a lot.

86
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,800
And she may not be as
cute as some other girls.

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,933
-Yeah.

88
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:31,633
-Well, I really think
you owe her an apology.

89
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:32,800
SOUN TENDO: Kasumi's right.

90
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,200
And I'd do it if you
know what's good for you.

91
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,966
-That's what you get for
ripping out her heart.

92
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,333
-Huh?

93
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:43,500
Are you saying that I'm the
only one who has to apologize?

94
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,766
-You don't get it, do you?

95
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:48,266
All I did was get
her a little upset.

96
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,700
You are the one that hurt her.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
-I suppose I don't have
a say in this, huh?

98
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,800
-Right.

99
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,100
-I'll do it.

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,000
-Ugh, I will never speak
to that creep again.

101
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,900
Hm.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,233
Hm.

103
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,000
Get lost!

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,066
-But what did I do to you?

105
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,066
-Oh, please!

106
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,933
You can't be so
stupid not to realize

107
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,200
that you and Nabiki
made fun of me!

108
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,966
NABIKI TENDO: Akane, I think
you're taking this all wrong.

109
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,066
I was only joking.

110
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,433
-We didn't mean to hurt you.

111
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,300
-Think about it.

112
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,566
Why would we want to hurt you?

113
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,033
-Come on, would you just
get over it already?

114
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,200
-I am only going
to say this once.

115
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,300
I never want to speak
to you two again!

116
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,100
Ah!

117
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,500
Aah!

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,933
Ugh!

119
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,333
[screams]

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,233
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

121
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,000
Nabiki doesn't know
how to take a fall.

122
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,833
-Nabiki!

123
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,200
-Ugh!

124
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,833
-Well, it looks like you
saved my life, Ranma.

125
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,000
-Huh?

126
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,866
-Hmm?

127
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,600
-Uh, Ranma, maybe it would be
best for you to put me down.

128
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,300
That way, I'll leave you
and Akane alone for awhile.

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,700
-What was I supposed to do?

130
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,100
Besides, don't
worry about Akane.

131
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,833
She understands.

132
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:09,266
So Akane, what were you
saying before we fell?

133
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:12,233
What's wrong?

134
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,300
-We're finished!

135
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,066
Why don't you go and
be Nabiki's fiance?

136
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,033
-Akane?

137
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,233
-Come on, Akane,
you don't mean that.

138
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,366
-If that's it, he's mine.

139
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:20,907
-Huh?

140
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:27,433
-You better remember,
Akane, it's a done deal.

141
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:28,733
-Grrrr.

142
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,100
-And I'll never give
him back to you.

143
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,900
-Take him!

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,866
The creep's all yours.

145
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:36,266
-Thanks.

146
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,166
-Hmm?

147
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:40,233
Don't you think that you
and Ranma should at least

148
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,733
talk to each other, Akane?

149
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,733
-Never.

150
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,433
-You can't be serious, Akane.

151
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,933
I don't care what
the Saotomes think.

152
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,333
It really doesn't matter.

153
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54,600
But what I do care about
is you and your sister.

154
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,800
-[sighs]

155
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,600
KASUMI TENDO: Nabiki can't
be serious about all this.

156
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,833
And I can't see Ranma
putting up with her.

157
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:03,633
-Listen to me.

158
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,766
You must make up with Ranma.

159
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,566
-Oh!

160
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,500
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
They can't be serious.

161
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,833
And besides, it's
like Kasumi said,

162
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,600
Ranma won't put up with her.

163
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,766
This is between you and Nabiki.

164
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,900
It's not good to
drag Ranma into it.

[sighs]

166
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,866
You know, I don't know why
I'm even bothering to do--

167
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:30,266
RANMA SAOTOME
(INSIDE ROOM): What?

168
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,133
Make up with Akane?

169
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,300
-Ranma?

170
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,566
NABIKI TENDO (INSIDE
ROOM): Come on, admit it.

171
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,133
You're still in love with her.

172
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,500
-Excuse me?

173
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,266
Hey, if anyone should make up
with her, it should be you.

174
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:39,866
-No way.

175
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,166
-Hmm?

176
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:44,266
-Now, there's something I've
always wanted to tell you.

177
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:45,733
-Uh-huh.

178
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,233
NABIKI TENDO (INSIDE ROOM): I--
I've always loved you, Ranma.

179
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,933
There, I've said it.

180
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:51,766
I love you.

181
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:52,566
I love you, Ranma!

182
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,107
-Ah!

183
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:53,607
Ah!

184
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,174
Ah!

185
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:54,974
-It's that so wrong?

186

-[screams]

187
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:59,374
You're-- you're kidding,
r-right, right, right, Nabiki?

188
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:00,374
-No.

189

192

AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

193
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:07,707
Nabiki is serious.

194
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:19,441
If I'd only known she
felt that way about him.

195
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,141
-Ugh!

196
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,507
Whew.

197
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,507
So what do you want?

198
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,407
-Nothing at all,
Ranma, especially now

199
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,674
that you and Nabiki
are such an item.

200
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:32,374
-You know I don't
really care who

201
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:35,707
I'm engaged to-- at least
not while I'm in training.

202
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,707
-Yeah, I bet.

203
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:41,274
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
Maybe he's telling the truth.

204
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:43,441
-Ah, there you are, Ranma.

205
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,641
Did you miss me?

206
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:45,274
-Ah!

207
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,107
[laughs nervously]

208
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,374
-Here, let me towel you down.

209

-[kissing noises]

-Oh, oy.

211
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,507
(AWKWARDLY) Yeah, yeah,
that's-- that's nice, yeah.

212
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:52,907
-Hmm?

213
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,007
-Hey, do you mind?

214
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:56,007
-Humph!

215
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:56,974
-Uh, hey--

216
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:12,407
-There's something I've been
meaning to tell you, Ranma.

217
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:14,474
-Oh, y-y-you mean that, uh--

218
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:17,307
-Remember I said I loved you?

219
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,374
-That was a joke, right?

220
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:20,707
[chuckles nervously]

221
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,007
-You don't like older girls?

222
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:23,574
-Huh?

223
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:24,807
-Then it's true!

224
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:25,348
-Ah!

225
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:25,941
Ah!

226
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,041
I didn't say that.

227
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:29,207
I mean, uh, it's got
nothing to do with age!

228
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:29,748
-Really?

229
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,174
-Yeah.

230
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:33,741
I don't care how
old you are, really.

231
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:34,607
-I knew it.

232
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,274
Thank you.

233
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,207
RANMA SAOTOME:
I'm sorry, Nabiki,

234
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:44,107
but I really don't think this
relationship's going to work.

235
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,241
I hope you're not mad at me.

236
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,174
-Ranma, I don't believe you!

237
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:49,641
Say it isn't so.

238
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:51,507
But if it is true,
then I can't live

239
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:53,407
under the same
roof as you, which

240
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:55,541
means I'll have to
run away from home!

241
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:56,974
-Nabiki, wait!

242
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:01,407
Oh, man.

243
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,074
Now what do I do?

244
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:05,807
-A set of five pictures
for just 3000 Yen.

245
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:06,741
BUYER: How about two?

246
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,574
-What-- what are you doing?

247
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:18,541
-Ahh, tell me you're
not selling these.

248
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:21,474
-Ranma, the only way
to erase your memory

249
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:25,574
was to sell all my pictures
of you, even your girl ones.

250
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:27,441
-(SHOUTING) Are
you crazy, Nabiki?

251
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,307
-But they've been
selling so well.

252
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:30,207
BUYER: Please back up.

253
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:31,441
Come on, it's my turn.

254
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,674
-Over here, form a
line on the right.

255
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:36,241
-Hey come on,
you're on our team.

256
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:38,841
-This is the worst
day of my life.

257
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,269
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
I don't ever

258
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:01,236
want to go back home-- ever.

259
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:01,869
-Akane?

260
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:02,436
-Huh?

261
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,269
Nabiki?

262
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:04,536
-What are you doing?

263
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:07,403
You look like it's the end
of the world or something.

264
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:11,669
Ahh, how'd you like to have
your Ranma back for, let's say,

265
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,503
2000 Yen?

266
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,303
If you don't want
him back, fine.

267
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:20,436
But don't come crying
back to me later.

268
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:23,336
-But I'm-- I'm not
like you, Nabiki.

269
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:25,003
-Hmm?

270
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:28,369
-And I'll never be
like you-- never!

271
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:31,336
-But Akane--

272
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:32,669
[chuckling]

273
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,369
Come on, Akane, snap out of it.

274
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:38,169
I was just joking when
I said I loved Ranma.

275
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,669
-Can you be serious for once?

276
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,803
Look, I--I know you can be
pretty self-centered, Nabiki.

277
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,836
And sometimes you come
off as being cold.

278
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:51,436
But-- but don't kid around
when it comes to Ranma.

279
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:56,336
-Akane, what if I
cut my price and let

280
00:11:56,436 --> 00:11:58,536
you have him for 1500 Yen?

281
00:11:58,636 --> 00:11:59,703
-Oh, never mind, Nabiki.

282
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:05,103
-OK, final offer, 900 Yen.

283
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,003
-Would you quit it?

284
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,269
I'm not going to buy him back.

285
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,169
-OK, have it your way then.

286
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:15,936
But you are going to be sorry.

287
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,369
RANMA SAOTOME: I can't believe
Nabiki sold me to that mob

288
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:20,303
back there.

289
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:22,636
I'll never forgive her.

290
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:24,203
Hey, Nabiki!

291
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:26,369
-Oh, darling, I'm so
happy you're home.

-Ah!

you take a nice, long hot bath

while I fix you
something to eat, OK?

Now I got her.

-Hey, what's your problem?

304
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:47,703
Would you quit staring?

-But I--

00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:59,369
-Come on, one bite for
your little Nabiki?

-No.

Please!

look a little pale?

AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
Oh, I don't care anymore.

Big deal if Ranma and
Nabiki are engaged.

NABIKI TENDO (IN OTHER

327
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:38,369
Ugh!

328
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,403
-Well, well, if it
isn't Miss Jealous

329
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,403
looking for her former fiancee.

330
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:44,969
Just buy him back already.

331
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:46,836
-Listen very closely.

332
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,103
I'm not going to buy
him back from you!

333
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,236
-OK, for you, Akane, 5000.

334
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:53,503
-I'm not paying you anything!

335
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,169
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER): I'd
better make up with Ranma.

336
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,503
I mean, who cares if he's
engaged to my sister?

337
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:06,269
I'll just tell him I'm
sorry, and everything

338
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:09,336
will be back to normal.

339
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:10,769
MALE STUDENT: Good
morning, Ranma.

340
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:11,503
-Huh?

341
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:12,369
[gasps]

342
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:13,203
-So what happened?

343
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:14,436
-So how come you're with Nabiki?

344
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:15,236
-Well--

345
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:16,836
-Does Akane know?

346
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,269
-Uh--

347
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:19,903
-Oh, you're so cute.

348
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,836
I'll see you after class.

349
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,603
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
The nerve of him!

350
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:25,969
-Break up?

351
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,369
But-- but why, Nabiki?

352
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,836
-Because I'm not
the one you want.

353
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,836
-Pfft, please.

354
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:36,236
-Ranma, I know an easy
way out of this for you.

355
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:40,236
Give me a 5000 Yen
consolation fee?

356
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:42,803
-I'm not breaking
up with you, Nabiki.

357
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:47,336
-So how about a kiss?

358
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:48,769
-Huh?

359
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:50,303
But--

360
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:52,536
-Well, if we're not
breaking up, I'm

361
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:56,469
sure you want to
seal it with a kiss.

362
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:58,969
(ANGRILY) So then you
don't love me, after all!

363
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:02,469
You were just toying
with my affections.

364
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,503
-But Nabiki--

365
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,403
-No, Ranma, no!

366
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,069
I can't continue this charade.

367
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:08,469
-Huh?

368
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:11,403
-(CRYING) Well, I'm not going to
play your little game anymore.

369
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:20,003
And my consolation fee
just went to 6000 Yen.

370
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:20,869
Curses.

371
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:22,469
Foiled again.

372
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:23,469
-[sighs]

373
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,036
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
So she's only

374
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:27,903
toying with him, after all.

375
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:30,336
[crickets chirping]

376
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:34,969
-Nabiki, are the rumors
true that you're now

377
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:36,636
Ranma's fiancee?

378
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,669
-Not the way things
have been going lately.

379
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:43,836
You know, I really wish Ranma
knew how much I loved him.

380
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,336
-You are kidding, right?

381
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:46,669
-Duh.

382
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:49,803
-I don't think you should fool
with poor Ranma's feelings

383
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:50,936
like that.

384
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,636
-And I don't think this
is any of your business.

385
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,469
RANMA SAOTOME (VOICEOVER):
Why that little--

386
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:58,736
-But what if Ranma finds out?

387
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,203
-Oh, come on.

388
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:01,369
Ranma's a big boy.

389
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:03,003
I'm sure he can take a joke.

390
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:03,769
RANMA SAOTOME
(VOICEOVER): (CHUCKLING)

391
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:04,936
Now it's my turn to play.

-Hmm?

396
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,403
-Hey there, Nabiki.

397
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:13,636
You got a minute?

398
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:15,836
NABIKI TENDO: Are
you asking me out?

399
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:16,969
-Yeah.

400
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:19,236
I figure if we're
engaged, we should go out.

401
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:20,169
-OK.

402
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:20,803
-Great.

403
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:21,369
Then it's a date!

404
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:23,969
See you.

405
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,269
-A date, huh?

406
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:28,269
I really don't know if I
can stomach being around him

407
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:29,403
too much.

408
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:31,769
Maybe it's time to break it off.

409
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:33,036
-He said that?

410
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:34,003
-Yeah.

411
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:36,469
He told me he wanted
to take you out.

412
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,303
-But-- but why?

413
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,203
-Maybe he wants to apologize.

414
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:40,969
I don't know.

415
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:48,003
You're supposed
to meet him here.

416
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:48,836
AKANE TENDO: Thanks.

417
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,803

[fading footsteps]

-Maybe we'll get
back together again.

421
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:04,269
-Well, I've done my part.

422

And that's the last
time I play Cupid.

423

RANMA SAOTOME: Nabiki!

424
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,869
You're going to pay
for messing with me!

425
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:21,569
KASUMI TENDO: So where
are you off to, Akane?

426
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:22,369
-Nowhere special.

427
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,803
Oh, isn't it a
beautiful morning?

uh, can I help you?

429
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:38,536
-I want a rose, the
bloodiest rose you've got.

OK.

435
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:48,269
Now I have to think of
a way to thank Nabiki.

436
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:49,636
(YELLING) Thank Nabiki?

437
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,336
Yeah, right!

438
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,169
For what?

439
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,136
Ruining the rest of my life?

440
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:55,603
[laughs evilly]

441

NABIKI TENDO (VOICEOVER):
So that's it.

442
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,536
Today's date is a trap.

443
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:06,636
Well, I don't know what kind of
clever scheme you've cooked up,

444
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:07,969
Ranma.

445
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,136
But unfortunately, I'm not
the one going on the date.

446
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:11,669
It's Akane.

447

I'm so sorry, Ranma.

Oh, my.

00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,669
She looks so dressed up
and looks so happy today.

NABIKI TENDO
(VOICEOVER): I guess

457
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:43,603
I have to play along with
Ranma for Akane's sake.

458

This is it.

00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,569
I wonder where Ramna is.

-Hey, Nabiki, aren't
you forgetting

471
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,869
about our little rendezvous?

472
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:09,736
-There's Akane.

473
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:10,369
-Huh?

474
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:10,910
-Ah!

475
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:11,836
Yaah!

476
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,269
-It serves you right.

477
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,436
Hey, Ranma, if you're so
concerned about my sister,

478
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:19,136
why don't you go back
and apologize to her?

479
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:21,603
-I hate you, Nabiki.

480
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:22,803
Ugh!

Oh, maybe he's not coming.

00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,503
-Oh, no, what if he
suddenly changed his mind?

[bicycle bell]

484
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,136
-Come back here!

-Huh?

486
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:36,536
-Oh, great.

487
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:38,536
She had to ride into a maze.

488
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,436
Come out, Nabiki, before
I start to lose my temper!

489
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:45,003
I've had enough of your
stupid little games!

00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:45,769
-Huh?

491
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:46,736
-Huh?

492
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,603
-Aha!

493
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:50,503
-This is so bizarre.

494
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:54,403
He--he's the one
who asked me out.

495
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:56,903
I'll go home.

496
00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:57,736
Huh?

497
00:19:57,836 --> 00:19:58,636
RANMA SAOTOME: There you are.

498
00:19:58,736 --> 00:19:59,369
-Ahh!

499
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:00,169
RANMA SAOTOME: Ugh!

500
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:00,836
-Huh?

501
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:03,303
-You're all mine.

502
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,503
-No, Ranma, stop it!

503
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,103
You've got Akane, not me.

504
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:11,236
-I told you I'm tired of
your sick little games!

505
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,369
[grunts]

506
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:17,603
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you!

507
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:18,603
-Huh?

508
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:19,803
-What?

509
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:23,269
-Don't you understand that
I can't ever let you go?

510
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:25,769
We'll be together
for an eternity.

511
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:26,310
Ah!

512
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:31,203
-Ranma?

513
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:34,269
-A-- a-- akane, but I--

514
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,536
[whimpers loudly]

515
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,703
[cries hysterically]

516
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:44,036
-You and Akane.

517
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:46,969
Oh, by the way,
little sister, there's

518
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:49,303
really no need to thank me.

519
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:50,203
-But for what?

520
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:58,136
-Well, you two
lovebirds be good now.

521
00:20:58,236 --> 00:21:00,136
NABIKI TENDO (VOICEOVER):
That was the stupidest

522
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:01,536
revenge I've ever seen.

523
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:08,803
-I bought these so I could
play a joke on Nabiki.

524
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:12,503
-Oh, you expect me
to believe that?

525
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,836
-Hey, I don't care if
you don't believe me,

526
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:17,569
but it's the truth .

527
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:20,003
-You know, Ranma, I'm
getting tired of all of this.

528
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,203
Why don't we just
become engaged again?

529
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:22,744
-Huh?

530
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:28,636
[soft music playing]

531
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:32,677
-Here.

532
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:48,358
[theme music playing]

533
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:20,119
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
When a box of takoyaki

534
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:21,786
goes missing from
the kitchen, it

535
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:25,386
throws the residents of the
Tendo dojo into turmoil.

536
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:29,152
Next time, on "Ranma 1/2"--
"Case of the Missing Takoyaki."

537
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:31,619
We'll see you there.
