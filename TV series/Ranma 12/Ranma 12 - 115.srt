No.

00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,133
-Just as I promised,
I'm taking this with me.

00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:47,674
-No.

6
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,766
You can't.

7
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,800
Please.

8
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,800
Oh, no.

00:01:59,366 --> 00:01:59,807
-Hm?

00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:03,733

-Excellent.

00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:45,700
The time has come to open

Here and through it
I will conquer all.

Soon martial arts calligraphy
will rule the world.

Let's see.

00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,900
Hmm.

Hmm.

23
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,966
Perfection.

24
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:15,933
-Oh, no.

25
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,900
I've lost it.

00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,133
Ah!

37
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:34,133
Oh, no.

38
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,266
What if somebody reads it?

39
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,533
This cannot be happening to me.

40
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,566
-You're not getting away
without cleaning up.

41
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,500
-Oh, yeah?

42
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,900
Well, first you've
got to catch me.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
-Stop it!

44
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,033
-Make me.

45
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:52,500
-Why you-- You come down here.

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,066
-Why didn't you come
up here and make me?

47
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,633
What's this about?

48
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:00,100
What do you make of it?

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,366
-Uh, well, it's written
in cursive style.

50
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:04,800
It looks like a letter.

51
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,833
-If you please.

52
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:08,200
Let me see.

53
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,533
It says to my dearest Akane,
with autumn fast approaching,

54
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,100
I've decided to write you,
not just a simple letter,

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,366
but a love letter.

56
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:16,433
Hmm.

57
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,433
Whoever wrote this
has great handwriting.

58
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,566
-Who's it from?

59
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,366
Does it say?

60
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,466
-Oh, come on.

61
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:24,200
Don't stop now.

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,166
-OK.

63
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,333
It goes on by
saying, from where I

64
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,133
sit I can see Mount
Fuji in all its splendor

65
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,766
and it reaches up toward
the clear blue sky.

66
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:37,366
And as I do, I imagine the
fair pig-tailed girl who-- Hmm?

67
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:38,500
Did someone just fall?

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,033
-Come on.

69
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:39,766
Keep going.

70
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,366
-Silence.

71
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:44,733
But no matter where I am or who
I am with, the only girl for me

72
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,433
is Akane Tendo.

73
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:50,266
I love you, Akane
Tendo and only you.

74
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:53,100
-Oh, man, I'd sure like to find
out who wrote all that mush.

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,166
[muttering]

76
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,666
-Let me give you a clue.

77
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,033
His last name starts with K.

78
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,400
-Starts with a K?

79
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,133
-With a K?

80
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:03,700
-With a K?

81
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,866
-Can't see where it's signed.

82
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:11,466
No, from what I
can tell, whoever

83
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:14,166
wrote this didn't
leave his signature.

84
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,833
-Enough!

85
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:16,700
Give that back.

86
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:25,374
Saotame.

87
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,000
-But I'm not the
one who stole it.

88
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,466
-Say your prayers.

00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:42,333
-Uh, it wasn't me.

91
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:44,366
-Why don't you confess?

92
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:46,966
-You can write in cursive style?

93
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,300
-Excuse me?

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,866
-My name is Sotatsu
and I am the founder

95
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,466
of the School of Martial
Arts Calligraphy.

96
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,700
-Sotatsu?

97
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,066
-Have you ever tried
martial arts calligraphy?

98
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,700
-Martial arts calligraphy?

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,966
I've never heard of it.

100
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,666
-It's easy.

101
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,233
Just write the
Japanese character

102
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,166
for eternity whilst fighting.

103
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:05,933
-Hm.

104
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,700
That seems so infantile.

105
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,633
-That is terrible.

106
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:27,266
-Oh, man.

107
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:29,966
-Kuno just disappeared.

108
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:30,507
-Huh?

109
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,666
-So what happened to Kuno?

110
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:36,966
-Look over there.

111
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:37,507
Hm?

Uh!

115
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:48,100
Please help me.

116
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,641
Uh!

117
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,866
-Nice work.

118
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,233
Now it's my turn to take you
on with your martial arts

119
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,433
calligraphy.

120
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,033
-Then submit a formal
letter of challenge to me.

121
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,900
-Sure.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,566
-Huh?

123
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,366
-What's Rama doing?

124
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,833
[muttering]

125
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,300
-This is going to get good.

126
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,933
-How do you write the kanji
characters for challenge?

127
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:17,066
-In martial calligraphy,
each combatant

128
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,566
must write beautiful
kanji characters.

129
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,766
I can't fight someone who
failed miserably in penmanship.

130
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:24,466
-Hey you.

131
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,933
Where are you going?

132
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:27,474
Ah!

133
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,741
Uh!

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,133
-What?

135
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:37,600
A school of martial
arts calligraphy?

136
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,366
And you say his dojo is
located right here in our city.

137
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:44,133
-I've never heard
of him or his dojo.

138
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:47,000
-And why did he make Kuno write
the character for eternity?

139
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,600
-Maybe the guy's a freak.

140
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,666
-Enough.

141
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,466
-Well he could be.

142
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:53,333
-Tendo, you explain it.

143
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,333
-Um, um, OK, if
you look closely,

144
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,766
you'll see that
in order to write

145
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,666
the character for eternity,
every basic calligraphy

146
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:00,933
technique must be used.

147
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,366
-Ah, I see.

148
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:06,266
You know, Kasumi and Nabiki
both have beautiful handwriting.

149
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,000
-Yeah.

150
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,400
What about you?

151
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,666
-And here's the trading
hall sign my dad wrote.

152
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,066
-What about you?

153
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:12,933
-Uh--

154
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,066
-Greetings.

155
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,233
-Oh, we've got company.

156
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,500
-So this is your
place of residence.

157
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,433
-Yeah.

158
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,533
Changed your mind
about the fight?

159
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,233
-I want to challenge
the person who

160
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,066
wrote that sign on your door.

161
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,633
And I don't think
you're that person.

162
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,333
-Well, you got that right.

163
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:34,166
-Yoo, hoo, Satomi,
someone here to see you.

164
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,666
-Oh, how embarrassing.

165
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:40,533
-Gee, Pop.

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,433
-A panda who can write?

[laughing]

168
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,500
It can't be.

169
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,041
Gotta run.

170
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,633
Bye.

[insane laughing]

-So, uh, what's up with him?

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,041
-Bua?

174
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,400
-OK.

175
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,166
OK.

176
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,233
OK.

177
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,100
I can't believe what
I saw back there.

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,533
A panda that can write.

179
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:22,400
A panda that can write.

180
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,133
[insane laughing]

181
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,766
-Martial arts calligraphy?

182
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:34,433
I've never heard of that.

183
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,133
-You're saying old
ghoul like you,

184
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,300
who's been around for
3,000 years hasn't--

185
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,066
-Hey.

186
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,233
-Watch your mouth, child.

187
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,600
-Geez, can't you
take a little joke?

188
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,300
-Great grandmother, I finished.

189
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,100
-Let's see.

190
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,766
-Nice handwriting.

191
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,200
-There is old saying.

192
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,533
One's handwriting reflects
one's inner character.

193
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,633
-You can't be serious.

194
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,400
-If Ranma wanted
beautiful handwriting,

195
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,233
then should practice
by writing letters

196
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,233
and better yet, write
love letters to Shampoo.

197
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,833
Is good idea, no you think?

198
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:06,200
-Hmm, right.

199
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,166
-You know, I'd have
to agree with Shampoo

200
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,800
on that one, Ranma.

201
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,066
I've heard that for centuries,
the greatest martial artists

202
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,033
are also known to have
the best handwriting.

203
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,366
-Man.

204
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:20,933
-Maybe you should try practicing
it and you'll get better.

205
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,466
-You really think it would help?

206
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:24,900
-Hey, I don't think
it'll hurt you.

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
Just try it.

208
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,300
-Maybe.

209
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,933
-I thought you'd be
hungry so I whipped

210
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,333
you up something special.

211
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:32,874
-Huh?

212
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,600
-Oh, wow, a fight!

213
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,141
-Huh?

214
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,333
-Learn martial arts calligraphy.

215
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:06,233
I'll teach you everything
you need to know about it.

216
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,433
Just fill out an application.

217
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,733
When are you going to accept
my challenge, Sotatsu?

218
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,200
-We fought already.

219
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,733
-You know, I get the feeling
you're chickening out.

220
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,133
-Uh, Ranma--

221
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,833
-You are chicken, aren't you?

222
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,433
-Your handwriting
isn't up to par.

223
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,466
-I'll give you handwriting.

224
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:29,366
-Ranma!

225
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,133
-And I can write
with both hands.

226
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,400
-Had enough?

227
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,033
If you want to improve your
health, your handwriting,

228
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,500
and your martial
art skills, why not

229
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,400
experience martial
arts calligraphy?

230
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,033
-Man.

231
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,066
-Oh, Ranma.

232
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,400
-Oh, you can sign me up.

233
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,400
-He's so dreamy.

234
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,366
-Do you think I
could learn to do it?

235
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,100
-The training is pretty intense,
but I'm sure I can teach you.

236
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,633
-Would you personally
give us lessons every day?

237
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,566
-I think that can be arranged.

238
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,500
-I'm so ready to join.

239
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,833
-Wow, they love him.

240
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,966
-Ah, that jerk's not so tough.

241
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:09,700
I'll show him.

242
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,682
-They were so big and bouncy.

243
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,166
RANMA: OK.

244
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,266
I'm finished.

245
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,366
AKANE: Not yet.

246
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:35,233
-How about now?

247
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,000
-Keep going.

248
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,300
-Is that good enough?

249
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,966
-I can't read it

250
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,066
-Look harder then.

251
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,933
-Well, it looks like
chicken scratches.

252
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:42,700
-How's this?

253
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:46,800
-Done.

254
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,133
-Good job, Ranma.

255
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,066
-Thanks.

256
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,933
-What do you think you're doing?

257
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,700
-I'm sorry to tell you that
I cannot fight with you.

258
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,241
Observe.

259
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:04,066
-All those guys are
here to challenge you?

260
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,200
-Let me tell you this.

261
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,466
You're the only one
with bad handwriting.

262
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,500
-You failed.

263
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,933
Again.

264
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:22,933
Not acceptable.

265
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:26,400
-Oh, man.

266
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,466
I quit.

267
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:30,000
Who cares about martial
arts calligraphy?

268
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,533
-Did you hear yourself?

269
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,033
I thought you were
proud of the fact

270
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,633
that you've never
lost any fight that

271
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,900
has to do with martial arts.

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,266
-Wake up and smell
the coffee, Akane.

273
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:41,300
Calligraphy is
not a martial art.

274
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
It's nothing more than
stupid handwriting.

275
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,100
Fighting Ryoga would be harder.

276
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,641
-Ranma.

277
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:54,133
-Hi, Ranma.

278
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:54,666
-Ryoga.

279
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:55,207
-Ryoga.

280
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:55,700
-Hey.

281
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,166
Are you OK?

282
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:57,833
Tell me.

283
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,066
Who did this to you?

284
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:03,733
-I warn you, Ranma, not to
take Sotatsu too lightly.

285
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,833
-What?

286
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,866
You came all this way
to tell Ranma that?

287
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:09,866
-Yeah, I guess I'm a
sucker for punishment.

288
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:14,300
-What did you do with your
challenge letter, Ryoga?

289
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,300
-Here.

290
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,833
-Yeah, he wouldn't
fight you either.

291
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:17,933
Huh?

292
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,466
Cause your writing is
just as bad as mine.

293
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,100
Oh, man.

294
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,333
It's beautiful.

295
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,333
-And I wrote it
with my left hand.

296
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:29,500
RANMA (VOICEOVER): His
handwriting's better than mine.

297
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,500
-Oh, no.

298
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,033
Does this mean Ryoga's
better than me?

299
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,933
-They say, he who knows
the most is smarter.

300
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:42,066
-Let me wash all the ink off.

301
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,033
Uh, Ranma.

302
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,900
-I gotta beat him.

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
-Look at him.

304
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,233
I've never seen
Ranma so focused.

305
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,666
It's probably because he
thinks he's inferior to Ryoga.

306
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:56,533
Ryoga?

307
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:57,074
Huh?

308
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,600
P-chan, where did you come from?

309
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,400
-Sotatsu.

310
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,600
-Ah, you again.

311
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,533
You are persistent.

312
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,766
Let me have a look then.

313
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:17,166
Hm?

314
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,233
-Well what do you say?

315
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,500
-Hm.

316
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,833
Have it your way.

317
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:22,966
I'll give you your fight.

318
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,966
-Do you really mean it?

319
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:28,300
-But if you lose, you
must become my student.

320
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,100
-I'm not worried
about that because I

321
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,766
know I ain't going to lose.

322
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,566
-Now if you don't mind,
would you please leave.

323
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,466
-Until we meet again, loser.

324
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,033
All right.

325
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,433
I got my fight.

326
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:44,400
-I didn't the heart to tell him,
his handwriting is atrocious.

327
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:50,133
[drum]

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
-Before we begin, let
me introduce myself.

329
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,833
I am the referee,
Tatewaki Kuno, also known

330
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,466
as the Blue Thunder
of Furinkan High.

331
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:12,366
The style of the match will
be martial arts calligraphy.

332
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,866
If there are no questions,
than let us commence.

333
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:17,100
[cheering]

334
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,300
-Fight for the
pride of our dojo.

335
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
-The first combatant to
write the characters e roha

336
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,466
wins the match.

337
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,833
Do you understand?

338
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:35,700
Then let us begin.

339
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,633
-That's not a kanji character.

340
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:40,266
-It's still a character.

341
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,700
-Go.

342
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,666
-OK.

343
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:46,433
First I need a
little of this ink.

344
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:47,466
Hey, I'm not ready yet.

345
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:55,966
OK.

346
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,200
Now I'm ready.

347
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,766
-Yes.

348
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:58,866
I must admit.

349
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,266
You've improved.

350
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,266
But still you are no match for
me or my secret running spray.

351
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,633
-Well, it looks like Ranma
is keeping up with him.

352
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,033
-And now my paper whip move.

353
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:26,533
-Let me know when
you're ready to fight.

354
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,000
-You can do it, Ranma.

355
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,000
-Ranma is too busy
to even write.

356
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:42,900
[cheering]

357
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,533
-What's the big idea anyway?

358
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm trying to have a nap.

359
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,966
Hey, how did I get out here?

360
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:51,200
I must have had fun last night.

361
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,500
FEMALE VOICE: Come on, Sotatsu.

362
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,900
You can do it.

363
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,166
FEMALE VOICE: That's it, Ranma.

364
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:56,707
-Ranma?

365
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:01,966
What's this?

366
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:05,100
Ranma's fighting?

367
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,700
Oh, I see girls.

368
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,233
And even my sweet Akane.

369
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,533
-Block star letter move.

370
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:17,000
-That's no match for my
Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken.

371
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,266
-You've got him on the ropes.

372
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:19,933
-Hm, hm,

373
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,166
-Boy's looking good.

374
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,100
Hey?

375
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,641
-Uh, huh.

376
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,200
-I'm only getting started.

377
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:28,741
-Huh?

378
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:35,966
-Poor Kuno.

379
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,033
-Sotatsu isn't fighting fair.

380
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,100
-Paper attack.

381
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,500
-Hey, who turned out the lights?

382
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,666
-Now it's my chance to
finally finish him off.

383
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,433
-I've had enough.

384
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,333
Out of my way, creep.

385
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,500
-You're in my space, cretin.

386
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,466
-Don't get pushy.

387
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:02,966
-Go, Ranma, go.

388
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,833
-Hey, I need some elbow room.

389
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,800
-How about an elbow?

390
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,233
-What are you two clowns doing?

391
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,366
-Huh?

392
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:14,733
-Those are the biggest
brushes I've ever seen.

393
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,600
-Get lost you old freak.

394
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,766
-That's no way to
talk to your elders.

395
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,433
-Please excuse him,
sir, but we are

396
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,733
in the middle of a martial
arts calligraphy match.

397
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,333
-So you're practicing
handwriting?

398
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:27,400
You don't know how to write yet?

399
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,166
And here I thought I
was a slow learner.

400
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:31,566
-Would you take a hike?

401
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,666
-I think you misunderstood what
we're trying to tell you, sir.

402
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:35,566
-Yeah, yeah.

403
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,666
Whatever.

404
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:39,066
But first allow me to
show you how easy it

405
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,366
is to perfect your
handwriting skill.

406
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:45,600
You first start off by being the
brush and going with the flow.

407
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,000
First one way, then the
other, always keeping

408
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,933
the brush limp in your wrist.

409
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,133
Got it?

410
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,633
A limp wrist is the key.

411
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:54,700
Trust me, I know.

412
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,433
-Huh?

413
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:59,566
-Now watch and I'll
show you again.

414
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,633
There we go.

415
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:09,766
-Master.

416
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,966
-Why don't we got through
the alphabet, shall we?

417
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:17,766
A, B, C.

418
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:18,466
-I'm sorry.

419
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:19,633
This is so embarrassing.

420
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,266
[insane laughing]

421
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:33,333
-I've never seen anything
so funny in all my life.

422
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,800
[laughing]

423
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,800
-Ranma, now's your chance.

424
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,566
-Right.

425
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:46,600
-You just shimmy,
shimmy, shimmy.

426
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,733
-That should do it.

427
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,500
[insane laughing]

428
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,633
-What a loser.

429
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:57,166
-Yeah.

430
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:59,266
No kidding.

431
00:20:59,366 --> 00:20:59,933
-Hey wait.

432
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:00,900
Where are you going?

433
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,066
-Check this out.

434
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,100
-No!

435
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,500
No, it goes like this.

436
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,433
-You have to let it flow.

437
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,800
[laughing]

438
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,300
-You crack me up.

439
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,533
-This way and that.

440
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:18,300
All around.

441
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,600
Come on, everybody.

442
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,166
-Oh, Mr. Referee, aren't you
going to declare a winner?

443
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,366
-I call it a draw.

444
00:21:49,133 --> 00:22:09,437

445
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:19,697
NARRATOR: In the deepest
recesses of Furinkan High,

446
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:22,364
lies the mysterious
secondary school store.

447
00:23:22,464 --> 00:23:24,264
What secrets does it hold?

448
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:28,064
Next times on Ranma 1/2, the
Secret Dawn of Furinkan High.

449
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:29,930
We'll see you there.
