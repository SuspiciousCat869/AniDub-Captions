00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,057
NARRATOR: After attacking
the guard of Jusenkyo

2
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:41,657
and stealing the guidebook,
the mysterious youth

3
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:43,657
heads for Japan.

4
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:45,357
As it turns out,
the youth happened

5
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:47,657
to be picked up by
Happosai right after birth

6
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:49,557
and was washed in
that most tragic

7
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:51,490
of all cursed springs,
Yeti Riding Ox Carrying

8
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,057
Eel and Crane.

9
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:58,124
There in the rain, the
youth implicates Happosai

10
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:01,124
and makes off with Akane
to a distant locale.

11
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,457
Naturally, Ranma and
the others follow.

12
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,424
Will the youth avenge himself
against the wicked Happosai,

13
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:11,657
not to mention lots of Akane?

14
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,224
A water fortress?

15
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:23,290
What better way to finish your
cross dressing friend once he

16
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,524
comes charging to your rescue?

17
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:37,624
NARRATOR: "The Demon
From Jusenkyo, Part Two."

18
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,590
[grunting]

19
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:44,024
Hang on, Akane.

20
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,024
Hang on.

21
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,190
You've all come for me?

22
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,557
Well, it's certainly
taken you long enough.

23
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:07,124
Akane!

24
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:07,790
Ranma, don't!

25
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,290
It's a set up.

26
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,290
A what?

27
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,157
AKANE: Stay back!

28
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:21,990
Do as she says, cross dresser,
or these cute little face

29
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,490
will be covered with hose.

30
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,724
You can't!

31
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:26,524
You monster!

32
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,157
And we all know how
completely ridiculous

33
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:32,324
a person wearing
pantyhose looks.

34
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:35,257
How fiendishly clever of you.

35
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:37,057
Now you go too far.

36
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:39,524
In Akane's case,
though, maybe it helps.

37
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:40,957
[screaming]

38
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:43,857
Don't do it!

39
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:48,457
If you must put a stocking on
someone, then take me instead!

40
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:50,357
Ryoga!

41
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:51,290
AKANE: Ryoga!

42
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,124
Hey.

43
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:55,657
Perhaps you'd best cool down.

44
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:58,490
[screaming]

45
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,424
AKANE: Ryoga!

46
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:01,890
One down, you little coward.

47
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:06,724
Come back here!

48
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,157
Now where'd he go?

49
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:11,757
Yo, pantyhose!

50
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,290
Uh oh.

51
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:25,224
Hey thanks, man.

52
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:29,690
You're mine, Ranma, not his.

53
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,624
Two down.

54
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,790
[quacking]

55
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,657
Moose!

56
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:37,957
Now I really owe you my life.

57
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:39,957
[quacking]

58
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:50,857
[grunting]

59
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,424
Oh!

60
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,590
So here you is.

61
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,257
Shampoo?

62
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:55,357
She came to help me.

63
00:04:58,324 --> 00:04:59,157
[inaudible], Akane.

64
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,024
Time to die.

65
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,190
Shampoo, look out!

66
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,624
The trap!

67
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,990
[grunting]

68
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:13,357
And that makes three.

69
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:17,757
Now only the cross
dresser's left.

70
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:18,298
Ha.

71
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,624
[grunting]

72
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:32,724
Jeez.

73
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,157
I've got to be careful.

74
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:38,324
There's all kinds of water
just below the surface.

75
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:40,190
Don't worry, though, Akane.

76
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,924
I ain't giving up.

77
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:45,424
[grunting]

78
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,757
Huh?

79
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:49,090
I'm impressed.

80
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,290
I can't believe you made
it up without being soaked.

81
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,257
Tell you what, cross dresser.

82
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:56,790
I'll leave and let
you stay a man.

83
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,090
Seeing as how you're
into pantyhose,

84
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,957
I would have thought
you'd like me as a girl.

85
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:04,590
[grunting]

86
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:10,124
That's payback for the log.

87
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:14,257
Are you coming or not?

88
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,257
Always did like a guy
who holds a grudge.

89
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,557
[meowing]

90
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,557
Here goes.

91
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:42,024
[yelling]

92
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:43,790
What's the matter, pantyhose?

93
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,990
You going to fight back or what?

94
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,457
[grunting]

95
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:57,757
Here, how do you like this?

96
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:58,757
Ranma!

97
00:06:58,857 --> 00:06:59,324
Oh.

98
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:00,724
Do be careful.

99
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:03,757
As you may have noticed, there
are water traps everywhere.

100
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:04,524
Oh.

101
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,157
I so want this to be over.

102
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:09,557
Well, good thing you
changed to a girl.

103
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:16,090
Because while I have
no mercy for females,

104
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,024
I have even less
for cross dressers.

105
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:20,024
I'm not a girl.

106
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:21,024
I'm a guy.

107
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:28,957
Why, you--

108
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,290
[screaming]

109
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,790
Didn't I just warn
you about the water?

110
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,390
Even something like this can--

111
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:41,724
No!

112
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:44,190
[screaming]

113
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,624
Ranma!

114
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:48,557
If anything-- anything--
happens to him,

115
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:51,057
I don't know what I'm
going do, but-- hey!

116
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:51,757
Hey!

117
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:52,990
Are you listening to me?

118
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,690
I've told you before you
should have more faith.

119
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,190
Frankly, you're in
more danger than he.

120
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,731
What?

121
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,590
Huh?

122
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,524
[rattling]

123
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:09,324
A scorpion?

124
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:11,724
Was that why he threw the stone?

125
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,990
[grunting]

126
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,824
OK.

127
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:17,024
Let's try that again, shall we?

128
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:26,190
[quacking]

129
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,924
Man.

130
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:37,190
Talk about your lucky breaks.

131
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,290
And after we've had
one, we'll head back.

132
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,057
So where are we, do you think?

133
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,990
Leave that part to me.

134
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,390
I know just where we are.

135
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:53,957
I do wish I'd gotten a better
look at that cliff, though.

136
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:55,690
That's where I come in.

137
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,857
I got a really good look at it.

138
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:00,824
Great.

139
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,124
Then so long as
we work together--

140
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:04,490
We can't lose.

141
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,457
[laughing]

142
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:10,924
Hey, are you ready, huh?

143
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:12,390
What's the matter,
cross dresser?

144
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,290
Don't you want to fight back?

145
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,490
Why not defend yourself?

146
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,724
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Oh,
he'll lose at this rate.

147
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:23,224
Oh, if only he had
some hot water.

148
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:24,357
That one.

149
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:25,790
It looks familiar.

150
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,224
I'm a'coming, Shampoo!

151
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:31,457
Hot water!

152
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:33,824
Hey, Ryoga!

153
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:34,524
Be right there!

154
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,157
I'm almost there, Shampoo!

155
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:42,524
AKANE: Hey, over here!

156
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,524
Be right there!

157
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:48,824
I'd say it's just about over,
wouldn't you, cross dresser?

158
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,190
You--

159
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,357
Ugh.

160
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:51,924
That's it!

161
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:56,457
Huh?

162
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,824
Hey!

163
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:02,457
I want you to listen carefully.

164
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:04,190
It's not the fighting
I mind so much,

165
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,590
but I am sick of being
called cross dresser.

166
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,490
[grunting]

167
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,157
Wait a sec.

168
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,990
You're going to wish that
you hadn't done that.

169
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,490
No!

170
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,957
Ranma, catch!

171
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:21,957
Got it.

172
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:22,957
Oh no!

173
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:32,390
Akane!

174
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,390
[grunting]

175
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,290
Ranma.

176
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,890
You're not hurt, are you?

177
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,224
Thanks to you I'm not.

178
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,024
This is really it.

179
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:01,390
That dude is going down.

180
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,891
I have really had it.

181
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:24,058
Akane, you stay here, OK?

182
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:26,091
Just promise you'll be careful.

183
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:27,891
As long as I'm a guy, I--

184
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:32,558
[yelling]

185
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,691
Mousse, come on.

186
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,358
It's time to-- huh?

187
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,725
Here you go, Shampoo.

188
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,158
Give me that
before you waste it.

189
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:46,991
[grunting]

190
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:50,925
Damn him.

191
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:53,558
Even as a monster, he's
spent more time with Akane

192
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:54,925
than I have.

193
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,425
I won't allow it.

194
00:11:56,525 --> 00:12:00,191
Even when he wrapped Shampoo in
pantyhose, Chinese Amazon pride

195
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,991
no let her run away.

196
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,225
Shampoo's anger is my anger.

197
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,425
And so there we have it.

198
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:10,558
Now, are you guys going
to kick his butt, or am I?

199
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:11,358
I am.

200
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:17,891
RANMA: Ready?

201
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:20,191
ALL: Yeah.

202
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,158
Hi-ya!

203
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:25,591
[grunting]

204
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:37,366
Ranma!

205
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:43,158
[yelling]

206
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:45,125
He aiming for cliff.

207
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:48,558
He's going to smash us,
yeah, right into Akane.

208
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:49,991
Cut it out, pantyhose jerk.

209
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,425
Akane, run for it!

210
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:55,791
Wha--

211
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:57,225
Akane!

212
00:12:57,325 --> 00:12:57,766
Run!

213
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:03,558
[whimpering]

214
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:09,558
Ranma, I'll take care of Akane.

215
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:10,099
Happosai?

216
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:15,725
The old man.

217
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:16,891
What are you doing, freak?

218
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:18,091
Let her go.

219
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,058
Can't you see that
I'm protecting her?

220
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:23,158
RYOGA: No, stupid.

221
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:24,858
You're putting her in danger.

222
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,791
What if we all hit him?

223
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,125
Good idea.

224
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,358
And a one, and a two, and a--

225
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:37,558
All right.

226
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:40,491
He felt it.

227
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,491
Waterfall!

228
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:45,458
[screaming]

229
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:08,825
[gasps]

230
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,291
It seems that
they have all gone.

231
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,525
They can't be.

232
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,025
We just have to find them.

233
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,225
Poor things.

234
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:18,258
Now they're no more than
stars in the evening sky.

235
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,991
Yeah, so sorry
to disappoint you.

236
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,958
Ranma!

237
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:25,625
A cave behind the waterfall.

238
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:26,166
Wow.

239
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:32,825
I come to protect you and
this is how you repay me?

240
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:35,658
Look, we're not letting you
go until you tell us what

241
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:37,591
you did to make him so mad.

242
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,658
Let's just get it over with.

243
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,925
I know nothing--
nothing, I tell you.

244
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,391
I see.

245
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:46,391
So it's all some kind of
a big misunderstanding.

246
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:47,325
Is that it?

247
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,425
Don't be mad at me.

248
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:52,258
You act like somehow,
it's my fault.

249
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:56,525
I ought to be thanked for
what I did, not blamed.

250
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,625
Now we're getting somewhere.

251
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:02,358
Why don't you tell us and
let us be the judge of that?

252
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,758
You remember how I told you
I washed the newborn, right?

253
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,425
What's that?

254
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:13,625
You want me to name
the newborn, too?

255
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:15,191
It's old village custom.

256
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:19,258
One who help birth newborn
help come up with name as well.

257
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:22,758
Very well, but only
because you asked.

258
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,625
Just you watch, son.

259
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:27,291
I'll come up with a name
you'll be proud to use.

260
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:35,025
For three days and nights,
I gave it my full attention.

261
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:45,125
Your name is Pantyhose Taro.

262
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:46,558
You what?

263
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:48,091
P-- p-- panty--

264
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:49,958
Hose Taro?

265
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:52,958
And you actually
wonder why he's upset?

266
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:55,258
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

267
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:59,291
You don't really
think that-- huh?

268
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,325
At least your
memory's good, old man.

269
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,091
How long has he, um--

270
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:06,225
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:07,858
I had no idea.

272
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,758
All this time, I've been
saying, "You jerk, you stupid

273
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:14,458
pantyhose jerk," as
though Pantyhose Jerk was

274
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:15,158
your real name.

275
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:22,258
Now that I know better,
though, you're Pantyhose Taro.

276
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:23,625
Shut up.

277
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,891
Still, with a
name like that, one

278
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:28,525
does expect a certain
amount of deviance.

279
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,891
And here, I worked so hard
to come up with it, too.

280
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,258
You did not.

281
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:37,291
If you hate the name
he gave you so much,

282
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:39,325
why can't you just
make one up yourself?

283
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:40,791
Change name is impossible.

284
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:43,391
Village custom forbid it.

285
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:44,591
That's right.

286
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:47,358
Once someone gives a name,
their decision is final.

287
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,125
You really don't like it?

288
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,658
What do you think?

289
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,691
Since you're the one who
gave it to him, though,

290
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,058
you can change it, right?

291
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:54,691
You see?

292
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,091
Problem solved.

293
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:59,858
Are you going to
change it or not?

294
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,291
Hm?

295
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:03,691
[gasping]

296
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,591
Uh-uh, no way.

297
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:10,891
It's Pantyhose Taro or nothing.

298
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:12,525
Yo, dude, are you OK?

299
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,691
[coughing]

300
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,358
Yo, man.

301
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,925
Pantyhose Taro?

302
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,225
I said shut up.

303
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:20,758
Still Pantyhose Taro is
better than Panty Taro, right?

304
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:21,725
Yeah.

305
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,158
Panty Taro's pretty
bad all right.

306
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:25,691
Pantyhose is much better.

307
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,525
[grunting]

308
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,758
SHAMPOO: Shampoo thinks so too.

309
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:30,891
Kind of suits him,
don't you think?

310
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:34,158
Oh, absolutely.

311
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:35,958
You're all going to be sorry.

312
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,458
Just wait and see.

313
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,691
[gasping]

314
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,558
The cave's already been
weakened by Happosai's fire

315
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:44,491
burst.

316
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:47,191
He no more care
what happens now.

317
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,691

320
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:10,625
Ranma!

321
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:13,125
Not again!

322
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,125
Cut it out.

323
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:17,125
Put me down!

324
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:20,091
Ranma!

325
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,591
Hang in there just a bit longer.

326
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:26,591
OK.

327
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:27,591
Can't hold on!

328
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:36,058
Ranma!

329
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,558
Here, use this.

330
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:42,525
Got it.

331
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,025
Thanks!

332
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,525
You ready, jerk?

333
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,025
Woo hoo, going down.

334
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,058
If Ranma can smash him
into the ground like that,

335
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:55,991
he's sure to win.

336
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:58,425

338
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,158
Here we go.

00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:18,725
Just what I was waiting for.

341
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,691
[grunting]

342
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:29,591
Take this!

343
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:33,558
Shooting star Pantyhose kick.

344
00:19:33,658 --> 00:19:36,158
[grunting]

345
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:42,291
You lose.

346
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:59,525
Pantyhose!

347
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,791
Hey, no fair.

348
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:04,058
Get off me.

349
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:06,391
Looks like this
gang's all here, right?

350
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:06,932
Mm-hm.

351
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,958
Just hit him until you feel
better, OK, Pantyhose Taro?

352
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:15,491
Don't call me that.

353
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:16,891
Listen, old man.

354
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:20,791
This is your last chance to come
up with a better name for me.

355
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:23,258
What's wrong with
Pantyhose Taro?

356
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:26,058
Excuse me?

357
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,958
[yelling]

358
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,858
Pantyhose Taro.

359
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,091
Shut up, would you?

360
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:39,691
Isn't that just wonderful?

361
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,958
You're finally going to
have a name that you like.

362
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:44,425
Well, he's pretty
stubborn, but we're

363
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:47,325
sure you'll be able to
persuade him somehow.

364
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:47,991
Here.

365
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:49,591
Knock yourself out.

366
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:51,391
I appreciate it.

367
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:54,358
Most likely, we'll
never meet again.

368
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:54,899
Farewell.

369
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:03,891
Don't come back now, you hear?

370
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:05,425
Take good care
of the freak, OK?

371
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,658
Say, Ranma, what do you
think his new name will be?

372
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:16,358
Whatever it is, it can't
be any worse than it was.

373
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,425
Wonder Bra Kiro.

374
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:18,791
No, that doesn't work.

375
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:19,491
Underwear Saburu.

376
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:21,125
How's that?

377
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:23,991
Um, Loincloth Shiro, maybe.

378
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:25,425
Cockroach Goro?

379
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:26,425
I don't know.

380
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:27,691
Heartburn Rokuro maybe.

381
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,558
Belly Wrap Shakiro.

382
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,025
Girdle Hachiro?

383
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,025
[inaudible]

384
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,025
Buck Naked Yokiro?

385
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:35,991
Come on.

386
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,393
It's Christmas
Eve and I haven't

387
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:19,593
seen Ranma since twilight.

388
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:23,493
Honestly, if he doesn't come
soon, he'll miss the party.

389
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:26,627
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"A Christmas Without Ranma."

390
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,760
We'll see you there.
