But why do I got to wear
this dumb bunny costume, ha?

Why don't you wear it?

You're a girl, ain't you?

-Oh, but Ranma, you look so
much better in it than I do.

OK, already.

tease me, darling.

Is there somewhere special
I should hand the wash?

-Uh, there's a clothesline
in the backyard.

--[giggles] Oh, is
that the backyard?

is so small that I-- well,

-Hm.

But do you really
think a flyer is

315
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:47,528
enough to attract new students?

-I'm telling you, they
are going to be swarming

00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:22,294
-Huh?

336
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,128
-I'll sell the Kuno
ancestral estate

337
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,394
to raise the money, if need be.

338
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:29,061
Darling, just think of the
improvements we might make!

339
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,528
-[gulps]

340
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:35,061
-Saotome, you tell this woman
who this dojo belongs to.

341
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:36,428
-To you, of course.

342
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,761
But someday, it will be Ranma's.

343
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:39,894
-Yes, yes.

344
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:43,194
But only after Ranma
marries my Akane, right?

345
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:43,828
-(SQUEALS) What?

346

[sobs]

347
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:51,561
Then, then you're saying that
he has no claim on the dojo

348
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:54,528
unless he weds with
the dread Akane Tendo?

349
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:55,461
Oh!

350
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,961
-Yeah, that just
about sums it up.

351
00:14:58,061 --> 00:14:58,861
-Why?

352
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:02,161
Why didn't you say so earlier?

353
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:03,094
-Why?

354
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,494
Because you never
asked, my dear.

355
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:07,961
-[sobbing]

356
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:16,128
-What?

357
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,528
What was that all about?

358
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:28,228
-[yawns] Ah!

00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,694
Ding-dong, the witch
is finally dead.

360
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:33,394
Maybe now, I can get
some peace and quiet.

361
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:35,994
-The pervert doth
protest too much.

362
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,161
-Did you just say something?

363
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:38,128
-Hm.

364
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,494
How many will
come, do you think?

365
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:40,061
-Hm.

366
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:41,194
Good question.

367
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:43,361
-Or we could, uh, make
a little wager on it.

368
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:44,461
What do you say?

369
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,394
-You're on.

370
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:47,794
-Would you two
please be serious!

00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:50,494

375
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:57,702
-Hm?

376
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:01,628
All right!

377
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,428
-Ranma, we did it!

378
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:06,294
-Well, technically
speaking, I did it.

379
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:07,694
But--

380
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:08,861
-Oh, Saotome.

381
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,628
-Oh, Tendo.

we'll never go hungry again.

Just write your name and
address on this line.

roll, uh, boys.

drive for our brand-new dojo.

-Like, enroll now, and you'll
get an all-you-can-eat Korean

00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:03,761
barbecue dinner.

394

-Whoa, you can count me in.

395
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,794
Cancel my enrollment, huh?

396
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:09,335
-What?

397
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:09,928
-Me, too!

398
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,261
-That's me, three!

399
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,261
-But--

00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,228
-You can't do that!

401
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:15,769
-Hey!

402
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:16,261
-Come on!

403
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:16,828
-Come back!

404
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:18,194
-My darlings!

405
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:19,161
Wait!

406
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,361
-M-- ma-- master, no!

407
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:23,261
Well, better-- oh!

408
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:24,428
-What's the matter with you?

409
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:25,361
What are you thinking?

410
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:31,928
-Uh, I'm going to kill him!

411
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:32,861
-Fine, then!

412
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,428
I guess, I'll be going, too.

-Akane!

Sh-- should I turn
back to a guy or--

00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,928
AKANE: You're asking me?

416
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,661
Honestly, Dad, you
picked the worst time

417
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,628
to play "deer caught
in the headlights."

418

-Hey, I don't see it.

419
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:47,961
Or something.

00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,428
-Where's the beef?

421
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,561
-Where's the beef?

422
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:52,994
-This must be it.

423
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:53,561
-Hm.

424
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:55,161
Leave it to me.

425
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,161
-Ranma, wait!

426
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:58,161
Where are you--

427
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:58,828
-Huh!

428
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:00,161
-One, two, one, two.

429
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:01,661
Butts in the air, girls.

430
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:02,661
There you go.

431
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,261
Feel the burn!

432
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:06,228
One, two, one, two.

433
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:08,228
Boys, too, suck in those guts.

434
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:09,028
There you go.

435
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:09,828
That's the way.

436
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:10,628
-Oh, my god.

437
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:12,361
It's Anything Goes Aerobics!

438
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:13,728
-So what?

439
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:16,028
You thought they'd be doing
karate or something like that?

440
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,094
-Yup.

441
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:19,361
-The two styles would
seem incompatible.

442
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:20,028
RANMA: Yup.

443
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:21,328
-One, two, one, two.

444
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:22,328
Come on, girls.

445
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:24,794
-For an old guy,
he's pretty good.

446
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:25,361
-That's it.

447
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:26,294
That's right.

448
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:28,294
Now, relax.

449
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:29,294
Oh, OK, now.

450
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:31,761
Now, let's try-- oh!

451
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,761
-Ugh.

452
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,861
-M-- master?

453
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:34,528
-That's it.

454
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:35,661
He's dead.

455
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,061
-[squeals] Oh, Ranma, darling.

456
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,894
You finally made it.

457
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,194
-Here we go again.

458
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,828
-So you're behind all this.

459
00:18:42,928 --> 00:18:45,494
-A word with you in
private, mon cher?

460
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:46,594
-Huh.

461
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:50,094
-After all, this is
your own dojo, my pet.

mean by that, huh?

00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:56,361
-Oh, how I love it
when you take command.

465
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,694
You needn't take it
if you don't want it.

466
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:04,961
-This has gone far enough!

467
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,161
Ranma's marrying my Akane
and taking over my dojo.

468
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:09,194
And that's it!

469
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:12,494
-I'd take this
dojo if I were him.

470
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:13,861
Ugh.

His or mine?

-Choose hers, and you die.

Do you hear me?

475
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:19,661
-Choose hers!

476
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:20,461
Choose hers!

477
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,228
Choose hers!

Will you?

485
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:35,228

-No.

You hate dojos, then, darling?

What I'm saying is the Saotome
School is Anything Goes.

It doesn't need a dojo.

So I don't need Akane.

00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:15,194
KASUMI: Time for
breakfast, everyone.

503
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:21,028
-Hm.

504
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:23,761
Just tea for breakfast, then?

505
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,094
-[chuckles]

506
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:26,228
Don't be silly.

507
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:29,194
Tomorrow, we'll be out of tea.

508
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:34,128
-We'd be eating barbecue right
now if it wasn't for Ranma.

509
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:36,761
-How can you even say
something like that?

510
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:37,728
-Hm.

511
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,694
I know I'm not long
for this world.

512
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:40,728
-Yeah!

513
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:44,094
Because I'm going to
put you out of it!

514
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:45,528
Hm?

515
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,528
What the heck is this?

516
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:47,828
-A black rose!

517
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:50,428
It's from Kodachi.

518
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:53,761
-"To my darling Ranma."

519
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,928
KODACHI (VOICEOVER): What
is it you desire, my love?

520
00:20:56,028 --> 00:21:05,361
You have but to say it,
and it shall be yours."

521
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:07,828
-I want bras and panties!

522
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:11,528
-Maybe we can have the
lights turned back on?

523
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:13,761
-I wouldn't mind a
CD player myself.

524
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:14,394
-Rice.

525
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:15,828
That's all I want.

526
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:16,928
-What is this?

527
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:17,694
Christmas?

528
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:18,794
-No.

529
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:20,461
But she did say all
you had to do is ask.

530
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:21,794
-Nabiki!

531
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:22,694
-Say it!

532
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:23,628
Say!

533
00:21:23,728 --> 00:21:24,228
-Go on, son.

534
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:24,994
-Yes, you do it.

535
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:25,528
What are you waiting for?

536
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:25,994
-Yes.

537
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:26,561
-Just ask her.

538
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,961
-Say it already.

539
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:30,328
HAPPOSAI: And get me a bowl of
teriyaki eel while your at it.

540
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:31,261
GENMA: And ramen.

541
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,994
Don't forget the ramen.

542
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:35,294
SOUN: Yeah, and potstickers.

543
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,561
[grunts]

544
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,294
(SHOUTS) Would all
of you just shut up?

545
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:49,576
[music playing]

546
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:18,098
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Hang in there, Gramps.

547
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:20,498
You've got a lot of
time before you die.

548
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,398
Huh?

549
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:22,498
What's wrong?

550
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:25,065
For some reason, you're
not looking very well.

551
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:28,598
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"The Last Days of Happosai."

552
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,532
We'll see you there.
