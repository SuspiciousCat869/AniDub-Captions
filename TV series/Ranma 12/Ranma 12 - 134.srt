Where's that mailbox!

5
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,662
Oh, boy.

6
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:56,528
I just cannot believe my luck.

7
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:59,795
I must have made a wrong
turn at that corner store.

8
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:01,328
You dummy!

VOICE: And today
was the day I was

10
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:04,728
going to tell her how I felt.

11
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:05,528
Who's there?

12
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:12,095
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Who is this kid?

13
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:13,862
You were-- you
were just wondering,

14
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,895
who is this kid, weren't you?

15
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:16,862
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

16
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,395
He can read minds.

17
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:20,628
That one was easy.

18
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:23,095
You thought to yourself,
he can read minds.

19
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:24,562
That's pretty good, huh?

20
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:25,995
Amazing.

21
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:28,062
This kid can read minds.

22
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,828
For real.

AKANE (VOICEOVER): Akane's
unfathomable heart.

24
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,028
What are you doing
out here following me?

25
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,262
Ha, you're right.

26
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:48,062
I am following you for a reason.

27
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:49,795
It's because a few
miles back there

28
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:52,095
I noticed that you
dropped this in the woods.

29
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:54,428
Hey, that's my-- huh?

30
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:57,728
It's gone.

31
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:58,662
Huh?

32
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,628
The girl's name
is-- Akane Tendo.

33
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:02,662
RANMA: Ha, yeah.

34
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,595
It looks like you're
right again, kid.

35
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:08,228
Can I have my
picture back, please?

36
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:10,662
Tell me, where
does this girl live?

37
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:13,595
Why would you want to
know where Akane lives?

38
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,395
Oh, now I see.

39
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,928
She doesn't live very
far from here at all.

40
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:19,128
What?

41
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,695
I think I would
like to meet her.

42
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:24,195
What?

43
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:24,736

Wow, I'm so glad that's done.

48
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,595
Hey, what are you
doing tomorrow?

49
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,262
AKANE: Ranma, when
you get home, can you

50
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:53,062
put this on the
coffee table for me?

51
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:53,628
Sure.

52
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,428
But what is it?

53
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:56,762
It's for the puppet show.

54
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,928
A monster?

55
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:01,362
It's a princess, you idiot!

56
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:02,895
Oh, now I see it!

57
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:04,928
It-- it's a princess, all right.

58
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,028
Hurry up, Akane.

59
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:06,562
Oh!

60
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:07,128
I'm coming.

61
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:07,962
I've gotta go.

62
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:11,462
So can you just do it, please?

63
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:12,003
Hm?

64
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,762
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
I was wondering

65
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,662
what she's been trying to
sew the last few nights.

66
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:30,895
You gotta admit, though,
it's still pretty ugly.

67
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:33,362
Ugh!

68
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:35,962
Ranma, you go out
on date with Shampoo?

69
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,228
I'm busy!

70
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:39,195
So the answer is no!

71
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,295
OK, then.

72
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:42,995
Shampoo help you, and
then we go on date.

73
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:45,562
I've gotta drop
something off for Akane.

74
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:46,528
Hm?

75
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:47,528
Huh?

76
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:48,528
Ah!

77
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:49,528
Oh, no.

78
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:51,095
Is that your errand?

79
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,728
So, Shampoo, do
you always carry

80
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,928
around needles and thread?

81
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:01,162
Shampoo always
prepared for anything.

82
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:02,128
Oh.

[humming]

84
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,495
I finish.

85
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:09,195
Awesome!

86
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:10,362
Hey, thanks.

87
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:10,903
No.

88
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:11,995
Huh?

89
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,495
Not until you promise to
have date with Shampoo.

90
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:18,028
But I-- I promised Akane I'd
take the puppet home for her.

91
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:20,062
Does Akane mean
that much to you?

92
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:20,862
Get serious.

93
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:21,562
Huh?

94
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:24,628
OK, then we can date!

95
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:26,995
First, I think we
should have lunch, OK?

96
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:34,395
Sorry, Shampoo.

97
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:37,862
But my first promise was
to deliver this for Akane.

98
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,403
Ranma!

99
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:46,728
Oh, good.

100
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,495
Akane isn't home yet.

101
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,928
Huh?

102
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,028
Who's this for?

103
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:54,195
There you go.

104
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:56,895
VOICE: Akane would be
mad if she found out.

105
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:57,436
Huh?

106
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:04,903
Huh?

107
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:13,795
VOICE: I better
keep it a secret.

108
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,762
You can try to get
me, but you'll just

109
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:17,128
be wasting your time.

110
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:18,828
I'm way too fast.

111
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,562
Come here, you little creep!

112
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:22,162
Why, you little--

113
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:22,962
Too slow.

114
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:24,228
Come back here!

115
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:25,628
Oh, my.

116
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:29,862
Punch of the tiger dragon!

117
00:06:29,962 --> 00:06:32,862
SATORI: Akane's puppet got--

118
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:34,262
Ooh-la-la.

119
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,628
VOICE: So I had Shampoo--

120
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:40,928
You better shut your trap.

121
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:41,562
Or else.

122
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:48,695
I see you're getting
along just fine.

123
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,728
Like birds of a feather.

124
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,962
Would somebody please tell
me who the little brat is?

125
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:54,762
Oh, Nabiki.

126
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:56,695
Thanks again for the tea.

127
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:59,528
He says he's a
friend of Ryoga's.

128
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,628
Ryoga, you say?

129
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:03,195
Why, I haven't seen
him around for a while.

130
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:06,195
And I always thought he
didn't have any friends.

131
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:09,762
Well, to be perfectly
honest, I only just met Ryoga.

132
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,362
What is it with all
the racket out there?

133
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:15,828
Don't you realize that I'm
trying to, uh-- meditate?

134
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:17,595
OK, Ryoga's friend.

135
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:18,828
You got a name?

136
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:22,695
Well, you're not gonna
believe me when I tell you.

137
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:23,795
Huh?

138
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:24,362
OK.

139
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:25,395
Here it is.

140
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:27,462
My name's Satori.

141
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:30,128
Tendo, did he say
his name was Katori?

142
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:31,328
No, Saotome.

143
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,862
It sounded to me like he
said his name was Hatori.

144
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,795
Oh, he must be a ninja.

145
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:38,028
No!

146
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:39,128
My name's Satori.

147
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:39,669
Sa-to-ri!

148
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,428
Well, that's a very nice name.

149
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:46,595
Uh, thanks a lot.

150
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:47,962
Hang on.

151
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:50,328
Doesn't your name come from
some character in a fairy tale?

152
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,428
Exactly!

153
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:54,595
And I'm that boy who
can read people's minds.

154
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:55,528
Oh.

155
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:56,562
Interesting.

156
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:57,895
A mind-reader, eh?

157
00:07:57,995 --> 00:07:58,928
Pretty impressive.

158
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:02,195
You know, kids say
the darndest things.

159
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,662
Oh, boy.

160
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:05,062
But I can read minds!

161
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,403
Huh?

162
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:22,069
Hm?

163
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:40,195
Ahh!

164
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:41,228
Hey!

165
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:41,795
Help!

166
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:42,662
Someone help me!

167
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,262
Snap out of it.

168
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:45,595
Huh?

169
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:48,662
What the heck is
the matter with you?

170
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,028
I think the boy's
a little tired.

171
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:52,495
I'm not tired!

172
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,095
I just went too
far into her mind.

173
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:56,462
I'll prove it.

174
00:08:56,562 --> 00:09:00,228
Old man, this time I'll tell
everyone what you're thinking.

175
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:01,395
Well, all right.

176
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:04,862
Uh, Satori, let's say,
for the sake of argument,

177
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,595
you really can read
people's thoughts.

178
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:09,928
Well, with that in mind, might I
suggest you pick someone else's

179
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:11,295
brain to read?

180
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:12,762
Trust us on this one, kid.

181
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,262
RANMA: Hey, kid, what's wrong?

182
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,128
WOMAN: Oh, my.

183
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:26,095
TENDO: What happened?

184
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:27,362
GENMA: What's the matter?

185
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:28,562
TENDO: Get some ice, quickly!

186
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:34,295
He must have seen
something horrible.

187
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:36,428
You should really
lie down, Satori.

188
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,328
Why don't you believe me?

189
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:41,928
It's because the people in this
house are strange, that's all!

190
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:43,695
Well, what do you say
we give him one more

191
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:45,328
chance to prove himself.

192
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:46,228
AKANE: I'm home!

193
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:51,095
[music playing]

194
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:09,652
I'm home!

195
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:12,419
What are you all doing in here?

196
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,519
Come in, Akane.

197
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:15,219
Yes.

198
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:16,752
Grab a seat and join us.

199
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:20,219
Well, everyone, it seems we've
just found our next victim.

200
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,352
Huh?

201
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:22,886
Akane, this is Satori.

202
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,686
He's a friend of
Ryoga's, and he claims

203
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,619
he can read people's minds.

204
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,419
He-- hello.

205
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,086
Hello there.

206
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:32,486
So, you're a little
psychic, huh?

207
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:34,219
TENDO: Why don't you
try reading Akane's?

208
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:34,760
Huh?

209
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:43,919
Mm-- huh?

210
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,219
I can't.

211
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:56,952
Do you know what we
do to little boys who

212
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:58,419
tell fibs around here?

213
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,019
He's teasing.

214
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:03,386
Why don't you turn in
for the night, Satori?

215
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:05,019
AKANE: Oh, Ranma, thank you!

216
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:05,560
Hm?

217
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,319
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Oh, man.

218
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,219
Shampoo did too
good of a job on it.

219
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,019
Yeah, no problem.

220
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,052
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Good, she didn't notice.

221
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:21,852
You just thought,
good, she didn't notice!

222
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:25,860
Hm?

223
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:34,386
Stop that!

224
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,152
Quit following me!

225
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:38,152
You don't want me
hanging around you.

226
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:39,452
Gee, what was your first clue?

227
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,452
You know I can
read your thoughts.

228
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:42,952
Back off!

229
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:44,652
And what if I don't?

230
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:45,719
Shut up!

231
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:46,552
Hey, you two.

232
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:48,219
Breakfast's ready.

233
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,252
Oh, good morning, Akane.

234
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:52,519
Ranma's hiding a
secret from you.

235
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:53,386
Huh?

236
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:54,152
Ranma?

237
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:55,486
Hey, what's the big idea?

238
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,386
We don't want our breakfast
to get cold, do we, Satori?

239
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,586
TENDO: Kasumi, perhaps
we need to ration food

240
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:13,686
for the rest of the month.

241
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:15,186
As you wish, Father.

242
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:44,419
What is up with you always
stealing my food, you cheat?

243
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,086
But that's not true!

244
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:04,286
That little creep doesn't know
who he's dealing with yet.

245
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:06,686
Hm?

246
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,319
Now what?

247
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,552
Oh, nothing .

248
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,519
Then get lost, kid.

249
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:12,060
OK.

250
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,286
Hm?

251
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:17,486
Ah!

252
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:20,986
No, wait, come back here,
you little smart aleck!

253
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:21,852
What's going on?

254
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,652
Keep it down, boy!

255
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:26,886
Come on, open this door before
I start to get really mad, you

256
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,552
little fairy tale freak!

257
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:29,519
SATORI: Leave me alone.

258
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:30,719
I'm busy.

259
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,619
Now you're asking for it!

260
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:35,886
GENMA: Sometimes I hate
to admit he's my son.

261
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:37,586
Now, now.

262
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:38,552
Never mind him.

263
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,119
And besides, we both
know his bark is

264
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,486
bigger than his bite, Saotome.

265
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,819
Oh, I think I've got you.

266
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,619
I knew you were gonna do that.

267
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,619
Now try to get out of this.

268
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,986
Huh?

269
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:53,152
Oh, Satori, please
don't surprise us.

270
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,086
You scared me out of my mind.

271
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:57,486
I agree.

272
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,652
Mister with the head wrap, the
mister with the dumb mustache

273
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:01,919
was expecting that
move, you know.

274
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:02,786
It's not dumb!

275
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:03,986
What?

276
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,619
I'll do something different.

277
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,086
Maybe like this.

278
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:07,952
Oh!

279
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,519
I didn't see that.

280
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,252
Don't worry, Mr. Mustache.

281
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,619
The man with the head wrap
just did that without a plan.

282
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,219
It's just a fluke.

283
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,019
Then I've got nothing
to worry about.

284
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,719
It looks like I'm going
to win another one.

285
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:21,086
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
The kid's just

286
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,352
playing with the both of them.

287
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:26,152
TENDO: So, Satori, where
should I make my next move?

288
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:27,352
GENMA: Hey that's not fair!

289
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:28,019
You're cheating.

290
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:33,052
Are you going out, Akane?

291
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:33,752
Yeah.

292
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,052
I have puppet practice.

293
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:36,386
Well, you have fun.

294
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:37,719
[bell ringing]

295
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:42,252
Ni hao, everyone!

296
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:43,386
Shampoo?

297
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,852
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

298
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,252
None your business.

299
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:48,452
Shampoo here to see Ranma.

300
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:49,786
Shampoo?

301
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:52,152
Remember your little
promise with Shampoo?

302
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,719
What little promise?

303
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,119
Uh-- it's like--

304
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:58,686
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
I'm in trouble.

305
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:01,252
Akane, you like
the puppet, yes?

306
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:04,452
Uh-- nothing, really, Akane.

307
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,319
Shampoo, could you step
outside for a minute?

308
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:07,286
What about your date?

309
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:14,252
Why, you-- you're
gonna pay for this!

310
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:16,586
SHAMPOO: Look,
Shampoo made lunch.

311
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:17,819
Is that so?

312
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,786
Hang on.

313
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,052
I can explain.

314
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,486
You know, I'm not in the
mood for any excuses.

315
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:25,319
Huh?

316
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:26,386
Wait, Akane.

317
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:28,886
It's not how it looks.

318
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:33,319
You know, this doll looks
too nice for me to have made.

319
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,119
That's because, Akane,
Shampoo fix ripped puppet

320
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,719
when Ranma asked me yesterday.

321
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:38,852
She's right.

322
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,886
This nice lady really
did mend your puppet.

323
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:42,052
See?

324
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:44,286
I told them I really
could read people's minds.

325
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:45,619
Hey, yeah!

326
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:48,019
And you know you're the best
mind-reader Shampoo ever met

327
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:48,686
in whole life.

328
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:49,552
Gee, thanks.

329
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:50,986
Um, well, uh--

330
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:52,519
Is that the truth, Ranma?

331
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,486
Well, uh-- I mean, it
really was an accident.

332
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,886
Ah.

333
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:59,419
But Rama still hiding something
even more important from you.

334
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,352
Go ahead and ask them about it.

335
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:03,386
Hey, what are you
saying, you little brat?

336
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:05,152
I told her everything
there is to tell,

337
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:07,519
and that's the end of
it, you understand.

338
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:10,086
Ranma, you know you haven't
told her the whole story.

339
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,152
OK.

340
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:20,086
That's just about enough
out of you, kiddo.

341
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:21,752
You should be
ashamed of yourself

342
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:24,086
for the way you've acted, Ranma.

343
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:25,886
You're disgusting!

344
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:26,786
Akane--

345
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,119
Take that!

346
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:30,952
I'll get you, Satori!

347
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,052
I never thought Ranma
could sink so low.

348
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:44,419
[knocking]

349
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,619
Who is it?

350
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:48,886
Oh.

351
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:49,686
Oh, Satori.

352
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:51,252
What can I do for you?

353
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:57,952
I kind of thought you might
be feeling a little down.

354
00:16:58,052 --> 00:16:59,319
I'm all right.

355
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,486
Are you telling me you don't
mind if the guy you're engaged

356
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,152
to wrecks your puppet?

357
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:05,486
That has the nerve to go
behind your back and promise

358
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:08,052
to go out on a date
with that Chinese girl?

359
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,319
I-- I don't know.

360
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,719
I guess I should hate him.

361
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,886
Are you sure?

362
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:14,852
I'm very sure.

363
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:30,752
I can't-- I can't
read her thoughts.

364
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:39,386
Akane did work really
hard on this doll.

365
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:41,386
I suppose I should go
and apologize to her.

366
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:52,052
SATORI (VOICEOVER): I just
can't seem to read her mind.

367
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:55,052
If you wanna know
why, I'll tell you.

368
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:56,652
Huh?

369
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,519
Na-- Nabiki?

370
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,252
Listen, if you really want to
know the reason why you can't

371
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:04,019
read her, just let me know.

372
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,486
But if not, then
don't waste my time.

373
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,219
So, tell me!

374
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,419
Hm.

375
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,552
First you'll have to tell
me my thoughts, Satori.

376
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:17,486
Huh.

377
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:18,686
How interesting.

378
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:21,419
It looks like you really
can read people's minds.

379
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,652
You see, the reason why
you can't read her thoughts

380
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,586
is because you have
a crush on Akane.

381
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:29,352
Are you saying you can
read people's minds, too?

382
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:29,886
Oh.

383
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:32,819
Well, maybe.

384
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:33,360
Huh?

385
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,019
Now what?

386
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,786
Akane hates you!

387
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:45,986
She hates everything about you!

388
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:48,852
Hey, don't tell me you
have feelings for Akane.

389
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:51,619
You really shouldn't
have said that, Ranma.

390
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,819
I want a duel!

391
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:54,852
You want a fight?

392
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:56,886
Well, fine by me, pipsqueak.

393
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,586
I'd be more than
happy to meet you up

394
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:02,452
on the roof and mess
with your puny pea brain!

395
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:04,919
It's so nice to see the
mature side of Ranma.

396
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,619
I'm ready.

397
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,986
But honestly, I don't think
you're fast enough to catch me.

398
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:18,886
You're just a
spoiled little brat

399
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:20,552
who thinks he's pretty tough.

400
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:21,686
Well, I'll teach you!

401
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:29,386
You're not gonna win.

402
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:30,886
I can read all of your moves!

403
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,352
He's right.

404
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:41,619
He can read all my moves.

405
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,686
That's enough, you two.

406
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,652
What do you think you're doing?

407
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:50,193
Huh?

408
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:50,693
Akane?

409
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:54,919
Satori!

410
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,386
I wish you'd just leave
and never come around Akane

411
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:58,752
ever again, you bully!

412
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:03,319
Ha ha!

413
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,352
Now I've got you.

414
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:05,986
Hey, let me go!

415
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:06,952
Ranma!

416
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:09,586
You put him down
this very instant!

417
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:10,952
Stop it!

418
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:14,252
Hey, you don't know what I've
been through with this kid.

419
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:14,793
Ahh!

420
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,486
[screaming]

421
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,086
Huh?

422
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:36,552
I can read Ranma's secret.

423
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,552
And Akane, yours too!

424
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,252
Akane!

425
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:44,019
Wait a sec-- you're both liars!

426
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:49,286
[groaning]

427
00:20:58,152 --> 00:20:59,586
I'll see ya.

428
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:00,686
You take care.

429
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:02,019
See you around, kid.

430
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,352
Yeah.

431
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:05,986
And maybe one day I'll meet
a girl just like you, Akane.

432
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,586
Huh?

433
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,686
Uh-- never mind.

434
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:11,152
Well, gotta go.

435
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:12,652
Bye.

436
00:21:12,752 --> 00:21:14,319
See ya.

437
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:14,860
Adios.

438
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,186
Take care.

439
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:20,727
Goodbye!

440
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:29,819
Huh?

441
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,419
Where's that blasted mailbox!

442
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:42,386
[music playing]

443
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:04,186
[singing in japanese]

444
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,001
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I guess
it's my fault for buying

445
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:19,701
a notebook at the
secondary school store,

446
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:22,434
but I never expected
this to happen.

447
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,668
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
A Teenage Ghost Story.

448
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:27,801
We'll see you there.
