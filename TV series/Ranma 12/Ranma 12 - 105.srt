Let's go have lunch.

looks like it's gone.

00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:48,721
I guess he just eats super fast.

From hors d'oeuvres to dessert.

00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:20,487
First one finished
is the winner.

-What he means, then,
is speed eating.

-Hey, when it comes
to speed anything,

00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:35,021
I'm about as fast as they get.

Oh, man.

00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:45,254
Are we sure he's even eating?

fast, too, you know?

His hands are, anyway.

Monsieur, you are defeated.

69
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,221
I suppose you would
like to know the secret?

70
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:17,354
It is to make the
mouth like this.

71

For now, au revoir.

But do not wait too long.

your father can tell you,

money, but please,

back then that I'd

106

father three daughters?

volunteer for bridal training

at Chateau Chardin.

112

were four girls living here.

Send me!

115

I've already fought
the guy, remember?

It's a noble thing you
do sparing my daughters.

-Hm.

123

Hey, no prob.

124
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,421
I figure it'll take three days
to learn this battle dining

But then, I'm going to

Ranma here reporting for
bridal duty as you requested.

132
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,321
Shall we begin?

133
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,921
-Tres bien!

134
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:06,121
Welcome, mademoiselle,
to my humble abode!

135
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:16,121
Indeed, mademoiselle.

136
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:19,287
It would seem that
you are very shy.

137
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:22,121
-Oh, well, you now.

138
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:24,754
PICOLET: Care for a [inaudible]?

139
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,221
-Oh, [french].

140
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:28,454
Don't mind if I do--

00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:31,154

-What the--

144
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,587
-Zut!

145
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:40,854
Tell me, mademoiselle
Were you reared in a barn?

146
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:44,687
-Mademoiselle Ranma, may I
introduce Madame St. Paul.

147
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:49,654
-So are you the one who
will teach me battle dining?

148
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:53,821
First, you must
show me how you eat.

149
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:54,387
Alore!

150
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:57,187
Non, non, non.

151
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,154
-Ranma!

152
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:01,121
-It is part of the training.

153
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,854
-I wasn't that bad, was I?

154
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,221
What did I do?

155
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:05,921
Tell me.

156
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,287
-Indeed, mademoiselle.

157
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:10,421
There is a trick to eat.

158
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,654
-He ate it.

159
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,554
-And without using his hands.

160
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,654
-This time I do it
for you more slowly.

161
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:18,421
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
That's right, pal.

162
00:09:18,521 --> 00:09:19,821
Show me your secret.

163
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,721
-Un, deux, trois.

164

[speaking french]

165
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,054
-Now I've done it.

166
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:29,721
-You sure have.

167
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:30,687
-Battle dining.

168
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,954
How terrifying.

169

You're not really going
through with this are you?

RANMA: Akane, I have to.

172
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,454
I said I would.

He'll be fine.

Knowing Ranma, it shouldn't
take him more than a few days

to learn the techniques.

It's battle dining, and
they're all combatants.

-And what are you doing here?

-There's no shame in asking
for a father's help, you know?

I've come to look after you.

To learn this
battle dining thing.

292

-And I suppose the food's
got nothing to do with it.

-Certainly.

even think of such a thing.

334
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:18,987
Come back.

335
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:21,987
I still need--

336
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:24,221
-Too slow!

337
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,321
[sigh]

338
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:28,387
-OK.

339
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:30,687
Why is this battle dining
stuff so tough for me?

340
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:32,954
I'm usually really
good at this stuff.

341
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,154
It is not!

342
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:40,254
There's more to it than that.

343
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:43,487
Battle dining is--
whoa, that's it.

344
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:45,687
I've been so busy trying
to eat that I forgot

345
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:47,587
the most important thing of all.

346
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,487
It's still just
another martial art.

347
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:53,121
And what's martial
arts but attack?

348
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,521
-And that's why
you're been losing!

349
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:56,454
-Gah!

350
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:58,187
What are you doing
in that outfit?

351
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,921
-I work here, but that's
not important now.

352
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:02,587
This is what's important.

353
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:05,254
-Hm, who's who in battle dining

354
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:07,021
SOUN: Here, I
bookmarked the page.

355
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:10,187
In 400 years of
battle dining history,

356
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,287
there was once a small
group of radicals

357
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:14,154
known as La Petite Bouche.

358
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:16,387
As the name implies, their
mouth was very small.

359
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,421
But that didn't stop them.

360
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:21,354
Instead, they developed
a special technique--

361
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:24,287
the terrifying
Parle du foie gras.

362
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:26,121
-Parle du foie-- what?

363
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:28,021
Where is this
terrifying technique?

364
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:28,562
Hey--

365
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:29,621
-Exactly.

366
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:31,754
Someone's torn out
the pages we need.

367
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:33,354
-Oh, man.

368
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:34,854
-Unfortunately.

369
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:37,254
-Ugh.

370
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:42,287
So, Monsieur Picolet,
would you do me a favor?

371
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,687
-But of course,
Mademoiselle Ranma.

372
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:48,121
-Have you ever heard of
the Parle du foie gras.

373
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:51,221
-Foie-- foie-- foie-- gras?

374
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:52,321
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Please.

375
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:54,554
He does know it then,
but why would he

376
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:57,154
make such a big deal about it?

377
00:18:57,254 --> 00:18:59,354
-I've never heard
of it in my life.

378
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:00,987
-You're such a liar!

379
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:05,687
I mean, you wouldn't
lie, would you, monsieur?

380
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:09,187
-Pardonne moi,
Mademoiselle Ranma.

381
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:11,787
But would this mouth lie to you?

382
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:15,287
-I would like to go
home now, please.

383
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,421
-Mademoiselle, wait!

384
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,687
Do not go, I beg you.

385
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:23,987
Since it means so much to you,
I will tell you the secret.

386
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:27,354
As you may have guessed,
it involves foie gras,

387
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:30,021
that most famous jewel
of French cuisine.

388
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:34,554
It is made from the liver
of the fattened goose.

389
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:37,321
Indeed, it is prized
all over the world.

390
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:43,154
[speaking french], such as I.

391
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:43,687
-And then?

392
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:44,754
And then?

393
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:46,187
-And that is it.

394
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:53,054
If he's hiding some kind of
secret, I sure can't see it.

395
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,154
-I just know there's
more to it than that.

396
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:58,887
Maybe if I just taste
it, I'll figure it out.

397
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:05,421
-My entire mouth is
embraced with the taste

398
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:08,321
of this rich, velvety goodness.

399
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,821
-The taste is all you need, but
I feel I could eat it forever.

400
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,354
-Rich taste, velvety texture.

401
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:19,454
You take a bite, you want more.

402
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:20,121
Hm.

403
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:21,787
Where's the secret?

404
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,254
MADAME ST. PAUL: What--
what did you say?

405
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:28,121
The mademoiselle asked
about Parle du foie gras?

406
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:28,987
[screaming]

407
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:30,587
-Madame St. Paul!

408
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,421
Calm yourself!

409
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,587
MADAME ST. PAUL (VOICEOVER):
The Parle du foie gras?

410
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,587
The most devastating technique
in the battle dining arsenal?

411
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:42,587
How can this mere girl
have heard of this?

412
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:44,954
-Monsieur Picolet,
it seems apparent we

413
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:48,121
have no time to waste.

414
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:49,421
-I agree, Madame.

415
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:51,721
-We must stop her.

416
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:53,521
-There's but one thing.

417
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,587
-Saotome, you give
that back! [inaudible].

418
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:01,087
I'm not eating it
because I want to.

419
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:02,987
I'm doing it for Ranma!

420
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:10,021
-Just shut up.

421
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:12,654
I'm trying to think here.

422
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,421
SOUN: You ate it!

423
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:16,821
You piggy panda.

424
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:18,854
PICOLET (VOICEOVER): It
is made from the fattened

425
00:21:18,954 --> 00:21:21,354
liver of the goose.

426
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:22,321
-That's it!

427
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,287
-Ranma?

428
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:25,987
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I see it.

429
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,054
I know how to use it.

430
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,754
The only question
is-- do I dare?

431
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:47,554
[music playing]

432
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:17,983
AKANE (VOICEOVER): The
winds call the clouds.

433
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,783
The cloud calls the storm.

434
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,416
Battle dining's
ultimate technique's

435
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:22,949
about to be revealed?

436
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,316
What is the Parle du foie gras?

437
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,183
Next time on "Ranma
1/2," Dinner at Ringside.

438
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,316
We'll see you there!
