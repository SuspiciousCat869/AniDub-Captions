AKANE (VOICEOVER): "A Tear
in a Girl Delinquent's Eye?

3
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,863
The End of the Martial Arts
Rhythmic Gymnastics Challenge."

4
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:13,742
-Ryoga, behave yourself or
you're going to be sorry.

5
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,990
-Now the fight you've all been
waiting for-- St. Hebereke

6
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:27,557
versus Furinkan
High in an anything

7
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,457
goes fight to the finish.

8
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:36,524
The only legal attacks
are through tools.

9
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,190
Bare hands are
strictly forbidden.

10
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,424
There's no time limit.

11
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:41,524
And if you're knocked out
or fall outside the ring,

12
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:43,957
you automatically lose.

13
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,257
-I don't like beating up girls.

14
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,390
You get out now and
I won't stop you.

15
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,490
Go on, leave while you're
still in one piece.

16
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:53,857
-How very kind of you
to worry about me.

17
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,624
-What an incredible athlete.

18
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:06,190
Kodachi Kuno wields the ribbon
as though it were a steel bar.

19
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:19,490
Oh, wait a minute,
it is a steel bar.

20
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,724
-Referee, that's a foul.

21
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:23,957
-Sorry, the tools
she has are legal.

22
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,290
-Nice technique, dear.

23
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:39,624
-Hey, referee, she's got
spikes on that thing.

24
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:40,390
That's a foul

25
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:41,390
-Sorry.

26
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:42,957
She's using legal tools.

27
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,557
KUNO (VOICEOVER):
Concealing the spikes

28
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,590
by means of a hidden switch.

29
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:48,024
Oh, my sister.

30
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:50,557
I admire your spirit.

31
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,957
-Make no mistake.

32
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,124
I fight you only for my
darling Ranma, for that alone.

33
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:58,724
Oh, my love.

34
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:02,157
For you, I would
dare all, risk all.

35
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,490
In the fields of passion, the
black rose of my heart blooms

36
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:06,390
for you.

37
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:07,757
I, Kodachi Kuno--

38
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:14,457
-When I want a date
with you, I'll tell you!

39
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,424
-All right.

40
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,690
ANNOUNCER: What a
clever way to use a pig.

41
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:23,190
How lucky for the challenger
that pigs are legal.

42
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:26,857
-And who said anything
about a date with you?

43
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,024
The one I long to date with
is my darling Ranma Saotome.

44
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:30,957
-OK, whatever.

45
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,290
But if lose, you'll
promise never

46
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:36,357
to bother your darling
Ranma ever again.

47
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,324
-And what is my darling
Ranma to you anyway?

48
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:41,724
RANMA: Are you going
to promise or not?

49
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:49,824
-Oh, I see.

50
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:50,990
-What?

51
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,124
-You love him.

52
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:52,890
That's it.

53
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:55,124
It's so obvious.

54
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:55,857
-What?

55
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,257
-That's it, isn't it?

56
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,324
That's why you're
interfering with me.

57
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:01,424
You wicked, wicked girl.

58
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:07,524
Take this, and this, and
this, and this, and this--

59
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,424
-Pigtailed girl.

60
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:08,924
-Oh.

61
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,024
Brother dear.

62
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:17,724
-Pigtailed girl, is it true
that you love Ranma Saotome?

63
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:19,724
-Love Ranma?

64
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:22,657
-Well, do you?

65
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,890
-Love him or not, Ranma and I
are of one mind and one body.

66
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:28,257
[gasp]

67
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,490
-One mind?

68
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:31,124
-One-- one body?

69
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,357
One mind and one body?!

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,424
-It just sort of happened, OK?

71
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:40,724
I-- it's like fate.

72
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,857
-You and Ranma fated
to be together?!

73
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,890
-My darling, it can't be.

74
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:48,857
-Hoop.

75
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,824
-Here, Captain.

76
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:55,224
-Hey.

77
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:56,457
ANNOUNCER: And there it is.

78
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,624
Kodachi's trademark razor hoop.

79
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:02,457
-Sorry, the tools
she has are legal.

80
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,757
-All right, I know.

81
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,824
-Impudent woman dares
take my beloved's name.

82
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:09,890
For that, the Black Rose
will bring you to justice.

83
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:15,757
-Ranma.

84
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,524
-If you won't listen
to reason, I'm

85
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,457
going to have to beat
some sense into you.

86
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:25,457
-She's incredible.

87
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,490
-It's amazing.

88
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:28,757
She uses the clubs
just like nunchakus.

89
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,457
-Hm.

90
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,524
How utterly ridiculous.

91
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,990
I am the rising star of
high school martial arts

92
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:36,657
rhythmic gymnastics.

93
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,657
The beautiful young
flower of St. Hebereke.

94
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,157
The one called the Black Rose.

95
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:54,590
Watch then, the dreaded
attack of 1,000 clubs!

96
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:56,124
-She's pretty good too.

97
00:06:56,157 --> 00:07:00,624
-She uses that one club like
she's got 10 or 20 of them.

98
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:01,124
-Ranma!

99
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,357
-Wow, look at that.

100
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,657
She really did have
10 or 20 of them.

101
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,190
-Wow, a cheat like that
is practically fair.

102
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:21,424
ANNOUNCER: Kodachi's attack of
1,000 clubs is a complete bust.

103
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,290
The two combatants
are sizing each other

104
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:24,957
up in the center of the ring.

105
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,690
What feats of skill
with they show us next?

106
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,824
-My dear, you must be patient.

107
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,290
I have so many plans
for the two of us.

108
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:49,924
ANNOUNCER: Champion Kuno
brings a bell into play.

109
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:53,424
Challenger Ranma Saotome
blocks with a pig.

110
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:57,290
The pig seems to be angry,
but that's to be expected.

111
00:07:57,324 --> 00:07:59,057
-Hey, what do you want me to do?

112
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,990
-An opening.

113
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:08,757
-I can play that too.

114
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,724
-Oh, no.

115
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:16,190
Challenger Saotome has
commandeered a desk.

116
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:19,524
Oh, Champion Kuno
counters with her brother.

117
00:08:54,757 --> 00:08:56,257
ANNOUNCER: Ladies
and gentlemen, this

118
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,190
is the battle of the century.

119
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,724
We just saw Challenger
Saotome attack Champion Kuno

120
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:03,690
with a desk, which she
countered with her own brother.

121
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:06,790
Isn't it lucky that brothers
are legal in this match?

122
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:09,390
Oh, look at the champion attack
the challenger with her brother

123
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,890
over and over again.

124
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,724
The challenger launches
a desperate defense.

125
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,024
Will it be enough?

126
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:16,757
Oh, the challenger
scores a pig kick.

127
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,657
Look at the champion's
brother flee the ring.

128
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,190
Has he gone mad?

129
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,490
Wait a minute, they're carrying
him out on a stretcher.

130
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:23,457
Listen to those cheers.

131
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,190
The crowd goes wild.

132
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:27,557
What a rare treat this is.

133
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,924
Until now, every one of
the champion's opponents

134
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:33,990
have had to forfeit the
match due to sudden illness.

135
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:37,557
Oh, the champion is throwing
balls with bombs inside.

136
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,757
Isn't she clever?

137
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,357
Look how quickly the
challenger evades the blast.

138
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,190
Who will win this battle now?

139
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:45,390
Will it be the challenger
or the champion?

140
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:47,790
Your guess is as good as mine.

141
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:55,690
Champion Kuno lobs
another ball bomb.

142
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,157
Challenger Saotome
flees to her corner.

143
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,957
-Well, you've given me
quite a little workout.

144
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,790
But from here on m
the real fight begins.

145
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:19,557
-The challenger nimbly
evades the champion's ribbon.

146
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,557
The two seem well-matched.

147
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,557
Oh, they've brought
out the clubs.

148
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,524
Now look at them go,
ladies and gentlemen.

149
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:37,090
OK, we're back.

150
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:39,524
The ribbons seem to
have become tangled.

151
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,024
Both combatants are deadlocked.

152
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:04,357
-What a pest.

153
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,757
She's like a cockroach
wearing a leotard.

154
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,790
But I know a remedy for roaches.

155
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,790
CROWD: Oh.

156
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:21,957
-Very well,
cockroach girl, let's

157
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,424
see how you like the attack
of the boiling water.

158
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,024
ANNOUNCER: Always ready
with a new challenge,

159
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:34,457
Champion Kuno brings a kettle
of boiling water into play.

160
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,490
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma.

00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:43,890
sends Challenger
Saotome into a panic.

163
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:46,324
It does look hot.

164
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,624
-Oh my goodness.

165
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,890
You and that pig
don't like water, eh?

166
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,557
RANMA (VOICEOVER): If I change
back into a boy in this getup,

167
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,824
the reputation of the
Saotome School of Anything

168
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:04,890
Goes Martial Arts is
practically done for.

169
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,290
[maniacal laughter]

170
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,933
ANNOUNCER: Challenger Saotome
is backed into a corner.

171
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:23,700
Does this mean victory
for Champion Kuno?

172
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,100
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Uh oh.

173
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:36,633
-No, no, no way I'm going
to let you get that on me.

174
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,133
-Watch.

175
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:42,100
-Ah!

176
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,400
Ah!

177
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:44,601
ANNOUNCER: Champion Kuno's
attack of the boiling water

178
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,568
scores a direct hit.

179
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,534
-I-- it's not fair.

180
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,701
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I'm doomed.

181
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,134
-What a surprise.

182
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:04,568
Challenger Saotome's
corner has just

183
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,634
turned the hose on
her and the pig.

184
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:08,301
That water's got to be cold.

185
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,501
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I'm saved.

186
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:15,201
ANNOUNCER: Challenger Saotome
is almost out of the ring.

187
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:17,701
If she touches down
anywhere now, it's over.

188
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:18,701
She's finished.

189
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:30,168
Oh, Challenger
Saotome is swimming

190
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:32,168
upstream to the
center of the ring.

191
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,134
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
what tenacity she has.

192
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,134
-Saved by one's second.

193
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:39,134
That's cheating, not tenacity.

194
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,101
You're making a mockery
of all true athletes.

195
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:53,101
ANNOUNCER: What an upset.

196
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:55,634
Challenger Saotome comes
back from the brink of defeat

197
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,768
by swimming against
the stream of water

198
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,301
turned on her by her second.

199
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:01,634
-Hmph.

200
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:05,734
-You there, don't you think
you're taking this too far?

201
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:08,901
Do you really want my
darling Ranma that bad?

202
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:12,401
-Hey, you don't own
your darling Ranma.

203
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,068
-Silence, you!

204
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:16,134
No more excuses.

205
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:16,868
-Boo.

206
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,401
-Oh, you scared me.

207
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:20,501
Why'd you have to be so mean?

208
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,668
Hey, give me some of
that popcorn, will you?

209
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:26,634
-Junko, I've- I've got this
favor I really want to ask you.

210
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:27,501
-Would I what?

211
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,168
-You know about Hiroshi?

212
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,501
I was hoping maybe you
could talk to him for me.

213
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:33,834
Could you tell him that
I'm sorry and everything?

214
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:36,034
I heard from Sachiko
that you guys are really

215
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:37,401
good friends and stuff.

216
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,501
-So that's what you wanted
to talk to me about.

217
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:40,968
Hey, is there any juice left?

218
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:41,868
Thank you.

219
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:42,934
-You mean you won't do it?

220
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,301
-You're the one who
wouldn't go out with him.

221
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:50,001
He's really sad
about it, you know.

222
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,301
-Yeah, I know.

223
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,901
But I've been thinking
about it all this time,

224
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,234
and he is really cute and all.

225
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,601
-You're such a flirt.

226
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,301
You think they're all cute.

227
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:02,101
You're always
chasing after guys.

228
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,434
-Hey, you guys, come
take a look at this.

229
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:07,168
Doesn't she look exactly
like Professor Matsushida?

230
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,501
-Hey, let me see.

231
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,568
-Oh my god, you're right.

232
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:11,834
It's her.

233
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,468
-Hey, you guys, don't you
think that today's match is

234
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:15,668
taking awfully long?

235
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:16,734
-Yeah, you're right.

236
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:19,201
-Do you think the
match is over already?

237
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,401
Yuko, what do you think?

238
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:22,334
-Doom.

239
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:23,968
Run, mortals, flee
while you can.

240
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:25,201
Captain Kuno always wins.

241
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:26,468
GIRL: C-- cut it out.

242
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:27,468
You're scaring me.

243
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,934
-What an incredible
show this is.

244
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,434
It's been a long match for these
two, and it's not over yet.

245
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:42,934
Will Challenger Saotome
triumph at last?

246
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:45,334
Or will victory go to
the undefeated champion,

247
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:47,801
Kodachi-- the Black Rose-- Kuno?

248
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,234
-How'd you like that?

249
00:15:56,268 --> 00:16:00,201
Why don't you go play outside?

250
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,101
-Oh, the challenger has
thrown Champion Kuno right out

251
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:03,901
of the ring.

252
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:06,034
Do we have a winner at last?

253
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:07,734
[whistle]

254
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:15,668
-The ring, it-- it moved.

255
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:16,968
-Foolish girl.

256
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,701
Don't you realize I can't
be knocked outside the ring?

257
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:25,034
[whistle]

258
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,301
ANNOUNCER: Oh, a mere whistle
and the ring literally moved.

259
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:40,034
[screaming]

260
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:45,401
ANNOUNCER: Oh, are those
gymnasts under there?

261
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,668
It was people power
that moved that ring.

262
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:51,468
The entire St. Hebereke School
for girls' rhythmic gymnastics

263
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:52,401
team scatters.

264
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:54,134
And the mat is completely gone.

265
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,168
All that remains are the ropes
and poles at the corners.

266
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:00,268
Remember, in keeping with the
rules of Martial Arts Rhythmic

267
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:04,101
Gymnastics, the first to lose
their footing is the loser.

268
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:08,168
It's all come down to a test of
balance, ladies and gentlemen.

269
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,834
What an incredible
match this has been.

270
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:20,934
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Mid-air combat

271
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:24,501
is a specialty of the Saotome
School of Anything Goes Martial

272
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:25,068
Arts.

273
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:28,734
Victory is mine.

274
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:32,668
-Ryoga, you little jerk.

275
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:33,734
Jeez, Ryoga.

276
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:37,734
What the heck you'd
go and do that for?

277
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:39,001
Shut up!

278
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,768
You try that again and I'm
going to have to hurt you.

279
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,568
-Arguing with a pig.

280
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:45,068
Razor hoop!

281
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:53,968
ANNOUNCER: Oh,
Challenger Saotome

282
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,968
has been swept into the air.

283
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:04,334
-Get ready.

284
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:05,834
I'm going to kick you out.

285
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:14,068
-No attacking without
the tool, remember?

286
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,968
-The challenger uses the
rebound off the ropes

287
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:18,034
to launch herself
at the champion.

288
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:19,034
-Can't you hear?

289
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,301
It's a foul to
attack without tools.

290
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,768
-If it's tool you
want, watch this.

291
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,934
ANNOUNCER: Champion Kuno has
been knocked out of the ring.

292
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:49,134
In accordance with the rules
of Martial Arts Rhythmic

293
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:52,001
Gymnastics, we have a winner.

294
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:54,468
Champion Kodachi--
the Black Rose-- Kuno

295
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,468
has been defeated by
Challenger Ranma Saotome.

296
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:06,334
-Ranma Saotome.

297
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:07,334
-I'm beat.

298
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,234
-You there, pigtailed one.

299
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:16,768
I, the beautiful young flower
of St. Hebereke, the rising

300
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,734
star of the Martial Arts
Rhythmic Gymnastics world,

301
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:25,368
Kodachi-- the Black Rose--
Kuno have been defeated.

302
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:28,368
As promised, I shall
forever after abandon

303
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,701
my present affection
for my darling Ranma.

304
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:37,434
[crying]

305
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:37,901
-Kodachi.

306
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:54,734
I could've won that thing easy
if you had kept out of it.

307
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:56,068
-Just shut up.

308
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:59,401
It was my one chance to break
you and Akane up forever.

309
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:02,001
AKANE: P-Chan, come here, baby.

310
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,368
It's time to go beddy bye.

311
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:09,334
-Got to go.

312
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:10,734
-Wait a minute.

313
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:12,768
You don't think you're going to
sneak into Akane's bed again.

314
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:19,201
[pig squealing]

315
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,934
RANMA: Come here,
you little runt.

316
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:23,101
You've got a lot of nerve
thinking you can just--

317
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:29,334
-Ranma.

318
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:32,301
-I, uh, ah, well, I, uh--

319
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:33,434
AKANE: You're unbelievable.

320
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:43,668
-Aw, man.

321
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,901
That's just great.

322
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:47,001
She's mad again.

323
00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:48,501
KUNO: Saotome.

324
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:50,501
-Huh?

325
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:51,534
Kuno?

326
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:53,101
Now what do you want?

327
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,034
-Deliver those to the
pigtailed girl, will you?

328
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,601
You do know that some day,
I shall take her from you

329
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,234
by force, Ranma Saotome.

330
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:02,401
Prepare for that day.

331
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:03,101
-Wait a minute.

332
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,101
Come back here.

333
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:13,634
Gee, that darn Kuno sure
gives me the creeps sometimes.

334
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:15,401
KODACHI: You there,
pigtailed one.

335
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,134
-Kodachi?

336
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:21,168
-Please deliver those
to my darling Ranma.

337
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,134
-Hold it.

338
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:24,101
What ever happened
to you abandoning

339
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:26,068
your present affection
and all that?

340
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,068
-Yes, it's true.

341
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:30,068
I've abandoned my
present affection.

342
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:34,701
Now I burn with entirely
brand new passion for him.

343
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,268
You do realize that
someday, I shall take him

344
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:39,168
from you by force.

345
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:41,201
I bid you adieu.

346
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:44,068
[maniacal laughter]

347
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:51,734
-What was that?

348
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,568
They're sick, both of them.

349
00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:12,003
