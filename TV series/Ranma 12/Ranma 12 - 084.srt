AKANE: Ooh, dim sum.

172
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,500
How yummy?

that be, I wonder?

-Ahh, did somebody
fall in the pond?

180
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
-Better check it out.

181
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,533
Who's there?

182
00:08:58,633 --> 00:08:59,074
Whaa?

183
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,033
Huh, it's empty.

184
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,166
AKANE: Maybe the koi.

185
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:05,300
-Maybe.

186
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,333
SHAMPOO: Ranma, come eat.

187
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,300
RANMA: Yeah, OK.

[duck squawk]

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,833
SHAMPOO: Great-grandmother,
I'm home!

[bubbling noise]

191
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,100
-Shampoo, doesn't that
knife belong to Mousse?

192
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
He must have forgotten it.

193
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,533
-You think so?

194
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:43,300
Poor Mousse.

195
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,033
Why he always so stubborn.

196
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,033
-She's crying over me.

197
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:50,800
-Hiyah.

198
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,733
Stupid onion really
hurt Shampoo's eyes.

199
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,233
-Don't they?

200
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,733
The fresher the vegetable,
the more stubborn they are.

What a plump little foul.

204
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,300
Poor thing.

205
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,333
You must be shy.

206
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,733
But you mustn't let
that bother you!

207
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,133
Oh, you're a
fighter, aren't you?

208
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,333
That's good.

-Here, Mr. Scaly Green.

212
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,033
Come meet your new playmate.

213
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,533

Where he go running this time?

Ranma!

Oh, man.

229
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:44,766
Now that Mousse has
gone back to China,

230
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:47,366
Shampoo won't give
me a moment of peace.

from a distant star.

-You moron!

236
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,366
I thought you went
back to China.

237

-I told you my name was Cupid.

238
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,933
I'm here to see that you make
Shampoo happy, whether you

like it or not!

Where'd this come from?

-Cupid of love, my butt.

00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,866
Oh, I'm so hungry.

247
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,333
-So, how many do you want?

248
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,200
Don't you worry,
it's on the house.

249
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,700
But you know that though, right?

250
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,033
-Sure do.

251
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,533

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,200
Why, Ranma Saotome.

256
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,633
You dirty cheat!

back, just so you could eat!

-Silence!

260
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:54,300
I am here to make sure
you stay faithful to her,

despite this bimbo.

-OK, now you've done it!

263
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,300
The only thing faithful
here is our love.

-You don't say.

265

Shows what you know.

269
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,266
Our love is fresh off the
grill six days a week.

So you want to play hard ball.

274
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:24,800
Is that it?

275
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,200
Fine, consider the
challenge accepted.

276
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,566
It's going to take more than one
little setback to break us up.

277
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:34,133
Let's see how much of
our love you can eat.

-What happened to my
order of love, huh?

00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,433
Ahh!

290
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,666
-What can I do for you, darling?

291
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:02,200
Something must have
brought you all this way.

292
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,900
Ahh, I-- yeah, uh--

[stomach rumbling]

294
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:08,466
-It's not hunger that brought
you here, is it, my darling?

295
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,133
-You-- you've going
to be kidding--

-Goodness, you are
hungry, aren't you?

299
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,700
How would little Ranma
like it if Kodachi

300
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,900
prepare him a
home-cooked meal, huh?

301
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,566
-I'm telling you,
I'm hungry, OK?

302
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:26,433
-Now, Ranma, are you sure that's
how you want to talk to me?

303
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,400
I do have those pictures
of you, after all.

304
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,107
-Ahh!

305
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,600
She's really taking her time.

306
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:40,533
-And here it is!

307
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,533
-Hey, it looks great!

308
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,400
-The first course will be-- oh!

309
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,433
-Sneaking around again?

310
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,133
-We are not!

311
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,233
-He's right.

312
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,333
Ranma and I keep no
secrets from each other.

313
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,600
-I knew it!

314
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,833
You're incapable of being
faithful, aren't you?

315
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:00,500
I can see now not to trust you!

316
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,100
Unless you start keeping
your word to Shampoo,

317
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,433
I'm not going anywhere.

318
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:05,866
Do you hear me?

319
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:09,666
-But I never promised
nothing to nobody, you jerk!

320
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:11,566
-With the exception
of me, darling.

321
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,533
But that's a special case.

322
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,466
Otherwise, yes, you're free.

323
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,333
-Yes, is he?

324
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:17,966
Give me that!

325
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,733
-Oh!

326
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,266
Oh, now you've done it!

327
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:25,366
If you think you're getting
away with that, you-- you!

328
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:28,866
Yow!

329

-You little cowards.

331
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,833
How dare you run away!

332
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,933
Stay still and take
your punishment!

333
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,166
-Missed me!

334
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:38,833
Hey, cut it out!

335
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:41,300
-Ha!

336
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,633
Some man you are!

337
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,966
-Like some girl could ever
beat me, a master of hi--
