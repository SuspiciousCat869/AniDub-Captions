you're filling in

for our gymnastics team?

do you bear against me?

-Aw man, Kuno.

-Ranma, darling, did you hear?

45
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,243
This means we're
officially a couple.

Not so fast.

Going out with you is
the last thing I want.

Get it?

Hm?

-You hate me, then.

52
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:34,409
Is that it?

53
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:34,943
-No, no.

I just-- I.

-You do hate me I can tell.

56

Don't lie to save my feelings.

that's not it.

Winner of the tournament
gets to take Ranma Saotome.

-What did you say?

71
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,209
That's crazy.

00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:16,743
-But Akane, it's perfect.

You need but lose and
you're rid of him forever.

-No need for that dear.

75
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:27,076
The beating that
I plan to give you

76
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,309
will be more than sufficient.

77
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:38,176
Ranma my darling, when the match
is over you'll be all mine.

Until then, ado.

you to look after my sister.

Wait a minute here.

Your what?

-My sister.

weakness, which I think

proceeds from wayward sickness
and no grounded mouth.

90

I love her well.

Yes.

Be wary of her at
the tournament Akane.

Already a vision of you in your
leotard drives me to madness.

Some innocence escape
not the thunderbolt.

That's what the
ancients used to say.

My sister is not the type
to give up on something

97
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,009
once she's set her sights on it.

Why doesn't that surprise me?

going to lose to her.

her now Akane, right?

the match is tomorrow.

I'm going to lose.

-I wonder where Ryoga's
been for the last few days.

That would mean
Hiroshima and Kyoto.

Where were you trying
to go there P-chan?

-There you go.

138
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:41,309
All done.

139
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:51,376
-Akane, you are such a klutz.

140

-You'll have to drop
out of tomorrow's match.

I've got to.

I can't let her beat me.

Ah.

-See?

149
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:09,243
You'll have to
find a substitute.

150
00:09:09,276 --> 00:09:12,309
-Well it's not that simple.

151
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,743
Where are we going
to find someone

152
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:16,876
who's good at martial arts,
knows gymnastics, and looks

153
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:17,976
good in a leotard?

154
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,909
And on such short notice too.

155
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:23,276
Huh?

156
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,076
Oh.

-Huh?

00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,209
What are you looking at me for?

159
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:34,276
Hey cut that out,
that's not funny.

160
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,543
You ain't getting me in
to no stupid leotard.

161
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,676
No way!

-Ryoga.

163

-Looks like it's going
to be an all-nighter.

164
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:47,609
Huh, Ranma?

165
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,143
-The thing about Martial
Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics

166
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:57,676
is that hand to hand
attacks are forbidden.

167
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,143
The match is in
less than 24 hours.

168
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:03,009
You need to practice as though
your life depends on it.

169
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:04,709
Are you ready, Ranma?

00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,409
-I'm ready whenever you are.

171
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:07,243
-Come on, then.

172
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:12,909
Let me show you a thing or-- Ah!

173
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:14,809
-Ah!

174
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:16,543
That was too easy.

175
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:18,143
Whoa!

176
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,976
-Use the tools you idiot.

177
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,976
Are you some kind of animal?

178
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:22,676
-Hm.

179
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,709
At least I'm not a pig.

180
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:27,976
-What did you say?

181
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,809
-What a waste of time.

182
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:32,511
OK.

183
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:33,011
Let's go.

184
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:37,644
-La oh la.

185
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:02,388
-Hiya!

186
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,597
-Ah!

187
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,097
-Ya!

188
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:16,730
-Wow.

189
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:19,030
Ranma you're really good.

190
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:21,930
-Hey, I haven't been watching
you a week for nothing,

191
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:22,864
you know.

192
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:26,397
-You don't even
need to practice.

193
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,897
-Maybe a little more.

194
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,564
Akane, you go to bed.

195
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:31,464
-I can't do that.

196
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:33,764
-Hey, I think you're
worried about me.

197
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:34,464
Is that it?

198
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:37,564
-Of course not Ranma.

199
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:38,564
-Please go to bed.

200
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:39,330
We're fine.

201
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,197
We'll be OK by ourselves.

202
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,964
-You sure?

203
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:44,297
-We'll be just fine.

204
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,064
-I'm sure Ranma will
be just fine tomorrow.

205
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:08,664
-Hey I was there, you know.

206
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:11,097
I heard you promise that if
you lost the match tomorrow,

207
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,164
you'd go out with Kodachi.

208
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,664
Which means that it's over
between you and Akane.

209
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:22,064
Isn't that right?

210
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:25,097
I came here to make
sure that you lose.

211
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,464
-Huh.

212
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:29,397
I knew your sudden change of
heart was too good to be true.

213
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,997
You're wrong about
one thing, though.

214
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,497
I've got absolutely no intention
of going out with Kodachi.

215
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,364
-You don't have any
choice in the matter.

216
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:37,997
I'm going to make sure you lose.

217
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,130
I'll do whatever it takes.

218
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:43,230
I'll kill you if I have to.

219
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,230
-Go ahead and try it you jerk!

220
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,064
[crashing]

221
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:50,497
[dog barking]

222
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:11,597
Ranma: Why you--

223
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,497
-Hm?

224
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,497
-Take that!

225
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,664
Ranma: Come here I said!

226
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:17,164
-They didn't.

227
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:20,497
[fighting]

228
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:26,364
-There!

229
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:27,297
Take that.

230
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:27,864
-Ah!

231
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:29,064
-Do you give up?

232
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:30,064
Or don't you?

233
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:39,897
-Ah!

234
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,964
I can't believe you two
were fighting all night?

235
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:42,664
-Huh?

236
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:43,530
It's morning already?

237
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,397
-But the match is today.

238
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,064
-It's OK.

239
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:47,564
It's OK.

240
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:48,164
It's OK.

241
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,897
This cake's awfully
tough, Kasumi.

242
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,730
-That's a dish rag.

243
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:58,964
AKANE (VOICEOVER): That's it!

244
00:14:58,997 --> 00:14:59,497
We're doomed.

245
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:13,297
-Don't forget, girls.

246
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,997
The martial arts rhythmic
gymnastics tournament against

247
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,764
the visiting team from Furinkan
high will take place this

248
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:20,897
afternoon at 1:00PM in
the second gymnasium.

249
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:27,664
-A last minute substitute?

250
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,630
-I hurt myself
practicing last night,

251
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:32,564
so she's going to
fill in for me.

252
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,097
-I know you.

253
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,230
Yes, you're that pigtailed
girl from the other day.

254
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:40,430
I do hope you'll be fighting
fair today, won't you?

255
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:42,430
-Wait just a minute.

256
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:45,564
What do you call this?

257
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:46,697
-Good heavens.

258
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,664
How ever did those tacks
get between my fingers?

259
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:54,530
-Is this really St.
Hebereke's School for Girls?

260
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:55,464
-Uh-huh.

261
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,730
-You're absolutely
sure about that?

262
00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:58,230
-Yes.

263
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,364
-I made it here safely.

264
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:07,197
Here I am with the world's
worst sense of direction

265
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,664
and yet I made it straight
here without getting lost once.

266
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:14,764
It's the power of love, Akane.

267
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:16,297
Oh, Ranma!

268
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,564
One way or the other, I'm going
to make sure that you lose.

269
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:21,330
-I don't believe that girl!

270
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:23,330
You can't take your eye
off of her for a minute!

271
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:26,630
Huh?

272
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:27,597
-Hello.

273
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,530
-Mr. Saotome.

274
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:30,230
-Hey Pop.

275
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:31,497
You made it.

276
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,097
-Look at this.

277
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,997
Black roses.

278
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,930
Huh?

279
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,197
[coughing]

280
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:52,797
-Sleeping gas.

281
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,497
-Sure woke me up.

282
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:02,197
-Well that's strange, I should
have reached the gym by now.

283
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,530
-Be careful, somebody
could be down there.

284
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:07,664
-It's just a pit,
there's no harm done.

285
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:08,330
[squealing]

286
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:10,064
-Oh, a little piggy.

287
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:14,130
-Look, it's so cute.

288
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:17,530
-Hello Kodachi.

289
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:20,906
-Oh I know just
what to do with you.

290
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,931
-Good afternoon everyone and
welcome to the St. Hebereke

291
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:35,098
versus Furinkan High Martial Art
Rhythmic Gymnastics Tournament!

292
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:38,531
[cheering]

293
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:51,631
-Ladies and Gentlemen, if we
may have you attention, please.

294
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:55,831
The rhythmic gymnastics match
will begin at any moment.

295
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,965
-And the contestants are ready.

296
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:06,365
-Wha-?

297
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:08,298
What the what?

298
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:13,131
-The Furinkan High challenger
is entering the ring.

299
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:13,631
-Hiya!

300
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,165
-It's the pigtailed girl.

301
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:25,365
-She's certainly
showing a lot of spirit.

302
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:28,465
Will she be this confident
once the fight begins?

303
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:29,865
Only time will tell.

304
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,165
And here comes the champion.

305
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:50,498
-Watch out!

306
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:50,998
-Ah!

307
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:57,931
-Oh my goodness.

308
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:00,498
However did that
bomb get in there?

309
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:03,998
I do hope you're all right.

310
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,231
-Why you little!

311
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:08,665
-As usual Kodachi makes
a dramatic entrance.

312
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:12,165
And isn't her
outfit just lovely?

313
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,231
KODACHI (VOICEOVER): There's
no real contest here.

314
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:18,365
Once I've defeated the little
hussy, Ranma will be all mine.

315
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:20,931
I shall wed you in
this very dress.

316
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:23,998
Oh yes, my love, yes
I dare it all for you.

317
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:31,831
-If Kodachi wins then Ranma
Saotome becomes my stepbrother.

318
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:35,365
Which means that Akane
and the pigtailed girl

319
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,265
shall both be mine by default.

320
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:38,398
Smite her, my sister.

321
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:41,798
For the first time in
my life I cheer for you!

322
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:43,198
-Why brother dear.

323
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,365
-Did you hear?

324
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:45,131
Her brother.

325
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:46,131
-I'm in love.

326
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:47,131
-Hear that?

327
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,665
-In this m ignorance is bliss.

328
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:51,998
-And here they are,
ladies and gentlemen.

329
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:55,765
In the red corner from St.
Hebereke's School for Girls,

330
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,665
Kodachi Kuno.

331
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,831
[cheering]

332
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:09,265
In this corner uh, hm.

333
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:10,565
Excuse me, miss.

334
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:11,931
What did you say your name was?

335
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:12,898
-Ranma Saotome.

336
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:13,931
-Hey.

337
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:16,098
Should you use your
real name in this?

338
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:21,598
From Furinkan High
School, Ranma Saotome.

339
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,231
-Ranma Saotome?

340
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,098
-Ra-- Ranma Saotome?

341
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,198
-Did she just say Ranma?

342
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,131
-Ranma?

343
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,065
-Yeah!

344
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,065
Yeah!

345
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:35,598
-That brazen hussy
is Ranma Saotome?

346
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:38,465
The same name as my beloved?

347
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:41,331
How is that the same
name, given to a girl,

348
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,231
can be so utterly disgusting?

349
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:43,931
-Ah!

350
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:44,831
At last!

351
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,431
The pigtailed one has a name.

352
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:51,798
I must prepare the ink
quickly, lest I forget.

353
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:55,631
[gasp]

354
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:57,765
-It's funny but she does
kind of look like him.

355
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,431
-Who knows?

356
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,098
Maybe they're twins.

357
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:01,498
-Oh, good one!

358
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,365
Haha.

359
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:04,598
-You see Akane?

360
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,065
What did I tell you?

361
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,598
-OK girls, to the
center of the ring.

362
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:09,998
All right, shake hands.

363
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:15,065
-Ranma, look out!

364
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:15,565
-Huh?

365
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:24,531
-Oh.

366
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:25,131
-Huh?

367
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:28,498
Hey, what's this?

368
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:32,465
-How very careless of you.

369
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:33,865
-Ah.

370
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:36,331
[squealing]

371
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:36,831
Ryoga?

372
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,531
Oh, you just live to
mess me up, don't ya?

373
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:49,465
-Hehehe.

374
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:52,465
[growls]

375
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:03,865
[music playing]

376
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:13,079
[music playing]

377
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:43,200
-What do you mean so as long
as you use tools anything goes?

378
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:45,867
And Kodachi keeps using
all those dirty trucks.

379
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,667
And here's Ranma using
P-chan like a tool, too.

380
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,200
Next time on Ranma 1/2, the
tear in a girl delinquent's eye,

381
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:56,567
the end of the Martial Arts
Rhythmic Gymnastics Challenge.

382
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,100
See ya there!
