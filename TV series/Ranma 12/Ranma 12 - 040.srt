NARRATOR: Meet Ranma
Saotome of the Anything

2
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:10,074
Goes school of martial arts.

3
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:11,008
-Here we go!

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,541
-Hi yah!

5
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:14,741
NARRATOR: And here's Akane,
of the Tendo training hall.

6
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:15,741
-What are you doing?

7
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:17,074
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

8
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:18,774
to marry by their
loving parents.

9
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:20,008
-I didn't ask for this.

10
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,508
-Who asked you?

11
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,308
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

12
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,708
-What'd you do that for?

13
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,308
NARRATOR: When Ranma's
splashed with cold water,

14
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:31,708
he becomes a she.

NARRATOR 2: "Bathhouse Battle"
We're in some hot water now!

17
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:04,513
-Ranma, I believe it
is time you entered

18
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:08,380
next phase of your training
as a martial artist.

19
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:09,713
-He's right.

20
00:01:09,747 --> 00:01:11,113
Martial arts isn't
something that you do only

21
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:12,613
on the weekends or after school.

22
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:14,180
It's full time!

23
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:17,613
You've been having it way too
easy lately, Ranma, my boy.

24
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:20,947
-So quit talkin'
and start training.

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,247
-You really think you've got
it all figured out, don't you?

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,613
You may be surprised at what
your elders can teach you.

27
00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:31,013
Listen and learn, Ranma.

28
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:35,280
You may know a trick or
two, but can you do this?

29
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:37,247
RANMA: Huh!

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,147
[pulsing sound]

31
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,147
-Huh?

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,980
SOUN: Did you see that, boy?

33
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:48,180
Now that's what I call
a true martial artist.

34
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:50,047
The master did not
become the martial artist

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,247
he is today by skipping out
on his training sessions.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,413
-I think you're in need
of some reeducation, boy.

37
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:03,280
[clicking]

38
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:05,247
-I guess it must be broken.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,080
That means no more hot water.

40
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:10,380
-Hmm, I know for an old
guy, you're pretty good,

41
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,713
but I also know your weak spot!

42
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:14,747
-Hotcha!

43
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,447
Whaddaya know, it's
manna from heaven!

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,047
-Sucker.

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,647
Hiya!

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,080
-Of course, Tendo,
each martial artist

47
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:27,147
has his own way of training.

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,680
-Don't fix it if it ain't
broke, I always say.

49
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:33,880
-Ranma, I think that's enough
training for the day, boy.

50
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,313
-I need your advice, father.

51
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,147
-Huh?

52
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,480
What is it Kasumi?

53
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:48,613
-Well it seems the hot
water heater's broken.

54
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:52,313
I can get by in the kitchen,
but what about baths?

55
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:54,580
-Well, why not use
a public bath house?

56
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:56,113
-Good idea!

57
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:59,480
Who knows how long it'll be
until the repair man comes?

58
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,780
Why don't you all go together.

59
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,913
Make a little trip out of it.

60
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:03,447
-Huh?

61
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,213
What's that?

62
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:04,913
-Huh!

63
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:06,447
-Together?

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,813
Why, your father and I
used to go all the time.

65
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:12,147
Didn't we, Soun and Genma?

66
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,013
[nervous sighing]

67
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:18,713
GENMA (VOICEOVER):
Yes, we'd train

68
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:20,913
at the women's side of
the public bath house

69
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:21,947
nearly every day.

70
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:29,580

72
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,947
-So it's you!

73
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,213
-You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

74
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:34,847
-Master!

75
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,613
Please!

76
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,413
-How old are you anyways?

77
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,380
HAPPOSAI: Sorry boys, gotta go!

78
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:40,880
GENMA (VOICEOVER):
Come to think of it,

79
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,780
he'd always leave us
behind, wouldn't he?

80
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:47,213
-Ahhhh, now those were
the good old days.

81
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:51,380
A long therapeutic soak would do
me the world of good right now.

82
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:52,780
How's about it, boys?

83
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:54,413
What do you say the three
of us go hit the baths?

84
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:58,013
-I, uh, uh no, the hose in the
backyard's good enough for me.

85
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:01,547
-I'll have to pass too,
on account of my cold.

86
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,480
[nervous laughter]

87
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:05,513
-Hey, you didn't tell
me you had a cold.

88
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:07,447
-Ah, who need 'em?

89
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,913
So you coming?

90
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:09,385
-Huh?

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,780
It's been while.

92
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:19,113
Before we moved here, Pop and
I used to go all the time.

93
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:21,713
SOUN (VOICEOVER): Son, it's
very important you listen to me.

94
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:24,847
Do not let the master out
of your sight, not even

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,380
for a moment.

96
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:30,680
-Hmm, don't you think you're a
little too old for bath toys?

97
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:32,280
You trying to
embarrass me, or what?

98

-You ain't seen nothing yet.

That's the reason
I'm inviting you.

102
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,580
Honestly would not
believe your eyes

103
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:48,447
but there's one thing
you need to bring.

104

-Oh my, you're home late.

105
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:52,113
Did you have a good time, Akane.

106
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,347
AKANE: I went shopping
with friends after school,

107
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,847
and lost track of time.

No way!

00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,313
This is a public bathhouse?

you've go it bad.

bad I tell you.

but once you get to my age,

think happened?

You don't mind using the
public baths, do you?

for another week.

of what the master
is telling you.

As we were telling you before,
training isn't something

you just do part time,
it's 24 hours a day.
