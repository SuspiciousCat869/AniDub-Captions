[theme music]

2
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,190
-It's a twister!

3
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:44,890
-Hm?

4
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,431
-Huh?

5
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:48,565
-Whoa.

6
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:54,457
-Hm.

7
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:55,657
-It's Ryoga.

8
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:56,357
-Hiryu Shoten Ha.

9
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:00,624
-Looks like he learned
it all on his own.

10
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:06,724
NARRATOR: Showdown.

11
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:07,824
Can Ranma Make a Comeback?

12
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,624
-So cold-- that
energy coming at me.

13
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,324
So cold!

14
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,324
[scream]

15
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:28,090
-Must be a nightmare.

16
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,824
Poor guy.

17
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,290
Only one thing to do.

18
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,957
Rest in peace, my friend.

19
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:37,190
-How's your patient
doing in there?

20
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:37,724
-Quiet.

21
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,390
How's Ranma?

22
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,724
-I guess he's still unconscious.

23
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:48,224
-That Heaven Blast of
the Dragon trick of yours

24
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,690
is really something else.

25
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,790
-The forces of nature are
nothing to be trifled with.

26
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,924
-What's nature
got to do with it?

27
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:58,990
-Look, you are not thinking
about this in the right way.

28
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,490
The Hiryu Shoten Ha isn't magic.

29
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,457
It's the natural convection
of a battle aura's heat

30
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:07,924
mixed in with the cold of the
two martial artists' heart.

31
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,224
The resulting
dragon, or tornado,

32
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,124
is what gives the move
its incredible power.

33
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:16,657
Unless the opponent, in this
case Ryoga, is truly angry,

34
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:18,290
the dragon won't form.

35
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,624
And that's why when Ranma
landed that final punch--

36
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:22,757
-That's right.

37
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:25,990
His final punch wasn't
a punch at all, was it?

38
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,490
What he was really doing
was mixing his cold air

39
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,157
with Ryoga's hot air, thereby
forming the Hiryu Shoten Ha,

40
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:34,257
or Flying Dragon
Heavenly Ascenstion Wave.

41
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:37,357
-Which is how he managed
to complete the technique.

42
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:38,690
Very good.

43
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,190
-When you were talking about
all that body of ice stuff,

44
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,124
then you were really
training him to--

45
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,324
-Exactly.

46
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,924
I was leading up to
showing him the final blow.

47
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:47,757
But I was too late.

48
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:50,590
He figured it out on his own.

49
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,157
-I thought I was gonna die, OK?

50
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:54,824
My brain must have
been working overtime.

51
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:55,490
-Ranma!

52
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,957
-Finally awake, huh?

53
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:01,990
-Man, I gotta tell you, though,
once that big blast of heat

54
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:10,824
from Ryoga started
coming in, I-- I--

55
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,724
if I hadn't thought
I was going to die,

56
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:14,090
I couldn't have done it.

57
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,290
I probably wouldn't have
mastered the Hiryu Shoten Ha

58
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,957
at all if it hadn't
been for Ryoga.

59
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:21,324
Man, I guess this time
I really owe him one.

60
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:25,324
-In other words, you needed
the energy of my ki to do it.

61
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:27,224
Which is why you forced
yourself on Akane!

62
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:32,224
Ranma, you die!

63
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,324
-Can we go now?

64
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:38,624
-Guess we'd better.

65
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:41,790
We've still got to get that
moxie map from the master.

66
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,457
Ranma may have a new technique,
but without that pressure point

67
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:47,924
chart, he's still
weak as a baby.

68
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:49,890
-What are we all waiting
around for, then?

69
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,257
Let's hurry and get a move on.

70
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:55,057
-The sooner the better.

71
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,857
-Ranma, will you grow
up and act your age?

72
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:59,824
-We're gonna go without
you if you don't hurry.

73
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:04,190
-Wait up, will ya?

74
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,490
-You're leaving already?

75
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,457
[shouting]

76
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:15,957
-Somehow it's just not
as fun as it used to be.

77
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:21,957
Of course!

78
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:23,357
How could I have missed it?

79
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:27,090
Ever since Ranma went away, the
old pilfering's lost its punch.

80
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,790
Oh, you dear, dear child.

81
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,357
Whyfore hath thou
gone and forsaken me?

82
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,424
-Forsake this, ya
stinky little goat!

83
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:42,757
-Dear me, now I think
I'm hearing voices.

84
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:46,457
-Loud enough for ya?

85
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:47,757
-Ranma!

86
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:49,757
Oh, my boy, you're alive!

87
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:51,157
-Yeah.

88
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:53,824
Back from the dead to put you
in your grave, you old freak.

89
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:58,224
-Well then, in that case, let
me welcome you with open arms!

90
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,824
-What have you done
to my collection?

91
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,857
Now you've done it!

92
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:07,490
-I'm mad!

93
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,157
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
That's it, gramps.

94
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:12,290
Get good and mad.

95
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,524
It'll be the end of you.

96
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:20,390
-That didn't take long, did it?

97
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,690
-Look at the master.

98
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,390
-The heat of his anger is
warming the air around him.

99
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,924
-Everything's in place
for Ranma's final blow.

100
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:30,390
-Not quite yet.

101
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,390
-Look!

102
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,390
They're at the
center of the spiral.

103
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,690
-Do it now!

104
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,690
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Keep
my cool, keep my cool.

105
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,557
Now!

106
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:38,490
Hiryu Shoten Ha!

107
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:43,624
-The master!

108
00:06:43,724 --> 00:06:47,257
He's run away!

109
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:47,798
-Hey!

110
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:54,357
Hey!

111
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,524
-Get lost, will ya, kid?

112
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,657
You bother me.

113
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:58,057
-Bother you, huh?

114
00:06:58,157 --> 00:07:00,024
Why can't you just
be serious for once?

115
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:02,824
-Listen, sonny, when it comes
to peepin', I'm the most serious

116
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,857
man in Japan.

117
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,024
-Hello, nurse.

118
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,090
[screaming]

119
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,824
-I'm warning you.

120
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,790
Interfere with me
just one more time,

121
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,124
and I'm going to make you sorry.

122
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:17,224
-Well, why don't you do
something about it, then?

123
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:18,890
-I can't.

124
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,024
If I were to hurt you
in your weakened state,

125
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,757
my conscious would
never forgive me.

126
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:27,357
-Where are you--
hey, come back here!

127
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:28,190
-Yeah, right.

128
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,257
What a joke.

129
00:07:29,357 --> 00:07:30,890
Like the master's
really got a conscious.

130
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,957
-He knows more
than he's telling.

131
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:33,824
-Come on.

132
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:35,890
Fight me for real, will ya?

133
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,724
-I had my suspicions,
but now I'm sure.

134
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,657
How dare you use
the Hiryu Shoten Ha

135
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:43,724
on a poor little
old man like me.

136
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:48,824
-Ah-ha.

137
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:51,657
He knew about the Heaven
Blast of the Dragon all along.

138
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:53,024
-But-- but how?

139
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,257
-That technique is one of the
most closely guarded secrets

140
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,790
of our Amazon tribe.

141
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,090
The only way he could
know is-- ah-ha!

142
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,624
-At the time I was but a
handsome youth of a mere 18

143
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:04,165
summers.

144
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,890
Oh, Cologne!

145
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,390
You may as well get
it over with you know!

146
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,890
You've gotta say yes
to me sooner or later.

147
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,957
-Oh, Happy.

148
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,557
Why you never listen what I say?

149
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:21,490
You only learn hard way.

150
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,990
-Heya, baby!

151
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,957
Come to--

152
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:25,957
-Hiryu Shoten Ha!

153
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,890
-Course, we were
both younger then.

154
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,924
-It's not funny!

155
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:39,657
-Without my battle aura, the
Hiryu Shoten Ha is worthless.

156
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:42,057
You're not gonna get
any anger out of me.

157
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:43,457
-Yeah?

158
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,990
That's only because I've been
going about it the wrong way.

159
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:52,165
Well?

160
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:56,290
-Nice handwriting.

161
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,290
-OK, then.

162
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,590
How's about a mouthful
of firecrackers?

163
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,357
Well?

164
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,290
-Nice and spicy.

165
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,124
-Fine.

166
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,257
Be that way.

167
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:09,524
I'll just have to go and
bring out the big guns.

168
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:11,290
That's all.

169
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,257
How do like this?

170
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:15,324
-Hey!

171
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:16,757
That's my life's work
you've got there.

172
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,724
What do you intend to do?

173
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:19,690
-Gonna do this.

174
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:27,057
-No!

175
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:28,024
No, no!

176
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:33,124
Why, you--

177
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:34,157
-Keep it up, gramps.

178
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,431
Huh?

179
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:42,657
-That's OK, Ranma.

180
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:45,090
I'll just collect
myself a new batch.

181
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,490
I do feel a little sad, though.

182
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,690
-I-- I-- I've lost!

183
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:02,524
-Don't let it get to ya.

184
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,390
True, you're still
only an amateur,

185
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,590
but everyone's got to
start somewhere, right?

186
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,624
-I'm just better
than you, that's all.

187
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,157
Nothing to feel bad about.

188
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:12,057
-I can't stand it anymore!

189
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:14,624
Pick on someone your own size!

190
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:18,324
He makes me so mad sometimes.

191
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:19,924
Huh?

192
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:21,290
Uh, Ranma?

193
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,324
And here he trained
so hard, too.

194
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:29,924
-I'm starting to wonder if he'll
ever get his strength back.

195
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,524
-If burning his
precious collection

196
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:42,090
wasn't enough to
make him get mad,

197
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,857
why did I bother training so
hard, if all I was going to do

198
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:48,357
was-- that's it!

199
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:49,157
Training!

200
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,090
Of course!

201
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,490
Why didn't I think
of it earlier?

202
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,290
-You know, I'm not
looking forward to it,

203
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,224
but I guess somebody's
gotta cheer him amount.

204
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:00,424
Hey.

205
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:02,590
What's that sound?

206
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,990
-I've got it.

207
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,424
I've finally got a
plan to make him mad.

208
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:10,257
I'm going to bring out 100--
no, make that 120% of his anger,

209
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:12,257
whether he likes it or not.

210
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:13,457
-Whether he likes it or not?

211
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:15,557
Is there some way to do that?

212
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,590
Then again, he may
be on to something.

213
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:33,908
-What?

214
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:34,641
Ranma's back?

215
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:35,574
-Yeah.

216
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:36,374
Fighting a duel
with the old guy.

217
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:37,808
-Is he still weak, or what?

218
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:38,474
-Aw, man.

219
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,574
This oughta be good.

220
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:43,682
-Hey.

221
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,474
-Uh-huh?

222
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:45,474
-Give me two of those, will ya?

223
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:46,774
-Comin' right up.

224
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:47,974
-Ranma.

225
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,741
-If I win the fight,
you hand over the chart.

226
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,174
You got that?

227
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:52,941
-Yeah, yeah.

228
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,141
Heard you the first time.

229
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,674
You can come at me whenever
you feel like it it.

230
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:57,974
-Will you look at him?

231
00:11:58,074 --> 00:11:59,408
He hasn't a care in the world.

232
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:01,308
-If he doesn't hurry
up and lose his cool,

233
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:03,374
Ranma hasn't got a chance.

234
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:04,841
-Ranma said something
about raising

235
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,008
120% of his battle aura.

236
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:09,741
I wonder if that sound I heard
has anything to do with it?

237
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:14,508
-Come on, Ranma.

238
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,808
What are you waiting for?

239
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,908
-I'd never have done this if
it could have been helped,

240
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:21,041
but with this goes
the last of my pride.

241
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,608
Then again, if it means
getting my strength back,

242
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,474
there ain't nothing I
ain't willing to do.

243
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:28,074
-Check 'em out, freak!

244
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:30,008
Get a load of these, will ya?

245
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:35,341
Well?

246
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:36,841
[gasping]

247
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,341
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
I've been working

248
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,674
on the heat of his anger, but
the heat of his perversion

249
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:41,641
is even worse.

250
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,041
Burn, you old pervert.

251
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:44,274
-That's it!

252
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:46,541
That sound I heard was a camera.

253
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,274
-That was his secret plan?

254
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,841
-It's the same old stuff
he's always pulling.

255
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,141
-You're wrong.

256
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:54,808
It's true that Ranma
pulls the skirt thing,

257
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,141
but it's also true that he
always wears boy's underwear.

258
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,208
Look at him!

259
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,274
This time he's wearing
girl's underwear!

260
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:02,641
-She's right!

261
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,474
This time, Ranma's
risking it all!

262
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:07,874
-And without the
training, he'd never

263
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:09,141
have had the nerve to do it.

264
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,441
-What's the matter with you?

265
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,308
Do you want 'em, or--

266
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,274
-Yes!

267
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:20,741
-Those pictures are mine!

268
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:25,941
-It's the heat of
his perversity!

269
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:26,641
-OK.

270
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,874
And now for the spiral.

271
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,308
-If you're gonna be
hittin' Ranma, I want in!

272
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:33,574
-Mousse!

273
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,341
-If you're gonna
have fun at school,

274
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:37,674
you need to have my permission.

275
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:39,208
-Hand over those photos!

276
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:40,874
-Stay still and let me hit ya!

277
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:41,841
-Let me cut in here!

278
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:43,308
-Gimme!

279
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:47,608
-The chart with the
pressure points!

280
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,574
-Whoa!

281
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:50,374
-Quickly!

282
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:51,508
Why are you waiting?

283
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:55,008
Use the Dragon's
Heaven Blast, already!

284
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,874
-But if I do it now, they're
all gonna get caught in it, too.

285
00:13:57,974 --> 00:14:02,108
They've done nothing
to deserve-- uh-huh.

286
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,108
You shouldn't have
oughta ganged up on me!

287
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:05,708
Hiryu Shotenha!

288
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:09,808
-Ranma!

289
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:10,574
-Way to go!

290
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:12,574
-How'd you like that?

291
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:14,041
[scream]

292
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:14,974
-Akane!

293
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:22,408
How did you-- Akane!

294
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:23,408
Akane!

295
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:24,841
Akane!

296
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,308
-Ranma.

297
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,374
Ranma!

298
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:28,041
-Akane!

299
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:28,674
Don't move!

300
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:30,474
I'm almost there!

301
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:31,015
Akane!

302
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,941
-Whoa, check it out.

303
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,941
-Someone's in there.

304
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,674
-Whoever it is, they're
coming this way!

305
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:45,741
-Whoa, check that out.

306
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,008
-Jeez, what are the odds?

307
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,841
Every jerk in this school's
in the same place at once.

308
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:51,674
-Only one thing to do.

309
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:54,541
-Bury 'em!

310
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:58,308
-It's become even more powerful
since he hit me with it.

311
00:14:58,408 --> 00:15:01,008
-That's because there was
plenty more battle aura in it

312
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,608
this time than just yours.

313
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,541
-With Ranma honey
still caught up in it,

314
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,574
how are we ever going
to get him down?

315
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,874
-Good question.

316
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,074
-We can't just stand here!

317
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:14,808
-Akane!

318
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,474
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
I can't breathe!

319
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:17,841
-Ranma!

320
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:18,808
Here!

321
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:20,341
Take the pressure point chart.

322
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:23,341
I got it for you when I noticed
Grandfather Happosai dropped

323
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:25,008
it.

324
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:27,874
-Akane-- is that why you let
yourself get caught up in this?

325
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:33,841
You idiot!

326
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:36,774
How dare you risk
yourself like that?

327
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:38,741
-Ranma-- hurry.

328
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:39,282
Take it.

329
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:42,749
-Akane!

330
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:46,682
There it is!

331
00:15:46,741 --> 00:15:48,141
The map!

332
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:49,608
Akane risked her life for it.

333
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,074
I can't just-- No!

334
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:55,441
There it goes!

335
00:15:55,541 --> 00:16:00,108
The single last surviving copy
of the pressure point chart.

336
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,141
-Now what?

337
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:02,108
-I dunno.

338
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,841
Confetti?

339
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,874
-Oh, no!

340
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:09,008
-Quickly, gather it up!

341
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:10,941
Don't let a single
piece blow away!

342
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,241
-All of it?

343
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:13,308
You gotta be kidding.

344
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:14,441
-Listen to me.

345
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,908
Unless we find all the
pieces of that chart,

346
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:19,574
Ranma will be weak for
the rest of his life.

347
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:20,408
-That's it.

348
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:21,241
It's over.

349
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:23,274
I'll never be strong again.

350
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:26,741
Akane, I'm sorry.

351
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:27,708
Akane!

352
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:28,708
That's right!

353
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:31,174
How could I-- it's not over!

354
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:32,841
Not until I save you!

355
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:34,774
Not until you're safe!

356
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:35,441
-Oh, no!

357
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,741
They're gonna crash!

358
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:37,282
-Akane!

359
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,141
-Curse you, Ranma!

360
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:45,508
Founding School of Anything Goes
Martial Arts final technique!

361
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,141
Get ready for the--

362
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,441
-What's he got, a cherry bomb?

363
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,874
-Happo Fire Burst!

364
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,274
-Wait a sec.

365
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:00,541
That just bought us some time!

366
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:01,708
Huh?

367
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:04,241
-Now hand over the
pictures, or else.

368
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:07,808
-If it's pictures
you want, take 'em!

369
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,574
-How sweet!

370
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:10,941
-Gotcha!

371
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,374
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Least this way,

372
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:14,741
I can prevent Akane
hitting the ground.

373
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:16,508
Wha?

374
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:17,974
-He's gonna hit the fence!

375
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:18,774
-The fence!

376
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:19,974
We're gonna hit the--

377
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:20,808
-Ladies, come back.

378
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:21,774
Oh, yeah.

379
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:39,908
-Look.

380
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:41,641
Akane didn't get a scratch.

381
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:43,074
-Yeah, not even from the fence.

382
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,874
-The pressure point chart.

383
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:49,374
Where is it?

384
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:50,074
Ranma, the chart!

385
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:50,841
Where did it go?

386
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:52,474
-Hm?

387
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:53,941
RANMA (VOICEOVER): That's right.

388
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,508
Akane doesn't know yet.

389
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,974
She still thinks it's safe.

390
00:17:58,074 --> 00:17:59,174
-Here you go.

391
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:01,774
We picked up the chart,
just like you told us to.

392
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,841
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
What the-- all right!

393
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:07,008
There's still hope!

394
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:08,841
-There's a piece missing.

395
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,108
Wouldn't you know it?

396
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,241
It's the only part
we really need

397
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,874
to cure your weakness, too.

398
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,774
-Does this mean
that Ranma will be

399
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:20,541
weak for the rest of his life?

400
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,774
-Afraid so.

401
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:23,141
-Dude, keep your
voice down, huh?

402
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:24,341
He's right in front of us.

403
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:34,241
-Granny, Ryoga, Ukyo.

404
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:34,874
All of you.

405
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:41,241
I want to thank
you for helping me.

406
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,441
You've all been great.

407
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:46,674
-Huh?

408
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:47,608
Ranma?

409
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,041
Come back!

410
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,274
Aw, jeez.

411
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:51,308
That poor guy.

412
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:54,308
-I hope he doesn't
do anything stupid.

413
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:57,508
-This is all your fault,
you disgusting little turd!

414
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:59,908
Take that, and that!

415
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:00,874
And that!

416
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:01,674
And--

417
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:02,241
-Wait!

418
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,341
Hang on a sec.

419
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:04,641
-This better be good.

420
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:07,208
-Say, granny, what's this?

421
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:08,674
-Well, what do you know?

422
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,841
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I'm
gonna miss all of you.

423
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:16,974
Especially you, Akane.

424
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:17,515
Wha?

425
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:22,808
-Planning to sneak
off again, huh?

426
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,408
-Huh?

427
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:25,074
Akane, I--

428
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:26,774
-You make me sick.

429
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:33,474
But I still want to go with you.

430
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:37,941
-Uh-- Akane-- it'll never work.

431
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:43,108
You know a girl's got no
business on a training journey.

432
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,841
-I'm not coming
to train, stupid.

433
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,708
I'm coming to
carry your luggage.

434
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,508
Ranma?

435
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,741
Who says you have to go
off training, anyway?

436
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,474
So you're not big and strong.

437
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,174
Well, big deal.

438
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:01,608
-Without my strength,
what else is left?

439
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,008
-Huh?

440
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:04,441
What kind of question is that?

441
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,141
You've got a lot of things!

442
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:07,974
-Go on.

443
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,141
I'm listening.

444
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,374
-Well, um, for one thing,
you, uh-- well, that

445
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:16,774
is to say, you
kind of-- um, look,

446
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:18,708
you just have to be strong.

447
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,041
You satisfied?

448
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,874
-Gee, what's the matter, Akane?

449
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:23,608
Couldn't think of
nothing else, could ya?

450
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:32,041
[scream] Haven't you
tortured me enough?

451
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,141
My strength!

452
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:44,174
-Guess that means the
moxie bustion worked.

453
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:45,108
-What's this?

454
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,141
Ranma Saotome back
from the dead?

455
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:48,208
-Lie at your own peril.

456
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:50,608
-We're gonna have the
big fun now, yeah!

457
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:54,708
-I'm cured!

458
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:55,674
Akane, I'm cured!

459
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:56,441
-Oh, Ranma!

460
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:03,074
Oh, Ranma, I can't tell
you how happy I am for you!

461
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:03,874
-I'm cured!

462
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,808
Cured, I tell ya!

463
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:08,741
Ha ha ha!

464
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:10,208
I'm 100% back to normal!

465
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:10,741
Cured!

466
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:13,641
Good as new!

467
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,141
Better than new!

468
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,108
Oh, yeah!

469
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,074
All right!

470
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:18,574
Way to go!

471
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:20,008
Outta my way, tree!

472
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:20,541
Who dam an?

473
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,041
Who da man?

474
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:23,041
Come on, pop.

475
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:24,341
You want to take me on again?

476
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,274
-What do you know, Saotome?

477
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:27,941
Looks like the
Anything Goes school

478
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,008
has no shortage of
power, at least.

479
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:32,374
-I'm just so glad
everything's turned out well.

480
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:36,174
-Hey, you want that I should
give him another dose?

481
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:37,241
-Look at me!

482
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:38,274
I'm strong!

483
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,676
[theme music]

484
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:19,080
NARRATOR: So what's with
the skirt, huh, Ukyo?

485
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,013
And Ranma?

486
00:23:20,113 --> 00:23:20,946
What's the big idea?

487
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:22,780
You two going out on a date?

488
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,780
Next time on Ranma 1/2, Ukyo's
Skirt, The Great Girly Girl

490
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,846
We'll see ya there.
