GOSUNKUGI (VOICEOVER):
Several months

5
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:45,807
ago, I moved to this
town, yet still there is

6
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:48,107
so much I do not know about it.

7
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:50,374
But one thing I do
know for certain

8
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:53,307
is each morning
at precisely 6:30,

9
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:57,574
my classmate, Akane
Tendo from Furinkan High,

10
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,741
passes this spot
during her morning jog.

11
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:05,174
Oh, my name is Hikaru
Gosunkugi, and today I've

12
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:08,241
decided to reveal
the real me to her.

13
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,407
Ah, here she comes now.

Good morning, Akane.

Hey!

17
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,441
Hey, Gosunkugi.

You know, I run
here every morning.

00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,007
You do?

21
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:29,107
Well, so do I.
What a coincidence.

22
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:30,241
GOSUNKUGI: Yeah.

23
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,174
When I run on a beautiful
morning like this,

24
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:35,174
I feel like something
wonderful could happen to me.

25

AKANE: Hey, maybe
I'll see you tomorrow.

GOSUNKUGI: Yeah, probably.

27
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:41,174
Like I said, I'm
out here every day.

I'll see you then.

You know, I've had
my eye on you, boy,

60
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:09,641
and I feel sorry for you.

61
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:12,341
So I thought you might be
interested in something

62
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:15,574
I have that would be
just perfect for you.

Some kind of salesman
or something?

00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:19,974
Bingo.

66
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:21,707
And what I offer
are products that

67
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:26,374
can solve specific
problems for my clients.

68
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,041
So what do you have
in there for me?

69
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:29,274
Let's see.

70
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:32,874
A matching set of
12 paper dolls.

71
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:34,174
Paper dolls?

72
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,874
May I?

73
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:37,841
Hm.

74
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:39,741
Just write a
command on the doll

75
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:41,941
and put it on the person's back.

76
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,407
And then--

77
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:47,674
That person is forced into
following that command?

78
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:48,774
Really?

79
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:50,507
You got it, kid.

80
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:53,774
But remember, it will only
work once for each doll

81
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:55,307
and that's it.

82
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,307
Uh huh.

Hello.

173
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,115
Uh, hi there.

174
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,782
You've got some
explaining to do, jerk.

175
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:45,982
I-- I do?

176
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,348
About what?

177
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:49,082
Oh, I think you know, pal.

178
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:52,015
Hey, just leave me alone.

179
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:54,115
So what are you hiding there?

180
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:54,715
Show me!

181
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:55,256
No.

[whimpers]

183
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,015
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

184
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:01,148
Just butt out.

185
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:02,215
[sighs]

186
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,748
I can't believe Akane
came to my rescue.

187
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:07,982
Hey, this has nothing
to do with you.

188
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:10,348
Too bad, because I
won't put up with it.

189
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:13,715
How come you're being
so stupid, stupid?

190
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:15,982
Speaking of stupid,
look at a mirror!

191
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:16,715
Um, Akane?

192
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:17,348
Ranma?

193
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,648
Please calm down.

194
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,548
I have to put the doll
on, so can you not

195
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:21,548
fight until I-- hey!

196
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:23,048
You stay out of this.

197
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:26,548
This is between me and Ranma.

198
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:28,048
See you later, Akane.

199
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:29,015

[laughs nervously]

205
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,448
Gosunkugi, I-- I was wondering
if you're free tomorrow.

206
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:53,082
Yeah.

207

Would you like
to go out with me?

AKANE: Where are you going?

213
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:02,415

Huh? Now what's
up with the freak?

Ha ha!

00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,015
I'm so happy.

going out with me!

219

Out with me, out with me!

220
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,215
Ha ha!

221
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,082
There's definitely
something fishy going on.

222
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:36,315
Akane would never go out on
a date with a certified geek

223
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:37,848
like Gosunkugi.

OK.

227
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:44,382
It's time to look into this.

228
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,482
A date with Akane?

229
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:50,082
But where should we go
and whatever should we do?

230
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,382
So, my dear., having fun?

231
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:00,648
Yes, I am.

I know.

237
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,282
I'll take her out to the
park in the afternoon.

Oh, Gosunkugi, wait for me?

Why don't you try and
catch me, my sweet?

Aren't they the most
perfect couple in the world?

They remind me
when I was young.

say any more.

OK.

You write a note on them, and
stick it on a person's back,

309
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:01,415
and whatever you wrote
is supposed to come true.

brain to tell your legs to stop

[grunts]

344
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:31,948
Excuse, but if you don't mind,
could you just please leave?

345
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:33,782
OK, you don't have to get mad.

346
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:37,348
Geez, I was just trying
to make conversation.

347
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:38,315
AKANE: What about you?

348
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,782
Aren't you supposed
to be studying?

349
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:40,448
[door shuts]

350
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:42,382
What's with him?

[clock ticks]

352
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,582
Oh my, I'm too
nervous about tomorrow.

353
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:01,982
I've tried everything to try
and make myself fall asleep,

354
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:03,382
but nothing seems to work.

00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:28,582
AKANE: Come on, Akane.

357
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,848
Wait up!

358
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,615
I'm late for school.

359
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:34,615
I gotta tell you something.

360
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:38,015
There it is, the paper doll.

361
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:39,482
Slow down, Akane.

362
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:45,315
Uh, ah!

363
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:49,348
[groans]

364
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,582
AKANE: See you at school.

[grunts]

366
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:54,015
OK.

[students chattering]

369
00:17:59,115 --> 00:17:59,615
See you later.

370
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,948
I wonder where
Gosunkugi is today.

371
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:08,048
After all, today
is their big date.

[snores]

373
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:15,848
Whoa!

374
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:16,748
Huh.

375
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:17,289
Huh?

376
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:22,648
Oh no!

377
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:24,615
I am so late.

378
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:29,515
Come on.

379
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:30,548
Hurry up.

380
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:31,748
They're waiting for us.

381
00:18:31,848 --> 00:18:33,182
Oh, OK.

382
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:34,482
I'm coming.

383
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:36,315
Ah, Akane?

384
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,882
Gosunkugi.

385
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:40,182
You do realize that
school is over.

386
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:41,448
Uh, yeah.

387
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,115
Sure.

388
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:43,982
Hm?

389
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:48,315
But today is our
date, remember?

390
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:50,515
Silly, our date is tomorrow.

391
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:51,448
What?

392
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,782
Tomorrow?

393
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,215
But yesterday you
said it was today.

394
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:56,182
Huh?

395
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:58,415
GIRL: Akane, are
you coming or what?

396
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:01,148
Oh, right.

397
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:02,548
See you tomorrow, Gosunkugi.

398
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:08,948
GOSUNKUGI: But--
But-- But-- But Akane!

[sighs]

400
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,815
RANMA: You looking for this?

401
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,282
Huh?

402
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:15,248
You give me that back.

403
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:16,182
Come on.

404
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:17,482
Sorry.

405
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:21,715
Tell me, are you really as
dumb as you look, Gosunkugi?

406
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:22,348
What?

407
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:24,048
What do you mean?

408
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:26,448
Feast your eyes on this.

409
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,148
You wrote on the doll that she
would go out on a date with you

410
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:30,248
tomorrow.

411
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:31,448
You idiot.

412
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:34,182
Don't you realize
tomorrow never comes?

413
00:19:34,282 --> 00:19:35,648
[whimpers]

414
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:38,148
No!

415
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:40,648
She'll never go out with me.

416
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,782
What a freak.

417
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:47,448
Huh?

418
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,315
Hey.

419
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:51,182
Wh-- Where are you going!

420
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:52,148
Ha ha ha ha!

421
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:53,115
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

422
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,815
Yippie!

423
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:55,915
So now what's he up to?

00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:56,782
[gasps]

425
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,515
He's got another
paper doll left.

426
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,448
No!

427
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:00,382
Wait up!

428
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:05,882
GOSUNKUGI: I've only got
one chance left with Akane.

Akane.

Are you all right, dear?

434
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:23,448
I'm fine.

435
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,182
And look, it's a boy.

436
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:25,815
That's right.

437
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:27,615
He's our first son.

438
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:30,848
Ah, you have made
me the happiest man.

439

(HIGH PITCHED) I
love you, sweetheart.

(HIGH PITCHED) Oh Gosunkugi,
I hope this moment never ends.

443
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:41,015
Me too.

[kissing sounds]

445
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:44,148
I think he's gone
completely nuts?

446
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:45,548
Yeah.

447
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:46,515
Let's go.

448
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:47,615
Hm.

449
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:48,282
Huh?

450
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:51,048
Oh no, you can't go.

451
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,448
Wait, I've got
something for you!

452
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:55,082
Don't do it, Gosunkugi!

453
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,548
Don't do it!

454
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,748
Gosunkugi, don't be so silly.

455
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:08,682
You're my friend.

456
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:11,015
Why would I hate you?

457
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:13,748
Oh, thank goodness.

And a few minutes

461
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:31,148
later, it dawned on
me that I should have

462
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,448
had Akane fall in love with me.

463
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:35,548
Oh, I'm such a dummy!

Satori, a mysterious boy

who's supposed to be
able to read minds

00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:22,217
decides to come and see Akane.
