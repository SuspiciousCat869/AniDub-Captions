you to a frog,

00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,933
-It's your fault.

332
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:14,466
I knew it.

333
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:15,800
-What?

334
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,433
Do you want me to take a lie
detector test or something?

335
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,533
-I've had about enough of you.

336
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:21,166
Hi-yah.

--[sighing] That's odd,
it tastes like water.

-[cackling] That's 'cause it is.

-Huh?

359
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,700
-I used to have some
Jusenkyo spring water, true.

360
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,033
But, ah, it kind of
all, well, evaporated.

361
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:37,400
-So then those three
frogs are just frogs.

362
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,966
-Now you got it.

363
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:42,533
I wanted to scare you a
little, and that's all.

364
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:46,966
-But why involve Shampoo
then, and the others?

365
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:50,333
-So many have fallen into
those cursed springs.

366
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:55,433
Yet I was sure none were
more miserable than I. I just

367
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:58,466
wanted to spread that
misery around a little.

368
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:00,000
-What a rotten thing to do.

369
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,666
-But Ryoga never fell into any--

-Don't worry, they're
only sleeping.

374
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:14,166
I just wanted to scare
you a little, and I did.

for you to shut up.

but not frogotten.

-Are these a lie too?

Salty-- guess not.

But why?

00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:24,455
Is it connected to that
new crepe making guy?

Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"Raging Okonomiyaki."
