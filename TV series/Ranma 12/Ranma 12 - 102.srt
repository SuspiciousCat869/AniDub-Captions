well, thinking about me.

why I never noticed before.

Sure, you're clumsy
and violent sometimes--

-No, no.

118
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,566
Don't mind us.

119

-As you were, kids.

120

-As you were.

121

-To see our youngsters
getting along like that.

122

Well, it does the
old heart good.

Eh, Tendo?

124
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:14,033
It's like being a kid
again, eh, Saotome?

00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,200
-Or, at least young at heart.

I-- oh, Akane.

Are you serious?

135
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:43,966
And what about me?

136
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:47,300
Was I-- I think that I was.

137
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,300
Or maybe, I wasn't.

138
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,333
But I meant to be.

139
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,700
I mean, I meant to
mean to be serious.

140
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,400
I mean--

141
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:53,966
KASUMI: Ranma.

142
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:01,000
-Are you OK?

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,000
-Yeah.

SOUN: So, there you are, son.

145
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,700
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were shy.

146
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,633
Silly me.

147
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm just so happy you
and Akane are together.

148
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,566
-Ranma, is that true?

149
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,000
-It will be if you
say so, Kasumi.

150
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,800
-What?

151
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,466
-You what?

152
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,866
-I wha?

153
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,900
What the heck am I saying?

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,666
-Ranma!

155
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:28,000
Are you cheating
on Akane already?

156
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,333
-Father, please.

157
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,666
Calm down.

158
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:33,233
If that's the way Ranma feels,
then the least we owe him

159
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,833
is to.

160
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,433
Oh, dear.

161

Oh, son.

162
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:41,400
And here I believed in you two.

[panting]

164
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,966
-OK, I'm awake.

165
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,366
Why'd I do that all of a sudden?

166
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,166
I mean, I don't even like--

167
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,566
-So, then I'm all
like, you know?

168
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,866
And he's all like, whatever!

169
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:02,966
-Oh, my gosh.

170
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:03,966
Really?

171
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:04,933
-They're beautiful.

AKANE (VOICEOVER): Am I cute?

I am, aren't I?

174
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:23,433
KASUMI: Akane.

-Ah!

176
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,500
Kasumi, don't scare
me like that, OK?

177
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,400
-Has something happened
between you and Ranma?

178
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,033
-Uh, heh, what
makes you say that?

179
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,833
-So then you didn't say
that you'd marry him?

180
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:41,874
-What?

181
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:42,466
No, marry?

182
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:43,233
Are you crazy?

183
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,066
No way.

184
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:44,666
Nuh-uh.

185
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:45,600
Not a chance, OK?

186
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,000
Absolutely not.

187
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,566
Forget it.

188
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,400
I mean as if!

189
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,366
-Hmm.

00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:51,566
-Kids these days.

No respect.

192
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,633
I just wanted to see
what color they were.

193
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:55,700
That's all.

194
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,066
She didn't have to
go all in-- Bandages.

195
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,900
Bandages, let's see here.

196
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:05,866
Huh?

197
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:06,700
That's odd.

198
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,600
There ought to be a few left.

199
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:14,933
I swore there was-- my mistake.

Have you had enough?

00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,233
-No one seem be winning.

204
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,133
-We've been at it
all day and we're

205
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,700
no closer than when we started.

206
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,766
-Maybe we should take break.

207
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,400
-My thoughts exactly.

-Is that Ranma?

212
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,466
RANMA: So then I was like
all totally, you know?

213
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:48,300
Can I walk you home?

What you mean by this?

216
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:55,533
You're not dating
those girls, are you?

217
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,933
-You're so cute when you're mad.

218
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:00,266
Did you know that?

219
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,300
-Forget about it, Ranma.

220
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,966
She means absolutely nothing.

221
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:04,766
Go on.

222
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,600
Tell me who you really love.

-I love you, of course.

-Ranma, listen.

225
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,666
People who tell lie
go very bad place.

-What lie is that?

227

-That Ranma love you, stupid.

What you think?

231

-Which one.

232
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
-He means me, of course.

233
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,000
-I think he means me.

Hang in there, Ranma.

in fights lose fight.

-Huh?

00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:46,214
I just keep thinking this

00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:49,314
-Oh, yeah, sure thing.

343
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:50,581
-I'm telling you, boy.

344
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,181
If I hadn't of seen it, I
wouldn't have believed it.

345
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:56,381
-Do you think this is any
way for a man with a fiance

346
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,714
to behave?

347
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,114
-Ranma!

348
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:00,547
-Oh, hey, Shampoo.

349
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:01,847
-We finish what we start?

350
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:04,214
-And what would that be?

351
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:08,147
-I want you tell me in boat
again how happy you is.

352
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:11,714
-Boy, is she telling the truth--

353
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:13,781
-And what about
your promise, Ranma?

354
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:14,581
-Promise?

355
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,347
And what promise is that?

356
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:19,947
-Remember, you promised that
I'm the only one for you.

357
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,814
-He say that to me, too.

358
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:24,114
-Yeah, but with me, he meant it.

359
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,247
-You take that back!

360
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:26,414
-Go on, Ranma.

361
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:27,981
Tell her.

362
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:28,522
-Hm?

363
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,047
-Now, wait a sec.

364
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:35,014
-Nabiki, I--

365
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:35,947
-Ranma!

366
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:37,014
-Ugh!

367
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:39,014
-What?

368
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:41,014
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma,
and I believed him.

369
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:45,514
-Akane.

370
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:46,514
Akane, please!

371
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:47,947
Open the door.

372
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,781
He made a mistake, that's all.

373
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:50,547
Akane!

374
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,747
Akane, I'm talking to you.

375
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:53,414
Akane!

376
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:54,481
HAPPOSAI: Don't lie.

377
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:57,081
You know he's just
showing his true colors.

378
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:57,981
SOUN: Master, please.

379
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,314
You're not helping.

380
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,681
HAPPOSAI: Oh, you
know it's true.

381
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:04,114
Where is the little
ladykiller anyway?

382
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,581
SOUN: He is in the
dojo being punished.

383
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:09,947
HAPPOSAI: Well, I'll
go say hello then.

384
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:18,047
Now that's nice for a change.

385
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:24,281
Maybe now you're finally ready
to hear what I've got to say.

386
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,347
Hey, I recognize that bandage.

387
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:30,447
So that's where the little
rascal disappeared to.

388
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,014
May as well leave it on.

389
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:34,047
The best part's yet to come.

390
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:36,981
UKYO: And what
part is that, huh?

391
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,914
-Shampoo want hear too!

392
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,514
-OK, girls.

393
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:47,681
You've had your fun.

394
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:49,681
Now cut me down please!

395
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:51,714
UKYO: Not 'til
you spill, gramps.

396
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:53,547
HAPPOSAI: OK, OK.

397
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:56,414
It's a magic bandage, all right?

398
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:58,114
Ranma doesn't know about it.

399
00:16:58,214 --> 00:16:59,247
I bought it in China.

400
00:16:59,347 --> 00:17:01,614
It's supposed to have
some kind of love potion

401
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:04,714
that activates
with human warmth.

402
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:05,714
-Warmth?

403
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,647
Like by wearing it, you mean?

404
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:10,481
-You say it, no matter
who he love with?

405
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:11,314
-That's right.

406
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:13,081
That's what a love potion does.

407
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:15,881
-Now are you going to cut me
down from here or aren't you?

408
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:16,614
Come on.

409
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:17,614
-Sorry, pops.

410
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:18,847
No can do.

411
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:21,647
It's your punishment for
meddling in people's lives.

412
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:24,281
-Shampoo know something
wrong with Ranma.

413
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,114
Now she know why.

414
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,081
-Does it matter who--

415
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,314
-He in love with?

416
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:32,447
BOTH: In other words--

417
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:36,047
-How dare you take advantage
when Ranma is so confused.

418
00:17:36,147 --> 00:17:37,014
-Oh, right.

419
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,514
Look who's talking, Ukyo.

420
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:41,114
Like you no try to make
Ranma marry you yourself!

421
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:43,647
-Will somebody get
me down already!

422
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:44,914
-A promise is a promise.

423
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:47,281
-You snooze, you lose.

424
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,281
[sighs]

425
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,414
-Thanks, Akane.

426
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:51,181
I owe you one.

427
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,414
-I didn't come here to help you.

428
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:55,881
I just wanted to
ask you a question.

429
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:56,547
[groans]

430
00:17:58,214 --> 00:18:00,481
-Are you in love
with someone else?

431
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,447
You-- you said it yourself.

432
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:07,514
You know, I'm clumsy
and violent and, well--

433
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:08,055
-Akane.

434
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:15,714
Actually, I think
you're very cute.

435
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:16,255
What?

436
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:16,747
-Ranma!

437
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,647
You come me.

438
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:18,188
Ranma!

439
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:22,581
-That stupid Shampoo.

440
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:24,581
Akane, you got a
shot at this too,

441
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:26,447
but not if you just
sit there waiting

442
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:28,147
for happiness to come to you.

443
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:30,781
-Wait, I don't-- I said wait!

444
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,447
-Shampoo, where
are you taking me?

445
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:40,214
-A place where no one
interferes, of course.

446
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:01,647
You-- you love Shampoo, right?

447
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:02,714
-Sure.

448
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,447
-Then it's OK you
sign marriage license?

449
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:06,014
-OK.

450
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:06,555
UKYO: A-ha!

451
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,181
The moment I've
been waiting for.

452
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:14,847
Ranma, honey, will
you please sign this?

453
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:15,388
-Sure.

454
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:21,981
-Oh, no, you don't!

455
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:25,714
-Seems like we're right
back where we started.

456
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:26,681
-So it seems.

457
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:28,147
-You guys, cut it out.

458
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,414
What are you doing?

459
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:32,881
-Ranma, you have to
do what Shampoo says.

460
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:35,514
Magic bandage means
he loves all women.

461
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:37,514
-That's right, which
is why he's going

462
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:40,447
to write his name on
my marriage license.

463
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,414
-I what?

464
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,947
-So-- so that's it.

465
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:45,114
Wait, wait, you guys.

466
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:46,914
Don't you see it's pointless?

467
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:47,781
-How so?

468
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,181
-Yeah, how?

469
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,281
-What about how Ranma feels?

470
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,214
-Shampoo worry that one later.

471
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:55,181
-For once, I agree with you.

472
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:56,647
-Please, don't!

473
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:57,614
-Oh, no!

474
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:01,514
-Akane!

475
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:02,055
-Ranma!

476
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:02,555
Ranma!

477
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:10,447
-Ranma!

478
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,314
He no dead, is he?

479
00:20:12,414 --> 00:20:13,381
-They're fine.

480
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:14,381
Look at how they landed.

481
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:19,581
-Ranma?

482
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,547
Ranma?

483
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:24,481
Ranma, wake up.

484
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:25,947
-Akane, you OK?

485
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:27,414
-Ranma, you're alive!

486
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:30,281
RANMA: Gosh, you're
cute when you cry.

487
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:30,822
-You dummy.

488
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:36,747
-I guess it must be
because of the bandage.

489
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:39,681
My heart is beating like crazy.

490
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,914
-So you guys gonna
stay like that or what?

491
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:44,014
-We see what you're doing.

492
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:46,814
-Yeah, and the bandage
came off a while ago.

493
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:47,781
-What?

494
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:50,047
-You should be
ashamed of yourself.

495
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:52,847
-That's the last time
I trust him again.

496
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,314
-Just like Shampoo always say.

497
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:56,381
Men is pig.

498
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:57,514
-I'm outta here.

499
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:58,447
-Shampoo go, too.

500
00:20:58,547 --> 00:20:59,914
But it no mean I give up!

501
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:07,914
-It's getting kind
of late, isn't it?

502
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:09,114
-Uh-huh.

503
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:10,914
-So, you hungry?

504
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:11,647
-A little.

505
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:13,047
You?

506
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:13,588
-Huh?

507
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:19,281
-Look here, boy.

508
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:21,214
-Yeah, look here, son.

509
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,281
-Out all night I see.

510
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,914
That's not good, Akane.

511
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:26,581
-But-- but we--

512
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:29,181
GENMA: Ranma, you're
grounded for a week.

513
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:30,314
SOUN: Akane, no allowance.

514
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,381
Three months.

515
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:33,481
-Huh?

516
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:34,514
RANMA: I knew it.

517
00:21:34,614 --> 00:21:36,514
Girls are nothing but trouble!

519
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,876
AKANE (VOICEOVER): So here's
this guy, and he plays Shogi.

520
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:22,409
What I don't get is
why do we have to play?

521
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:26,343
Next time on "Ranma 1/2," Battle
Chess-- the Game may be Fake,

522
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:27,976
but the Pieces are Real.

523
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:30,109
We'll see you there!
