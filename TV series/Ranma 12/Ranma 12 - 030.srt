NARRATOR: Meet Ranma
Saotome of the Anything

4
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,633
Goes School of Martial Arts.

5
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,866
-Hey, let go!

6
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,166
-Hai-yah!

7
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,600
NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

8
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:45,800
-What are you doing?

9
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,000
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

10
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:48,600
to marry by their
loving parents.

11
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,300
-I didn't ask for this.

12
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,800
-Who asked you?

13
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,066
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

14
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,533
-What'd you do that for?

15
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,566
NARRATOR: When Ranma is
splashed with cold water,

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,166
he becomes a she.

17
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,310
All right, that's enough.

18
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:14,243
GENMA: This dojo is for
training, not brawling.

19
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:15,776
Show it some respect.

20
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,276
SOUN: Ranma, Akane, you're
both under a lot of pressure.

21
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,710
We know that.

22
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:21,376
Carrying on the Anything
Goes School of Martial Arts

23
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,810
is not an easy thing.

24
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,943
Both of you have trained
hard, and it's only natural

25
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:26,943
that passion should run
high while training.

26
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:32,410
But you're not to use this
dojo as a boxing ring.

27
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,476
-Ranma, I'm concerned.

28
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,376
We've talked about this before.

29
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,976
Akane is your fiancee.

30
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,410
You should look out for her.

31
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:42,843
Martial arts is in the
fist, boy, it's in your gut.

32
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,310
Your gut, boy.

33
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,476
-She ain't my fiancee.

34
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,476
-So who'd want to be?

35
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,843
-You may have your little
misunderstandings now and then,

36
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:57,143
but someday, you'll come
to appreciate each other.

37
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,643
-Right.

38
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:01,010
The future of the Anything
Goes School of Martial Arts

39
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,710
depends on you.

40
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:07,843
Ranma, Akane, only
the two of you-- huh?

41
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:08,743
Ranma?

42
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:09,743
SOUN: Akane!

43
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:10,310
-Wait.

44
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:11,210
Please listen.

45
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:12,376
-Wait, please, listen.

46
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,176
-Sorry, Dad, but
I never asked you

47
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,310
to arrange an
engagement to Ranma.

48
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,276
-She's right.

49
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,543
[sobbing loudly]

50
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,043
-Ranma, I just want
what's best for you.

51
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,810
-Then why don't you listen
to me once in a while?

52
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,143
-But I listening!

53
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:26,476
Really, I am!

54
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,810
Please, boy, you must listen.

55
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:30,043
Believe me, please!

56
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,010
Oh, please!

57
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:33,143
-Gee, don't cry about it.

58
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:34,643
KASUMI: Father, come quickly!

59
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:35,437
-Huh?

60
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,243
-Huh?

61
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:38,810
NARRATOR: Danger
at the Tendo Dojo.

62
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:44,210
SOUN: "Saturday night,
I, the Dojo Destroyer,

63
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,176
shall come to
challenge your dojo."

64
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,143
That's tomorrow.

65
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:50,076
-Oh, that must be a joke!

66
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,143
Gee, I thought those kind of
guys were only in the movies.

67
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,910
-What did he look like, Kasumi?

68
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:58,076
-Oh, Father, I don't know.

69
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,276
Only the letter was here when
I got back from my shopping.

70
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,476
SOUN: "A wise man once said the
path of a true martial artist

71
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,643
is fraught with dangers.

72
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:07,243
The training is
nothing unless you're

73
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:10,176
prepared to lay your life on the
line to defend what is yours.

74
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,210
If you cannot meet my challenge,
then you were never meant to be

75
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,676
a martial artist in
the first place."

76
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,743
-Right.

77
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:18,610
The Anything Goes
School of Martial Arts

78
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:21,910
must accept any
challenge at any time.

79
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:22,976
SOUN: Right.

80
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,543
I, Soun Tendo, am a
true martial artist.

81
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:28,410
I would gladly lay
my life on the line.

82
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:32,010
Ahem, uhm, uh-- although
the Tendo Dojo now

83
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:35,843
belongs to Ranma and Akane,
so they must defend it.

84
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,676
GENMA: And that's
the way it must be.

85
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,276
You two must join forces
and defend our dojo.

86
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,043
-Me?

87
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:43,310
Work with Ranma?

88
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,576
RANMA: Yeah, I'd be
better off on my own.

89
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,076
-What's that mean, huh?

90
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,243
-Duh, Akane.

91
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:49,843
I can take him on myself.

92
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:50,943
You'd only slow me down.

93
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,643
-Well, is that so?

94
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:54,010
-Yeah, you're a slowpoke!

95
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,810
AKANE: So what if I'm
not as fast as you?

96
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:57,510
What's important is
defending the dojo,

97
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:00,010
and I can do that all by myself.

98
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:00,843
RANMA: Yeah?

99
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:01,376
You and what army?

100
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,376
-Excuse me?

101
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,743
-There's no excuse for you.

102
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:04,543
[angry sigh]

103
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:09,343
RANMA: Aw, face it, Akane.

104
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,876
The only thing you've
got working for you

105
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,476
is brute strength.

106
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,876
AKANE: Oh, you mean this
brute strength, Ranma?

107
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,643
-That's the spirit.

108
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:19,410
You must tap into
that energy when

109
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:21,910
you're fighting
the Dojo Destroyer.

110
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:24,343
Just remember, kids, two
heads are better than one.

111
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:25,710
I'm confident that
together you'll

112
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,976
come up with a plan to
defend your inheritance.

113
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,976
Akane, are you listening to me?

114
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,010
-Yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:32,610
-Hmph.

116
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:37,876
-I don't know.

117
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,410
Do you think those two
will cooperate, Saotome?

118
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:41,743
-You'll see, Tendo.

119
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,910
I'm sure they'll work it out.

120
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,610
All we can do now is
have a little faith.

121
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:49,743
They're not bad
kids, just stubborn.

122
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:52,576
SOUN: Oh, Saotome,
I hope you're right.

123
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,276
This outside threat may be
the only chance for the two

124
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,443
to join together.

125
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,810
GYM TEACHER: OK, next?

126
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:24,276
-Aaaaagghh!

127
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,310
-Huh?

128
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,376
STUDENT: Where'd she come from?

129
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,210
[kids chattering]

130
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:31,110
-Ni hao, Ranma!

131
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:33,010
-Can we help you?

132
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:36,176
-Hey, what are you doing here?

133
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,510
-Hmm.

134
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:40,310
You sure you want talk
to Shampoo like that?

135
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:42,210
-Huh?

136
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:43,910
-This one just normal water.

137
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,110
Watching careful now.

138
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:50,943
This one just normal dog, right?

139
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:56,910
[splashing]

140
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:58,276
[gasps]

141
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,276
STUDENT: Oh my!

142
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,276
STUDENT: The dog!

143
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,243
It turned into a guy!

144
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,010
-It-- it can't be!

145
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:05,876
SHAMPOO: Ta-dah!

146
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,710
Instant Nanniichuan.

147
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:07,843
Huh?

148
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:11,010
-Whatever fall in spring
take body of young boy.

149
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,743
Very tragic story.

150
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:17,143
This powder make
Instant Nanniichuan.

151
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:21,576
Ranma, you be normal man again.

152
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,176
STUDENT: You think
it's for real?

153
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,510
STUDENT: Well, why
wouldn't it be?

154
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,610
STUDENT: You mean
it's like bath salts?

155
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,710
RANMA: Vo: It's-- it's
too good to be true.

156
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,476
If she's telling
the truth, I can

157
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,643
be rid of this curse for good!

158
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:44,143
-So what's he got to
do for it, Shampoo.

159
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:46,310
-You smart girl.

160
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:48,576
Ranma, you date Shampoo?

161
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,576
-Huh?

162
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,143
-Take Shampoo to
date, you get powder.

163
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:53,343
You want go date?

164
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:54,110
