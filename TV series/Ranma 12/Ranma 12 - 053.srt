I'd love to.

-So, Ranma, what kinda
girl is she, huh?

111
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:45,215
You picked her out for me,
'cause she's my type, right?

You do know my type, right?

Oh, it's so good to be alive.

-Oh, Ranma.

118

Come on.

119
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:04,515
You don't mean Shampoo.

120
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:05,748
You know she'll never say yes.

121
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:10,448
-Yo, Shampoo.

122

OK.

-He say he want date with
you, great-grandmother.

138

-What about why I want?

-You do know my type right?

140
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,482
Big eyes, long hair.

141
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,282
-Gee, why didn't I think of it?

142
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:51,048
They're so close in age too.

143
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:52,748
-Is good couple.

144
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,415
-We'll leave you
two lovebirds alone.

145
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:57,315
-We kids no want interfere.

146
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:57,856
-Don't go.

147
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:59,856
Don't go.

148
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:00,556
-Oh yeah.

149
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:01,723
Is beautiful bracelet.

150
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:03,556
-I want you to have it.

151
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:04,923
Think of it as a dowry.

152
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,123
Now, come on.

153
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,523
Don't take it personally.

154
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,723
I'm sure you'll make
someone a fine wife.

155
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,923
But-- but for me, the only
one I want to marry is--

-Don't be ridiculous.

I'm sure we'd all
much rather hear

158
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:22,823
how you got your hands
on that bracelet.

159
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:26,723
Why, even the ancestress of our
3,000 year old Amazon tribes

160
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:28,523
would've wept to
have possessed it.

161
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:31,723
How on Earth did you
get a hold of it?

162
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,489
-That's for me to know
and you to find out.

163
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,289
-I knew it must've
been ripped off.

164
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,123
-All night.

165
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,789
You hand that over this instant.

166
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,989
-I don't wanna.

167
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,456
-Hand it over!

168
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:46,289
-Now that I know it's so
valuable, I don't think so.

169
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:50,556
[laughter]

170
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,756
-Why, that monster
stole our treasure.

171
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,556
-But why is it so special?

172
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:55,856
-Shampoo?

173
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:58,023
You simply must get
that bracelet back

174
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,856
before he learns its secret.

175
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,089
-Secret?

176
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:04,256
-If you fail, he'll make
this world a living hell.

177
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:12,556
-What?

178
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:13,723
A love potion?

179
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:14,556
-Whoa.

180
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,323
You mean like in that old song?

181
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,389
-Yes.

182
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,056
Only this love potion
is so terrifying,

183
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,456
it frightens even me.

184
00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:22,756
Swallow one of the three
pills in that bracelet,

185
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:24,289
and you'll fall
instantly in love

186
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:26,823
with the first person you
see of the opposite sex.

187
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:28,689
-That really is terrifying.

188
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:29,389
-Whoa.

189
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:30,723
Creepy.

190
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:31,656
-Oh, Ranma.

191
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:33,289
You swallow pill
for Shampoo, yes?

192
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:34,189
-That's not funny.

193
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:34,989
Let go.

194
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:36,589
-Oh, be polite now.

195
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:37,130
-I ain't.

196
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:38,223
So let go!

197
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,123
-This is no time for
eating snow cones.

198
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,856
We've gotta stop him.

199
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,456
-If he discovers the
secret of those pills--

200
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:47,356
-It'll be hell, all right.

201
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,323
-I heard it.

202
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:50,256
I heard it!

203
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,923
Shampoo, baby!

204
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,523
Let's start us up a heat
wave of the heart, baby.

205
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:02,123
Hey!

206
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:03,456
-Stay still, you little freak.

207
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:04,523
Hand over that bracelet.

208
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:05,089
Hah.

209
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:05,956
Now I've gotcha.

210
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:09,156
-Take that, you ingrate.

211
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,789
Nya, nya.

212
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,056
You can't catch me.

213
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,789
You can't have this
bracelet, neither.

214
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,423
Never, never, you hear?

215
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:19,256
-He got away.

216
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:21,389
-But he leave one pill behind.

217
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:23,123
-Hey, it's that love potion.

218
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,389
-Think it work?

219
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:27,023
Ranma!

220
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:28,689
What you think you're doing?

221
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:29,689
-Oh, I'm sorry.

222
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,123
Am I in the way?

223
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:32,289
-So what are you doing?

224
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,023
You're so cute.

225
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,189
-Uh--

226
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:43,223
-You're so cute.

227
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,323
-Ra-- Ranma, wait a minute.

228
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:44,989
-So cute.

229
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,723
-Stop it.

230
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:48,689
No.

231
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:49,656
Not like this.

232
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:53,223
Say it to me without
the love potion.

233
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:53,805
-Sucker.

234
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:04,356
Oh, yeah.

235
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,623
Like I'd really swallow it.

236
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:29,551
I swallowed it.

237
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:31,818
Oh my god, I swallowed it.

238
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:32,651
-Ranma!

239
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:33,751
-Ranma, look at Shampoo, yes?

240
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:34,284
-Hey!

241
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:35,351
-OK, ghoul.

242
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:37,651
Hand over the antidote.

243
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:49,051
How come I-- how
come I never realized

244
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:53,217
just how beautiful a mature
woman in full bloom could be?

245
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,251
-You're just teasing
me, aren't you?

246
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,651
-Is no fair, great-grandmother!

247
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,651
-Forgive me, child.

248
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,517
But I too am a woman.

249
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:03,751
-My darling, you know I won't be
happy until we're man and wife.

250
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:04,851
-Yes, my love.

251
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,584
-Great-grandmother,
you stay away from him!

252
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:13,117
-Sorry, but I ain't handing
this cutie over to anyone.

253
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:15,884
-If we no do something, Ranma
and great-grandmother will--

254
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,017
-They can't.

255
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:18,684
No, they can't.

256
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:19,817
I won't let them.

257
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,851
Ranma, don't do it!

258
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,217
-Cut that out!

259
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:31,217
I'm sorry, son, but I
must oppose this marriage!

260
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,017
-Huh?

261
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,251
What?

262
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:35,917
-Before you enter into holy
wedlock with that woman,

263
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:38,017
first, you must
defeat me in battle.

264
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:39,084
-Wedlock?

265
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:40,984
Who the heck do you
think I'm marrying?

266
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:41,951
-Me, of course.

267
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:45,684
-Is-- is he all right?

268
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:49,717
-Ah, well.

269
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,684
Guess the pill
couldn't last forever.

270
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:52,384
-You mean?

271
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:53,684
-No is permanent?

272
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:57,151
-What the sap here just
swallowed was the instant pill.

273
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,384
-Ah, too bad.

274
00:12:58,484 --> 00:13:01,084
Imagine what t have happened
if only it had lasted.

275
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:02,651
-Bad great-grandma.

276
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:04,084
-I still don't understand.

277
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,417
If what Ranma took
was the instant pill,

278
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,384
how long will the
other two pills last?

279
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:10,451
-Each of the three
pills on the bracelet

280
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,917
is effective at
different duration.

281
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:14,851
The two remaining
love potion pills

282
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:18,251
are effective one day and
a lifetime respectively.

283
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:20,151
AKANE: OK, the instant
lasts an instant,

284
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:23,817
the one day lasts a day, and
the lifetime lasts forever?

285
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,517
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER:
Yes, if the son-in-law

286
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:27,484
had swallowed that pill.

287
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:29,817
I'd already be sending
out wedding invitations.

288
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:36,051
-That one too close for comfort.

289
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:38,451
-Ranma?

290
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,684
I don't think he hears us.

291
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:46,817
-Oh.

292
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:48,651
Hm.

293
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,917
Which girl do I pick?

294
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,351
-Ah-hah.

295
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,051
So there you are.

296
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:54,251
-Shampoo, baby.

297
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:56,884
-Oh, you want go on
exciting date with Shampoo?

298
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:57,417
-Do I?

299
00:13:57,517 --> 00:13:58,617
Do I?

300
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:01,317
Oh boy, oh boy, oh
boy, oh boy, oh boy!

301
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,717
-But what is it?

302
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,117
Is it an oompa-loompa?

303
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,117
-It's crying and
wiggling and stuff.

304
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:07,284
-Quit trying to get it down.

305
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:08,317
Just keep poking it.

306
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,884
-I am not an octopus.

307
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,917
I am not an oompa-loompa.

308
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,284
Shampoo lied to me.

309
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:16,084
Get me down!

310
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:16,951
Come on.

311
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,184
I'll buy you some ice cream.

312
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:19,184
I'll buy you some candy.

313
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:20,517
I'll buy you whatever you want.

314
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:21,517
Just get me down!

315
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,884
[moaning]

316
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:31,084
-Oh, honestly, Ranma.

317
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,484
Just get over it, will you?

318
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:34,817
-Shampoo no mind.

319
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,617
-Hey, what do you want?

320
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:37,184
Huh?

321
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:38,617
The bracelet.

322
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:40,851
-He take this one
while he sleeping.

323
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:41,617
-Oh no you don't!

324
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,451
-Say, "ah," and fall
in love with Shampoo.

325
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:51,425
-Gha?

326
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:52,117
Wha-- wha?

327
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:53,951
-How's about this?

328
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,951
Still wanna give Ranma
that love potion?

329
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:59,184
-It no matter, stupid.

330
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:02,051
Once Ranma swallow pill,
Shampoo change him back to boy.

331
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,117
then he love her whole life.

332
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:05,484
-Hey!

333
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:06,051
-You missed.

334
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:16,117
-She what?

335
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:19,617
Akane swallowed a
love potion pill?

336
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:23,251
So in other words,
the first man she sees

337
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:24,617
is the one she'll love?

338
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:26,551
-Something like that, yeah.

339
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:27,384
-Ranma.

340
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:30,484
-Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

341
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:32,384
-Take a good long
look, sweetheart.

342
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:33,584
-Did it have to be so hot?

343
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:39,451
-Shampoo no think so.

344
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,984
-Dad, cut it out, will you?

345
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:44,617
I'll be the one who
decides who I look at.

346
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:45,451
-Hey, there, Akane!

347
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:51,584
-You can't take your eyes
off of him for a second.

348
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:52,284
Oh yeah.

349
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,717
Tell me quick, Akane.

350
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:54,751
Which one did you take?

351
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,617
The one day pill or
the lifetime pill?

352
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:59,084
-Hey, what happens if she
took the lifetime pill, huh?

353
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,117
-So this is the last one.

354
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,651
You can relax, Akane.

355
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,884
The love potion pill you
took was the one day only.

356
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:13,817
-Oh good.

357
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:14,951
-Is that all?

358
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,684
-What do you mean, is that all?

359
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:20,284
-If it's only a one day
pill, what's the big deal?

360
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:23,784
-Just because it
isn't your problem--

361
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,617
-Little freak springs
up from outta nowhere!

362
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:31,451
Before looking at some other
freak, why not look at me?

363
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:34,817
-Uh-- are you sure
you're ready to?

364
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,684
-Don't tell me you
thought I was serious.

365
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:44,117
-All I have to do is not
look at any guys, right?

366
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:48,617
Some stupid love potion
isn't gonna beat me.

367
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,217
-Akane.

368
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:53,684
-Ow.

369
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:54,617
-Jeez.

370
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:57,117
Why does she gotta
be so stubborn?

371
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,917
-And why's she gotta ignore a
sweet, harmless, little old man

372
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,284
who only wants to help her.

373
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:04,351
-Maybe it's because you make
her feel sick to her stomach!

374
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:05,484
-What did you say?

375
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:08,017
Is that any way for you
to address your master?

376
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:08,851
-Whoops.

377
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:09,851
My mistake.

378
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,251
I got it wrong.

379
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:15,851
The one Akane swallowed was the
lifetime pill, not the one day.

380
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,392
-Lifetime?

381
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:21,851
-Ranma, you wait.

382
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:22,417
-Come on.

383
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:23,651
Let go of me.

384
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,251
-Shampoo no care if last
pill is only one day type.

385
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,784
Just hurry up, swallow,
and fall in love with her.

386
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,784
Who care what Akane look at?

387
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,251
-Maybe it's not important
to you who she looks at.

388
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,717
But she's sure the
heck gonna care.

389
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:35,284
Let go!

390
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:37,484
-Shampoo won't.

391
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:38,217
Ranma, come back!

392
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:54,484
-Where the heck have I come now?

393
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:56,384
I can't go on.

394
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:57,817
Oh, Akane.

395
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:03,817
If only you were-- Huh?

396
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:08,184
Hello, Akane.

397
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,684
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Ranma, you idiot.

398
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,251
Can't you care?

399
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:18,951
Just a little?

400
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,317
-Akane?

401
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:21,284
Akane?

402
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:22,284
Akane!

403
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:23,517
-Ryo--

404
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:24,058
-Hiya!

405
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:32,517
Huh?

406
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,684
-What was that for?

407
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:38,484
-This little pig was drowning.

408
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,017
-Hi-chan.

409
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:39,951
What's he--

410
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:41,684
-It's important
you listen, Akane.

411
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:42,451
About that pill--

412
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,384
-Poor wittle baby.

413
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:50,117
You must've been so lonely in
that house all by yourself.

414
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:52,017
-Akane, I'm trying to
tell you something.

415
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:54,551
That pill you took, it-- hey!

416
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:55,451
Wait.

417
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,717
Where are you doing?

418
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:59,284
Akane, that pill you took
was the lifetime one.

419
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,184
Put your blindfold back on.

420
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:02,884
What if some strange
guy shows up?

421
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,151
-What do you care, Ranma?

422
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,351
Who knows?

423
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:08,051
Maybe my prince on a white
horse may come along.

424
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:12,451
-Akane, have you
gone crazy or what?

425
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:12,992
What the?

426
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:17,817
-Look at me.

427
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:18,651
Look at me!

428
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,084
I'm a prince on a white horse.

429
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:21,984
-Why you little!

430
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:24,051
-Akane!

431
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:25,484
-Oh no you don't!

432
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:26,384
Akane!

433
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:26,925
Forgive me!

434
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:33,451
-I'll save you, Akane.

435
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:34,417
-I said no!

436
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:43,984
Akane, I--

437
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,417
-Ranma!

438
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:45,958
Be good.

439
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:46,884
Take pill!

440
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:55,184
You drop pill!

441
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,017
-Huh?

442
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,984
-I'm sorry, Akane,
but I gotta do it.

443
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,984
What if you fall in
love with some freak?

444
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:09,284
I'm gonna become a
guy just for you.

445
00:20:09,384 --> 00:20:09,825
-Ranma.

446
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:25,684
-So have you fallen for me yet?

447
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:26,584
-I dunno.

448
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,251
Have you fallen for this?

449
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,684
-Ow!

450
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:32,484
But you-- but you swallowed
the-- what about the--

451
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:33,484
-The pill?

452
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:36,117
Thanks to your drowning
me, here it is!

453
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:36,651
Who needs it?

454
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:41,817
-What're you doing?

455
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:42,817
You're wasting it!

456
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:48,151
Look what she's done.

457
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,117
The love potion's gone.

458
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:04,351
-All's well that ends well.

459
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:07,184
Isn't that what Daddy says?

460
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:08,851
-I already told you.

461
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,151
I was just trying to warn
you about the lifetime pill.

462
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:13,751
-It was day only.

463
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:16,284
-Ranma.

464
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:17,751
-What the-- what
the heck are you--

465
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:21,284
-Are you absolutely sure
she took the lifetime pill.

466
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:23,551
-Yeah, that pill went
back into the water.

467
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:26,317
-I knew it.

468
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,251
-Oh no.

469
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:28,384
You don't think
it swallowed the--

470
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,517
-Run for it!

471
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:34,251
-I didn't wanna get
married to an octopus.

472

[speaking japanese]

474
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,095
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
That stupid moose.

475
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,528
What's he up to with
poor, good-hearted Ryoga?

476
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:20,695
What?

477
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:22,728
The two of them are
teaming up against Ranma?

478
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:24,828
Next time on Ranma
1/2, The Ultimate

479

Team-up-- The Ryoga
Moose Alliance.

480
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:28,561
We'll see you there.
