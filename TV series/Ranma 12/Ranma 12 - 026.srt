NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:15,724
-What are you doing?

8
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:16,858
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

9
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,291
to marry by their
loving parents.

10
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:20,258
-I didn't ask for this.

11
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,758
-Who asked you?

12
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:25,258
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

13
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,658
-What'd you do that for?

NARRATOR: When Ranma is

he becomes a she.

[crying out in pain]

22
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:55,930
If I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes,

23
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:57,130
I wouldn't have believed it.

24
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:59,830
I poured that tea
quite a while ago.

25
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:01,497
Hm.

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,630
Like a cat's tongue, huh?

27
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,097
-Dr. Tofu, Ranma thinks that
Shampoo's great-grandmother

28
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,463
put pressure on
one of his nerves.

29
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:10,197
He is getting more
crazy by the minute.

30
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,930
-Hey, I wouldn't
talk if I were you.

31
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:13,863
You are so non-cute.

32
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:14,997
-Well, you've gone crazy.

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,097
-Have not!

34
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,230
-Yes you have!

35
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:20,397
-Now, now, you two.

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,230
Problem is, this nerve
is very hard to reach.

37
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:25,397
Only a specialist in the
Chinese medicinal arts

38
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,963
should be fooling with it.

39
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:29,963
-But I just know you can do
something, can't you, Dr. Tofu?

40
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:30,863
-Can I do something?

41
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:31,697
Uh--

42
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,063
-Oh, thank goodness.

43
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:33,797
-See?

44
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,963
I told you.

45
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:36,197
-Or can't I?

46
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,397
-What?

47
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,730
--[laughs] Oh, you're
such a kidder.

48
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:41,363
It seems there's nothing
you can't do, Dr. Tofu.

49
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:42,930
Isn't that right, Ranma?

50
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:43,997
-Of course.

51
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,963
I put my life in
your hands, Doc.

52
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:48,930
-Hey, you two, I'm not a
miracle worker, you know.

53
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:52,663
I meant to say I probably
can't do anything for you.

54
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:53,119
-Huh?

55
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,930
-Huh?

56
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:54,763
-I take that back.

57
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:55,597
I'm sure I can't.

58
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,331
Sorry.

59

[gasp]

60
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:58,663
-Oh no!

61
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:00,930
You mean Ranma will have to
spend the rest of his life

62
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:02,197
as a girl?

63
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,230
DR. TOFU: Well, I
wouldn't go that far.

64
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:06,630
Hey, stand up.

65
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:08,397
I have an idea.

66
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,297
-Hey, Ranma, snap out of it!

67
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,163
The doctor wants
you to stand up.

68
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:15,197
All right, now turn around.

69
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,797
-OK.

70
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:20,963
Ooh!

71
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:22,730
-What did you do
to him, Dr. Tofu?

72
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:25,997
-That Full Body Cat
Tongue nerve is strong.

73
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,430
But there's another nerve,
one that is even stronger.

-Oh, that's right!

-Yes, when it comes to Tokyo

will do.

86

-Which means that I could
change back into a guy, right?

87

-It's true.

88
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,097
Old Tokyo men are the toughest.

-Let's hear it for the old guys.

-Won't she be upset
when she finds out

104

but for how much longer?

169
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:35,797
RANMA: OK, that does it!

170
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,763
-Ranma!

171
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:38,297
-Ranma, that's enough!

172
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:43,330
-[laughs]

173
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,297
-Huh?

174
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,030
--[satisfied sigh] How I've
searched for you, Shampoo!

175
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:10,097
-Ugh.

176
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,230
RANMA: Hey!

177
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:13,763
Who you calling
Shampoo, you jerk?

178
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,330
-Hm-- hm?

179
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,030
-What'd you do that for?

180
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:23,363
-And who are you?

181
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:25,897
-That's what we want to know.

182
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,463
-You may call me Mousse.

183
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:30,763
I have come for you, Shampoo,
all the way from China.

184
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:31,563
[students laugh]

185
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:34,163
-Put your glasses back on.

186
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:36,930
That's her!

187
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,730
-Oh, my darling Shampoo!

188
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:42,830
I'm sorry, but you see,
Miss, I'm her future husband.

189
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,097
-That not true.

190
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,197
You only stupid
friend from childhood.

191
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,097
COLOGNE: She's right.

192
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,863
-The ghoul returns.

193
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:50,197
-Get used to it.

194
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,363
Come now, Mousse.

195
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:53,263
Shampoo has already
rejected you.

196
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,330
-That doesn't count.

197
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,663
We were only three years old!

198
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:58,630
-You know the rules as
well as I, young man.

199
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:02,730
Besides, Shampoo's already
got her eyes on this one.

200
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:03,497
-Hai-yah, Ranma!

201
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,863
-I never agreed to nothing!

202
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:07,097
-With him?

203
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,697
Tell me, who are you?

204
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,397
-Who, me?

205
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,630
I'm, uh, Ranma Saotome.

206
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:15,263
-Mousse, what you doing?

207
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,230
-Stop that!

208
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:18,963
-And who are you?

209
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:20,197
-Akane Tendo.

210
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,463
-She's just a girl
whose house the boy

211
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:23,963
is freeloading at,
nothing more than that.

212
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:25,097
-Huh!

213
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,197
-She's angry.

214
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,763
-She's always angry.

215
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,163
-Oh, now I get it.

216
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:31,230
It's not enough that
you've got Shampoo.

217
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:34,197
You're stringing
along this woman, too.

218
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,797
You've got some nerve!

219
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,463
-Hey!

220
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,930
-You enemy of women!

221
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:38,897
Aaaagh!

222
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,930
-Hey, come on, buddy!

223
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,297
-No excuses.

224
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,797
Fist of the White Swan.

225
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,730
Hakucho Ken!

226
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:50,063
-Whoa, I didn't see his hands!

227
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:51,530
-The White Swan?

228
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:52,563
-Heh.

229
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,330
You aren't worthy of
being my opponent.

230
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,330
RANMA (VOICEOVER): What
the heck did he just do?

231
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,963
MOUSSE: You there, have
you given up so soon?

232
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:00,597
-Never!

233
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,297
-Ranma!

234
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,797
Be careful, Ranma.

235
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,163
He a master of dark magic.

236
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:06,363
-What's that supposed to mean?

237
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:07,830
-He have many, many trick.

238
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,397
-I'd listen if I were you.

239
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,063
Just as the swan conceals
his thrashing feet

240
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:14,097
beneath the glassy
surface of the lake,

241
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:20,030
so do I conceal my deadly blows!

242
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:20,630
-Huh?

243
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:26,530
-A training potty?

244
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:27,597
Hah!

245
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,697
OK, that's it.

246
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,863
Now you've don't it.

247
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:30,630
Let's fight!

248
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:31,730
-Wait.

249
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:33,963
First promise me if I
win, you'll give up.

250
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,363
-Shampoo is spoken for.

251
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:39,963
-That should I win,
you'll give me your woman.

252
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:40,963
[gasp]

253
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:42,163
[girls giggle]

254
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,497
-He'll do no such thing!

255
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,963
-You mean one girl's as
good as another to you?

256
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:47,230
-All right.

257
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:49,163
We will fight man to
man-- unless you're

258
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:51,297
too chicken to
fight me, that is.

259
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,797
-Oh, fine with me.

260
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,530
Any time, anywhere, buddy.

261
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:55,330
-Ranma!

262
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:56,863
-Just a moment, son-in-law.

263
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:58,397
-Huh?

264
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,097
-Now wouldn't it be better
to arrange a more formal duel

265
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,497
over dear Akane's
hand in marriage?

266
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,063
-Fine!

267
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:05,030
-Count me in. r

268
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:07,163
-Hey, now hold on a minute.

269
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:09,997
-[chuckles] It's arranged then.

270
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,563
How about tomorrow, at the
park at noon, all right?

271
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:14,097
RANMA: OK.

272
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,263
MOUSSE: OK.

273
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:16,797
Remember, it's a
man-to-man promise.

274
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,830
-I'll be there.

275
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:24,730
[students chatter]

276
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:25,330
AKANE: Yah!

277
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,697
Huh?

278
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,097
[laughs nervously] Ah, listen
to me for a sec, Akane.

279
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,830
-No, you listen.

280
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:43,263
I can take care of myself.

281
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:44,997
Don't worry about me.

282
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,330
-I told you not to worry.

283
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:48,763
I can beat that Mousse
guy, no problem.

284
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,797
You're not listening.

285
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,130
-Huh?

286
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:53,763
-I don't care about that stupid
duel with you and Mousse.

287
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:56,230
Win or lose, I don't
belong to anyone.

288
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,230
Everyone keeps trying
to boss me around.

289
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:01,230
If it's not a duel, it's
that stupid fiance thing.

290
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:02,130
I've had it!

291
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:03,730
Do you understand me?

292
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:05,230
Even if you do lose to Mousse,
I don't have to live with him.

293
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:06,630
I can just ignore him!

294
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:09,130
If it comes down to it,
I can beat him up myself.

295
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:11,163
You're the one who
needs to relax, Ranma.

296
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:12,163
-Jeez, you coulda just--

297
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:12,797
-Ow!

298
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,663
-Akane!

299
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,430
I'm glad to hear
that-- the Tendo

300
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:17,197
Dojo will be proud of you.

301
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,263
You're the perfect
fiance for Ranma.

302
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:21,397
-You hear that, boy?

303
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,097
She swallowed her
own pride, just

304
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,830
so she could take the pressure
off you and make you look good.

305
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:28,163
You're so lucky, boy.

306
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,797
-That's not what I meant!

307
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,563
-Don't worry, Akane.

308
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,997
I just know Ranma will win.

309
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,997
-You've got to trust
him eventually.

310
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,997
-I sure wish your dear mother
were here to see you now.

311
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,830
-Father, you promised you
wouldn't get all emotional.

312
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:45,163
-Well, now, so I did.

313
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:47,730
[all laugh]

314
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,330
RANMA: Hah!

315
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:58,363
RANMA: Hah!

316
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:01,163
-Time for breakfast, you two!

317
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:03,097
-Since he's got over
that Cat Tongue thing,

318
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,730
he's been in a good mood.

319
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:08,130
-Is it true that Dr. Tofu
was the one to cure him?

320
00:11:08,163 --> 00:11:08,963
-Yep.

321
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:10,330
He's the best.

322
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:11,863
[phone ringing]

323
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:12,630
-Oh!

324
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,663
-I'll answer it.

325
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:18,797
[phone ringing]

326
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,930
Tendo Dojo, hello?

327
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,063
Good morning, Dr. Tofu.

328
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,663
We were just talking about you.

329
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:29,663
What?

330
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,930
You mean it can only
be used one time?

331
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:33,797
Ranma!

332
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,030
-Yeah?

333
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:35,630
Aaaah!

334
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,263
-Uh-oh!

335
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:42,297
Guess I'm too late.

336
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:56,510
-What?

337
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,076
No!

338
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,910
-Wait!

339
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:00,376
-What's with him?

340
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,276
-The Old Man Tokyo
nerve that Dr. Tofu

341
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,576
used to cure his Cat Tongue
can only be used one time.

342
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,276
RANMA: Aaaaahh!

343
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:13,225
Aaaahhh!

344
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:18,776
It's cold, not hot.

345
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,810
AKANE: Ranma, what are you going
to do about the match today?

346
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:23,910
-What do you mean, do?

347
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,743
-You can't fight him like that.

348
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:26,776
I

349
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,810
-I never run away from a fight.

350
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:29,643
We made a man-to-man promise.

351
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:30,676
AKANE: But Ranma--

352
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,410
-Hey, hey, don't worry.

353
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,643
I'll deal with it.

354
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:36,210
[laughs]

355
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:43,476
[laughs]

356
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,443
-Come get!

357
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:45,576
Come get!

358
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,776
Hot, delicious
dumpling for sale.

359
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,710
[chatter]

360
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:54,176
-Fruit and vegetables here.

361
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,743
Step right up and get them
while they're still fresh.

362
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,910
[music playing]

363
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,576
-Oh!

364
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,876
I don't believe it!

365
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,843
It's a circus.

366
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,243
-He's late.

367
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:20,710
You don't think that he's
run away now, do you?

368
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:21,776
-He'll be here.

369
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,710
Just give him five minutes.

370
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:26,110
-Oh, arriving late
on purpose in order

371
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,910
to psych out the opponent, eh?

372
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:30,110
Look, I think his
strategy is working.

373
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,276
-Ranma, prepare to die!

374
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,076
-Somebody help me!

375
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,110
-So you're scared of me now?

376
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:35,910
Oof!

377
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:38,310
-That's not Ranma, you fool.

378
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:38,876
-Ranma?

379
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,043
What happened.

380
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,676
Look at you--
you're all dried up?

381
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,943
Unh!

382
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,643
COLOGNE: Put your
glasses on, you idiot.

383
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:46,010
[laughter]

384
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,343
-They're both idiots.

385
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:52,076
I wonder where
Ranma is, that jerk.

386
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,610
-This is bad.

387
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,943
Don't you think he's
overdoing it just a little?

388
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,076
-I told you, he'll be here?

389
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,910
AKANE (VOICEOVER): At
least I hope he will.

390
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,910
-[laughing] Relax, Akane.

391
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:17,910
I told you, I've got
everything under control.

392
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:22,110
This trick's sure to make
him think that I'm a guy.

393
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:24,510
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I've got
a bad feeling about this.

394
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:25,210
-Argh!

395
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:26,210
He's late!

396
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:29,443
I'm going to rip
Ranma's stupid head off!

397
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:31,643
RANMA: Let the show go on.

398
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,876
-Ranma?

399
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,076
[crowd murmurs]

400
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,125
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
He doesn't think

401
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,658
that dumb costume's going
to fool anyone, does he?

402
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:55,392
-Oh, Ranma, now you
turn girl-type again.

403
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:57,092
[laughter]

404
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,658
-Yo there, Mousse, hurry
up and let's fight.

405
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,058
-What?

406
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:02,692
Hm.

407
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,525
[laughs]

408
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:05,725
-You were late, Ranma.

409
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,892
How dare you order
me to do anything?

410
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:09,492
That's so rude!

411
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,892
-Yeah, that's the kid all right.

412
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:14,592
[chatter]

413
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,292
-Oh, [inaudible].

414
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,192
-That's just the way I like it.

415
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:23,158
[gong]

416
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:25,025
-What the heck was that?

417
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,358
-You like it?

418
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,492
It's a little trick I
worked up for the match.

419
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,325
Can you do any magic?

420
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:32,592
-Magic tricks?

421
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,525
Is that what you think
my techniques are?

422
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,292
Just magic tricks?

423
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:37,525
-Well, yeah.

424
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:40,025
You're the master of
dark magic, right?

425
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:41,425
Here's what you do.

426
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,992
You hide junk up your
sleeves, where it's dark,

427
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,558
and then you take
it out and use it

428
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,358
to impress the audience,
like this, see?

429
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:50,392
Nothing to it.

430
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,792
-Nothing to it?

431
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,058
I'm going to show you some
dark magic you're never

432
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:55,192
going to forget.

433
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:57,725
Behold, Hen's Egg Bomb.

434
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:58,492
Attack!

435
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,658
Keiran Ken!

436
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:06,892
-Well, all right!

437
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,392
You do know magic!

438
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:08,992
-Quiet!

439
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:15,025
-Ranma!

440
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,992
--[laughs] What do you
think of my tricks now?

441
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,725
-I'm not impressed.

442
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,092
Hah!

443
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:26,392
And now for my grand finale!

444
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:30,092
-What the-- huh?

445
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,992
-I turn into a girl.
[giggles] How about it, pal?

446
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:38,992
Even disguised as a girl,
I'm more than enough for you.

447
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:40,358
-Hey, that's no fair.

448
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,958
Are you trying to
make a fool of me?

449
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:43,725
Well, are you, huh?

450
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:44,725
-Hai-yah!

451
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:46,692
They really think
he just disguised.

452
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,092
-Ranma, you're something else.

453
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,625
-He is that.

454
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:53,458
But still, can that woman's
body beat Mousse in battle?

455
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:54,858
[giggles]

456
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:57,425
-Well, now I know
what it is you want.

457
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,858
All right.

458
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:01,192
-Huh?

459
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:03,825
[crowd cheers]

460
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,492
MOUSSE: Time to put
away our tricks.

461
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,058
Time to fight with bodies alone.

462
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:09,992
-Oh, Ranma!

463
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,225
He make Mousse mad!

464
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:14,125
-But it's hand-to-hand combat.

465
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,892
-I don't know about that.

466
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:16,758
-Huh?

467
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,558
What do you mean
by that, Doctor?

468
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:25,425
-I told you my darling
Ranma was here.

469
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,458
-That cretinous fiend.

470
00:17:27,492 --> 00:17:30,125
I, Tatewaki Kuno, shall
surely take him to task

471
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:37,658
for fighting one other than I.

472
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:38,225
-Well?

473
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,825
Now do you see?

474
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,858
-He doesn't seem to realize
that a girl's arms and legs have

475
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:43,658
less reach.

476
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,925
It could be a fatal mistake.

477
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,192
-Unless you want to
hand over your woman,

478
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:52,192
shed that foolish disguise
and fight me man to man!

479
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:52,792
Hyah!

480
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,392

SOUN: Gotcha.

483
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:00,425
-No fair!

484
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,825
-Oh, Ranma!

485
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:02,658
-Wowza.

486
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:04,425
She is busting out all over.

487
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,058
-What?

488
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,258
-What?

489
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:06,892
Huh!

490
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:07,692
Oh no!

00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:08,825
We gotta help the boy!

00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:11,392

Hey, what are you doing?

499
