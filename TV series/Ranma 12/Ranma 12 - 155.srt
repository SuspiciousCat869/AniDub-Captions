GIRL (VOICEOVER): Ranma
has gotten himself

4
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:48,134
into a cheerleading competition
against Mariko Konjo, leader

5
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,134
of the Seisyun High Martial
Arts Cheerleading Team.

6
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,401
In order to win, each
girl must cheer for Kuno

7
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:56,667
and demonstrate that she
loves him more than the other.

8
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:02,201
Bring It On-- Love as a
Cheerleader, Part Two.

00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,301
RANMA: Oh, Kuno!

11
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,067
Huh?

12
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:13,634
Oh, there you are!

13
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,701
I found you, Kuno.

14
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,401
Good morning, my
pig-tailed girl.

15
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:17,401
Here's a towel.

16
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,267
Good luck with that
big kendo match.

17
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,367
[gasp]

18
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,767
It's so nice of you
to do this for me.

19
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:26,334
I made you this lunch.

20
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:29,334
And here's a drink
and a good luck charm.

21
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:30,234
[gasp]

22
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,601
That's not all.

23
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:36,234
I made this sweater and a scar.

24
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:37,767
I wrote you love letters.

25
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:40,167
And I brought some
good luck dolls,

26
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,934
some Valentine's
chocolates, a birthday cake,

27
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,301
and New Year's cards.

28
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,034
See ya!

29
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,167
Love you, Kuno!

30
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,867
Bye!

31
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:49,934
Stop right there.

[gasp]

33
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:52,167
Listen.

34
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,001
This might seem a
little ungrateful,

35
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,167
but I can't help
but feel that you're

36
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,234
doing all the things that you
hate most just to get them out

37
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,534
of the way and over with.

38
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,201
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Busted.

39
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:06,601
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma, you're
doing all this for my sake.

40
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:23,534
I'm not going to let Ranma
go through this alone.

41
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:28,634
I'm going to take part in the
cheerleading competition, too.

00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:34,901

Oh, lousy batons.

50
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:41,867
Nice, Akane.

51
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:43,934
Too bad you got the spaz
genes in the family.

52
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,134
[sigh]

53
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:45,767
OK.

54
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,901
I'm not giving up.

NABIKI: Now will
you call it quits?

62
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,134
SOUN: What?

63
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,467
What do you mean Ranma went
out with Kuno on a date?

64
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,067
Tell me it ain't so!

65
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:10,434
Kuno's not man
enough for my Ranma.

66
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,434
What on earth is
going on here, Tendo?

67
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:15,867
Saotome, that's
what I want to know.

68
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,534
I feel sorry for him.

69
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,034
Well, you know Ranma.

70
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,601
He'll come out of this somehow.

71
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,801
No, I meant Kuno.

72
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:23,734
Huh?

73
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,934
Hello, everybody.

74
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:26,767
Hi, Ranma.

75
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,067
Hi.

76
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,334
You're sure looking
very happy this evening.

77
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,301
So how did your
date go with Kuno?

78
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,234
[laughter]

79
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,534
Ranma, tell me you
didn't go overboard,

80
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,667
like drinking juice
from the same glass.

81
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,001
How rude.

82
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:43,201
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Or
holding hands in the theater.

83
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:45,267
Hands to yourself, you octopus!

84
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,767
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Or
kissing in the park!

85
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,634
Think you can get
away with that?

86
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,167
[laughter]

87
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,834
Just thinking about it
gives me the creeps!

88
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:58,334
My skin is still crawling!

89
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,201
Oh, my.

90
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:00,734
Now he hates him
even more, just

91
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,034
in time for the championship.

92
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,234
I figured something
like this would happen.

93
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:05,034
[scream]

94
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,234

[groan]

96
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,634
I hear it's a competition
between cheerleaders.

97
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,701
Oh, yeah?

98
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,101
So you mean both
the cheerleaders

99
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:20,401
are rooting for just Kuno
and not the whole team?

100
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:22,967
BOY: Yeah, but I still don't
get why the pig-tailed girl's

101
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:23,767
cheering for Kuno.

102
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,067
MARIKO (VOICEOVER):
Today I'll get

103
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:31,134
Kuno to open his heart to me.

104
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,734
BOY: Mariko, over here.

105
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,634
Huh?

106
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,001
Oh, it's the kendo team.

107
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,034
Is it true you're
going to cheer for Kuno

108
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,367
from the Furinkan kendo team?

109
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,734
You're supposed to be
cheering for our team.

110
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,634
How could you do that to us?

111
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,234
Don't worry, boys.

112
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,201
I've brought you a present so
that you won't feel forgotten.

113
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,134
Here.

114
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,567
Help yourselves to
some sandwiches.

115
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,434
BOYS: Great!

116
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:52,267
[chatter]

117
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,334
BOY: I knew you still loved us.

118
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:53,967
All right.

119
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,301
Eat up now, boys.

120
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,101
[groan]

121
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:57,701
She poisoned our sandwiches.

122
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:59,301
Help me!

123
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,267
[chatter]

124
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:05,034
Mariko Konjo, today
you'll be cheering for me.

125
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,701
Oh, my blooming heart.

126
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,001
Oh, Kuno.

127
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,267
You've finally realized
how much I love you.

128
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:13,234
Up to your tricks,
as usual, Mariko?

129
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:15,501
You see, when
you're as good as me,

130
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,634
you only cheer for
the person you love.

131
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,634
That's what being a great
cheerleader is all about,

132
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,034
you know.

133
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,467
Think you can handle that?

134
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,901
I've taken care of anyone
who might get in Kuno's way.

135
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:31,467
Now it's just
between you and me!

136
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:32,867
Ha!

137
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:33,867
[grunts]

138
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:34,834
Yeah?

139
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,434
Two can play at this game!

140
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,267
[panting]

141
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,267
Look out, my pig-tailed girl.

142
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:39,934
[groan]

143
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,767
Stay out of this!

144
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:43,701
[gasp]

145
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,001
Now she's in trouble.

146
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:47,434
Check out how depressed
Kuno's gotten already.

147
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,834
She's gotta stop knocking
him around like that.

148
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,434
BOY: If it weren't
obvious already,

149
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:54,001
the pig-tailed girl
doesn't love Kuno at all.

150
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,667
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Come on, Kuno.

151
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,534
Snap out of it.

152
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,401
K-U-N-O!

153
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:00,001
He's the man.

154
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:02,701
Let's go!

155
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:03,667
Kuno!

156
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:05,467
My love will cheer you up!

157
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,334
Try this one on for size!

158
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,701
Huh?

159
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:13,834
Ha!

160
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,601
She's hiding
inside the pom-poms.

161
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:22,467
My rivals in love don't
stand a chance against Mariko.

162
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,401
[gasp]

163
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,001
She's hiding
inside the pom-poms

164
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,801
so you can't tell where
the kicks are coming from!

165
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:28,767
[groan]

166
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,567
MARIKO: Pom-pom fireworks
to celebrate my love!

167
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:35,267
Yeah!

168
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:35,967
I like it!

169
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:36,634
I like it!

170
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,901
[laughter]

171
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,767
Mariko's ridiculing
the pig-tailed girl

172
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,334
and cheering for Kuno.

173
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,267
That girl's got
some kind of talent.

174
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:45,634
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Oh, man.

175
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,701
How am I going to beat Mariko
when she obviously loves Kuno?

176
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,867
I still have a chance to win
this cheerleading competition.

177
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,367
But how?

178
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,701
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma,
there's one way you can win,

179
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:58,534
even if you don't love Kuno.

180
00:07:58,567 --> 00:07:59,134
Hm.

181
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:04,301
[laughter]

182
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,201
Kuno can't lose with
me cheering at his side.

183
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:09,801
Pig-tailed girl, you'd
better be careful,

184
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:13,334
or else Mariko will replace
you as the love of my life.

185
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,534
The love of your life, you say?

186
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,667
Want to bet?

187
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:19,067
BOY: There he goes again.

188
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:22,401
BOY: He's sinking into a
black hole of depression.

189
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:23,167
[gasp]

190
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:24,601
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

191
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:25,901
It's no use.

192
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:30,534
I'll never be able to
pretend I love Kuno.

193
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:31,367
What can I do?

194
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,501
What's the answer?

195
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,401
[cheers]

196
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:39,767
Contact.

197
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,334
One point.

198
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,701
Huh?

199
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:43,701
Oh, yeah.

200
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:44,934
The kendo match.

201
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,401
It was just too much
to keep track of.

202
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:48,167
Forgot about them.

203
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:49,834
Contact, one point.

204
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:52,167
Contact, one point.

205
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:56,301
Contact, one point.

206
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,301
[groan]

207
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:58,267
[sigh]

208
00:08:58,301 --> 00:08:59,834
MARIKO (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

209
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:02,367
I made sure the Seisyun kendo
team was out of the running.

210
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:08,401
Who is that masked man?

211
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:11,701
Next up from Furinkan
High is Tatewaki Kuno.

212
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,134
Come forward.

213
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,767
If Kuno loses, then Furinkan
loses the whole match.

214
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:16,901
Kuno, think happy thoughts!

215
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:19,467
We're counting on you!

216
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,201
[laughter]

217
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:21,467
Fear not, good people.

218
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,701
Anyone who dares
fight Tatewaki Kuno,

219
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:26,901
the blue thunder of Furinkan
High, is destined for defeat.

220
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,534
BOY: Yep, that's the
Kuno we know and love.

221
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,401
Begin!

222
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:35,901
I'll take care of my unworthy
opponent in mere seconds.

223
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:37,401
[laughter]

224
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:39,834
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
That guy from Seisyun

225
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,601
is keeping up with Kuno.

226
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,001
Not too bad.

227
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:45,167
[laughter]

228
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:48,901
No one attacks my beloved Kuno!

229
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,467
Baton cutter!

230
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,401
[gasp]

231
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,701
[chatter]

232
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:04,634
[laughter]

233
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,734
Just what do you
think you're doing?

234
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,967
Cheerleading's about love.

235
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,834
You said to be a
good cheerleader,

236
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,701
you needed to show your
love for the person.

237
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,167
What's your point?

238
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:18,467
You just helped a student
from Seisyun High.

239
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,434
I've decided I
love this guy here,

240
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,301
so that's who I'm
going to cheer for.

241
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,234
[chatter]

242
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,201
The pig-tailed
girl has declared

243
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:25,801
a love for the other guy.

244
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,701
Of course.

245
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,101
What a brilliant plan.

246
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:31,234
If Seisyun wins the kendo
match, then I win, too.

247
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:33,934
We'll see if you can live
up to your reputation.

248
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,934
I think it's time I
gave you a demonstration

249
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,867
of my unparalleled
cheerleading skills.

250
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:41,367
I love you!

251
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:41,849
Yeah!

252
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,234
I don't know who
you are, but you

253
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:50,501
filched my beloved pig-tailed
girl right from under my nose,

254
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,834
you villainous cad.

255
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:53,867
[growl]

256
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,434
You'll pay for this treachery!

257
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,434
[grunts]

258
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,834
K-U-N-O, Kuno!

259
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,434
Remember my love for you!

260
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,834
Baton cutter!

261
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,434
Here it comes.

262
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:09,834
Right back at you, baby!

263
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,834
Huh?

264
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,034
[groan]

265
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,434
Baton contact.

266
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,434
[gasp]

267
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:17,934
Oh!

268
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,201
Poor Kuno!

269
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:23,567
Bet you've never seen
anyone block a baton

270
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,034
attack like that before.

271
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,467
Your batons are powerless
against this cheerleader.

272
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:28,667
[groan]

273
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,234
Ugh!

274
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:30,801
Ha!

275
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:32,434
Let's test that!

276
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:36,567
We can do this all
day, if you want!

277
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:37,567
Ha.

278
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:39,334
Feast your eyes.

279
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:43,901
Here's a special attack
you'll never forget!

280
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:44,901
Huh?

281
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:46,067

00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:02,643
That's some extended baton.

286
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,943
Hm.

287
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,309
[coughing]

288
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,776
She got me that time.

289
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,143
S-T-O-P!

290
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:10,676
Stop!

291
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,158
Now!

See that?

295
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:20,643
That guy just saved
the pig-tailed girl.

296
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:23,309
Do you think he loves her back?

00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:40,176
Now try and get me!

I've got you this time.

307
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:54,043
Now I'll just finish you off,
you pitiful little vermin.

308
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,409
Baton cutter!

309
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:58,009
Not a chance, girlie!

The old bugle maneuver.

Those two make a pretty
good team, wouldn't you say?

[giggle]

00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:07,609
Now it's official.

316
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:10,076
You and I are head over
heels in love, partner.

Either somebody's blushing,
or his head's about to melt.

That's it!

321
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:19,043
I won't let you steal
my pig-tailed girl.

Catch!

[groan]

333
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:51,109
Unreal.

334
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:52,709
You're real clumsy, huh?

Oh, man, he's pretty touchy.

338
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:58,443
All she did was call him clumsy.

339
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:00,276
Who is he, anyway?

340
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:01,809
[laughter]

341
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,543
Having a little
trouble in paradise?

342
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:07,976
Do you really think you can
compete with my love for Kuno,

343
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:09,709
you pathetic fools?

344
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:10,643
Come on.

345
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:12,009
How in love can
you be considering

346
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:13,776
you've only known Kuno 10 days?

347
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:17,376
Hm.

348
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:18,609
What's this?

349
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:20,776
Her pom-poms have
turned into needles.

350
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,376
Pom-pom attack!

351
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:27,743
Huh?

352
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:28,709
[gasp]

353
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,676
[groan]

354
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:32,076
[gasp]

355
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:33,676
[groan]

356
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:35,643
Come on!

357
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:36,776
Get up!

358
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,609
If you stay down, I'll
lose the competition!

359
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:39,609
Are you OK?

360
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:40,176
I love you.

361
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,009
Do you hear me?

362
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,976
Snap out of it.

363
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:45,109
Do you really mean that, Ranma?

364
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:46,209
Do you?

365
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:47,209
[gasp]

366
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:48,709
Akane?

367
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:49,943
Thanks, Ranma.

368
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,076
Really.

369
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:52,943
BOY: So the kendo
guy from Seisyun

370
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,309
was actually Akane Tendo?

371
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,409
BOY: I had no idea.

372
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:57,976
Hey, wait just a second.

373
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,509
Didn't Akane Tendo call the
pig-tailed girl Ranma just now?

374
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:05,143
Why in the world would she
call the pig-tailed girl Ranma?

375
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:06,109
[grunt]

376
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:07,109
[gasp]

377
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:12,709
What the?

378
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:13,676
[gasp]

379
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:14,309
OK.

380
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:15,609
Now I'm confused.

381
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:18,143
BOY: The pig-tailed
girl turned into Ranma?

382
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,343
[gasp]

383
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:22,709
BOY: Now he's the
pig-tailed girl again.

384
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:23,543
[grunt]

385
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,576
BOY: So he's both-- two in one.

386
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,943
You know what this means?

387
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,509
[chatter]

388
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:33,309
Throughout the match, Ranma
kept saying that he loved her.

389
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:35,309
I mean, that she loved him.

390
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:37,343
He-- I mean, she was
trying to win Akane over

391
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:40,209
with some kind of special
love powers he has.

392
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,876
I mean, she has.

393
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:42,643
[gasp]

394
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,576
Snap out of it.

395
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,043
There's no time
to be embarrassed.

396
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:48,009
Do you want to lose the martial
arts cheerleading match?

397
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:49,209
Uh.

398
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:51,109
So the mysterious
Seisyun kendo man

399
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:54,076
is actually that loser floozy
from the volleyball game.

400
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,543
This time I'm here to win!

401
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,076
[groan]

402
00:15:57,109 --> 00:15:57,909
BOY: Uh oh.

403
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,576
Kuno's back up.

404
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:00,543
Ah!

405
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:01,843
If it isn't my
beloved Akane Tendo.

406
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:05,276
You've come to cheer
for me, too, dear Akane.

407
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:06,176
[groan]

408
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:07,643
Not!

409
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,043
[groan]

410
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:12,209
You got this
straight, don't you?

411
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:13,776
What do you mean?

412
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,076
I mean, the reason I'm doing
this is to win the martial arts

413
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,643
cheerleading match.

414
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,143
Yeah, because you wanted to
prove how much I mean to you.

415
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:20,776
Hm?

416
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:21,743
[groan]

417
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:23,643
[gasp]

418
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,876
Huh?

419
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:27,176
You're right, Akane.

420
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:29,176
This is no time to be
feeling embarrassed.

421
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,009
Yeah, that's the spirit, Ranma.

422
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:31,909
Look.

423
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:33,043
Ranma's back in action.

424
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,143
So he's admitted
he loves Akane then.

425
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:36,576
No, no, no, nuh-uh.

426
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:37,543
No, no.

427
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:38,543
Ranma!

428
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:39,509
Ha!

429
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:40,309
Here!

430
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:42,843
Get a load of my love cheer!

431
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,809
Ranma!

432
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:46,176
Ha.

433
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,909
Ranma joined the competition
to prove his feelings for me.

434
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:51,609
And if you think I'm going to
stand by and watch him lose,

435
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,176
you've got another
thing coming, girlie.

436
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:55,276
[laughter]

437
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:57,043
Whatever you say.

438
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:58,609
[fighting sounds]

439
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:05,909
Atta girl, Akane Tendo.

440
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,509
Give me a cheer.

441
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,276
[groan]

442
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,043
Good work, my dear Kuno!

443
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:14,809
Now I'll finish you off
with my Super Baton Crusher!

444
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:15,284
[gasp]

445
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,250
Oh, no!

446
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:17,417
Look out, Akane!

447
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,150
[gasp]

448
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,850
Huh?

449
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:31,250
What?

450
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,817
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this, but--

451
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,817
Kuno, sweetie,
I'm here for you!

452
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,917
Come to me, Akane Tendo!

453
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,117
Oh, I'm coming!

454
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,117
With my lucky love kick!

455
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:47,084
[gasp]

456
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:52,617
Kuno, darling, are you OK?

457
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,984
[crying]

458
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:55,984
I can't believe you'd chase
after another girl like that.

459
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:57,150
Right in front of me.

460
00:17:57,184 --> 00:18:00,050
Oh, Kuno, how could you?

461
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:01,584
Wow.

462
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,984
Looks to me like Mariko's
pretty much gotten over Kuno.

463
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:04,884
Yeah.

464
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,684
And who could blame her?

465
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:07,617
Oh, Kuno.

466
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,984
I love a man who
plays hard to get.

467
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:10,850
[groan]

468
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,617
Kuno's down for the count,
which goes to prove my point.

469
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,117
He doesn't love
you, Mariko Konjo.

470
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,250
You've lost the match.

471
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:19,684
[laughter]

472
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,550
You just don't get it, do you?

473
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:26,450
You have no idea how fierce
we cheerleaders can be.

474
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,550
Come on, gals!

475
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:32,317
[groan]

476
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,517
[gasp]

477
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:35,917
One, two, heave!

478
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,917
[gasp]

479
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,284
Love is in the air today!

480
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:41,284
Invincible!

481
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,884
Love Baton Attack!

482
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,484
[groan]

483
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:49,650
I can't see where the
batons are coming from.

484
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:52,250
She's hiding behind Kuno.

485
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,850
[scream]

486
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,217
[gasp]

487
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,350
OK.

488
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:05,184
Now finish her
off, Kuno darling.

489
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:06,784
Come on, Ranma!

490
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:07,350
Ranma!

491
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:08,484
Wake up, Ranma!

492
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:10,184
Hurry! [inaudible]
needs your help!

493
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:10,884
Come on!

494
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,184
[chatter]

495
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,750
No, no, no, no.

496
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:14,225
Ah.

497
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:14,791
No.

498
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:15,266
Huh?

499
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,399
Akane!

500
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:17,432
Now you will
taste the true fury

501
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:21,232
of martial arts cheerleading!

502
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:22,199
[scream]

503
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:25,199
Ranma!

504
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,999
Akane!

505
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,166
Your cheering days are
over, you ditsy little tart!

506
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,166
[gasp]

507
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,732
[chatter]

508
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:43,732
[gasp]

509
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,299
No!

510
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:46,132
My darling Kuno!

511
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,099
Hey, look!

512
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,099
Kuno's down and out.

513
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:50,832
Floor plant for one point.

514
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:51,466
[gasp]

515
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:52,632
[chatter]

516
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,866
The match has gone to Ranma!

517
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,232
[cheers]

518
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,599
Thanks for everything, Ranma.

519
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:04,266
I don't know why you
felt you had to butt in.

520
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:05,866
I was doing just
fine without you.

521
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,699
That's if you consider
being passed out doing fine.

522
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:12,032
I won this competition because
of my awesome cheerleading

523
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:12,866
skills!

524
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:13,632
What do you mean?

525
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,866
You were totally pathetic!

526
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,999
You're just jealous
of my new talent!

527
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,232
You wish I was jealous!

528
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,732
You stink!

529
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,066
RANMA: If you weren't such
a crummy volleyball player,

530
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,032
he wouldn't even be here.

531
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:23,999
[crying]

532
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:25,366
I've lost.

533
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,332
[groan]

534
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,699
I'm undone.

535
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:30,799
The love you two have
is stronger than ours.

536
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:31,832
Huh?

537
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,866
L-O-V-E. She loves
you, don't you see?

538
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:35,399
Hey, come on.

539
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:36,366
Not so loud.

540
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:37,332
Jeez, pipe down, will you?

541
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,599
Don't try to deny it now.

542
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:41,199
She said she loves
Akane, didn't she?

543
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:42,232
Sure did.

544
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,232
Hey, you heard it, didn't you?

545
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:44,799
You betcha!

546
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:45,799
[laughter]

547
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:47,199
[chatter]

548
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:48,273
No!

549
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:49,140
No!

550
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:50,307
You've got it all wrong!

551
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,207
It was just part
of the competition!

552
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,807
[chatter]

553
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:55,740
Oh, sweet Kuno.

554
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:59,573
It's time that I, Mariko,
made my quiet exit.

555
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:01,407
Farewell, my dear Kuno.

556
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,873
[crying]

557
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:04,973
Don't be sad.

558
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,607
Don't be down.

559
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,873
Mariko looks bad in a frown.

560
00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:09,773
Go Mariko.

561
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:14,940
[chatter]

562
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:19,173
You won't believe it.

563
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,307
Ranma announced to the whole
crowd that he loved Akane.

564
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,207
No!

565
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,407
You can't be serious!

566
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,307
It said that a rumor
lasts only 75 days.

567
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,773
So only 74 days to go.

568
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,002
[music playing]

569
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,477
GIRL (VOICEOVER): A
family trip to the beach

570
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:21,511
turns into a huge gathering with
Shampoo, Mousse, Ukyo, Kuno,

571
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:24,644
Ryoga, ghost cat,
and even Tsubasa.

572
00:23:24,677 --> 00:23:28,077
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Battle for Miss Beachside.

573
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:29,444
We'll see you there.
