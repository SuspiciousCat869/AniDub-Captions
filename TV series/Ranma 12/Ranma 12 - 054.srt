RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
Oh Akane, why can I

3
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,869
never express my
true feelings to you?

4
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,669
Why must I constantly
be running away?

5
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,936
Can it be you've no idea
what kinds of thoughts

6
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:06,236
run through my mind
when we're together?

7
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:11,669
I think a little time apart
from you is all I really need.

8
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:12,736
-No way.

9
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:13,736
-Hey, would I make
something like that up?

10
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,436
-Knowing you, Saiyuri,
you just might.

11
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:16,136
-Ryoga!

12
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:17,969
What are you doing here?

13
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,869
Where have you been?

14
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,069
You've been out of town
for practically forever.

15
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:31,636
-Akane I-- I. Ah!

16
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,403
Why can't I--

17
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:34,944
-Hm.

18
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:40,669
NARRATOR: The Ultimate Team Up?

19
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:41,769
The Ryoga-Mousse Alliance.

20
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:55,436
-Great.

21
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,936
I came back to town and
didn't even realize it.

22
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:00,269
Huh?

23
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:01,269
Who's there?

24
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:02,003
Who is it?

25
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,169
How dare you set an
ambush for Ryoga Hibiki!

26
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,236
-Look down, look round.

27
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:23,869
If you're dumb enough
to fall for that,

28
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,736
I guess I must've misjudged you.

29
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:27,869
And here I thought
Ryoga Hibiki was

30
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,169
someone to be reckoned with.

31
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,936
-Who are you?

32
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:35,636
-For now, you may think of
me as the man from Ganymede.

33
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:36,869
-Give me a break.

34
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:41,103
Do I look like I just
fell off the turnip truck?

35
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:42,136
-I take it back.

36
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:44,436
You really are the
famous Ryoga Hibiki.

37
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:47,403
If nothing else, Ranma Saotome's
enemies are never weaklings.

38
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:56,903
-See you tomorrow!

39
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,236
Huh?

40
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,603
Is that Pi-chan?

41
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,503
You're Mousse, aren't you?

42
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,736
Why are you picking
on my poor Pi-chan?

43
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,936
My poor wittle baby.

44
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,636
Where have you been
all this time, huh?

45
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,036
Did that big bully hurt you?

46
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,003
-Come here, you.

47
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:25,269
Now cut it out, you two.

48
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:28,236
No kissy face in public.

49
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:29,369
-Stop it!

50
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:32,469
Pi-chan isn't some toy
for you to play with.

51
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:33,403
Oh, yeah.

52
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,136
Weren't we going
to play dress up?

53
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,536
You'd look so cute in blue.

54
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,236
Out of my way!

55
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:38,969
-Uncute!

56
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:39,536
Uncute!

57
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:40,169
She's so uncute!

58
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:49,469
-I guess I cut the pattern
a little too small.

59
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:53,436
Don't wear it if
you don't like it.

60
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,769
So you do like it, then?

61
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,636
I'm so glad.

62
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:59,303
Hey, were you listening?

63
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:01,269
I think Ranma is jealous.

64
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:04,436
Why else would he have said
that playing kissy face?

65
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:05,769
Imagine, being jealous of a pig.

[squeal]

67
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,936
-Pi-chan, where are you going?

68
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:27,103
-Ranma, I hate you!

69
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:28,703
-Yeah, so?

70
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:31,036
So now what have I done?

71
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:31,769
-Pi-chan?

72
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:32,903
Where are you?

73
00:06:33,003 --> 00:06:35,103
RYOGA: Hey, if you want
a fight, you've got one!

74
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:36,069
Come here!

75
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:37,969
-Ranma, fighting
with Ryoga is wrong.

76
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,369
-So blame him!

77
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:40,403
-Why should I?

78
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:41,603
I know it must be your fault.

79
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:43,569
It's always your fault.

80
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,203
-Excuse me?

81
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:48,469
You are so, so, so uncutr!

82
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:49,603
-Oh, really?

83
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:51,869
Guess there's nothing to
be jealous about, then.

84
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,803
-And who said I
was jealous, huh?

85
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:57,303
Argh!

86
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:58,203
Why, you--

87
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,169
-Hey, Akane?

88
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:02,836
This is goodbye.

89
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:06,469
-Huh?

90
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,503
But Ryoga, do you
have to leave so soon?

91
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:10,603
-You know I'll never leave.

92
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:12,869
I just-- I--

93
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,169
-What the-- Ryoga, wait up!

94
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:19,436
Come on, Ryoga, wait up!

95
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:20,569
What's the matter with you?

96
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,569
You're acting so weird.

Ryoga!

98
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:24,169
What is it?

99
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,036
Something you ate, or what?

100
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:27,003
-Back off!

101
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:27,969
-Ha!

102
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,103
Now that's the
Ryoga Hibiki I know.

103
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:30,769
-You don't know me.

104
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:33,069
Maybe you did once, but we're
hardly those little kids

105
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,736
anymore, are we, Ranma?

106
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,636
Goodbye.

107
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:38,936
-Don't go.

00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,336
Ryoga.

109
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:40,918
Ryoga!

00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:44,844
Ryoga.

111
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:56,803
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Oh, Akane.

112
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:59,269
This is it, the choice
I've been afraid to make.

113
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,269
No matter what I
do or say, you're

114
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:03,469
going to love me
the way I love you.

115
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,136
There's only one way the
two of us can be together.

116
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:10,936
Even if it has to be a pig.

117
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:14,569
Farewell, Ryoga Hibiki.

118
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:15,769
-Not so fast.

119
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,636
-Who are you?

120
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:18,669
-My name is Mousse.

121
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:19,869
I'm sorry about before.

122
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,303
I didn't know if
I could trust you.

123
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:22,936
No hard feelings, all right?

124
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,736
-You mean it was a test?

125
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:28,669
-I figure if we work together,
defeating Ranma should be easy.

126
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:31,036
What do you say we team up?

127
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,403
-Mousse, was it?

128
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:34,836
You wouldn't happen to have
a grudge against Ranma,

129
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:36,236
would you?

130
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:39,703
-Boy, do I. Not only is he
trying to steal Shampoo away

131
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:42,703
from me, he also lured me
to that cursed [inaudible]

132
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:46,536
spring in China that
turns people into ducks.

133
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:47,803
-Gee, that's too bad.

134
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,469
But you'll have to get
revenge on Ranma by yourself.

135
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:54,069
Akane's the only
one I care about.

136
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,769
-Well, I can understand that.

137
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,569
But what are you going to
do once Ranma and Akane are

138
00:08:58,669 --> 00:08:59,769
finally married?

139
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:02,269
Be their pet?

140
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:03,903
-Hey, I can think
of worse things.

141
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:11,636
-What a good pig.

142
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:14,469
-Well, at least that way
we'd still be together.

143
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:15,303
-Oh, sure.

144
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:17,403
You'd be together, all right.

145
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,636
Just one big, happy family.

146
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:23,003
You and her, and Ranma, and
whatever kids the two of them

147
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,136
have.

148
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:25,969
-Kids?

149
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,736
-OK, darling, now say ah.

150
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:37,303
[crying]

151
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,303
-You made my baby cry!

152
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:40,469
-Gluttonous little swine.

153
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,336
All he ever does it eat
us out of house and home.

154
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:46,536
Honey, how would you
feel about a cat?

155
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:47,336
-Sounds good.

156
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:03,436
[squealing]

157
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,969
-That insensitive jerk.

158
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:12,869
And after everything I've gone
and done for that family too.

159
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:15,936
Just think of all the money
I've saved them on babysitters!

160
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:17,436
It's all Ranma's fault!

161
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,503
-I knew that you'd see things
my way sooner or later.

162
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:27,103
Ranma, this time I'll
get you for sure.

163
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,103
AKANE: I knew Pi-chan was
acting strange yesterday.

164
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:42,469
I shouldn't have let
him run away like that.

165
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,136
I'm gonna go and look for him.

166
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:45,969
-Ah, leave to leave
the runt alone.

167
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,836
He'll come back sooner or later.

168
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,669
-How can you be so cold, Ranma?

169
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:53,303
My poor little Pi-chan's
got feelings too, you know.

170
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,936
Hmph.

171
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:56,603
-Ugh.

172
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:59,303
I'll bet he's just
trying to get attention.

173
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:01,436
Then again, he was
acting pretty weird

174
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,436
when I talked to
him the other day.

175
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,236
-Well, maybe you
knew me once, Ranma,

176
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:08,269
but we're hardly those
little kids anymore.

177
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,069
Goodbye.

178
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:10,903
-Oh geez.

179
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,369
I guess I gotta go look for him.

180
00:11:14,469 --> 00:11:15,436
-Pi-chan!

181
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:17,569
Oh, please don't be angry.

182
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:19,303
Pi-chan!

183
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:19,869
Pi-chan!

184
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,436
Where are you?

185
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:24,236
-Ryoga!

186
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:26,169
There he is.

187
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,003
Hey Ryoga, it's me!

188
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:31,469
[squealing]

189
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:32,369
-Come on, man.

190
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:33,936
Wait. up!

191
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:35,869
Don't worry, I ain't
gonna pick a fight.

192
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,836
And calm down, will you?

193
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:39,769
Hey, what's the matter?

194
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:40,736
You catch a cold?

195
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:41,969
Your voice sounds weird.

196
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,436
RYOGA: Not as weird
as you're gonna

197
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,336
sound when I'm through with you.

198
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:46,269
-Huh?

199
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:46,810
-Hm.

200
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,503
-What'd you do that for?

201
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:54,044
Huh?

202
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:54,636
Hey!

203
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:55,269
What do you know?

204
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:56,603
It was a real pig.

205
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:59,369
What are you up to?

206
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,736
Mousse?

207
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,769
-If you turn him into a girl
first, he'll be less powerful.

208
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,003
Let's face it.

209
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:07,503
With your superior strength
and my superior tactics,

210
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,403
the two of us are invincible.

211
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:10,669
-Oh, I get it.

212
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,403
You two are in
cahoots, ain't you?

213
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:14,236
But there's one
thing I don't get.

214
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:16,969
Ryoga, since when did
you become so pathetic?

215
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,103
-Pathetic?

216
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,569
I'm not the one who made
a pet into a babysitter.

217
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:23,669
I'm not the one who threw a
poor little pig in the trash.

218
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:26,936
Ranma, the one who's
pathetic is you, not me!

219
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,903
Think of your son, damn you!

220
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:30,403
-What are you talking about?

221
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:31,069
-Enough talking.

222
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:31,903
Let's fight!

223
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:33,136
-All righty, then!

224
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,269
Good.

225
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,336
Now we're finally back
in familiar territory.

226
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,403
But before we fight, there's
something you should know.

227
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:41,269
Sure, my power may go
down when I'm a girl,

228
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,903
but have you forgotten
how fast I get?

229
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:44,836
-Fast, smast!

230
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,369
Either way, you're
still gonna die!

231
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:48,336
Ranma!

232
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:49,169
-What?

233
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,136
-Look up, look down, look round.

234
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,569
-Look at this!

235
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:54,110
-Ranma!

236
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,310
-Hey!

237
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,877
That's no fair!

238
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,877
-If you pin down
his arms and legs,

239
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:36,444
his so-called superior
speed becomes a moot issue.

240
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:38,477
Ryoga, now it's your turn.

241
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,310
-Now you listen to me.

242
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,710
You'll never abuse
your pet again.

243
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,244
Not if I have anything
to do with it!

244
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,810
Rest in pieces, Saotome.

245
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,351
Huh?

246
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:58,744
-This your way of trying to tell
me you wanna be my plaything?

247
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:00,077
-Put your clothes on!

248
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:00,977
-Huh?

249
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:02,410
Oh yeah, sorry.

250
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,177
OK, you can look now.

251
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:04,718
-Right.

252
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,077
Here I go!

253
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:08,044
Ranma!

254
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:08,977
That's no fair!

255
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:10,110
Don't you have any modesty?

256
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,477
What kind of girl are you?

257
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:13,810
RANMA: OK, I'm ready.

258
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,244
-You sure this time?

259
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:17,877
You're absolutely,
positively sure?

260
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:20,844
RANMA: Would you look already?

261
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,877
Now do you know what
kind of girl I am?

262
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:24,844
Mousse.

263
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,744
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself,

264
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:28,577
using poor Ryoga like that.

265
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:30,377
I'm gonna make you sorry!

266
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,810
Gee, what's the matter?

267
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,277
I move around too much for you?

268
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,877
-You just read my mind.

269
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:46,544
Well, well.

270
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:49,344
Now you can't use any of
your fancy techniques.

271
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:50,010
RANMA: Why you!

272
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,810
-Ryoga, finish him.

273
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,577
-Even without my hands, my
legs are more than enough.

274
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,777
And here I thought my
hands were out of action.

275
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:07,644
This chain's an even better
weapon than I thought.

276
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:08,210
Thanks.

277
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,244
I owe you one.

278
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:11,144
-Hey, quit that.

279
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,277
No fair using my own
weapons against me, OK?

280
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:23,944
-You couldn't have
been hiding this!

281
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:25,310
It's too big!

282
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,744
-I'm not called the master of
hidden weapons for nothing.

283
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,677
Take this!

284
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:30,644
-No, Ranma.

285
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:31,610
Take this!

286
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:39,844
-Now you've really made me mad.

287
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:44,777
Ah!

288
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,877
-Ah!

289
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:47,510
B--but I thought you
were weaker as a girl.

290
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,544
-You never heard of adrenaline?

291
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,844
Eat it!

292
00:15:50,944 --> 00:15:53,544
-You caught me by surprise
last time, that's all.

293
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:56,977
Let's see you deal with a
Baksai Tenketsu breaking point.

294
00:15:57,077 --> 00:15:58,610
-Run for it, Ryoga!

295
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,277
That cannon ball you're standing
next to is really a time bomb.

296
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,877
It's gonna blow, run!

297
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:08,377
-It's heavy.

298
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:10,877
Somebody help me!

299
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:12,877
Hey, come on!

300
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,177
You stupid scaredy cats.

301
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:18,110
Oh no you don't!

302
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,110
RYOGA: Why you little--

303
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,144
-No fair.

304
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:21,177
You can't use my own
chain against me.

305
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:21,910
RYOGA: Let go!

306
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,210
Come on!

307
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,410
-Time to reel you in!

308
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,544
So tell me.

309
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:29,510
Do you wanna find that
key or do you wanna die?

310
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,044
-Find it.

311
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:32,010
I wanna find it.

312
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,577
Um.

313
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:34,710
It's gone!

314
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,144
-What do you mean, it's gone?

315
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:38,210
-Look harder, idiot!

316
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,210
-That tickles!

317
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,144
-I found it!

318
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,944
Gee.

319
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,877
That was close.

320
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:54,810
AKANE: [inaudible]!

321
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,277
Where are you?

322
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,244
-Akane.

323
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:58,277
Akane!

324
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:00,010
AKANE: Oh, Pi-chan,
where can you be?

325
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,310
Pi-chan!

326
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,277
-No, Akane!

327
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:04,677
-Akane, run!

328
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:05,677
Akane, don't go near it!

329
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:06,410
-It's gonna blow!

330
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:06,951
-Ranma.

331
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,910
And Ryoga!

332
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,210
-Akane, run!

333
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,044
-Huh?

334
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,477
-Just shut up and come with me.

335
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:12,044
-Why?

336
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:12,592
Why should I?

337
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:20,844
A bomb?

338
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,644
I don't have time for jokes.

339
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:24,844
I'm worried about
my poor Pi-chan.

340
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:25,677
-Forget Pi-chan!

341
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:26,444
We gotta go!

342
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:27,310
-I don't wanna!

343
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,144
-Akane, Pi-chan's fine.

344
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:30,310
-Why should I believe you?

345
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,277
-He's fine, I tell you.

346
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:33,277
Just fine!

347
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:34,610
But-- But I--

348
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,377
-Why do you gotta
be so darn stubborn?

349
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:38,144
What did you say?

350
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:40,544
-Stubborn as a mule, twice
as ugly, just as strong!

351
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,810
-I don't have to stay here
and take this kind of abuse

352
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,077
from you!

353
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:45,044
That's it.

354
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:46,510
I'm going home!

355
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:58,344
-They weren't kidding.

356
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,377
-Maybe even stubborner.

[groaning]

358
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,010
-I was an idiot to team
up with Mousse like that.

359
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,877
If anything had
happened to Akane,

360
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,344
I would have never been
able to forgive myself.

361
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,377
-Ah, don't be so
hard on yourself.

362
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:22,310
Mules like her ain't
exactly helpless, you know.

363
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,377
Course, they ain't exactly
marriage material either.

364
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:28,977
-I thought you and Akane
were supposed to be engaged.

365
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:30,344
-I am.

366
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,344
That is, at least until I can
figure out how to dump her.

367
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:34,377
What's it to you, anyway?

368
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,810
-Ranma!

369
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,910
You better be good to
her, or so help me, I'll--

370
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,977
-Ah huh?

371
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:46,810
-Or so help me, I'll
make you regret it.

372
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,510
I-- I think this is the
point where you and I should

373
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,010
say goodbye to each other.

374
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,944
-Ever since yesterday, you've
been acting really weird.

375
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:56,077
What's wrong?

376
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,310
-I should have done
this a long time ago.

377
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,610
Farewell, Ranma.

378
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,677
Farewell Ryoga Hibiki!

379
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,777
-What the heck are
yo-- Ryoga, what

380
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,477
are you turning
yourself into a pig for?

381
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:17,677
-Ranma, look.

382
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,144
It's Pi-chan.

383
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:20,277
He's come home.

384
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:24,244
Look at you.

385
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:25,577
You're soaking wet.

386
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:28,944
Ranma, you were bullying
him again, weren't you?

387
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:29,644
-Oh no.

388
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,077
Don't look at me, no.

389
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:32,110
-Grow up, will you?

390
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,477
You just forget about him.

391
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:36,410
You and me are gonna
take a bath, right?

392
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,210
-Bath?

393
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,510
Together?

394
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,810
-Oh yes.

395
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,777
I'll help scrub your back
if you'll help me with mine.

396
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,077
Oh wow, Pi-chan.

397
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:44,077
I don't believe it.

398
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:47,010
Are you blushing?

399
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,477
-Wait a minute, Akane.

400
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:51,444
What are you and Ryoga
planning on doing in there?

401
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,144
-Ryoga?

402
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:54,377
What are you talking about?

403
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:55,144
-Nothing!

404
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:56,344
I'm talking about nothing.

405
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:58,677
So that's what you
were up to, huh, you

406
00:19:58,777 --> 00:19:59,644
shameless little swine.

you're jealous again, Ranma.

409
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:07,010
What a big silly he is.

410
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,677

Come back!

414
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,744
Ugh.

415
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,677
Ranma, this is all your fault.

416
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:18,644
How dare you embarrass
Pi-chan like that?

417
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:20,310
-Wait up, you little runt!

418
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,744
-And don't you
think for a minute

419
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,610
that I don't know what
you're up to, either!

420
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,377
-Come back here, Ryoga!

421
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:32,344
Admit it, your goal was to
take a bath with her all along.

422
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:33,610
-You're wrong!

423
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,177
The hot water would only
turn me back to a guy anyway.

424
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,810
Besides, if Akane
ever saw me naked,

425
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,044
I'd-- I'd-- I'd-- I'd-- I'd--

426
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,277
-So you do admit it!

427
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:41,210
RYOGA: I'd die!

428
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,310
-You wanted her
to see you naked!

429
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,277
-I told you, I did not!

430

-Don't you lie to me!

431
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:48,910
Like I should believe some
pervert who turns into a pig!

-Who are you calling
a pervert, pervert?

I wouldn't talk if I were you.

You don't see me flashing my
chest to win a fight, do you?
