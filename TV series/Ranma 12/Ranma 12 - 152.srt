AKANE (VOICEOVER): The Daimonji
School of Martial Arts Tea

3
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:43,095
Ceremony-- the
elders, Matsu, Take,

4
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:45,662
and Ume, and their
successor Sentaro.

5
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:48,428
The Miyako Oji School of
Martial Arts Tea Ceremony--

6
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:53,195
the elders, Ino, Shika, and Cho,
and their successor Satsuki.

7
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:55,062
Sentaro and Satsuki
fell in love and it

8
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,562
seemed their
marriage would bring

9
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:58,462
the Orthodox and the
Unorthodox School

10
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:02,062
together to make
everything all right.

11
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:03,962
I'll just take this
opportunity to point out

12
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,562
this has nothing to do with me.

13
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,862
Quit staring and get
me off this thing!

AKANE (VOICEOVER): Battle
for the golden tea set.

15
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:14,344
Bingo.

16
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:17,528
Come on, Tendo.

17
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:18,795
That wasn't fair.

18
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:20,062
Take it back and give
me another chance.

19
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:21,228
No, sir.

20
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:22,828
You've used up your
chances already, Saotome.

21
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,528
Hey, Kasumi.

22
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,628
Bring some tea.

23
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:28,328
KASUMI: Coming.

24
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:32,862
Thanks, dear.

25
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,728
I'll leave it right over here.

26
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,262
How do you find the tea?

27
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:41,262
Like it?

28
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:45,228
Here's your tea.

29
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:46,095
Right.

30
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,362
Thank you very much.

31
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:49,928
Oh dear.

32
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,028
You should think about changing
dishwashing liquids, Kasumi.

33
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:55,762
TENDO: We've got witches!

34
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:56,528
SAOTOME: Witches!

35
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:57,495
Help me!

36
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:58,095
Hmm?

37
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:02,595
We're looking
for Ranma Saotome.

38
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:04,962
Would you kindly
bring him out to us?

39
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:06,395
Please?

40
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:07,995
TENDO: Ranma!

41
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:12,295
SAOTOME: Your friends
are here to see you.

42
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,528
Those are my friends?

43
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:15,828
Hello.

44
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,028
You're the three elders
of martial arts tea.

45
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,328
Matsu.

46
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:22,195
Take.

47
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:23,695
Ume.

48
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:26,162
We're the elders of the
Daimonji School of Martial Arts

49
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,428
Tea Ceremony.

50
00:03:28,462 --> 00:03:29,562
Huh?

51
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,162
Ranma?

52
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,962
Hey, I dunno why they're here,
but I'm not getting involved.

53
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,328
We three elders of
the Orthodox school

54
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:37,628
have a favor to ask of Ranma.

55
00:03:37,662 --> 00:03:39,962
Hey, do I look like a
charity here or what?

56
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:43,028
It's a serious matter for we
three elders of the Orthodox

57
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:44,295
School.

58
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:46,595
Man, nothing good ever happens
to me when they show up.

59
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:47,962
Yeah, but the
least you could do

60
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,095
is ask them what
they want from you.

61
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:50,695
Ranma!

62
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:57,995
The Orthodox School is here.

63
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:58,562
Pathetic.

64
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,162
No self respect.

65
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:05,228
And no manners when it
comes to asking for a favor.

66
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:06,928
The Unorthodox School!

67
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:10,862
Miyako Oji School of
Martial Arts Tea Ceremony.

68
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:11,595
Ino.

69
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:12,295
Shika.

70
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,162
Cho.

71
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:13,895
Huh?

72
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:14,695
Oh no.

73
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,828
My troubles just doubled.

74
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:19,395
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

75
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,862
There's nothing to
be worried about.

76
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:27,462
We'll take care
of Ranma Saotome.

77
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:28,762
We'll take care of the boy.

78
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:30,728
We couldn't allow such a thing.

79
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:32,695
This matter is between we three.

80
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:35,528
There's no need for
you to interfere.

81
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:38,895
Something tells me trouble's
brewing down on the homefront.

82
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,628
Who we gonna call?

83
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:13,728
Witchbusters?

84
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:15,295
INO: Don't interfere.

85
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,495
CHO: Ranma belongs to us.

86
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:17,962
MATSU: We three got here first.

87
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:18,662
He's ours!

88
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:20,195
INO: You depend on us.

89
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:21,095
Hand him over.

90
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:22,428
MATSU: You depend on us.

91
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:23,595
CHO: You're being selfish.

92
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,928
This is getting
way out of control.

93
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:27,995
Ranma, you've gotta
say something to 'em.

94
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:28,795
Ranma!

95
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,262
TENDO: Ranma, do something!

96
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:33,595
Ranma!

97
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:34,295
All right.

98
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:35,528
I'm going.

99
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:37,095
I'm going!

100
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,295
Oh my.

101
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:39,962
I can't remember the last
time we had a tea party.

102
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:43,195
I certainly hope they brought
some cakes or something.

103
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:44,795
[gong chimes]

104
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,528
Nabiki, what are you doing?

105
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:00,428
Hey, this cake's
not too shabby.

106
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:09,228
All right.

107
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,328
How about we get down to
business and you tell me

108
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:11,228
what this is all about?

109
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,362
I haven't got all day.

110
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,128
Great things are
not born of haste.

111
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:15,195
Huh?

112
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,262
The guests must be
served before all else.

113
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,495
It's the way of tea ceremony.

114
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:20,795
Come on.

115
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:22,628
That's what I don't
like about their school.

116
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,395
They're always so
hung up on rules.

117
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:26,428
They're rude and
completely oblivious

118
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:27,495
to their guests' feelings.

119
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:28,562
MATSU: Pardon me.

120
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:30,195
INO: Pardon we three.

121
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:33,495
CHO: Our school has rules and
we three must observe them.

122
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:35,062
This tea is delicious.

123
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:35,862
Thank you.

124
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,362
How impertinent, young lady.

125
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,195
Don't gulp it down like a soda.

126
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,195
There are rules for
drinking it properly.

127
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:42,395
I'm terribly sorry.

128
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:44,328
Satsuki told me to
feel at home, so I

129
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,128
suppose I forgot my manners.

130
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:46,828
Satsuki said that?

131
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:48,328
I didn't hear her speak.

132
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:49,228
You did.

133
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:49,928
Right, Satsuki?

134
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,195
Satsuki, don't make
me laugh so hard.

135
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:57,628
How can she hear her?

136
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:00,595
They must both be using ESP.

137
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,062
What the heck is
this all about?

138
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:03,562
And now they say
they're gonna get

139
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:04,962
Sentaro to tell me everything.

140
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,562
Why didn't they
just get him to talk

141
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:07,862
to me right from the start?

142
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,762
Speaking of Sentaro,
it's been a long time

143
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,362
since we've seen him.

144
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:14,362
It has been a long time.

145
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:15,695
Quit sneaking up like that!

146
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:16,895
No anger, please, Ranma.

147
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:18,362
It's such a negative thing.

148
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:19,628
I've had enough of this place.

149
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:21,062
I'm splitting.

150
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:21,695
No!

151
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:22,995
Please, come back.

152
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,328
This time it really
is a serious problem.

153
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,062
I promise!

154
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:36,262
Ranma, at least listen
to them, won't you?

155
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:37,862
O my sweet Akane.

156
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,428
I knew you'd understand.

157
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,195
You're so soft
and you smell so--

158
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,762
I bet Satsuki would
want to hear about that!

159
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,328
Some things never change.

160
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,995
Ranma, I'm picking up
negative vibes coming from you.

161
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,895
Can't you just get
down to business

162
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:59,095
and tell me what
this is all about?

163
00:07:59,128 --> 00:07:59,569
Huh?

164
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:02,095
Huh?

165
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:02,895
Hmm.

166
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:04,695
It all began three days ago.

167
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:09,528
I found this letter shoved
under the door to my room.

168
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:11,328
What's this supposed to say?

169
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:12,762
It looks like a poem.

170
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:14,995
It's so flowery I
can't read what it says.

171
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:15,562
OK.

172
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,395
Enough suspense.

173
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:16,862
What does it say?

174
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:22,728
On a full moon night,
the [? enishi ?] teapot

175
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:23,628
will take flight.

176
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:25,128
Signed, Toko Otome.

177
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:29,762
teapot will take flight?

178
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:31,895
What's an [? enishi ?] teapot?

179
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,662
What does Toko Otome mean?

180
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:36,028
Toko Otome is a
traditional nickname

181
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:40,262
taken by a woman whose legendary
youth and beauty are eternal.

182
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:43,628
The teapot of [? enishi ?]
is a genuine golden teapot.

183
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:47,362
And a treasure passed down
in the Daimonji Family.

184
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:50,062
Genuine gold, you say?

185
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:53,028
In the wedding ceremony
of the Daimonji Family,

186
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:55,628
it's our tradition to
offer tea to the bride

187
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,628
with the golden pot.

188
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,162
In other words, that
letter is a declaration

189
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:02,962
of someone's intent to steal
our sacred [? enishi ?] teapot!

190
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:11,662
Hey, Satsuki, isn't
this sort of exciting?

191
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,928
If you're serious, then
start acting the part!

192
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,528
Listen, Ranma, Akane too.

193
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,128
You've got to help them.

194
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,628
They can't have their wedding
if the golden teapot is missing.

195
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:28,795
Yeah, I could care
less about Sentaro,

196
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:30,995
but think how poor
Satsuki must feel.

197
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,495
O Akane, Satsuki and i
will wed, but fear not.

198
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:35,828
My love for you will never--

199
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:37,028
Hey!

200
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:37,862
Oh my.

201
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,395
That's not very ladylike, Akane.

202
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:45,495
Tonight, the moon will
be full and Toko Otome

203
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:48,362
will come to steal
our golden teapot.

204
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:50,095
I'm scared.

205
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,695
Why don't you call
the cops and ask

206
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:53,328
for a guard to stay overnight?

207
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:54,662
That won't do.

208
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,695
The Daimonji Family's
name would be tarnished!

209
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:59,195
So how about letting us
see this golden teapot?

210
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:02,928
As you wish.

211
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:04,662
Follow me, and
I'll show the way.

212
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:15,462
Hmm?

213
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:16,962
SENTARO: Sentaro
here, grandmother.

214
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,728
I've brought Ranma
and his friends.

215
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:24,028
You may be my grandson, but
you're such a disappoint.

216
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:27,328
I understand you're asking
many favors of Ranma.

217
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:28,495
But grandmother--

218
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,528
Enough.

219
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,928
I don't want to hear anymore.

220
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:33,995
Welcome back to
our house, you two.

221
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:37,562
As my grandson has explained,
he desperately needs you help.

222
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,762
I must apologize for him.

223
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:42,595
He's always causing
you such trouble.

224
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:44,095
No problem at all, granny.

225
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:45,895
We'll do everything
that we can.

226
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,895
Gee, Sentaro.

227
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:57,528
I've never seen your
grandma look so glum before.

228
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:59,962
Well,I guess she's
got a good reason.

229
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:00,436
Ranma.

230
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,728
Hmm?

231
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,828
This is the golden
teapot of [? enishi. ?]

232
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,495
Whoa.

233
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:13,462
That's unreal.

234
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:14,795
It looks like a treasure.

235
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:15,962
OK, so what's the plan?

236
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:18,128
Stay on guard
watching it all night?

237
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:19,228
No.

238
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,662
I've decided to put
the golden teapot back

239
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:23,028
to the safest place
in this whole house.

240
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:23,962
What?

241
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:25,562
You mean like a
safe or something?

242
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:29,162
Even better-- the symbol of the
Daimonji Family, the five story

243
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:29,762
tower!

244
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:50,764
Don't worry, Satsuki my dear.

245
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:52,830
As long as I'm here,
no one can steal

246
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:55,230
our precious golden teapot.

247
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:58,530
And no one will dare interfere
with our upcoming wedding.

248
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:04,397
Ranma?

249
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,430
Kasumi be made you
something to nibble on.

250
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:11,764
Feels like we're
on a picnic up here.

251
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,530
Kasumi made a lot since she
figured it'd be a long night.

252
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:15,164
Here.

253
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:16,464
Great.

254
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:17,897
Help yourself, granny.

255
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,397
That's very kind of you.

256
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,430
I wonder if this Toko
Otome thief will really

257
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:25,630
show up tonight.

258
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:27,730
Seems a little over the
top for a practical joke,

259
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,064
wouldn't you say?

260
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,497
On a full moon night,
the [? enishi ?] teapot

261
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,464
will take flight.

262
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:33,830
Signed, Toko Otome.

263
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:36,130
This letter is the
only clue we have.

264
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:36,612
Yeah.

265
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:08,830
CHO: Welcome, solitary stranger.

266
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:11,264
The game is over, I'm afraid.

267
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:14,297
Ume of the Orthodox School
will allow you to trespass

268
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,330
no further.

269
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:17,397
Nor will Cho of the
Unorthodox School

270
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,497
Get out, evil thief!

271
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:33,297
Lucky block, but you won't
get away so easy this time.

272
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,130
Excuse me.

273
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:35,897
Do you have to stand on my head?

274
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,930
Oh dear.

275
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:38,697
How on Earth did I get up here?

276
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,230
Just quit yapping and get off.

277
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:43,464
You look a lot like my step
stool at home if you ask me.

278
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:44,330
Who are you to talk?

279
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,864
I know mushrooms
taller than you.

280
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:47,464
And I know toadstools
that have fewer spots!

281
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,630
M-- m-- m-- master.

282
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:04,797
Hmm?

283
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,264
What does that mean?

284
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,197
Looks like our thief
has made her appearance.

285
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,530
The old ladies on the second
floor tried to stop her,

286
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:11,997
but she got past 'em.

287
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,530
I wonder if Take and Shika
are OK on the third floor.

288
00:14:14,564 --> 00:14:16,030
This is as far as you're going.

289
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,430
This is it I'm afraid.

290
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:19,797
Hey, granny.

291
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,397
Maybe teaming up one Orthodox
lady with an Unorthodox lady

292
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,764
wasn't such a hot idea.

293
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:24,564
I'm older.

294
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,530
I go first.

295
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,597
Think again there, granny.

296
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,730
Back off, you Unorthodox wench.

297
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:29,464
Why I oughtta!

298
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:34,597
Uh-oh.

299
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,130
Three floors down, two to go.

300
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:37,697
I should known this
wasn't gonna work.

301
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,697
I proposed it as a challenge
for the Unorthodox and Orthodox

302
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,830
Schools.

303
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:44,097
Considering the
wedding and all, I

304
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,497
thought it would give
them a good chance

305
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,197
to team up and work
together for a single cause.

306
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,997
It would be the
first time in history

307
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,697
that the two schools
ever cooperated.

308
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:57,197
You must think you're
clever making it all

309
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,397
the way to the fourth floor.

310
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,230
But this is as far
as you're going.

311
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:02,630
As a member of the
orthodox school, I, Matsu,

312
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:04,230
will not allow you to--

313
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:07,464
As a member of the Unorthodox
school, you'll go no further!

314
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:10,697
Excuse me, but I believe I
was doing the talking here.

315
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,564
The strongest have
to stay in front.

316
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:13,964
Everyone knows that!

317
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,797
MATSU: Raw courage is the
only thing that counts.

318
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,064
Courage?

319
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:18,097
You jumped a foot
straight up when you saw

320
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,664
that cockroach earlier tonight.

321
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:22,197
Hah!

322
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,397
I suppose we could always
settle our differences later.

323
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,364
Good idea.

324
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:28,097
Let's save our
fighting for later.

325
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,397
She's pretty good.

326
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,264
There's only one thing
left for us to do, Matsu.

327
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:42,030
I hear you, Ino.

328
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:51,164
May the two schools--

329
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:51,646
Unite!

330
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,564
Better luck next
time, Toko Otome.

331
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:28,797
That's a lot of work just to
steal Akane's handmade pig.

332
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,130
It's a zebra!

333
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:30,964
Really?

334
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:32,330
I thought it was a wild boar.

335
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:34,530
You can't get at the
teapot you're looking for.

336
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:36,430
'Cause if you think
you're going on the roof,

337
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:38,830
think again! 'Cause you
gotta get through me first.

338
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:39,730
On the roof?

339
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:40,597
What are you saying?

340
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,464
Ranma, zip it.

341
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:51,030
Way to go, genius.

342
00:16:51,064 --> 00:16:52,830
You told her where
the teapot is hidden.

343
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:54,530
I don't believe this.

344
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:58,730
Well, she's still
not gonna get past me!

345
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:01,997
Hey, whose side
are you on, granny?

346
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,730
There she goes!

347
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,330
So glad we could finally meet.

348
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:18,197
I've been waiting
for you, Toko Otome.

349
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,864
I will not allow you to steal
the golden [? enishi ?] teapot.

350
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:27,530
I'm bound by my
lover for Satsuki

351
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:30,430
and I'm bound by the
family crest on my fan!

352
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,697
Bigger doesn't
always mean better.

353
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,464
As I was saying, you won't get
one step closer to-- one step--

354
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:43,064
ahh!

355
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:49,364
Huh?

356
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,364
That was sheer luck!

357
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,864
Satsuki!

358
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:25,830
Please return our
golden teapot to us.

359
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:26,430
She talked.

360
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,964
Please return our teapot.

361
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:47,497
All right.

362
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,630
That's enough.

363
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:49,364
Granny.

364
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:50,964
Grandmother.

365
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,130
A fine example of
the Miyako Oji style.

366
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:55,830
You don't really
want to continue

367
00:18:55,864 --> 00:18:57,397
fighting with your
granddaughter,

368
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,430
do you, Toko Otome?

369
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:02,897
[chuckling]

370
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,130
Your skills are
improving, Satsuki.

371
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,397
Master!

372
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,530
The Unorthodox Master?

373
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:22,997
So you two masters put
this whole thing together.

374
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,997
Yes, we were behind it all.

375
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,497
First, let me apologize
for all the trouble we must

376
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,164
have caused you all lately.

377
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:32,264
As you know, we're preparing
for the marriage between Sentaro

378
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,864
and Satsuki, after which the
two fighting tea schools will

379
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:38,064
be united for the first time.

380
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,897
But we were concerned about
whether Sentaro and Satsuki

381
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,497
were qualified enough
to becomes successors,

382
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,964
and I wanted to make sure
that everything would work out

383
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,464
for the best.

384
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:48,330
Sure.

385
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:49,897
Trust a bunch of
old teatotellers

386
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,497
to come up with
something like this.

387
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,997
Wait a sec.

388
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,597
I think I just figured out
that letter from Toko Otome.

389
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,264
The top characters of each
row spell out the word

390
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:02,697
for matriarch-- i, e, mo, to.

391
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,764
Very clever, young lady.

392
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:06,897
That's precisely the
one and only clue

393
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,830
that we gave our grandchildren.

394
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:11,597
So grandmother, how
did Satsuki and I do?

395
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,997
Did we pass your test?

396
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,130
Satsuki passed indeed.

397
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:19,197
She did have fine job of
blocking Toko Otome's attack.

398
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,964
I'm looking forward
to offering tea

399
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:23,864
to her as the
beautiful new bride.

400
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:26,497
Grandmother, that means
we can get married soon.

401
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,597
Not so fast, young man.

402
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,997
We have yet to grade your
performance, grandson.

403
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,697
What did you think of him,
Unorthodox tea master?

404
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,897
If I'm not mistaken, it
looks like the weather

405
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,464
will clear up today.

406
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:44,764
Yes, you're right.

407
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:47,430
But we still have a spell
of hot weather ahead of us.

408
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:49,930
With all that running
around, my ankles are the size

409
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:50,797
of an elephant's.

410
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,097
Oh no, dear.

411
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,397
You're still in much
better health than I am.

412
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,997
Excuse me.

413
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,230
Give it up.

414
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:57,197
If they're talking
about their ankles,

415
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,364
it means you didn't pass.

416
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,630
Sentaro, you must start
your formal training right

417
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:04,764
from the beginning.

418
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,430
We two masters
and the six ladies

419
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:08,397
of the Orthodox and
Unorthodox Schools

420
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,397
will spend every spare moment
working you to the bone.

421
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,164
Understand?

422
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:17,130
Man, and to think we all could
had a good sleep last night.

423
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:18,830
We couldn't have
known it was a setup.

424
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:20,430
And besides, it was
nice to get away.

425
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:24,530
I had a bad feeling about this
right from the very beginning.

426
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:25,830
Excuse me, everyone.

427
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,864
I hate to interrupt
you, but if you're done,

428
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:31,397
I've made some tea.

429
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,964
Start all over again?

430
00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:33,997
Thank you, Kasumi.

431
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,330
Shall we join you over there?

432
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,330
Yes, please do.

00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:46,178

AKANE (VOICEOVER): On
a cool summer night,

435
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,999
an old friend comes back
for a one night visit.

436
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:24,032
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Gosunkugi's Summer Affair.

437
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:25,399
We'll see you there!
