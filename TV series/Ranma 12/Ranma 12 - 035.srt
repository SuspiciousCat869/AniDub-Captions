-Hey, let go!

00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:13,024
-Hai-yah!

6
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:14,558
NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:15,691
-What are you doing?

NARRATOR: The to
have been engaged

to marry by their
loving parents.

10
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:20,391
-I didn't ask for this?

11
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:21,891
-Who asked you?

12
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:24,991
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

13
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,558
-What'd you do that for?

14
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:28,558
NARRATOR: When Ranma is
splashed with cold water,

15
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:30,158
he becomes a she.

[squeaks]

20
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,157
-Then why haven't I changed
back into a guy yet, huh?

21
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,023
Huh?

22
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:52,790
Tell me, you rodent!

23
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:53,923
What's going on?

24
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,723
Take a good look
at me, you moron!

25
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:57,023
Speak up.

26
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,123
You know I can't understand
you when you're like this.

27
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:00,190
Well? Tell--

RANMA: Huh.

32
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,290
Weird-looking pot to be
under the girls' locker room.

33
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:11,923
[gasp] Maybe that's
got something

34
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:15,590
to do with that Japanese Spring
of Drowned Man or something.

35

NARRATOR: Kuno's
House of Gadgets.

00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:19,657
Guests check in, but
they don't check out.

-Oh, get a load of that!

38
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:28,290
And here I thought these
things were only make-believe.

39
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:29,557
-Do you recognize it?

40
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,157
-How'd you punks get
your hands on this?

41
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,190
-Oh, that's easy.

42
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:34,090
We used a map.

COLOGNE: Japanese
Nanniichuan, eh?

45
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:41,923
I found it while I
was sight-seeing.

46
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:43,357
-Sight-seeing, huh?

47
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,423
That's what you call it?

48
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:45,957
RANMA: Enough wasting time.

49
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,290
What's that dumb pot got to
do with the Japanese Spring

50
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:49,423
of Drowned Man?

51
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:52,157
-As I was about
to tell you, this

52
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,790
is one of three
urns which I assumed

53
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:59,457
were only legend--
that is, until now.

54
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,423
It's said that if you
bring all three together

55
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,790
at a certain time and place,
the waters of Nanniichuan

56
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:09,323
will rise.

57
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:12,257
RANMA (VOICEOVER): [singing]
Never gonna be a girl again.

58
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,923
Never gonna be a--

59
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:17,390
-OK, you mean you're saying
that if I can find the two

60
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:21,090
other dumb pots,
maybe I can be normal?

61
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:22,323
Argh!

62
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,923
I've been through
hell because of you.

63
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:27,523
Last time you and your map had
me wearing girls' gym shorts.

64
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:28,323
Girls'!

65
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,790
-That was your bright idea!

66
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:31,023
-What do you know?

67
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:31,990
Here's the second one.

68
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:32,990
-Huh?

69
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:34,323
-Look at the pattern.

70
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:36,623
It's all right here, if
you know how to read it.

71
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,057
If I remember correctly,
the other two urns

72
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,490
are crimson and gold.

73
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:47,723
Whoa!

74
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,690
Found it!

75
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:54,990
I've cracked the code and
found where the crimson urn is.

76
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:57,823
Shampoo, fetch me
a pen and paper.

77
00:02:57,857 --> 00:03:00,723
SHAMPOO: OK!

78
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:01,590
-OK.

79
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:03,090
According to the
old ghoul's map,

80
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:05,857
I start by walking
30 steps southeast.

81
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,157
-Don't think you're
doing this by yourself!

-Hey, hand that over!

87
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:21,057
-Oh, yeah, like you
can read it, Ryoga.

88
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,890
OK, now 700 steps to the west.

He's gone.

-Yeah, here I am.

101
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,490
Mind getting off of me now?

-[laughs] It's mine! [laughs]

How very true.

In sooth, Akane Tendo

-Wha?

503
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:11,947
Oh no, the old freak's got it.

504
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,780
Come back here!

505
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,747
-Hey!

506
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,713
Who turned off the lights?

00:21:14,747 --> 00:21:17,480
RANMA: Come back, I said!

-Oh, hello, what's this?

509
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,180
RANMA: Come back!

silky treasures in. [cackles]

511
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,347
-You old freak, gimme that!

512
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,313

AKANE (VOICEOVER): What?

516
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,201
You mean there really is
a Japanese Nanniichuan?

517
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:13,868
Congratulations, Ranma.

518
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,834
I guess this means your days
as a pervert are at an end.

519
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:19,634
Next time on "Ranma

See you there!
