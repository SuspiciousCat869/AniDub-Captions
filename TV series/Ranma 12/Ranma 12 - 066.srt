-Hmm?

00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,146
Boy, that stinky little goat.

6
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:11,279
I'll show him.

7
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:19,212
-Huh?

8
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:22,112
Watch this.

And this.

12
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:31,546
And some of this.

13
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:33,179
-No, please, the stinky feet.

14
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:33,712
No.

15
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:34,446
That hurts.

16
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:35,679
Get off of me.

-Look what you've done.

00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:49,912
-What's happened to you?

21
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,312
-Hey, old man, you're home.

22
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:54,879
We were just starting
to worry about you.

-Why, you.

24
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:59,379
It's all your fault.

25
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,146
-Sautome, quick, do something.

26
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:03,846
The master's getting angry.

00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:04,379
-Huh?

28
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:04,920
-Sautome.

-You've really made
me mad this time.

30
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:13,846
Now you're going to pay.

31
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:17,046
Are you listening to me?

32
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:20,279
Let's see you try
to ignore this.

33
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,346
-And what's this supposed to be?

34
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:27,012
Hey, what are you doing?

35
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:28,912
Hmm?

36
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:31,312
That's hot.

37
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,979
Hot, hot, hot, aww.

Aww.

-Told ya.

-Mess with the master at
one's own peril, I always say.

41
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,679
-So what did I ever
do to him, huh?

42
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:47,679
-You want I should make a list?

43
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:50,379
-OK, we're off.

-Oh, man.

45
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:54,879
It still hurts.

46
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:56,546
-Oh stop complaining will you?

47
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,812
You got off lucky if you ask me.

48
00:03:58,912 --> 00:03:59,979
-That's true.

49
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,179
The freak don't usually
let you off so easy.

50
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:06,379
-Ranma Sautome, today's
the day you die.

51
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,212
-What that?

52
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,279
-Is that Kuno?

53
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,879
-Prepare to receive
my mighty blow, you.

54
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,012
-Good morning to you, too.

55
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:14,546
Geez, talk about your--

56
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:21,912
-If that was supposed to be
a kick, I didn't feel it.

57
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,812
-Why don't I believe you?

58
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:29,012
-Enough play already.

59
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:30,512
Put some back into it.

60
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,312
-You asked for it, pal.

61
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,312
That hurt.

62
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:47,412
-Ranma, hang in there.

63
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:48,979
-I--I did it.

64
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,212
I beat Ranma Sautome.

65
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,812
So in other words, date
with me, Akane Tendo.

66
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,512
-Thanks, but no thanks.

67
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:07,512
Ranma, what's wrong with you?

68
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:09,612
How could Kuno just beat you?

69
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:12,079
-Oh, man, that hurt.

70
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,812
Something's wrong all right.

71
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:19,579
The day Kuno beats
me is the day I--

72
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:24,746
it's the day that
I stop being a man.

73
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,979
Oh, my god.

74
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,346
Oh, my god, what have I done?

75
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:31,346
-What have you done is right.

76
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:34,479
-Hey, you OK?

77
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:37,212
-Of course he's not, stupid.

78
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:40,279
-You say something
mister poo-poo head?

79
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,112
-At least he's OK.

80
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,246
-Sure.

81
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:47,712
That's the-- that's the
important thing, right?

82
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:48,912
-He what?

83
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:52,379
Weak in what way?

84
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,046
-So, do you know what's
wrong with him yet?

85
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,679
-Let's see.

86
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,712
The bones and muscles
are fine, but hmm.

87
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:03,946
What's this burn mark?

88
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:10,912
Why, I haven't seen one of
these in over 100 years.

89
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,246
[speaking in a foreign language]

90
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:20,512
Here it is.

91
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,912
I'm sure it's in here somewhere.

92
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:25,812
Aha, what'd I tell you?

93
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:28,379
According to this
ancient text, whosoever

94
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,812
be burned by this moxibustion,
let him, be he howsoever strong

95
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:38,179
or howsoever great in his art
become weak as a mere babe.

96
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:38,720
-That's it.

97
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,646
Why, that little.

98
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,812
-There is a way you can cure
him, though, isn't there?

99
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:58,112
-Akane, I'm not
sure how to say it.

100
00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:59,212
-Say what?

101
00:06:59,312 --> 00:06:59,879
Come on.

102
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,146
Tell me.

103
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,979
-Tragically, at least for
now, this strength-sapping

104
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,879
moxibustion has no cure.

105
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:08,812
-But that would
mean that Ranma--

106
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:16,846
-Is weak for the
rest of my life.

107
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:18,646
-Ranma!

108
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:21,046
Ranma?

109
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,979
Doctor, please.

110
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,912
I just know you can find some
way to help him, can't you?

111
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,812
Doctor Tofu?

112
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:30,146
-OK then.

113
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:33,246
I can't promise anything,
but let me see what I can do.

114
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:34,912
-Oh Doctor Tofu,
you're the best.

115
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:44,712
-Good heavens, what is this?

116
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:45,679
-A letter?

117
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,146
-As if I did not know.

118
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,979
-Oh, happy happy day.

119
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,279
-Extra, extra,
read all about it.

120
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:06,820
Extra.

121
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,312
Extra.

122
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:07,779
-Freak!

123
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,346
-What's this?

124
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:12,712
Did I just feel a feather?

125
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:14,679
-Hey, no fair.

126
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,712
I'll teach you to
play dirty tricks.

127
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:20,246
-You ain't seen nothing yet.

128
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,979
My real revenge
is just starting.

129
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,246
-Real revenge?

130
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:28,312
-That stupid Ranma, now
where'd he go and run off to?

131
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:33,679
What the-- Pea-chan.

132
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,879
What are you doing here?

133
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:37,746
Huh?

134
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:38,746
A letter?

135
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:41,912
Ranma is what?

136
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:44,879
-The best part of my revenge
is I don't have to do a thing.

137
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:46,579
Your enemies will do it for me.

138
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,946
-That's a good theory,
but how's about I beat you

139
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,279
into curing me instead?

140
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,979
-It's ready to go.

141
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,179
It's ready to go.

142
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,679
-Honestly, must you
encourage him like that?

143
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,379
Really?

144
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,012
-Sautome?

145
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:07,846
Sautome?

146
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,079
Is Ranma Sautome absent today?

147
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:13,879
-He's uh, here.

148
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:15,379
But that is--

149
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,712
-Yes?

150
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:19,746
-I mean, he's not in his seat,
but he's definitely here.

151
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,912
-Thank you for clearing
that up, Ms. Tendo,

152
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:24,679
I know I feel enlightened.

153
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,946
-(MUFFLED) Come on!

154
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:26,746
Please!

155
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:27,946
Someone get me out of here.

156
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:28,612
Help.

157
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:29,912
Please, come on!

158
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:32,979
I'm gonna--

159
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:35,212
-I'm sorry, but until
we figure out a cure,

160
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,879
you've got to lay
low for a while.

161
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:40,079
-Stupid Akane.

162
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,046
[struggling]

163
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:51,446
-That was risky, but if she
thinks I'm just going to go

164
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:52,112
into hiding--

165
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,453
-Hello!

166
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:02,079
Why you need such big hair?

167
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:03,012
-Oh, not you again.

168
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,846
-Who's that supposed to hurt?

169
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:09,212
Let Nikauno give you a
quick buzz cut, yeah?

170
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,512
Do it again, boy.

171
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:17,979
I can't feel a thing.

172
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:30,579
-So you really are weak, just
like the letter said, huh?

173
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,479
-Let me go.

174
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,879
Let me go.

175
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:35,846
-Die!

176
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:36,812
-Why you--

177
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,912
-For shame, Sautome.

178
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:45,079
We both know why I won.

179
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,379
And this alleged weakness
has naught to do with it.

180
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,679
-I'll show you who's weak.

181
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:58,512
-Yield, cretin.

182
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:04,712
-I'm done for.

183
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,176
-Die, you.

184
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,396
Cut that hair!

185
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:22,896
-Punish.

186
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:23,337
Punish.

187
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:28,596
-Huh?

188
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:29,429
-Idiots.

189
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:29,970
Riyoga?

190
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,263
I guess you must have come
to beat me up, too, huh?

191
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,163
-Hey, don't get me wrong, Ranma.

192
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,763
I'm only here because it's
not right to bully the weak,

193
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:42,663
you know.

194
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:43,629
-Huh?

195
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:47,396
I'll show you who's
weak, you jerk.

196
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:51,529
-That felt like a baby's kick.

197
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,496
You know, there's
a Japanese word

198
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,496
for those punches of
yours, and that work

199
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:56,596
is [speaking in japanese].

200
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:57,363
-He said it.

201
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:58,729
The W word.

202
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,063
Weak.

203
00:12:01,163 --> 00:12:03,729
-Call me a romantic,
but I just can't

204
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:06,863
bear to see you like this.

205
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:10,963
-I thought you weren't
here to hit me.

206
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,696
-Do you really think
you can cure him?

207
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:14,696
-Sure.

208
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:16,363
I've done some
research and it seems

209
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:19,163
there's a certain chart
which reveals the pressure

210
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:21,729
points for the moxibustion cure.

211
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,163
-Oh Doctor Tofu, you
really are the best.

212
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,929
-So you see, once we find that
chart, all we'll have to do

213
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,896
is apply pressure to
the proper points.

214
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,029
-I can't wait to tell
him the good news.

215
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,396
-OK.

216
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:49,996
And now to open
the rest of-- Huh?

217
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:53,596
What in the-- huh?

218
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:55,796
Ranma, honey, you
just hang in there.

219
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:56,337
OK?

220
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:05,363
-Ranma?

221
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:06,429
[screaming]

222
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:07,796
-You'll never get your
old strength back.

223
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:08,929
Never.

224
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:12,163
They'll be lining up all
over town to beat you.

225
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:14,496
-Ranma Sautome, victory is mine.

226
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:15,496
-You lose, Ranma.

227
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:16,996
You lose.

228
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:21,496
-If you have to be like this,
I'd rather see you dead.

229
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:28,063
-Enough.

230
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:29,496
This coal's hot.

231
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,996
I'm burning up.

232
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:35,463
-Oh, finally awake, are you?

233
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:36,129
-Hot!

234
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:37,729
Okio, what happened?

235
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:39,429
-You were in the trash can.

236
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:40,863
-I what?

237
00:13:40,963 --> 00:13:42,729
-You know, I've
been hearing rumors.

238
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:44,363
Guess this means they're true.

239
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:46,263
-I can explain.

240
00:13:46,363 --> 00:13:47,996
-I understand perfectly.

241
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:49,896
You don't need to explain.

242
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,096
-I don't?

243
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,196
I mean, have you got some
kind of plan or what?

244
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:56,829
-I got something
better than that.

245
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:58,996
-You beat me fair
and square, youngin'.

246
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:01,763
-You're weaker
than a possum, Pa.

247
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:05,463
-Y'all go easy on your
poor, weak daddy now.

248
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:08,663
You just wait til you hear
when else I've got to say.

249
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:10,429
-Haven't you said enough, Okio?

250
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:13,063
-You might as well
face it, you know.

251
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,929
Without that strength
of yours, you're

252
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,663
in no shape to take
over the Tendo Dojo.

253
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:21,263
And without that, you're in no
shape to marry Akane, are you?

254
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:23,329
-The only thing I
care about right

255
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,396
now is getting my strength back.

256
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:26,729
I don't care about Dojos.

257
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:30,329
And I especially don't care
about that stupid Akane.

258
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:34,029
-That's it, then.

259
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:36,896
Guess you won't be needing
my stupid cure, then, either.

260
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:38,163
-I won't?

261
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:40,629
[yelling] You know it was
only a joke, right, Akane?

262
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:41,463
Right?

263
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:43,063
Here, let me do your shoulders.

264
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:44,229
You look fantastic today.

265
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,263
-Don't bother.

266
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:47,763
Grow a spine, will ya?

267
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,263
[crash]

268
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:53,063
-Shampu, Shampu, where are you?

269
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:55,296
-What's all the racket?

270
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:56,529
-I did it, Shampu.

271
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,563
I finally beat Ranma.

272
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,063
That means we can
finally be married.

273
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:00,063
You're glad, aren't you?

274
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,563
Aren't you?

275
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:03,196
-It's just all so sudden.

276
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:04,063
-Who said that?

277
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:09,329
You're not Shampu.

278
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:11,863
-Gee, you don't say.

279
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:12,404
Hmm?

280
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,129
Ranma is weak.

281
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:19,463
So the rumors are
true after all.

282
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:31,729
-Strength-sapping moxibustion,
here now in Japan?

283
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:38,029
-We are sorry to
bother you, but we've

284
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:40,929
heard that the pressure point
chart might be in this temple.

285
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,629
So we thought--

286
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,063
-So let us take a look at it.

287
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:44,829
OK?

288
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:46,629
We just need to borrow it.

289
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,096
-I think he's fainted.

290
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,529
-Maybe he's just
meditating or something.

291
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,963
-Yo, snap out of it, would you?

292
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:54,829
Where's the chart?

293
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:55,563
Hmm.

294
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,104
Yo?

295
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:03,796
-I'd like to help,
but that chart

296
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,196
ain't around here no more.

297
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:06,363
-What?

298
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:09,396
-We used to have it,
but it was stolen.

299
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:10,829
Nigh on a hundred years ago.

300
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:19,263
-That's it then.

301
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:20,596
I might as well give up.

302
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,496
Without any clues
as to where it--

303
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:25,729
-Did I say we didn't
have no clues?

304
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:28,429
Looky here.

305
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:28,970
-Huh?

306
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,629
This is--

307
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,929
-That there is the likeness
of the rascal who stole it.

308
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,796
I reckon if you find him,
you'll find the chart too,

309
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:37,829
sure as day.

310
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,896
-That's Grandfather
Haposai, isn't it?

311
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:42,396
-Sure is.

312
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:44,863
If I can just get that
chart from the old freak,

313
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,596
I can go back to being
strong like before.

314
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:51,196
-Why, you're practically good
as cured already, aren't ya?

315
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:51,763
-We'll see.

316
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,029
-Grandfather, if you have
any trash for me to burn,

317
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,663
would you please
bring it out to me?

318
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:09,063
-Got to keep this.

319
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,329
Got to keep this.

320
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,129
Keep this, too.

321
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:16,663
What's this piece of junk?

322
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:17,829
Can't be that important.

323
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:22,970
Kasume.

324
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:28,896
-Not yet.

325
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:29,596
Not yet.

326
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:32,529
Not yet.

327
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:33,729
There it is.

328
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:35,229
The chart with all the
mark se-- whatever points.

329
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:40,229
-So that's what it is?

330
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:41,563
I'd almost forgotten.

331
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:43,396
Better hang onto it.

332
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,696
-Why you little freak.

333
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:46,763
Hand it over.

334
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:48,863
-A little slow,
ain't you, Ranma.

335
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:49,929
What's the matter?

336
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,529
Can't you catch me?

337
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:53,363
-Fine.

338
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,063
We can do it either way, freak.

339
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,863
Easy or hard, it's your choice.

340
00:17:57,963 --> 00:17:59,563
-Kasume, Kane, thank goodness.

341
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:00,104
Look.

342
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:05,229
-Oh, yeah.

343
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:06,629
Getting serious, eh, punk?

344
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:11,229
Don't expect me to
back down either.

345
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,829
-But Ranma's far too weak.

346
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:14,763
He can't possibly.

347
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:17,529
-Akane, honey, he is.

348
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,529
-No problem.

349
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,829
[yelling]

350
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:31,263
-Ranma!

351
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:32,729
-Ain't beat yet.

352
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:36,863
How's about these apples?

353
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:37,963
-Hubba hubba.

354
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:41,563
-Ha, I tricked ya.

355
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,796
-What's the matter, Ranma?

356
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,029
-I'll clobber you in a minute.

357
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:44,570
OK?

358
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:45,729
Hang on.

359
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:46,829
-No thanks.

360
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:52,329
Why go for a clobber
when I can go for these?

361
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:53,263
-Quit it.

362
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:55,229
-Come on, Ranma,
give up already.

363
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:58,029
You're too weak.

364
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:58,763
-Ranma!

365
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:00,263
-Curse you.

366
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:02,429
-How pathetic.

367
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:06,096
Is tearing your shirt open the
only thing you could think of?

368
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:06,637
-What?

369
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:14,796
Give it up, why don't you?

370
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:16,896
You're in my power
now, and you know it.

371
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:18,363
-That's enough.

372
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:19,896
Don't you know when to quit?

373
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:24,196
-Even Ranma deserves to be
treated like a human being.

374
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:24,896
-All right.

375
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,796
Hand over that chart.

376
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:29,996
-I don't wanna.

377
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:34,063
Ranma, you can stay a weakling
for the rest of your miserable

378
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:37,363
life for all I care.

379
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:37,904
[laughing]

380
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:45,263
-Oh, come on.

381
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:46,529
You know how he is.

382
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,029
I'm sure he'll come around.

383
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:48,996
Ranma?

384
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:50,463
Ranma, you OK?

385
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:53,837
-Ranma.

386
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,496
-Hey, what's the
matter with you?

387
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:07,929
-Stop trying to cheer me up.

388
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,429
-But-- but I--

389
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:21,529
-Now what?

390
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:22,929
Is he mad at me now?

391
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,596
And here I was trying
to help him, too.

392
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:25,629
Fine then.

393
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:27,063
If he wants to be
that way, then hmm.

394
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:35,029
-Father, they're gone.

395
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:37,596
Both Ranma and Mr.
Sautome have left.

396
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,137
-Hmm?

397
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,096
-They must have packed last
night while we were sleeping,

398
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:48,637
and then--

399
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,663
-But why?

400
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,329
-Perhaps he felt
that being weak,

401
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:54,029
he could not take over the Dojo.

402
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,496
-Oh, the humanity.

403
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,529
-I don't believe it.

404
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:59,296
Ranma's no coward.

405
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:01,729
He would never run
from a real fight.

406
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,496
You believe that,
Dad, don't you?

407
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,229
Don't you agree?

408
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,496
-Of course.

409
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:09,596
He's a lot of things, but
Ranma's never been afraid.

410
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:15,296
-So what if he left
without saying goodbye?

411
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:16,496
Who needs a jerk like him?

412
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:18,363
I'm better off
without him anyway.

413
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:19,363
-Akane.

414
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:19,904
-Ranma?

415
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,829
Oh, Ranma, you idiot.

416
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:31,796
Where are you?

417
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:48,858
[music playing]

418
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,667
-Oh, Ranma, this
is no time for you

419
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:19,989
to be dancing around like that.

420
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:20,956
What?

421
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,622
You mean it's all
part of his training?

422
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:25,989
The next time on Ranma,
Eureka, the desperate move

423
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:27,522
of desperation.

424
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:31,122
We'll see you there.
