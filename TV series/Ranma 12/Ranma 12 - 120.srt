00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:51,774
Huh?

NARRATOR: Case of
the Furinkon Stalker.

7
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,033
Akane come see.

8
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,700
So, what is it?

9
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,833
Well, we were just
wondering how Ranma's been.

10
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:58,233
Have you noticed anything
strange about him lately?

11
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,333
What are you talking about?

12
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,766
Rama seems fine to me.

13
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,833
Did you hear
something about him?

14
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,700
To be honest--

15
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,933
Yeah, go on.

16
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,300
I met with him after
school yesterday.

17
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,133
I thought you'd like to know.

18
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,000
With Ranma?

19
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,700
No.

20
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,233
The Furinkon Stalker.

21
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,733
What you talking about?

22
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,866
You mean you haven't heard?

23
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:29,866
Why, practically call girls in
school are talking about him.

24
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,866
Well, I never
heard a single word.

25
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:34,633
He's dressed in a black mask.

26
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,833
It's all news to me.

27
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,133
Oh boy.

28
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,300
Ukyo, why don't you tell the
story from the beginning?

29
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
Yeah, would you?

30
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,600
Yesterday, I left
school late because it

31
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,600
was my turn for clean-up duty.

32
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:03,533
It seems like it's taking
forever to get out of here.

33
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,107
Huh?

34
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:20,974
Huh?

35
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,166
Then what?

36
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:52,900
[scream]

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,233
[scream]

38
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,633
Actually it sounds to me
like the guy in the mask

39
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,766
was more of a victim then Ukyo.

40
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,000
What about me?

41
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,433
I mean, I was the one who
was scared out of her mind

42
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,700
when he jumped out
at me like that.

43
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,133
Yeah, it is a really
nasty thing to do.

44
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,100
There have been four
victims, including Ukyo.

45
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,366
One of the victims was
squired with black ink.

46
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,066
Another was freaked
out by a caterpillar.

47
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,600
We don't feel safe
around school anymore.

48
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,333
Hey, you guys, I've
got a great idea.

49
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:32,300
We'll get Ranma, and he can
help us track down the creep.

50
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,166
OK, the first thing we'll
need is a detailed description

51
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,433
of the pervert.

52
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:37,833
Akane.

53
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,666
Huh?

54
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:42,166
Akane, there's something else.

55
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,700
And I think it might be
better if you sat down.

56
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, man.

57
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,900
That hit the spot.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,466
Come on, Ranma.

59
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:53,933
The guys are waiting for you.

60
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:54,900
Coming.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,833
AKANE: (YELLING) What?

62
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:01,433
What's up with them?

63
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:13,133
AKANE (VOICEOVER): It
just can't be true.

64
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,800
So, you're sure it's Ranma?

65
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,533
I am positive, Akane.

66
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,133
After what happened
to me yesterday,

67
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,133
I went and asked the other
girls who were attacked.

68
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:28,600
They said the same thing.

69
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,833
The Stalker had a--

70
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:34,600
He had a-- The Stalker
had his hair in a pigtail.

71
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,400
But listen to this, Akane.

72
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,233
When one of the other
girls was jumped,

73
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:43,166
she heard him call out, feast
your eyes on Ranma Saotome.

74
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:43,766
No!

75
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,100
It can't be.

76
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,766
It might have been somebody
who just said he was Ranma.

77
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,833
Yeah, Ranma would never
do something like that.

78
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:55,100
Well, I think because
the creep shouted

79
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,500
Ranma's name, that makes
Ranma somehow connected

80
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,466
to this whole mess.

81
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:00,200
Yeah.

82
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,866
I can see that.

83

86
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,533
Have you guys seen Ranma?

87
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,000
I think he went home.

88
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,966
You're sure?

89
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,666
What, had a date planned?

90
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:26,100
Course not.

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Well, Ranma's the lucky one.

92
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,200
Us lonely dudes are on our own.

93
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,633
Oh, let's go.

94
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:32,900
See you, Akane.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,133
I'll catch you later.

96
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,833
[sigh]

97
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,633
Hey, don't worry
about it, Akane.

98
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:45,300
You never know.

99
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
It might not be him.

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,033
Yeah, even if
everyone says it is.

101
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,400
There's no way that it's Ranma.

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,600
I mean, he doesn't
have a motive to do any

103
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,433
of those-- Hey, wait a minute.

104
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,233
[laughing]

105
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,233
I'm starving.

106
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,266
That doesn't have
anything to do with it.

107
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,866
Oh, Ranma.

108
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,266
Just where do you
think you're going?

109
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:34,600
Clean up your mess.

110
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,833
Uh yeah, well, I would but
I'm supposed to meet someone.

111
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,200
So I'd better uh--

112
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,466
I don't think so.

113
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:48,033
Hey, you missed a spot.

114
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,366
He got what he deserved.

115
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,766
All right, now check this out.

116
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, man.

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,433
What do you think you're doing?

118
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:09,800
[sigh]

119
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,133
Huh?

120
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:12,800
What's this?

121
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,700
It looks like uh--

122
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:19,200
[gasp]

123
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,966
It's the Stalker's black mask.

124
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,766
Here you go.

125
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:30,666
Here's your apples.

126
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,633
Oh, thank you.

127
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:33,400
Hey, what's wrong?

128
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,133
You look a little down.

129
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,300
No, uh, there's
nothing wrong, really.

130
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,066
Well, see you.

131
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,366
Hey, hey, wait.

132
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:43,566
You forgot your change.

133
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:51,900
It's starting to get late.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,100
Huh?

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,641
Uh.

136
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:58,907
Mm.

137
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,433
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Stay calm, Akane.

138
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,166
I've got to find out
if he's Ranma or not.

139
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:13,466
And I've got to find out
before he attacks anyone else.

140
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,007
Huh?

141
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,933
So, do you want to know what
it feels like when you sneak up

142
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,733
on somebody from behind?

143
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,433
Huh?

144
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,866
Huh?

145
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:24,866
Hey!

146
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:28,333
Hey, come back here.

147
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:33,266
Why, you little creep!

148
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:41,707
Bullseye!

149
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,233
Huh?

150
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,200
What?

151
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,833
Where did he-- where
did he disappear to?

152
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,033
Just wait till next time.

153
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,566
You won't get away.

154
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,900
Ranma.

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,433
Are you in there?

156
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,433
Yeah.

157
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,633
I'm having a shower,
so don't come in.

158
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,733
How come you didn't
wait for me after school?

159
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,966
You promise me we were
going to go to the market.

160
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,600
What?

161
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,466
Oh, geez, I must have forgot.

162
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,166
I came straight home.

163
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:13,633
Sorry, Akane.

164
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,000
Could it be?

165
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,133
Grr.

166
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,066
Ranma!

167
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:28,607
RANMA: Hey!

168
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,233
Do you mind?

169
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,166
I'm taking a shower!

170
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,200
Would you let go of my head.

171
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,733
Hey, what did you do that for?

172
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,266
AKANE: Ah!

173
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:37,200
Turn it off.

174
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,200
It's cold.

175
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,866
Would anyone like
nice cup of tea?

176
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,366
Uh, huh.

177
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:46,000
So do you tell me
what's going on here?

178
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,766
Ranma, I've got a few
questions to ask you.

179
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:50,307
Hm?

180
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,933
Soon, Saotome, your
entire reputation

181
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,833
will be totally destroyed.

182
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,300
[laughing]

183
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,643
You idiot.

184
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,676
Do you think I'm
so stupid that if I

185
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,209
went out and scared someone,
I'd turn around and tell them

186
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:28,109
my name?

187
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,676
Well, I guess not.

188
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,909
And when they told you it
was me, you believed them?

189
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,276
No, of course not.

190
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:36,243
Hey, give me one good reason
why I'd do something like that.

191
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,543
Well, if it's a motive
you're looking for.

192
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:40,109
Why you--

193
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,843
It's no big deal.

194
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:47,443
Someone out there is trying
to ruin my whole reputation.

195
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:49,909
And I'll get them for that.

196
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,309
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I
guess it's not you, Ranma.

197
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:56,176
Ah!

198
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,809
Would you like
some rice crackers?

199
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:01,676
Uh, huh.

200
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:02,909
Hey, you two.

201
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:03,576
Hello.

202
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:04,909
[whispering voices]

203
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,809
(WHISPERING) Oh, I can't
believe he did that.

204
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:15,743
Hah, hah.

205
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:16,709
Almost there.

206
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,576
Ah!

207
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,676
Not having a good day, Ranma?

208
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:36,709
What are you saying?

209
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:40,076
I've heard you're
the Masked Stalker.

210
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:40,809
Why--

211
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,743
Uh!

212
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:45,043
So where did you hear
that from, you freak?

213
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:48,076
The-- the whole school
is talking about it.

214
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:50,309
But don't get me
wrong, Ranma, I don't

215
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:52,843
believe any of what
they're saying for a minute

216
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:55,409
because I'm on your side.

217
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,776
Gosunkugi, thank you.

218
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,676
I suppose if you want,
I'll go tell the girls

219
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:01,876
that it wasn't you.

220
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:04,143
You're saying you know
who the heck the creep is?

221
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,276
Huh, uh.

222
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:08,643
But I understand exactly
how you must be feeling.

223
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:11,443
Trust me, I know what it
feels like to be ignored

224
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,276
by every single girl
in this entire school

225
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:17,376
and the totally helpless
feeling of ever exacting

226
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:19,943
any retribution against
any of those callous,

227
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:21,509
apathetic females.

228
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,643
You mind trying
that in English?

229
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,276
Your little secret's safe with
me because you and I are alike.

230
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:31,176
And I get the feeling we
could be the best of friends.

231
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:33,976
Maybe we can hang out
together every day.

232
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:35,543
Just you and me, Ranma.

233
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:36,084
Ah!

234
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:42,743
OK, let me
translated it for you.

235
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:44,909
To wait for you, my
love, while the dew

236
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,643
drops collect on the grass
at night is like an eternity.

237
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:51,709
So any questions?

238
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:52,609
Grr.

239
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:53,509
Grr.

240
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,309
I'll get you, you masked freak.

241
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,676
You just wait!

242
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:58,809
Grr.

243
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:01,443
I've got to figure some
way to nab that jerk.

244
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:10,809
Saotome, it is I who holds
your fate in my hands.

245
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,509
[laughing]

246
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:16,243
When everyone finally
hears that Saotome

247
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:20,576
is the Masked Stalker, they will
all avoid him like the plague.

248
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,409
[whispering]

249
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,509
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Why is
everyone staring at me?

250
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:28,943
[whispering voices]

251
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:30,676
(WHISPERING) What's
the matter with him?

252
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:33,343
He's not the guy
we used to know.

253
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:36,276
Akane.

254
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:39,943
Akane, at least you
believe me, don't you?

255
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:41,076
Ah!

256
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:42,709
You gotta believe me.

257
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,709
I'm innocent.

258
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:44,343
Get away.

259
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,443
You're disgusting!

260
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:46,984
Uh!

261
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,009
Uh!

262
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:52,676
You stay away from
her, you pervert.

263
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:58,676
Gosunkugi.

264
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,243
My sweet Akane.

265
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,743
That cretin will never
bother you again.

266
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:05,743
You're my hero.

267
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:09,343
Everything will be all right
now that we're together.

268
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:09,884
Gosunkugi.

269
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:17,143
Saotome, Tendo, and Gosunkugi.

270
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,576
Why don't you three go cool
off in the hall for a while.

271
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:25,376
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Just
wait till I find you.

272
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:38,743
Can you tell me where I
can find Ranma Saotome?

273
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:40,543
I don't have a clue.

274
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:43,243
Do you know where I'd
find Ranma Saotome?

275
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:45,576
No, but what are
you doing later?

276
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:48,876
I'm sorry, but I'm
Ranma's biggest fan.

277
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:50,243
Your loss.

278
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,743
Have you seen Ranma Saotome?

279
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:54,943
I think he went home.

280
00:16:55,043 --> 00:16:57,109
Oh, well, thank you.

281
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:58,843
Do you know where Ranma is?

282
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:00,476
I hope this works.

283
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:03,509
And it's not just another one
of Ranma's harebrained ideas.

284
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:12,343
I figured that masked creep
would have shown up by now.

285
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:15,443
Oh, well, maybe I'll
try again tomorrow.

286
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:18,909
Look at the beautiful sky.

287
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:24,309
Ah, man, I'm ready
to pack it in.

288
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,676
Ah!

289
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,443
Ah!

290
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:29,009
[evil laugh]

291
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:32,343
Who are you?

292
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:35,509
So, you finally decided
to show up, huh?

293
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,343
[evil laugh]

294
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:41,776
You don't know who you're
dealing with, do you?

295
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:46,343
Oh, I'll find out when
I take off your mask.

296
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,243
You're dead!

297
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,309
You're not getting
away this time.

298
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:02,343
What the heck?

299
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:04,043
Akane?

300
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:07,543
I knew he would show up
eventually and I was right.

301
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:09,376
He's all mine, Akane.

302
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,443
It's payback time.

303
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:12,709
Uh, back off.

304
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,643
Because you don't know who
you two are messing with.

305
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,076
I know that you're
a real pervert.

306
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:18,143
Ha!

307
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:23,076
Now it is time to
reveal my true identity.

308
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:24,543
I'm Ranma Saotome.

309
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,109
I'm sorry, Akane.

310
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:35,043
I, Ranma, am the Masked Stalker.

311
00:18:35,143 --> 00:18:37,709
G-g-g- Gosunkugi?

312
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:38,250
Gosunkugi?

313
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,009
Grr.

314
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:45,509
You actually thought you
could be Ranma Saotome?

315
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,443
You want to see a disguise?

316
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,743
Check this out.

317
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:58,209
You're looking at
the real Ranma.

318
00:18:58,309 --> 00:18:59,543
Holy Toledo!

319
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:01,576
How did you do that anyway?

320
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:02,543
Ha!

321
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:03,976
Did you really
think you'd get away

322
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,943
with it, wearing that
pathetic excuse for a costume?

323
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:10,176
I don't think you should be
explaining it too much, Ranma.

324
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,343
Freak!

325
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:18,476
Well, that takes care of that.

326
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:21,076
But I wonder what his
reason was for being you.

327
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,576
Isn't it obvious?

328
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:23,509
Huh?

329
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,176
Think who he was
trying to replace

330
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,376
and who that guy's fiance is.

331
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:28,143
Huh?

332
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:29,809
It was simple.

333
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,009
After I unmasked
the goob, I gave him

334
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,543
a taste of what a
Ranma fist tastes like.

335
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:37,343
I'm sorry we
doubted you, Ranma.

336
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,309
We're sorry too.

337
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,743
Oh, you guys don't
have to apologize.

338
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:45,309
Well, I guess good news is, I
taught the little jerk a lesson

339
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,643
he'll never forget.

340
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:48,143
I don't think he'll do it again.

341
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,743
Gee, that's pretty
neat, Ranma, but there's

342
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:52,909
one thing I'm not so clear on.

343
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,209
We still don't know the
identity of the Masked Stalker.

344
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:00,009
Good question, but after
everything that happened,

345
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:02,243
we never really got a
good look at his face.

346
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:03,343
Ah, who cares?

347
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:04,476
It's over with.

348
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:08,109
Look, Saotome, I
brought you some lunch.

349
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,143
Hey, thanks, pal.

350
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:14,476
I have to chow mein and curry
bread, just like you ordered.

351
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:17,709
So is there anything
else I can get you?

352
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,376
Atta boy, Gosunkugi.

353
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:21,476
Come on, buddy.

354
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:23,209
What you say we go chow down?

355
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,176
[laughing]

356
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:27,476
What's the deal?

357
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,443
When did those two
become friends?

358
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:30,909
[laughing]

359
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:37,343
It really is an honor
that you're letting

360
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:40,209
me hang out with you, Saotome.

361
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,276
Yeah, I know.

362
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:43,009
And if you keep
these lunches coming,

363
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,243
I'll keep my mouth zipped about
you being the Masked Stalker.

364
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:49,976
Thank you, thank
you, oh, thank you.

365
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:52,709
Oh, 1,000 times, thank
you, Oh Great One.

366
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:53,809
Thank you.

367
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:56,176
OK, not so hard and
don't use your nails.

368
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:59,343
Whatever you desire.

369
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:04,176
If you don't mind me saying,
you do seem a little tense.

370
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:06,043
A little to the left.

371
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:08,943
Oh, yeah, right there.

372
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:12,876
I have just the thing to
help hammer out that knot.

373
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:14,109
Sure.

374
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:17,076
Even though you're a
certifiable dork, you're A-OK.

375
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,276
Why thank you.

376
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:20,843
Oh man, I forgot.

377
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:22,009
I'm supposed to play soccer.

378
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,076
Catch you later.

379
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,543
[crazy laughter]

380
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:32,550
Ah!

381
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,999
[theme music]

382
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,867
AKANE (VOICEOVER): On
a dark, rainy night,

383
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:21,267
it came with a pair of pantyhose
wrapped around its neck.

384
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:25,700
Next time on Ranma 1/2, The
Demon From Jusenkyo, Part One.

385
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,833
We'll see you there.
