1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:02,133
[music playing]

2
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:41,528
Ranma, I'm attending
training camp in Hokkaido.

3
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,028
I'll be back in three days.

4
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:46,328
I challenge you to a match
at the usual vacant lot.

5
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:47,362
Don't be late.

6
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:48,495
Ryoga.

7
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:50,928
Yeah right, don't
be late he says.

8
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:52,928
Meanwhile, it's 10 days later.

9
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:56,662
Huh?

10
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,228
What?

11
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:01,195
Is it an earthquake?

12
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:04,828
What's going on?

13
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:07,462
From the Depth of
Despair, Part one.

14
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:14,828
Now where am I?

15
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:19,462
Trust somebody with your
lousy sense of direction

16
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:20,995
to come popping
out of the ground.

17
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:23,262
It's been a long
time, hasn't it, Ranma?

18
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,062
I hope you brought
your crying towel

19
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:27,462
because you won't stand a chance
against the new move I picked

20
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:28,628
up.

21
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:29,662
Well then, this
sounds interesting.

22
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:31,362
Now let's just see you try it.

23
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:37,295
What's that all about?

24
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,262
Here I come!

25
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:41,095
Shishi hokodan.

26
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:44,477
Huh?

27
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:54,628
This technique's more
powerful then I imagined.

28
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:55,928
Lucky shot huh?

29
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:57,528
But the match is just starting.

30
00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:58,695
Come on.

31
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,028
Fine with me Ranma.

32
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:01,828
I'll let you be my punching bag.

33
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,995
I don't think so!

34
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:16,928
I'll get you this time!

35
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,862
Now you're making me mad!

36
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:23,862
This is incredible.

37
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:26,628
But it should be even more
powerful then it is now.

38
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:29,162
OK, I'll try it again.

39
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:35,528
Shishi hoko-- Hello?

40
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:36,562
Hi Ryoga.

41
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:39,295
Haven't seen you for a while.

42
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:40,562
Ranma?

43
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,662
Ranma wasn't in any
state to be walking.

44
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:44,828
So I decided to pack him home.

45
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:46,328
How'd he get like this?

46
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:49,862
Oh my, what in the
world happened to Ranma?

47
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,628
Ranma was letting
me practice on him.

48
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:54,828
But I guess I must have gotten
carried away on the little guy.

49
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,595
Really sorry about that Ranma.

50
00:03:56,628 --> 00:04:00,562
Oh my, that was nice of you to
let him practice on you Ranma.

51
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:03,595
Ryoga, we're not done.

52
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:07,128
The match isn't-- oh!

53
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,362
Shishi hokodan?

54
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:09,595
The lion roar shot?

55
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:11,128
Never heard of that
martial arts move.

56
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:14,328
Impressive, being
able to defeat Ranma.

57
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:15,895
It is impressive.

58
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:18,862
But I think Ranma lost the match
on purpose, for my benefit.

59
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:20,962
How admirably modest.

60
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,295
Young people these days
are so arrogant they

61
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:24,662
could use your modesty.

62
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:28,262
You've shown some
dramatic improvement Ryoga.

63
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:30,428
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like to take a bath.

64
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:31,262
Huh?

65
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:31,736
Hmm.

66
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:32,262
Hmm.

67
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,162
Hmm.

68
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:41,528
Finally, I beat Ranma,
for the first time ever.

69
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:45,462
I beat Ranma for
the first time ever!

70
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,162
Why is Ryoga in
such a good mood?

71
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,328
He was just skipping all
the way down the hall.

72
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:49,928
Hmm.

73
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,595
Cheer up, will you Ranma?

74
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,062
It wasn't as if
you lost a match.

75
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,795
It was just a
practice after all.

76
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:01,795
Maybe it was a practice,
but I was serious.

77
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:03,795
I went after Ryoga.

78
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,595
But I couldn't even
lay a finger on him.

79
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:07,828
That lion roar shot.

80
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:11,328
I'm going to find out more
about that new move of his.

81
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:21,410
Hmm?

82
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:28,195
Did you want something Ranma?

83
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,062
What's that?

84
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:29,828
Why the mystery?

85
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,128
It's a scroll.

86
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,462
And beyond that it's
none of your business,

87
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,462
Come on, let me see.

88
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:38,162
Well then, just tell me where
you learned that lion roar

89
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:38,695
thing.

90
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,095
Look at you.

91
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:41,295
You're desperate to find
out about this new move I

92
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:42,128
picked up.

93
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:43,195
OK, I'll tell you.

94
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:46,828
It all started one
day about a week ago.

95
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:48,928
I was walking deep
in the mountains.

96
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:50,928
You mean you were lost again.

97
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:54,028
One night I was camping out
in a cave I'd come across.

98
00:05:57,528 --> 00:05:58,395
Oh no!

99
00:05:58,428 --> 00:05:59,895
A landslide.

100
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:01,762
All right, there's
one thing to use

101
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,095
and that's my bakusai tenketsu.

102
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:06,395
Bakusai tenketsu is
martial art technique

103
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:07,762
used for breaking rock.

104
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:13,795
This technique strike that
breaking point of the rock

105
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:15,095
and shatter it.

106
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,128
It didn't work.

107
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:22,595
The landslide just keeps
barreling down the mountain.

108
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:26,462
The ground is too brittle It's
useless to break it all up.

109
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:27,928
Huh?

110
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:30,928
You'll have to blast it
with something more powerful.

111
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,828
He was a civil engineer
from the town nearby.

112
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:35,662
The shishi hokodan?

113
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,528
I got the scroll right here.

114
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:38,762
You want to try it?

115
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,528
I'm sure you'll
be able to do it.

116
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:42,328
You look like a
talented young man.

117
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:59,828
I don't believe my eyes.

118
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:03,328
So it only took you one
night to get the move down?

119
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:06,795
It seems the engineer
was right about my talent.

120
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:10,895
Not much of a move if it
only took one night to get.

121
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:14,195
As it turns out, this move
is unlike my other technique

122
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,795
bakusai tenketsu.

123
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:20,262
It can be used on
people as well as rocks.

124
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:21,562
Huh, this is getting good.

125
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:22,895
You just wait.

126
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:26,562
And I'll beat that new
lion roar shot of yours.

127
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:28,395
Oh, I forgot to
tell you one thing.

128
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:29,928
Huh?

129
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:32,562
I still haven't
completely mastered it yet.

130
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:33,695
Huh?

131
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:35,862
You mean it'll
get more powerful?

132
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:38,095
Now you've got something
to look forward to Ranma.

133
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:40,628
I'll master this lion
roar shot move of mine

134
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:42,562
and defeat you once and for all.

135
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,495
[laughter]

136
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:49,395
What's that?

137
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,895
The shishi hokodan technique?

138
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,528
You must know about it.

139
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:54,728
Like the secret of the move.

140
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:56,362
Of course I know.

141
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:58,228
But why are you asking about it?

142
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:00,328
So I can beat Ryoga!

143
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:03,195
So Ryoga's involved?

144
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:04,128
All right.

145
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,428
But first you'll
have to practice.

146
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:07,762
Ready?

147
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:10,262
Cross both your fists
in front of your chest.

148
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:11,495
You mean like this?

149
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,428
No, much tighter.

150
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:15,128
Now you must focus your ki.

151
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:19,095
There it is.

152
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,462
That concentration
wouldn't stand

153
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,662
a chance against an alley cat.

154
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:28,828
I'll just give it another go.

155
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:29,995
Shishi hokodan!

156
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:35,262
Huh?

157
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:36,462
I figured as much.

158
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,295
I don't think you're ready
for this move quite yet.

159
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:40,528
If Ryoga can handle
it then so can I!

160
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,962
You and Ryoga are different.

161
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:44,295
He has a hidden source to tap.

162
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:46,028
He has a hidden source?

163
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:48,462
Don't take this wrong,
but you don't have

164
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,928
what it takes to handle it.

165
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,928
So don't waste your time.

166
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:52,395
Wait!

167
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:53,128
Granny!

168
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:56,128
Just give it up!

169
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:59,428
If Ryoga can handle this move
but I can't then that would

170
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:00,128
mean--

171
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:01,995
[laughter]

172
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:07,095
Then that would mean
Ryoga's going to beat me!

173
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:16,395
Help!

174
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:18,928
We've got a problem.

175
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:21,862
The school's future is at stake.

176
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,095
I don't need a weakling
like you Ranma.

177
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:25,028
Huh?

178
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:26,262
Ryoga, you're the
strong one here.

179
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:27,962
Defend our school
against this brute.

180
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,795
Coming.

181
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:30,795
Shishi hokodan.

182
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:36,328
Oh my a home run.

183
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,862
You are so strong Ryoga.

184
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:40,662
Oh, I can't believe
my good fortune

185
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:43,428
in having Ryoga as
my future son-in-law.

186
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:44,395
Huh?

187
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,862
Hey pop--

188
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:50,262
Ranma, it's all your fault
for letting Ryoga beat you.

189
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:53,728
Now all my dreams are
completely shattered.

190
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:56,562
It's not all that bad.

191
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:57,995
How miserable Ranma.

192
00:09:58,028 --> 00:09:59,295
Huh?

193
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:01,495
It seems the only talent you
have is eating free meals.

194
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:02,962
Ryoga's right.

195
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:05,228
All you do is sit around
eating up our food every day.

196
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:08,662
We can't afford to let you
people keep sponging off us

197
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,495
like this anymore.

198
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,395
We don't have much rice left
to last us the rest of the month

199
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:14,695
either.

200
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:17,295
And we do have a
son-in-law lined up already.

201
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:18,495
Leave us alone!

202
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:20,695
Come on you guys!

203
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,228
Wait a minute!

204
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,395
I've made up my mind.

205
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:35,128
Now I have the confidence
to propose do Akane.

206
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,862
Ryoga, is it true
you defeated Ranma?

207
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:41,428
Yes, I finally became
worthy of your love.

208
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:43,828
And I did it all for you.

209
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:46,128
Oh, you're so strong and brave.

210
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:46,610
Ryoga.

211
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,262
Akane!

212
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:59,395
Hey, what you doing Ryoga?

213
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:00,428
Huh?

214
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:01,028
Akane.

215
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,695
Are you OK Ryoga?

216
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:12,262
Sure, stuff like that
happens all the time.

217
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:14,728
Well, that was perfect timing
because there's something

218
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:17,062
I want to talk to you about.

219
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:20,195
Akane, I wanted to talk
to you about something too.

220
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:20,795
Yeah?

221
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:27,162
Um--

222
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:46,597
Akane, I'd like to ask you--

223
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,230
Ranma seems so
depressed these days.

224
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:49,630
And I don't know why .

225
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:52,430
He's been like that since
that practice with you.

226
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:54,230
Did something happen?

227
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,997
Um, kind of.

228
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,330
Speaking of which Akane,
now that you know I'm

229
00:11:58,364 --> 00:11:59,564
stronger than Ranma, will you--

230
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:00,297
Ryoga!

231
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,697
Yes?

232
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,430
Hey Ryoga, could you try
to cheer up Ranma for me?

233
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:06,830
Huh?

234
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:08,930
You've known Ranma for
longer than anyone else.

235
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:11,097
And I think that in
a situation like this

236
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,030
there's only one thing
that'll cheer him up,

237
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,064
kind words from a
friend like you.

238
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:27,864
Ryoga!

239
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:32,964
I've been looking for you Ryoga!

240
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:38,164
Let me see that new lion roar
shot of yours one more time.

241
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:38,997
Leave me alone.

242
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,797
I'm not in the mood for this.

243
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,597
What do you mean,
not in the mood?

244
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,964
Show me!

245
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,330
You're getting on my nerves.

246
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:46,964
Show me!

247
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:47,430
Show me!

248
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,030
Show me!

249
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:48,497
Show me!

250
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:49,097
Show me!

251
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,564
Show me!

252
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:50,164
Show me!

253
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:50,630
Show me!

254
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,564
Show me!

255
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:54,864
Why you-- shishi hokodan!

256
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,797
That'll teach Ranma for
not leaving me alone.

257
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:11,730
He seems to have gotten
more powerful than before.

258
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:14,964
Yes, but just wait till
I fully mastered it.

259
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:18,664
He's almost mastered
the lion roar shot?

260
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,897
I better act fast.

261
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,130
Ryoga!

262
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:26,964
Huh?

263
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:29,697
Hi sweetie.

264
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,430
Hi sweetie?

265
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:32,497
What you got there?

266
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,430
Secret fighting moves?

267
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,564
Have we met before?

268
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,530
I've been admiring
you from a distance.

269
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:41,464
I'm your number one fan.

270
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:42,464
My number one fan?

271
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:45,130
I've never even noticed you.

272
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:47,264
No duh, Sherlock.

273
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:48,797
Ryoga!

274
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,397
I heard that you defeated
that strong guy Ranma Saotome.

275
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,497
Is it true?

276
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,997
Yeah, I guess.

277
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,230
Too cool!

278
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:58,297
And the secrets of your
power are written in there?

279
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,430
You're pretty clever.

280
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,397
Show me.

281
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,330
Pretty please.

282
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:02,130
Pretty please.

283
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:03,030
I want to see.

284
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:03,597
I want to see.

285
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,164
Pretty please.

286
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:07,997
OK, I'll answer your request
and show you my new lion roar

287
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,264
shot.

288
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:14,164
Uh, I want to see the writings
not the actual maneuver.

289
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:14,997
Stand back.

290
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,164
I don't want you to get hurt.

291
00:14:16,197 --> 00:14:17,364
But--

292
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:18,864
Shishi hokodan.

293
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,564
What was that?

294
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,730
That's strange.

295
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,097
It's never happened
to me before.

296
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:27,797
No big deal.

297
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,664
It happens to everyone.

298
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:31,430
Shishi hokodan.

299
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:35,930
huh?

300
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:37,397
Come on, concentrate harder.

301
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,730
Let's see you do it.

302
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:41,730
If I screw this up
again she's going

303
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:43,230
to think I'm a total loser.

304
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:48,697
Uh-oh.

305
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,997
I did it.

306
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,479
Huh?

307
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,564
This isn't good.

308
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,630
Ranma!

309
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:03,797
why you-- How dare you trick me?

310
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:09,464
You'll pay!

311
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:12,364
No not again!

312
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,097
Sweet potatoes for sale.

313
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,130
They're hot.

314
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,664
Come and get them.

315
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:20,730
Oh, this can't be happening.

316
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:22,564
Ryoga's going to beat
me again and there's

317
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:25,164
nothing I can do to stop him.

318
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:26,597
Ranma!

319
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,630
What's wrong?

320
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,797
You have Akane here all worried.

321
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,364
Look alive Ranma.

322
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,530
Come on.

323
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,697
Will you people
just leave me alone?

324
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:41,230
I don't know.

325
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:42,464
He seems pretty normal.

326
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:44,997
Yeah, I'd have to agree.

327
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,397
I just did Ryoga's
lion roar shot.

328
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,864
Why did I suddenly get it?

329
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:51,197
What's with this move?

330
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:01,930
Shishi--

331
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:04,530
Why don't you take a
break for awhile Ranma?

332
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,764
Hoko--

333
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,830
Ugh, you haven't slept yet.

334
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:08,312
Dan!

335
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:16,864
What am I'm doing wrong?

336
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:19,930
The only time I could
do it was last night

337
00:16:19,964 --> 00:16:22,097
and that was just
by total fluke.

338
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,564
I don't know how he expects
to be able to concentrate

339
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:25,997
for so long.

340
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,564
How can I get back that
heavy ki I felt last night?

341
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:32,230
Not getting
anywhere, huh Ranma?

342
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:33,364
Huh?

343
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:34,730
What are you doing here?

344
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:37,697
Ranma, your days of
defeating me are over.

345
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,930
And I mean forever.

346
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:46,230
Ranma, does this mean--
did Ryoga beat you?

347
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:49,797
Yes Ranma lost to me two times.

348
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,230
I didn't lose in
a formal match!

349
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:04,530
Uh--

350
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:05,730
Hey, I did it again.

351
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,064
But how?

352
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,064
Oh, wait a second.

353
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,630
Last night my ki felt so
heavy because I didn't

354
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:16,230
want to lose Ryoga's match.

355
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:21,430
Heavy ki, heavy ki, heavy ki,
heavy ki, heavy, heavy, heavy--

356
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:22,397
heavy heart.

357
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,697
Heavy heart, heavy heart.

358
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,830
That means the
shishi hokodan, it

359
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:28,764
uses the depressive
power of a heavy art

360
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,697
to project a heavy
ki on the opponent.

361
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,730
Doesn't it?

362
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,597
You figured it out!

363
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,197
Now what have I done?

364
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,664
I just gave him the key to the
only move I have to defeat him.

365
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:40,097
Thanks for your help.

366
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,164
Now the move is mine.

367
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:43,697
But I still haven't
mastered it myself.

368
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,730
Here goes!

369
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:51,164
Shishi hokodan!

370
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,697
I'm so depressed!

371
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:03,397
I got confident and
my ki evaporated.

372
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,897
What a fool.

373
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:09,430
I'm still not good enough.

374
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,030
Oh!

375
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,830
Yes, it worked.

376
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:15,964
OK Ranma, you got me.

377
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:18,330
Shishi hokodan.

378
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,330
Ah!

379
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:24,297
Shishi hokodan!

380
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,697
Shishi hokodan!

381
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,664
Shishi hokodan!

382
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:32,864
Shishi hokodan!

383
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:47,997
Isn't it a little early in the
morning for all this racket?

384
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,964
Ranma and Ryoga, I
understand that young men

385
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,530
want to stay up
all night fighting

386
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,797
to prove their strength.

387
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,830
I know all too well
because it's Saotome

388
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:57,630
and I used to be just the same.

389
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:00,697
But on the other hand,
you've destroyed my wall.

390
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,130
Take your fighting
somewhere else.

391
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:07,897
Ryoga, I'm getting balled
out here because of you.

392
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,130
That wasn't my intention.

393
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:10,630
But I must say that
you're the one who

394
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:12,597
started this whole thing.

395
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,430
My ki is so heavy.

396
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:14,330
Wait.

397
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:15,797
guys, let's talk huh?

398
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,264
Hmm?

399
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:16,964
Come on.

400
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:18,564
Let's talk.

401
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:19,297
Shishi hokodan!

402
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,530
It's a homer.

403
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,464
I hope he'll be
home for breakfast.

404
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:31,397
Shishi hokodan!

405
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,097
Shishi hokodan!

406
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,197
How foolish, fighting
with the lion roar shot.

407
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,397
Granny.

408
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,230
That move is accompanied
by unhappiness.

409
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,797
Whoever masters the technique
of the lion roar shot

410
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,897
will have his
happiness shattered.

411
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,997
Surely as a lion being
tossed down a cliff

412
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,897
suffers the tragic loss
of its entire kingdom.

413
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,497
Which brings us back to Ranma.

414
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,464
He doesn't seem to
be faring too well.

415
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,197
I've always been
defeated by you Ranma.

416
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,564
Shishi hokodan!

417
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:04,197
What's worse, I have
no sense of direction!

418
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,597
Shishi hokodan!

419
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,130
To top it off, I don't
have a girlfriend!

420
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,130
Shishi hokodan!

421
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:16,164
You call that a problem?

422
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:18,097
Well get a load of the
troubles that I have.

423
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,530
When I'm doused with
water I turn into a girl.

424
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:24,630
Now that's what I call misery.

425
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:27,064
You've got to stop Ranma.

426
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:28,297
Call that misery?

427
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,864
So what if you turn into a girl?

428
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,964
Do have any idea
what happens to me?

429
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,797
I turn into-- I turn
into-- that's what.

430
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,564
Ranma!

431
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:41,697
You're mine!

432
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,864
Victory is mine.

433
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:51,664
Proving that when it
comes to misery you

434
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:53,830
don't stand a chance against me.

435
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:56,864
Ryoga, you trying to run away?

436
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:58,397
What?

437
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,464
This match isn't over yet.

438
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,097
I'll fight you
again in one week.

439
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,397
Oh no you don't Ranma.

440
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,330
This has gone on too long.

441
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,330
It's ridiculous!

442
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:07,797
Just you wait.

443
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,030
I'll prove that I'm the
all time king of misery.

444
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:12,430
I'll take you on.

445
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:15,197
I want to see how well you can
do without the secret writings.

446
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,930
Just as I feared, they've
learned the secret.

447
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:20,397
Now they're consumed with
tapping into their misery

448
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,797
to make the move work.

449
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,297
Let's hope they don't
completely master the move

450
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,130
or they'll live to regret it.

451
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:26,897
What?

452
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,530
They haven't mastered it?

453
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:31,930
It's powerful enough as it is.

454
00:21:31,964 --> 00:21:34,130
What'll happen when they
completely master it?

455
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:20,272
A move where the more miserable
you are the more powerful

456
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:21,272
it gets.

457
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:23,506
Can Ranma beat Ryoga's
lion roar shot?

458
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:27,472
Next time on "Ranma 1/2," From
the Depth of Despair part two.

459
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,106
We'll see you there.
