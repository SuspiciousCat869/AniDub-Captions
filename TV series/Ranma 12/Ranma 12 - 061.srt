nothing more than her pet.

I'm going to turn

into a pig in front of Akane.

104
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:05,682
-Why not kill me and
get it over with?

105
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:11,715
-What the--

106
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:15,815
RYOGA: I didn't feel it.

107
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:19,382
I must be imagining it.

108
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,782
-Hey, what's the
matter with you?

109
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:26,482
Am I the only one who's
noticed you're all wet?

110
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,082
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
It's not a dream.

111
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:33,848
This means-- this means
that I'm cured of the pig.

112
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:36,348
Which means we're
equal he and I. No.

113
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:39,848
I'm even more equal.

114
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:40,382
-Akane, I--

115
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:41,715
-Yes.

116
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,482
-Read that letter I gave you.

117
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:47,715
Read it, and you'll
know my true feelings.

118
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,882
We'll discuss it later.

119
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:50,982
-But why?

120
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:52,915
Why didn't he change
when he got wet?

121
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:53,915
Why didn't he?

122
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,848
-The ink's bled
all over the page.

123
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:00,448
-Why didn't you change, huh?

124
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:01,282
Tell me.

125
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:02,215
-That boy.

126
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:03,948
He use Shampoo's
soap without ask.

127
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:11,948
-Oh, Akane.

128
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,115
At last our time has come.

129
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:16,282
I don't know why,
but for some reason,

130
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:19,515
I'm no longer changing
when I get wet.

131
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:23,582
Meaning that, in
other words, Akane,

132
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:24,982
tell me that you'll be my girl.

133
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,782
-I'll finally be able to
ask her to go out with me.

134
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:35,715
-Check it out.

135
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:38,415
You really are cured
of the pig, aren't you?

136
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:39,382
-Ranma.

137
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:40,882
-So what's your secret?

138
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,148
You wouldn't hold out
on pal, would you?

139
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:47,382
-Wouldn't I. Besides
there's nothing to tell you.

140
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:48,282
-Ah, come on.

141
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:49,348
Don't play hard to get.

142
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:50,482
Who's your best buddy, huh?

143
00:07:50,582 --> 00:07:52,248
-You're not my buddy.

144
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:55,082
-I am begging you on my
hands and knees here.

145
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:57,315
-You're on top of
my head, you jerk.

146
00:07:57,415 --> 00:08:01,248
Jet blast!

147
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,415
I got nothing else
to say to you, Ranma.

148
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:07,082
The one I want is Akane.

149
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:09,282
Oh, where can you be?

150
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:11,948
Where are you, Akane?

151
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:13,248
-Hi there.

152
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:14,248
-Ahh!

153
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:16,782
-I'm, uh, glad we
ran into each other.

154
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:19,848
So aren't you going to tell
me what was in the letter?

155
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,682
-I've kind of forgot.

156
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,582
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): What's
the matter with you?

157
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:24,915
Do you want her to
think you're a coward?

158
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,015
Why don't you just say it?

159
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:27,382
Say it.

160
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:28,648
-Akane, listen.

161
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:29,582
-I'm listening.

162
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:35,382
-I-- I-- uh, that is-- ooh, uh.

163
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,282
I mean-- will you-- ahh!

164
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:39,248
I can't say it.

165
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:40,715
I can't say it.

166
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:43,115
I can't say it.

167
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:44,882
-Ryoga?

168
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,948
RANMA: Waterproof soap?

169
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:47,548
SHAMPOO: Used to wash body.

170
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,848
And no change when get wet.

171
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:52,615
Only Shampoo lose it at
the public bathhouse.

172
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:56,948
-Which goes to explain Ryoga's
sudden change in fortune.

173
00:08:57,048 --> 00:09:00,315
-Shampoo use anything
get it back from him.

174
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,815
-What-- what are
you going to do?

175
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,882
I mean you're not going
to shoot him, are you?

176
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:06,082
-Shoot with this.

177
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,482
[sigh]

178
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:08,548
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Akane.

179
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,515
Oh, Akane.

180
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:14,782
Huh?

181
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:16,982
An arrow?

182
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:19,715
To Ryoga Hibiki.

183
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,815
This is-- this
is-- this is-- this

184
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:23,582
is a letter from
my beloved Akane.

185
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:30,682
A wonderland of pools and open
air baths, Healthy Leisure

186
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:31,215
Land.

187
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:32,182
I Admit one.

188
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:39,215
This means she's
inviting me on a date.

189
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:40,282
Ah.

190
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:41,182
It's good to be alive.

191
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:44,682
Oh, Akane!

192
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:58,115
Made it.

193
00:09:58,215 --> 00:10:00,015
It's a good thing that I
left as early as I did.

194
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,515
At least, I think that
this is the right place.

195
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,148
"Meet you on the boy's side.

196
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:12,748
Love your Akane.

197
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:15,182
PS-- don't forget to bring soap.

198
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,148
Teehee."

199
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:19,615
Asking to meet on
this side of the bath,

200
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:22,382
Akane's not usually like that.

201
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:23,715
Oh yeah, right.

202
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:25,082
I almost forgot.

203
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,482
Hopefully, this
guide will tell me

204
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,148
where's a good place for a date.

205
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:30,615
The most important
thing is mood.

206
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:31,482
OK.

207
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:34,215
That sounds-- gah!

208
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:35,648
-You never fear.

209
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:37,282
Cupid twins is here.

210
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:38,615
-T-t-twins?

211
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:39,648
[giggling]

212
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:40,189
-She's Cu.

213
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,082
I'm Pid.

214
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,848
Do you want us to
wash your back?

215
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:44,748
-Buh, b-b-back.

216
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:45,915
You mean as in mine?

217
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:01,582
-Oh, what a big
strong back you have.

218
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:03,582
I'll bet the girls
must go ga-ga for you.

219
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:04,815
Eh, big stud.

220
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:05,582
OK.

221
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:07,548
And now to wash your hair.

222
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:08,215
There it is.

223
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:08,915
The waterproof soap.

224
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:14,782
See you later, alligator.

225
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,715
-Not for awhile, crocodile.

226
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:22,582
Soap belong me, not you.

227
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,515
Come get if can.

228
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:25,282
-Ah.

229
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:26,948
I just want to borrow it.

230
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:27,615
Come on.

231
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:28,515
Don't be so greedy.

232
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:29,448
I'll give it back.

233
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:30,615
I promise.

234
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,515
Come on, Shampoo.

235
00:11:31,615 --> 00:11:33,682
SHAMPOO: Nuh-uh.

236
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,248
-And with this waterproof soap.

237
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:38,315
I'll never have to
turn into a girl again.

238
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:44,315
-Waterproof soap?

239
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:45,582
-It's cold.

240
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:46,123
Shampoo.

241
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:51,548
-Ah-ha.

242
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:55,782
So this is the reason I
don't change when I get wet.

243
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,182
Ha, ha.

244
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:58,848
Now that I know what it does,
I'll never let go of this soap.

245
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:04,182
KASUMI: I guess it
is kind of nice.

246
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,448
-I don't know, Akane.

247
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:06,948
Therapeutic baths?

248
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:08,215
Are we kind of young.

249
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:09,248
-Ah, who cares?

250
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:11,015
So long as it's fun,
what's it matter?

251
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:11,556
RANMA: Cat.

252
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:12,082
Cat.

253
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:12,523
Cat.

254
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:13,023
Cat.

255
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:13,523
Cat.

256
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:14,023
Cat.

257
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:23,015
-What are you doing?

258
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:23,848
-Akane.

259
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:25,215
What-- what are you doing here?

260
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:26,682
-That's what I want to know.

261
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:31,748
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Akane's late.

262
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:35,748
I sure hope she hasn't changed
her mind about the date.

263
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:38,115
RANMA: All right.

264
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,215
Sorry, pal.

265
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:44,948
RANMA (VOICEOVER): So
long as I've got this,

266
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:46,682
I can splash myself all I want.

267
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:51,482
What?

268
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:52,515
What did I do?

269
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:53,282
RYOGA: [laughing].

270
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:57,315
Yeah, right, Ranma.

271
00:12:57,415 --> 00:13:00,948
Like I'd let you walk
off with the original.

272
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,515
-Why you.

273
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,915
This soap was a gift
to me from the gods.

274
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:06,982
I'll never let go of it.

275
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,448
It's from Akane.

276
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:13,948
Please note new meeting place.

277
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,115
I'm on my way.

278
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:15,915
-Ranma.

279
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,348
-Shampoo?

280
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,048
-Shampoo fix real date
for Akane and Ryoga.

281
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:21,115
-Huh?

282
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:24,482
-If he get Akane,
then he give us soap.

283
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,482
-I suppose you
got a point there.

284
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:34,015
-Meet at outdoor
waterfalls is OK.

285
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:35,315
But meet who?

286
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,182
There's no one here.

287
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:41,048
-Akane.

288
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:43,248
-Hi, Ryoga.

289
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:44,215
-Hi, Akane.

290
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:50,482
Thanks for inviting me
on a date today, Akane.

291
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:52,015
-Huh.

292
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,415
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Him on a date?

293
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:54,782
But I thought that he--

294
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:57,282
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER): Meet
at outdoor waterfalls.

295
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:59,682
Is OK.

296
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:00,648
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Aha.

297
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:02,448
Now what's Shampoo up to?

298
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:06,848
-A squid?

299
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:12,815
-She pid.

300
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:14,748
Me Cu.

301
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:19,115
-Otherwise known as the
Cupid twins of love.

302
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:23,148
That's right get all
that nasty ink off.

303
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:23,982
-OK.

304
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:25,648
I'll even use my special soap.

305
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,615
-Sucker.

306
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:28,582
Hand it over.

307
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:29,882
-That soap mine.

308
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:30,548
-Shampoo.

309
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:31,248
Ranma.

310
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,215
What are you two up to?

311
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,048
-So it's you too.

312
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:39,248
-So you saw through
our disguise?

313
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:40,715
-Big deal.

314
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,048
-Ugh.

315
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,682
I may have fallen for your
trick once, but I guarantee you,

316
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,448
you won't trick me again.

317
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:46,982
-What matter, Ryoga.

318
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:50,582
You know want kiss me?

319
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,915
-Of course, but--

320
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:53,515
-OK now.

321
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:55,348
Close eye.

322
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,982
-OK.

323
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,382
-He fell for it.

324
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,915
-How dare you pretend to
be me, and use my voice.

325
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:04,715
I sound nothing like that.

326
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:08,282
-Where'd he hide
the stupid soap?

327
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,715
-Ryoga, are you OK?

328
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:11,648
-Butt out.

329
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:12,215
Will ya?

330
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:13,382
-You butt out.

331
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,615
You set me and poor
Ryoga up on a date,

332
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,215
just so that you
could steal his soap.

333
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:18,448
-It wasn't like that.

334
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:21,915
-It exactly like that.

335
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:23,515
-I'd expect this from Shampoo.

336
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:26,382
But Ranma, how could you?

337
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:28,882
-I can explain.

338
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:30,615
-Consider one thing.

339
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,415
While you and Shampoo
are up to no good,

340
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,715
Ryoga and I will be on our date.

341
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:36,256
-Akane.

342
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,115
-Ryoga, you're finally awake.

343
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:50,848
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

344
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:52,582
I'm here.

345
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:54,515
Akane's here.

346
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:55,982
-This wouldn't be
a date, would it?

347
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:57,815
-Sure is.

348
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,215
-Yes!

349
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:00,982
So where do you
want me to take you?

350
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:03,148
-I don't know.

351
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:03,689
-OK.

352
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:04,582
OK.

353
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:05,382
That's what the
guide's here for.

354
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:06,148
Let me see.

355
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,282
Romantic date spots.

356
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:08,915
I got it.

357
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:09,915
Let's go to movie.

358
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,648
-Kind of like a
haunted house, huh.

359
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:18,615
-Oh wait a minute.

360
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:21,615
Where's the popcorn?

361
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:22,182
-Jeez.

362
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,448
That dumb Akane.

363
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,948
Couldn't they have found a
place a little less dark?

364
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:28,748
-Sometimes, dark places good.

365
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:29,289
-Ah!

366
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:33,248
-Akane!

367
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:36,482
Akane, where are you?

368
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:37,915
Akane!

369
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:38,882
Where are you?

370
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,015
Akane?

371
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:45,515
-Where you hide soap, stupid?

372
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,448
-So now, what are you up to?

373
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,082
-Well, excuse me for breaking
up you and Ryoga's fun.

374
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:54,248
Here I got a good reason too,
but I bet you won't believe me.

375
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,382
-Reason?

376
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,748
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): To
stand here and ignore

377
00:16:56,848 --> 00:17:01,182
all Akane's signals would
mean that I'm not a man.

378
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:03,582
Oh, Akane.

379
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:06,682
Here she is taking
the iniative again.

380
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:08,315
-Waterproof soap?

381
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,415
-Yeah, and if I
get my hands on it,

382
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:12,515
I'll never have to
be a girl again.

383
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,815
So that's why--

384
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:16,848
-So that's why I supposedly
asked Ryoga out on a date.

385
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,915
So that you could be
selfish and get your hands

386
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:20,582
on that stupid soap.

387
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:21,348
-Right.

388
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:23,015
Didn't I already say that?

389
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:24,315
AKANE: Then, in that case.

390
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,315
Don't follow us.

391
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,148
Well, Ryoga.

392
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,482
Shall we?

393
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:32,715
-OK.

394
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:34,582
-We still no have soap.

395
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:35,582
-Come on, Akane.

396
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,048
Can't you just
leave Ryoga behind?

397
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:42,682
-You know what
you did back there

398
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:45,515
in that cave meant
a lot to me, Akane.

399
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:46,548
-It did.

400
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,015
-I want to tell you
that I-- that I--

401
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,148
-It's OK, Ryoga.

402
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:51,548
I know what you're trying to s--

403
00:17:51,648 --> 00:17:52,082
-No.

404
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:52,782
Don't speak.

405
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:54,148
Don't speak, my dear.

406
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,482
Allow me to take the lead.

407
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:57,282
-Hey, you jerk.

408
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:58,682
Put her down.

409
00:17:58,782 --> 00:17:59,223
-Look.

410
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:00,015
Look.

411
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,282
Now, they real couple for sure.

412
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,448
-Oh, why that sneaky little--

413
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,748
-If you want the
soap so much, Ranma,

414
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,282
then why don't you take it?

415
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:12,882
-Hiya.

416
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:14,382
You swallow soap.

417
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:16,915
-Try not to hold it
against me, huh, pal.

418
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:19,248
After all, with that soap,
you can get other girls,

419
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,915
so you won't mind
if I take Akane.

420
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:23,248
-You've got it all wrong.

421
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:25,315
You-- you don't understand.

422
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:25,915
-Good boy.

423
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,015
Spit up soap.

424
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:27,915
Good.

425
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:28,456
Good.

426
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:37,815
-At last, we can be alone.

427
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:38,615
Oh, Akane.

428
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:45,082
AKANE (VOICEOVER): He's, uh,
kind of a passionate guy.

429
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:46,748
-At last, you can be my girl.

430
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:50,348
Oh, Akane.

431
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:59,082
-That Ryoga, what
an idiot he is.

432
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:03,215
Imagine being attracted to
a mule-faced chick like you.

433
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:05,548
-Well, excuse me.

434
00:19:05,648 --> 00:19:07,382
Who's fault do you
think it is anyway

435
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:08,882
that poor Ryoga
thinks the two of us

436
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,215
have got some kind
of future together.

437
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:14,982
-Akane, I found you.

438
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:16,248
-Why do you keep running away?

439
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,815
Am I doing something wrong?

440
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,915
I thought that in that
in the cave that we--

441
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,582
-I, uh-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

442
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:25,915
-Why can't we go back
to the way we were.

443
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:26,456
Akane!

444
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:32,582
-Check it out.

445
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:38,010
For a guy who's never been in
love before, he's pretty funny.

446
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,610
-Haha, Ranma.

447
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,377
Why he's so funny he might
just crush me to death.

448
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:43,918
-Huh?

449
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,751
Akane.

450
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:54,877
Why does she keep
running away from me?

451
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,810
Tell me why.

452
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,210
AKANE: Ah!

453
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,344
Ryoga, please.

454
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:02,910
Please be more gentle with me.

455
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,644
I'm scared.

456
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,177
-Akane.

457
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:14,510
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): All
the time I spent with you.

458
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:21,451
No matter how kind you were to
me, or how much you loved me,

459
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,610
it was never enough
for my man's heart.

460
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:33,210
For the first time ever, my
Akane, I embrace you as a man.

461
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,977
-Hey, what in the
world are you doing

462
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:37,277
wearing Ranma's clothes, Akane.

463
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:38,677
-Not much.

464
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:40,110
We're going to go on ahead.

465
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,510
All right.

466
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,510
-Oh, Akane.

467
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,051
Akane!

468
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:45,959
Akane.

469
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:48,444
Are you--

470
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:49,877
-Was it good for you too?

471
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,544
Hey, waterproof soap.

472
00:20:59,210 --> 00:20:59,651
-Ranma!

473
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,677
You are a dead man.

474
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:13,810
-What do you know.

475
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:19,444
Looks like your soap ain't
so waterproof after all.

476
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,410
-This last time Shampoo
trust Jusenkyo products.

477
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,110
Is rip off.

478
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,377
-Well, you know what they say.

479
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:27,610
You get what you
pay for-- eh, not.

480
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,610
-I hate to say it, but after
seeing his true feelings

481
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,744
like that, I feel
sorry for whoever

482
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:35,544
ends up being
Ryoga's girlfriend.

483
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:39,010
RANMA: Good thing I sacrificed
myself for you, huh, Akane.

484
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,324
[theme music]

485
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,158
AKANE: Do you really get
to go to China if you win?

486
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:22,224
I think it's great that
everyone's competing, but--

487
00:23:22,324 --> 00:23:26,124
Next time on "Ranma 1/2," "The
Anything Goes Obstacle Course."

488
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:28,224
We'll see you there.
