00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,566
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I
don't understand why,

3
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:53,333
but every time summer
comes, I get depressed.

4
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,666
-OK class, it's time to
announce this year's class

5
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,600
representative.

6
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,600
And I've decided on Akane
Tendo to represent us

7
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,200
at the regional
swimming tournament.

8
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:09,433
-With you representing
us, Akane, we can't lose.

9
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,600
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

10
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,133
We can't lose.

11
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,900
-Why didn't she just say no?

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,333
What did you say yes for?

13
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,366
You can't even swim.

14
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,100
-How did I know he
was going to pick me?

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,600
-This tournament's gonna
be one big disaster.

16
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,033
-Akane, I came as
soon as I heard

17
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,200
the good news, my beloved one.

18
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,100
The vision of you
wearing a swimsuit.

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,333
My prayers have been answered.

20
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,100
Until then, my sweet.

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,566
-There is no way I am
letting anyone see me

22
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,666
in a bathing suit.

23
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:43,000
-Excuse me.

24
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,600
I know you can't swim,
Akane, so why don't you

25
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,500
just let me compete for you?

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,933
-What a great idea.

27
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,100
I mean, Ukyo is the best
swimmer in the school.

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,733
And besides, she
can be your body

29
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,633
double, if you catch my drift.

30
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,433
-And from what I've
seen in gym class,

31
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,666
she definitely
needs a body double.

32
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,866
[laughing]

33
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:01,600
-That's it.

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
I've changed my mind.

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Swimming with psychos.

36

ANNOUNCER: And now
it looks like we're

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,500
set for the women's
50 meter freestyle,

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,333
representing Furinkan
High in lane number three,

39
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,166
it's Akane Tendo.

40
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,833
In lane number four it's--

41
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:21,866
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Great.

42
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:25,533
Now what have I
gotten myself into?

43
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:26,733
Huh?

44
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,400
-No way, Akane.

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,200
Don't do it.

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,900
AKANE (VOICEOVER): So
what's up with him?

47
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:37,866
-Help!

48
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,266
Please!

49
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,800
I can't swim.

50
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,266
-Oh, my.

51
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:46,100
What have I done?

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,641
-Akane!

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,333
-Are you OK?

54
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,500
[coughing]

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,266
-If you no can swim,
then why you jump in?

56
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:01,166
That the most stupid
thing me ever see.

57
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:04,166
-You're the one who
pushed me in, you idiot.

58
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,766
-But me thinking you
know how to swim.

59
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,333
Me sorry.

60
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,500
Is the policy of the school
that no kid cam pass the gym

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,900
until they know how to swim.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Me just assume you already know.

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,233
-Yeah, right.

64
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,900
You just made that
rule up, didn't you?

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,833
-Me just get a great idea.

66
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,066
Me could be giving the
personal swimming lesson.

67
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:29,607
-Huh?

68
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:37,333
-Good for you, Akane.

69
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,933
-You'll finally
learn how to swim.

70
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,466
-So you're telling
me the principal's

71
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,300
going to teach you how to swim.

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Now this should be interesting.

73
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,766
-Uh, huh.

74
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,766
It'll be great.

75
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,300
Yeah.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,833
Hey, Ranma?

77
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,733
-I can't believe you're
taking lessons from him.

78
00:04:55,833 --> 00:05:00,866
-Because ever since I was
little I wanted to learn how.

79
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,933
Every summer there was one
thing that kept bothering me.

80
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:07,100
It didn't matter if
I was at the beach

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,000
or even if I had a
new bathing suit on.

82
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,500
I'd get so--

83
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,733
-Hey, don't let it get to you.

84
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,900
Even if you are a little,
a little overweight.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,441
-Ahh!

86
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,766
-Star light, star bright,
first star I see tonight.

87
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,633
I wish I may, I
wish I might, learn

88
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:30,400
how to swim and win
the lousy tournament.

89
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,100
-I still think Ukyo's
idea was better, Akane.

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,900
-I want you stay
out of this, Ranma.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,233
Even if I sink like a rock,
I don't want you butting in.

92
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,000
-A rock?

93
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,900
-Therefore we can conclude
that Shakespeare was--

94
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:54,433
-Excuse me, cretins,
but class is in session.

95
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:55,766
Make way.

96
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:56,700
Back.

97
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
Move it.

98
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,066
-Hey, baby, how'd you like to
buy on of these for 1,000 yen?

99
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,500
-How dare you?

100
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,166
-This just seems to
get easier every time.

101
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,733
-She was serious
about that rock thing.

102
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,400
-So what does she think
she's doing anyway?

103
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,800
-Lesson number one,
getting into the pool.

104
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,466
-How am I supposed to
learn with this on?

105
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,500
-Oh, to be swimming
with the fishes, Kiki.

106
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,966
But you must be trusting.

107
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,933
Into the pool.

108
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:50,474
-Huh?

109
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,733

[scream]

111
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,200
-There is a shark in the pool.

112
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,433
-That's right.

113

Little Kiki wins a kewpie doll.

114
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,000
Is the 20 foot blue shark.

115
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,966
Roaming mainly in
the warm waters,

116
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,700
the blue shark be caught then
be boiled into the delicious

117
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,633
paste be eating by all
peoples of the world.

118
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,433
-Hello!

119
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,533
There's a shark in the pool!

120
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,600
-No be worried.

121
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,900
He be the friend to
come for the visit.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,700
-I'm gone.

123
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,900
-Kiki wait.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,300
If you be leaving now, you
never learn how to swim.

125
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,841
-Huh?

126
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,366
-In the islands,
everybody be learning

127
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,200
to swim with the
rock on their back

128
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,200
and the shark nipping
at their heels.

129
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,733
-I'd say he's nuts.

130
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,300
-Yep.

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,700
Certifiable.

132
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,500
-Yes.

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,166
I'm beginning to understand.

134
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,166
Oh, principal.

135
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:18,066
-Take my hand and
let me guide you.

136
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,966
-Why don't you show me first?

137
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,400
-Oh, boy.

138
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,900
-I'd say he's shark bait.

139
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,766
-He's not coming up.

140
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:35,666
-Maybe he's dead.

141
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,400
-Now what?

142
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,566
-I think I'll just go home.

143
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,000
-Oh, I've got to save him.

144
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,433
-Hey, what does she
think she's doing?

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,833
-What?

146
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,833
I thought you were drowning.

147
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:02,374
Ah!

148
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,000
-Akane!

149
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,166
-No.

150
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,900
If you jump in there, you're
going to turn into a girl.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,466
-Oh, right.

152
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:12,007
I forgot.

153
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:12,507
Huh?

154
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,366
-Kiki, Akane, me know you be
coming through to save me.

155
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:27,666
Hey, Mr. Sharky, is it
time for the dinner?

156
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,400
-Ranma.

157
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,200
-So what do you
think you're doing?

158
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,666
-Hey, you be killing my shark.

159
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:46,666
-Ranma?

160
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,366
-How dare you be
interfering with me?

161
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:50,700
-You can't teach her like this.

162
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,200
What you think she is, huh?

163
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Some kind of total
idiot or something?

164
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,133
-Hey, Miss Akane be learning
to swim and me be teaching it.

165
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,366
-Are you nuts?

166
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,933
She's way too much of a
klutz to learn your way.

167
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:03,633
-Yes, she will.

168
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:04,533
Yes, she will.

169
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:05,166
Yes, she will.

170
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:05,800
-No, she won't.

171
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,400
No, she won't.

172
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,466
No, she won't.

173
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:12,633
-Ranma.

174
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:13,233
-Don't worry.

175
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:13,966
I'm OK.

176
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,066
-I've made up my mind.

177
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:15,700
Come on.

178
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,933
Let's do it.

179
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,900
That the spirit, Kiki.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,466
-Now we be getting to work.

181
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,466
ANNOUNCER: Your
attention please.

182
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,200
-Huh?

183
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,866
-Nice rubber band he's wearing.

184
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:30,466
-Uh, the delicate
Akane Tendo is not

185
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,766
suited for swimming
Western style.

186
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,300
Back in the 5th year
of the Kacho Age,

187
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,633
Yashita's fate was
determined by the swimming

188
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:41,700
ability of his opponent.

189
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,366
-Come on, Kiki, we no be
needing the history lesson.

190
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:47,100
-Don't you get swimming
is not a sport?

191
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,266
Swimming is a
military art, one that

192
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,533
should be learned from a
master, through discipline

193
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,333
and concentration.

194
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,000
Yield not to false
instructors, Akane Tendo,

195
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,200
but learn from a true
student of the arts.

196
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,066
This guy's the biggest
flake I've ever seen.

197
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,133
-Now you try it, Akane Tendo.

198
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,966
-Kuno, you're embarrassing.

199
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,733
-Aren't you forgetting
something, my love?

200
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,133
In order to marry one
such as I, the bride

201
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,333
must first master
the art of swimming.

202
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,866
-You must be nuts.

203
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:21,233
Huh?

204
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:21,774
Ah!

205
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,366
-Look, Ramna.

206
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:27,266
-Akane's done for.

207
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:30,774
-Ah!

208
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:46,642
Oh!

209
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:47,183
Ah!

210
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,698
-Now you will be
forever in my debt,

211
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,598
once I have saved
you from that beast.

212
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:07,498
-Look, the palm trees,
straight from the island.

213
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:08,039
-Ranma!

214
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,398
-Take that!

215
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:12,939
And that!

216
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:13,439
And that!

217
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:14,331
And that!

218
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:14,872
Ah!

219
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:16,565
Ah!

220
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:19,398
How dare you break the
sword of Tatewaki Kuno?

221
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:20,898
-Try this!

222
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:21,465
-What?

223
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:22,165
What do I do?

224
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:26,465
-Nice work.

225
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:27,365
-How dare you?

226
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,098
Circus work is beneath me.

227
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:30,365
-Look!

228
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:31,331
Look!

229
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:32,098
[scream]

230
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:33,765
-So, what's your problem?

231
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:35,231
-Ah!

232
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:37,665
Oh!

233
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,098
Ah!

234
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:42,498
-Boy, I didn't know
Kuno could swim so good.

235
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,298
-I can't hold it any longer.

236
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:57,565
-Ah!

237
00:12:57,665 --> 00:12:58,998
-Oh, getting tired.

238
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:04,098
-That was a close on, Ranma.

239
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:06,298
You almost got
caught, didn't you?

240
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:08,265
-Yeah, thanks, Ukyo.

241
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:08,806
-Ahh!

242
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,865
-Don't you think it's
about time you quit, Akane?

243
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,098
-Not until I learn.

244
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:22,298
-Oh, man.

245
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:26,265
I'll be killed before
you learn to swim, Akane.

246
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:31,665
-I said, not until I learn, I
think it's time we continue,

247
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:32,665
Principal.

248
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,598
It be time to take
me beloved Kiki

249
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,331
to the next level
of the learning.

250
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,865
Me call it the swan project.

251
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:43,365
-Yes, swans.

252
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:46,831
Like swans on a
crystal clear pond.

253
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:50,131
-Well, if you ask me, she looks
more like the ugly duckling.

254
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:51,931
-The best results
in the training

255
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,565
try the latest Indie fashion.
which Big Kahuna designed.

256
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:57,498
-You made this just for me?

257
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:58,231
-Uh, huh.

258
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:59,431
Yes.

259
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:03,698
To be learning the swan
project, you gotta be one.

260
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:05,665
-Just for me?

261
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,931
-Oh!

262
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,765
I'm not a swan.

263
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:30,931
I'm a duck!

264
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:32,798
You are an idiot!

265
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:34,865
-It's all a misunderstanding.

266
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:35,965
-Don't touch me.

267
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,531
Wait a second.

268
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,898
He did this all just for me.

269
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,131
[singing]

270
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:51,965
-I didn't know.

271
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,265
-Now you be understanding.

272
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,665
-That thing's supposed
to be a bathing suit?

273
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:57,365
-That's it.

274
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:58,298
I can't watch anymore.

275
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:04,698
-Get your Okanomiyaki here.

276
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:05,498
One at a time.

277
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:07,965
One at a time.

278
00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:12,398
-What I wouldn't do for one.

279
00:15:12,498 --> 00:15:15,131
-Miss Akane, Go!

280
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:18,539
-Akane!

281
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:22,931
Come on.

282
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,631
How do you expect her
to learn like that?

283
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:27,098
This is completely insane.

284
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:28,131
-Observe.

285
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:28,865
Switch on.

286
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,965
-What's happening?

287
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:38,698
-Hey, hey, look somehow
Akane's able to stay afloat.

288
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:41,331
-Just like he was talking about.

289
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:45,365
-Yes, and a graceful
swan at that.

290
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:46,765
-Yeah, right.

291
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,865
-I'd say she's lost it.

292
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:56,431
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Now what do I do?

293
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,631
-Get your stuffed
polar bears here.

294
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:00,631
Just 300 yen.

295
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,798
[coughing]

296
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:19,431
-I was just trying
to help, Akane.

297
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:21,998
-You nearly gave
me a heart attack.

298
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,431
-Well, then, I guess this means
you're going to pack it in,

299
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:25,065
right?

300
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:26,665
-Not on your life.

301
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:27,831
-Who are you?

302
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:35,298
-A transfer student?

303
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:37,131
-I uh, hate to
interrupt but isn't

304
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,698
it time for my next lesson?

305
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,131
-Ah!

306
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:41,231
Yes, Miss Akane.

307
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,565
Me almost forgot.

308
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:44,865
Me hope you be ready be ready
for the lesson number two

309
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:47,798
which me be calling
the mermaid project.

310
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:49,265
-Good luck.

311
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:49,998
-Quiet.

312
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:51,198
He'll hear you.

313
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:51,739
Ready.

314
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,965
-Let's begin.

315
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:01,665
Switch on now, please.

316
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:05,965
-Ah!

317
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:08,498
Ah!

318
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,265
-Got it girly.

319
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,298
-Me be thinking she had enough.

320
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:20,498
-Ah!

321
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:22,831
Keep be in the paddling, Kiki.

322
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:23,565
Don't worry.

323
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:24,631
Me be holding.

324
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:25,172
-Right.

325
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:44,765
-You could see that one coming.

326
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,031
-Too bad he didn't.

327
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:48,865
-Where's Akane?

328
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:49,798
Oh, no.

329
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:50,498
I don't see her.

330
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:51,298
Akane!

331
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:51,998
-Wait for me.

332
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:57,506
-Oh!

333
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:10,765
-Thank goodness you be awake.

334
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,698
-What happened to me?

335
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,265
-Me sorry.

336
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:18,098
-What are you doing here?

337
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,731
-Me try teaching.

338
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:24,031
But me be failing even though
should be simple, Miss Akane.

339
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:27,265
-Man, I don't think I've
ever seen him serious before.

340
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:38,131
-Don't worry about me.

341
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:41,165
I'm all right.

342
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,965
-Miss Akane.

343
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:45,365
-Oh, and Ukyo, good
look in the tournament.

344
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:46,665
-Akane?

345
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,731
-You know, I just realized,
swimming isn't everything.

346
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:52,565
Even if a tidal wave
hit, I'd still be OK.

347
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,831
Because I'm a good runner and
I'd just jog up Mount Fuji.

348
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:56,965
-You be sure?

349
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:57,931
-I'm very sure.

350

-Miss Akane, come back.

353
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,598
-I just wanted to
swim like a swan.

354
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:13,265
Huh?

355
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:14,698

00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:26,598
Well?

361
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,031
-You can't give up, Akane.

362
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:28,931
-Huh?

363
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:31,165
-We won't let you.

364
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:33,898
-We're right behind
you all the way, Akane.

365
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,098
-100%.

366
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:37,665
-Really?

367
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,398
-We all be proud of you.

368
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:41,031
-Thank you, Principal.

369
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:43,665
-You be ready lesson three?

370
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,965

-We use this.

375
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:56,665
-Oh, boy.

376
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:59,198
-Slip this on.

377
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,265
Let's go.

378
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:02,731

-We'll never win.

382
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:14,398
-Her head's too heavy.

383
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,598
-Well, by the looks of it,
at least she has strong legs.

384
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:21,565
That's it.

387
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:40,831

Akane's new bathing suit?

388
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:46,265
