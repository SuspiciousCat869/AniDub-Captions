-Akane, Akane, wait.

339
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,789
At least tell me why you're so--

340
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,189
-I told you.

341
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:43,623
Oh!

342
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:45,023
Oh!

343
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:50,089
ANNOUNCER: (LAUGHING) Welcome
to the bath of shifting sands.

344
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,489
-You're standing too close.

345
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:53,889
-No, I'm sinking too close.

346
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:57,689
And if you hadn't made me follow
you, then we wouldn't be here.

347
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,989
Hey, it stopped moving.

348
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:00,530
-Oh.

349
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,856
I really am sorry.

350
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:06,023
You're right.

351
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:06,589
It's my fault.

352
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,456
-Huh?

353
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:09,023
-Go on.

354
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:10,456
Get out of here.

355
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:11,156
-Ha!

356
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:12,523
You're such a kidder.

357
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:15,089
I almost thought you
were like-- serious.

358
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,323
-I mean it, Ranma.

359
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,289
Get out of my face
while you still can

360
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:22,656
or I swear to you you're
going to regret you ever--

361
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:23,589
-Oh!

362
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:24,623
Hey, stupid.

363
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:27,856
You still haven't
said what I did to--

364
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:29,689
-I invited you because--

365
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:30,689
-Uh, oh.

366
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,189
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
You want to come?

367
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,356
It's already paid for.

368
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:35,123
And if we win this contest
we're holding, we--

369
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,356
-Oh, please.

370
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:41,689
This is not supposed
to be happening.

371
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,089
All I ever wanted was for Ranma
to win that trip, you know?

372
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:45,723
So we--

373
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:46,589
-If that's true--

374
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:47,889
-Huh?

375
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:51,289
- --then why are you trying
so hard to make me angry?

376
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:53,156
-Me make you angry?

377
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:55,523
How dare you?

378
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:56,956
-I'm sorry, OK.

379
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:59,089
I didn't realize
you'd invited me.

380
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:02,823
-You-- you came back
to say you were sorry?

381
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:03,356
-Sorry.

382
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,089
Yep.

383
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:05,356
Uh-huh.

384
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:08,356
And for what it's worth ,
I accept your apology too.

385
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:10,989
-Gee, isn't that
generous of you?

386
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,089
Huh?

387
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:12,789
[boing]

388
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:14,656
-Man this is easy.

389
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:15,823
-Oh, oh, great.

390
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:16,989
They're ahead.

391
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:18,756
Look, there's no time to fight.

392
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:20,989
Just trust me, OK?

393
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:22,389
-What?

394
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:23,489
Oh, what are you doing?

395
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:25,656
-What's it look like I'm doing?

396
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,623
First, I'm going to throw you.

397
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:32,056
Then I'm uh, then I'm, um, oh--

398
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:33,056
-Ranma!

399
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:35,656
Oh!

-[coughing]

00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:37,923
-What is it?

402
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:39,123
What's wrong?

403
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:40,656
-The rope's too heavy.

404
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:43,656
-But-- oh, I get it.

405
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,197
Here I'll--

406
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,156
-Oh--

407
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:45,697
-See this?

408
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:47,123
-Wait!

409
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:49,089
-Here it goes!

410
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:49,630
Ah!

411
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:03,056
[straining] Oh, there,
that ought to hold.

412
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,823
-You're, uh, kind of
good at this stuff.

[music playing]

they're going to win, Akane.

after what we've been through?

421
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,856
We ain't beat yet, are we boys?

422
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:37,356
-No, sir!

423
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:38,856
-Yes!

424
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:39,856
-Oh, it's running away.

425
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:44,256
-Faster men.

426
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:45,256
Run faster!

427
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,723
-They're insane.

428
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:49,156
-Move it, Mousse.

Oh!

We're almost there.

-Akane, thank you.

I owe you big time.

What?

nothing, Ryoga.

tough luck, Saotome.

I get back, Akane.

have wanted to go.

a fan of Hot Springs?

you picked here of all places.

What's this connection
with Kuno, though?

I don't get it.
