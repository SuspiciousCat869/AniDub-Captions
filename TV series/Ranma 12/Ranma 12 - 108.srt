Akane, nothing

in this world has hurt
me so much as loving you.

I have made my final decision.

before.

And what scares me
most is if I leave,

I might never be
loved like this again.

this happy in my whole life.

And I just wish things would
stay the same forever and ever.

Her name is Akane.

Don't look back, Ryoga.
