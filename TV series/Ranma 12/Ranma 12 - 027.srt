00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:10,925
-Hey, let go!

5
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,425
-Hai-yah!

NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

7
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:15,758
-What are you doing?

8
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,658
-The two have been engaged to
marry by their loving parents.

9
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,858
-I didn't ask for this.

10
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,358
-Who asked you?

11
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:24,025
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

12
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,925
-What'd you do that for?

13
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,158
NARRATOR: When Ranma is
splashed with cold water,

14
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,725
he becomes a she.

00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:41,979
The Race of the Snowmen.

17
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:05,713
-Yahoo!

18
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:16,046
-Yeah!

19
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,579
-[laughs] Huh?

20
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,213
Ranma!

21
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:23,513
-Hmph.

22
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:25,346
-Hey, why aren't you skiing?

23
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,679
-Come on, Ranma.

24
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:27,379
Don't pout.

25
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:28,713
You'll miss all the fun.

26
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:29,167
-Fun?

27
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:30,046
Where?

28
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,013
I must have missed it.

29
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:32,613
-Oh, don't be such a baby.

30
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:35,713
Akane isn't embarrassed to be
seen skiing with you as a girl,

31
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,946
so it shouldn't
bother you either.

32
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,313
-It doesn't bother me.

33
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:41,179
-You're not helping.

34
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:45,346
-Hey, well maybe I just don't
feel like skiing right now, OK?

35
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,213
[screaming]

36
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:48,513
SOUN: Come on, Miss.

37
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,346
Let me show you how to snowplow.

38
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,246
Look, Akane!

39
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,113
Look, Daddy's skiing!

40
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,913
-I'm so embarrassed.

41
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:59,346
-Pretend we don't know him.

42
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,446
Come on, Akane,
let's hit the slopes.

43
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:04,779
Ranma, are you coming?

44
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:05,946
-Hm.

45
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,113
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Yeah,
right, like I got time

46
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:11,346
for skiing right now.

47
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:14,213
I gotta get my hands on that
old ghoul's Phoenix Pill.

48
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:16,046
But how?

49
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,613
-Hand that over!

50
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:24,679
-Is that the best you can do?

51
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:26,546
I still don't get it,
do you, sonny boy?

52
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,513
You haven't got a
chance of defeating me.

53
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:29,946
You're 100 years too early.

54
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:30,546
-Aaaaahhhh!

55
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:36,879
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
It's hopeless.

56
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:45,513
COLOGNE: Here you go.

57
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:47,146
You ordered ramen, right?

58
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,379
Leave the bowl under the tree.

59
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:50,946
I'll come back for it later.

60
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,946
MAN: Thank you.

61
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:58,279
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
How'd she get here?

62
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:00,279
Is she following me?

63
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,879

GENMA: Yahooooo!

-You come back here!

71
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:54,879
-Huh?

72
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:55,979
Fancy meeting you here.

73
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,246
-Big mistake, ghoul!

74
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,379
Today I'm gonna get
that pill for sure.

75
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,813
-What exactly do you mean?

76
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:03,213
-Hey, don't play dumb.

77
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:04,213
-What?

78
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:08,146
RANMA: [screams]

79
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:11,046
Oh, now you've done it.

80
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,279
Uh?

81
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:15,279
Cat Cafe, Snow-Mountain Branch?

82
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:16,313
What the--

83
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:17,846
COLOGNE: It's a seasonal thing.

84
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,813
You wouldn't believe how well
the stuff sells out here.

85
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:23,246
Would you like your
job back, son-in-law?

86
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,146
-No way!

87
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,679
Come on, gimme the pill!

88
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:27,313
-What?

89
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:28,846
That silly thing?

90
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,046
Wouldn't you rather compete
in that contest, son-in-law?

91
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,013
-Hm?

92
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:36,246
[crowd murmurs]

93
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,779
-Martial Arts Carry
the Snowman Race?

-Aaah!

EMCEE (ON PA): And
here it is, ski bums!

99
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:58,813
The event you've all
been waiting for,

100
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:02,546
sponsored by our own local
branch of Furinkan's famous Cat

101
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:05,379
Cafe comes Snow-Mountain's
Snowman Snow Off.

102
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:07,646
Break your opponent's snowman
with your wooden sword,

103
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,046
and they're right out of luck.

104
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,446
But watch out,
because they'll be

105
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,646
trying to do the
same thing to you.

106
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,379
Now remember,
protect that snowman,

107
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,813
because the one to reach the
finish with their snowman

108
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:18,979
intact wins!

109
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,546
As for the prize,
how about a ski tour

110
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,446
for two with this
beautiful girl?

111
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,146
-As an added bonus.

112
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,079
-There it is!

113
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:37,613
The pill!

114
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:41,179
-If you win the race, it's
all yours, future son-in-law.

115
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:42,813
-You got it, ghoul.

116
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:44,079
But listen up.

117
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:47,613
There's only one thing I
want from you, and that's a--

118
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:48,579
Ranma!

119
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:49,513
Hai-yah!

120
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,879
Only one thing you
want is Shampoo?

121
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:52,613
Yes!

122
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:53,246
Oh so happy!

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,446
RANMA: No, no, no!

124
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,046
That's not what I meant!

125
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,013
-Akane, you're not going to
let him get away with this,

126
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,013
are you?

127
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,179
-Get away with what?

128
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:04,646
EMCEE (ON PA): On your marks!

129
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:08,646
Get set!

130
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,146
Go!

131
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:18,479
[shouting and laughter]

132
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:19,646
RANMA: I can do it.

133
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,646
I can do it!

134
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,379
I-- I-- whoa!

135
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:24,779
KASUMI: Ranma, what's wrong?

136
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:27,046
NABIKI: Don't tell me
you've never skied before.

137
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,446
-Snowshoes?

138
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,213
-The rules don't say
anything about having

139
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:35,113
to wear skis, now do they?

140
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,613
And with those on
you, you should

141
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,046
be able to keep up just fine.

142
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,113
Aren't you always saying
if it's martial arts in it,

143
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:42,713
you can do anything?

144
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:44,046
-Thanks, Akane.

145
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,446
-So I hope you enjoy your
little rendezvous with Shampoo.

146
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,446
-Aw, jeez, I already told
you, it's not like that.

COLOGNE: Whoops.

165
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:23,013
I didn't mean to
hit you, Mr. Bear.

166

-Out of the way, ghoul!

167
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,579
-Ah, this brings
back the memories.

168
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,946
I remember playing in the snow
like this as a young girl.

169
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:30,846
-Oh!

170
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,579
You mean in the Ice Age?

171
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:32,346
SOUN: Ranma!

172
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,879
GENMA: Are you nuts, boy?

173
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,146
How can you throw aside poor
Akane for that Shampoo girl?

174
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:39,213
-Son, do you really
want Shampoo that much?

175
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:41,079
-Hey, that's not it!

176
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:43,779
-Come on, Dad, that's enough.

177
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,413
I couldn't care less who
that idiot chases after.

178
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:49,046
-Watch how much
she doesn't care.

179
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,946
-Aaaaahhhh!

180
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,079
NABIKI: I rest my case.

181
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:59,313
-OK, now you snow
bunnies, check it out!

182
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,146
They're dropping off like flies!

183
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,213
Who's left?

184
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:04,879
A pigtailed girl
and two old men!

185
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,113
A mysterious mummy!

186
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:07,546
-Who are you calling a mummy?

187
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,946
EMCEE (ON PA): Plus one more!

188
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:11,446
The pretty girl with short hair.

189
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,179
And she's taking the lead!

190
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:18,079
-No one get by Ranma!

191
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:20,013
EMCEE (ON PA): What's this?

192
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,279
The prize has joined the fight.

193
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:24,913
-[laughs] Oh, yeah?

194
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:30,646
Here I come!

195
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:36,046
-Ranma!

196
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:38,346
-Ranma!

197
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:41,146
-It ain't ladylike
to play with swords!

198
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:41,779
-Ranma!

199
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,646
-Huh?

200
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,846
Aaaah!

201
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,313
-It's time for you to
decide-- Akane or Shampoo.

202
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:49,013
It's time for you to kiss
the one you want the most.

203
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:49,613
-Huh?

204
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,146
-Well?

205
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:55,979
Well?

206
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,279
-Ranma, be a man.

207
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:59,346
Pick a girl and kiss her now!

208
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,879
EMCEE (ON PA): What an
unexpected turn of events!

209
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:06,113
Which of these two girls
will receive the kiss?

210
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:13,446
--[laughs nervously]
Uh-- [stammering]

211
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,446
SHAMPOO: Vo: You no kiss
Shampoo, you kiss pill goodbye.

212
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,679
You want stay girl
whole life, Ranma?

213
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:27,013
[gasp]

214
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:27,979
-Huh?

215
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:28,979
You can't!

216
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:30,346
-Ranma!

217
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,213
-Uh, wait, Ranma.

218
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:34,146
People are watching, you know!

219
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,013
And we're both girls!

220
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:36,979
You can't!

221
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:38,346
You can't!

222
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,446
-You got a dirty mind!

223
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,646
-Hm, just kidding.

224
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,946
-Dirty mind?

225
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:46,746
-Just kidding?

226
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,613
-Aahh!

227
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:59,346
[yelling] Hey!

228
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,913
It's the finish line!

229
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:03,313
I can still win!

230
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:07,279
-Oh, no you don't!

231
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:09,679
Son-in-law, you're
not getting past me

232
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:12,613
until you promise
to marry my Shampoo.

233
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,313
-Ha!

234
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,613
OK, then.

235
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:17,213
Why don't we settle
this once and for all?

236
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:22,646
-[chuckles] You're talking to an
Amazon backed up by 3,000 years

237
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,479
of history.

238
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:25,479
Are you sure you're up to it?

239
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,379
-We'll know soon enough.

240
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:48,494
-Son-in-law, you're
not getting past me

241
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:51,427
until you promise
to marry my Shampoo.

242
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:52,427
-Ha!

243
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:53,527
OK, then.

244
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:56,461
Why don't we settle
this once and for all?

245
00:10:56,494 --> 00:11:01,494
-[chuckles] You're talking to an
Amazon backed up by 3,000 years

246
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,327
of history.

247
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,327
Are you sure you're up to it?

248
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:10,061
We'll know soon enough.

249
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:14,227
[shouting]

250
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:33,694
[all gasp]

251
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,561
-You can't win without
a snowman, son-in-law.

252
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:38,461
Why not give up?

253
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:39,994
-I'll show you!

254
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:41,961
-Oh, temper, temper!

255
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:42,827
-Give up?

256
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:44,394
No way!

257
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:46,727
This is where I pay you back
for everything you did to me,

258
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:49,694
you old ghoul!

259
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:54,027
[all gasp]

260
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,427
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Huh.

261
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:58,027
Finally got the old ghoul
to give up the stick.

262
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,194
My win for sure.

263
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:02,394
I've won for sure!

264
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:06,894
RANMA: Looks like your old age
finally caught up with you.

265
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,661
SOUN: Something's
not right here.

266
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,827
The boy's not that good.

267
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,761
-Give it up, ghoul.

268
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:16,994
It ain't good for old
folks to strain themselves.

269
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,927
COLOGNE: You haven't
beat me yet, sonny boy.

270
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:21,061
This old girl's got
some life in her yet.

271
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:22,094
-Is that so?

272
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:23,594
All right, I'll make you a deal.

273
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:27,827
Snowman or no snowman, if I
win, you give me the pill.

274
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:28,427
OK?

275
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:32,561
OK?

276
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:33,761
-I-- I've got no choice.

277
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:38,427
But if I should win, you
agree to marry my Shampoo?

278
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:39,627
That a deal?

279
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:40,627
-Sure.

280
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:43,561
I'd marry you to be a guy again.

281
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:44,594
-I'm glad you agree.

282
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:48,194
-Uh-oh.

283
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,361
COLOGNE: 'Cause
I'll hold you to it.

284
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:52,975
-Aaaaahhh!

285
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,627
-I knew it was too
good to be true.

286
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,094
-That fool!

287
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:01,761
I can't believe he let
himself be tricked like that!

288
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,927
-Did you give up
yet, son-in-law?

289
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:05,361
-No way, ghoul!

290
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:13,994
[all gasp]

291
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:19,494
[screams]

292
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:21,461
-You broke my snowshoes!

293
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:22,827
-[laughs]

294
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:24,494
-That's a dirty trick!

295
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:27,661
-Looks like it's your turn
to give it up, son-in-law.

296
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:28,694
-Not a chance!

297
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:30,161
-Oh, come on, son-in-law.

298
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:32,561
The Amazons of China have
been at this sort of thing

299
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:33,261
for 4,000 years.

300
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:34,161
[grunting with effort]

301
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:35,327
-Like this, for example.

302
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:40,227
[shouting]

303
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:42,361
ONLOOKER: What's she doing now?

304
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:43,661
[yelling]

305
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,094
ONLOOKER: That poor girl!

306
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,027
ONLOOKER: Hey, look, her
hair's standing straight up!

307
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,494
ONLOOKER: This is gonna be good!

308
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:53,061
[ranma yelling]

309
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:01,302
-Ranma!

310
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,494
--[laughs] Now what do
you say, son-in-law?

311
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:10,894
Now do you give up?

312
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:17,461
[yelling]

313
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:18,127
-No way!

314
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,161
-What are you doing?

315
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:20,694
How dare you grab me like that?

316
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,261
Let go of me this instant!

317
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,661
Let go!

318
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:27,027
Let go, I said!

319
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:28,427
[yelling]

320
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:30,527
-Now I feel sick. let
go of me, you go of me,

321
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,561
you stubborn fool.

322
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:37,294
[ranma yelling]

323
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:40,727
-Hey, you ghoul,
come on, fight fair!

324
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,127
-Putting your hands on
me like that-- I've never

325
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:45,027
been so insulted
in my whole life.

326
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:47,894
Why, in 5,000 years of
Chinese Amazon history,

327
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:48,894
I've never been--

328
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,061
-Shaddup, wouldja?

329
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:52,227
Who cares about
your stupid history?

330
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:56,994
3,000, 4,000-- it all
means the same thing to me.

331
00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:59,927
