00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:08,225
-Oh my.

339
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:10,525
It's Akane and Ranma.

340
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,525
-Come on, I can
explain everything!

341
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,492
-I'm not interested.

342
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:17,992
-Just five minutes, that's all.

343
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:19,425
-Don't be long.

344
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,859
And make sure you're home in
time for dinner, all right?

345
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,392
-Stop!

346
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:28,992
Just stop for a minute, OK?

347
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:32,459
AKANE (VOICEOVER): He's
easily keeping up with me.

348
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:34,159
-Who are you anyway?

349
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:38,525
[heavy breathing]

350
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,425
-Ugh, uh.

351
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:46,559
-Whoever you are, you should
watch where you're going.

352
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:56,825
[running]

353
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,459
-Took you long enough.

354
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,359
-Huh?

355
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:04,025
-You're about as
obvious as they get.

356
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,859
Uh, ugh.

357
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:08,359
Since you're here,
you might as well

358
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:11,625
ask Dr. Tofu to
take a look at you.

359
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:15,125
-And how do you know Dr. Tofu?

360
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:16,092
Who are you, anyway?

361
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:20,592
-I can't go through this again.

362
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,059
DR. TOFU: Hmm.

363
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:25,459
You don't seem to be injured.

364
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,225
When you came to,
how did you feel?

365
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:33,192
-That's the funny part.

366
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,692
I felt strangely refreshed.

367
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,725
-Hmm.

368
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,492
That's it.

369
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:39,525
It's got to be.

370
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,059
-What?

371
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:40,825
What is it?

372
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,092
Come on, tell us Dr. Tofu.

373
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,025
-A dreaded technique, the Xai
Fang Heng Gao shiatsu attack.

374
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:56,025
-And what does this dreaded
attack do to a person?

375
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,825
[grunts]

376
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:05,725
-Mr. Saotome.

377
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,259
-Pop, tell us exactly
what happened.

378
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,392
[grunting]

379
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,225
RANMA: Aah, you're
driving me nuts!

380
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:25,692
Hurry up and change back.

381
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,792
-I saw the whole thing.

382
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:35,359
I'll carry the memory
for the rest of my days.

383
00:19:35,392 --> 00:19:38,392
She attacked Akane from the
rear, the speed of her hands

384
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:39,725
was beyond human.

385
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,092
It took five or
six seconds, tops.

386
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:55,959
-Wow!

387
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:57,059
Incredible.

388
00:19:57,092 --> 00:20:01,759
-No wonder my head
felt so refreshed.

389
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,592
-So what does this
attack do to you?

390
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:10,992
-By applying rare Chinese
herbs and extracts, combined

391
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:13,492
with finger pressure
in strategic locations,

392
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,025
the Xai Fang Heng
Gao shiatsu attack

393
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:18,592
can selectively erase memory.

394
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,525
-Ooh, so that explains why
you forgot all about me.

395
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,325
-Do I know you?

396
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,692
-Dr. Tofu, isn't there
anything you can do for her?

397
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:30,892
-If we could find
that herbal solution,

398
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:34,725
we might be able to
reverse the effect.

399
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,825
RANMA: Well I can do that.

400
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,425
Akane, come on.

401
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:38,125
-Hey.

402
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,825
Hey, what are you doing?

403
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:42,425
[screams]

404
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:46,792
Help!

405
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:47,592
Stop!

406
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,559
Put me down.

407
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:50,159
What do you think you're doing?

408
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:52,159
Put me down right now!

409
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,959
RANMA: Shampoo, where are you?

410
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:57,759
Shampoo!

411
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:00,025
-Oh my.

412
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,925
It's almost time
for dinner you two.

413
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:12,659
[crash]

414
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:15,092
-Dr. Tofu, I home.

415
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,392
[grunts]

416
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:18,592
-Oh, that's right.

417
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,892
Let me introduce
Shampoo, my new nurse.

418
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:23,559
She'll be staying
here at the clinic.

419
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:25,959
-Nihao.

420
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:27,659
[grunts]

421
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,159
RANMA: Shampoo, where
the heck are you?

422
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:40,125
Come out, Shampoo.

423
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,892
-Why are you doing this?

424
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,359
Put me down!

425
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:51,292
-Shampoo!

426
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:53,792
-Why won't you tell
me who you are?

427
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:10,974
[theme music]

428
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,241
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Ooh, it's no good!

429
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:42,507
Why can't I remember?

430
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,007
Huh?

431
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:43,941
Ranma?

432
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,674
My fiance?

433
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,141
That's not even funny!

434
00:23:47,174 --> 00:23:50,341
But wait a minute, if
he's not my fiance then

435
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:55,007
why is he-- Next time on
Ranma1/2, "I Love You, Ranma.

436
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,374
Please Don't Say Goodbye."

437
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:59,907
See you there.
