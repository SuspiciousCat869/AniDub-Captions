00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:40,377
NARRATOR: Meet Ranma
Saotome of the Anything

3
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,810
Goes School of Martial Arts.

4
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:43,110
-Hey, let go.

5
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,744
NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

6
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:46,844
-What are you doing?

7
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,310
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

8
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:49,710
to marry by their
loving parents.

9
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:51,410
-I didn't ask for this.

10
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,710
-Who asked you?

11
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:56,077
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

12
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,710
-What'd you do that for?

13
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,710
NARRATOR: When Ranma's
splashed with cold water,

14
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,077
he becomes a she.

15
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,544
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
"P-Chan Explodes!

16
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:20,977
The Icy Fountain of Love!"

17
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,844
-Got it?

18
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:24,410
Akane is my fiancee.

19
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,410
You touch her and I'll kill you.

20
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:30,310
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Did
you mean that, Ranma?

21
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:31,677
Would you really do that?

22
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:39,277
-Hmph, a fiance isn't forever.

23
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,177
I'll take it as a personal
challenge to break those ties.

24
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,044
RANMA: You can try.

25
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:46,677
-I'll do better than that.

26
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,377
She won't be yours
for much longer.

27
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,944
We-- the world famous Golden
Pair-- have another name.

28
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:57,010
BOTH: The Anti-Matchmakers.

29
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,144
-Anti-Matchmakers?

30
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:00,777
ANNOUNCER: Ladies
and gentlemen, here's

31
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,144
the moment we've all been
waiting for-- the Golden Pair's

32
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:06,410
ultimate technique,
The Couple Cleaver!

33
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:09,344
-There's not a single couple
we've ever faced on the ice--

34
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:12,744
-That has stayed together
after we split them up.

35
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:13,577
-Ready, Akane?

36
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,544
-Mhm.

37
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:15,777
-Come on.

38
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,844
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Think
about the other stuff later.

39
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:19,277
For now, concentrate on winning.

40
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,310
-Hey, Ranma!

41
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,677
What are you two doing?

42
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,910
-Huh?

43
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:31,310
-You're wide open.

44
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:31,877
See?

45
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:51,365
MIKADO: The Good Bye Whirl.

46
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:57,298
-Ranma.

47
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,498
-Ho ho, take a good look,
ladies and gentlemen.

48
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,998
At last, the Golden Pair's
dreaded final technique--

49
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:05,131
the infamous Good Bye Whirl.

50
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:08,298
-Listen to me, Ranma Saotome,
release the girl's hand

51
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,965
and I'll stop spinning.

52
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:10,465
-Hah!

53
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:11,798
No way.

54
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,965
-Go on, let her go.

55
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:14,865
You can't hang on
much longer anyway.

56
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,298
-Ranma, let go.

57
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,298
-No way!

58
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,231
You'll go flying
head-first into the ice.

59
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,598
-Here's where the Good
Bye Whirl gets its name.

60
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,298
If one partner
betrays the other,

61
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,365
then he or she will be
spared, but what then?

62
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,631
Oh, what a terrible way
to end a relationship.

63
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:28,331
-Akane.

64
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:29,898
-Ranma, come on.

65
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:30,531
Do it!

66
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:31,598
-No!

67
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,531
How can you even ask
something like that?

68
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,398
-The more you trust
each other, the greater

69
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:36,931
the shock when you're betrayed.

70
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:40,531
A couple caught in the Good Bye
Whirl is doomed to disaster.

71
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:41,531
-Ignore him.

72
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:42,498
I'll be fine.

73
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,498
Let me go!

74
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:44,931
Please!

75
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:45,931
-No way!

76
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:47,098
How can I?

77
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:50,698
You're too stupid to
know what's good for you.

78
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:53,731
-What-- what'd you say?

79
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,665
-Little Azusa is all worn out.

80
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:09,698
ANNOUNCER: Look at
that, Challenger Saotome

81
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:11,598
never let go of his partner.

82
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:13,298
The Good Bye Whirl
was a failure.

83
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:18,898
But faithfulness has its price.

84
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:22,365
Ranma Saotome seems to have
sustained serious injury.

85
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:23,265
-Oh, no.

86
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:24,598
Ranma, Ranma.

87
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:29,965
-Little Azusa is so dizzy.

88
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:33,265
-I'm sure that every bone
in his body must be crushed.

89
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,998
Nothing human could
have withstood that.

90
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,798
-You dummy Ranma.

91
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:45,265
I didn't ask you to do that.

92
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:48,098
Dummy.

93
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,265
You dummy.

94
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:53,031
Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy.

95
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,998
You dummy!

96
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:55,898
-Quiet.

97
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:57,698
-Ranma?

98
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,231
-Is that how you thank me?

99
00:05:59,265 --> 00:05:59,931
Calling me names?

100
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,331
-You were faking?

101
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,331
-Is that all you really
think of me, Akane?

102
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:18,065
[moaning]

103
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:21,398
-Are you sure you're OK?

104
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:23,798
-I couldn't be better.

105
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,331
-Why, you've made
it to your feet.

106
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,498
-Come on, I'm
ready anytime, man.

107
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,165
-Huh, you're very stubborn.

108
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:32,231
Let's see how long you can last.

109
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:34,031
ANNOUNCER: And we're
back where we started.

110
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,865
Who will be the winner
of the Charlotte Cup?

111
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:39,965
Who will be the one to
take home the bacon?

112
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:41,265
-Oh!

113
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:42,131
-Don't be ridiculous.

114
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:43,565
You can't fight like this.

115
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,065
-Don't tell me what I can't do.

116
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:46,998
This fight's not over yet.

117
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,865
-That's right.

118
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,298
Those are my thoughts precisely.

119
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:52,265
I have no intention of
letting you withdraw.

120
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:58,231
Not until I, as promised, exact
a kiss from Akane Tendo's lips.

121
00:06:58,265 --> 00:06:58,965
-No way.

122
00:06:58,998 --> 00:06:59,765
Are you crazy?

123
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:03,631
-Here I-- oh!

124
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:09,298
-My Charlotte has disappeared.

125
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,031
-What are you doing, you fool?

126
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,765
-You help find Charlotte!

127
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:20,631
-This is where I come in.

128
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:21,798
-Come on, Akane.

129
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:24,465
-Wait a sec.

130
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:26,965
-Hrrg.

131
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:29,931
What'd you do that for, Akane?

132
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:30,798
-Don't do this.

133
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,231
Not for me.

134
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:37,131
-Huh?

135
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,298
-Really, it's not necessary.

136
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:40,798
-Akane.

137
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,898
RYOGA: Ranma, turn quietly into
a girl and let me handle this.

138
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:48,998
AKANE: Hey!

139
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:49,931
RYOGA: Pair up with
me, Akane, and we'll

140
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:50,998
take them on together.

141
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:52,665
RANMA: Oh, wouldn't
that be convenient?

142
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:53,465
RYOGA: Quiet, you.

143
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:55,798
Be a good girl and-- there.

144
00:07:55,831 --> 00:07:56,631
That's it.

145
00:07:56,665 --> 00:08:00,398
Now, Akane, you and I can-- ah!

146
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:02,131
-Moron.

147
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:03,298
-All right, where's Akane?

148
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:04,831
-Hey, stupid, that's my line.

149
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:07,165
What are you doing here anyway?

150
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:08,398
ANNOUNCER: Oh, wait a minute.

151
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:09,898
What's going on here?

152
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:12,498
Furinkan High has slipped
in a substitute pair

153
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:13,831
in the middle of the match.

154
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:16,165
-I'm here to pair up with
Akane, that's what I'm doing.

155
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:17,298
-Go home.

156
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,631
We're fine without you.

157
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,231
-My pigtailed princess.

158
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:24,098
-Find Charlotte.

159
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:25,498
Find Charlotte.

160
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:26,565
-Cut that out.

161
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,765
Come to me, my pigtailed pretty.

162
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:35,165
-Huh?

163
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:38,198
Oh, Mr. Sanzenin,
please put me down.

164
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,231
-I can't do that.

165
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,331
You owe me.

166
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:43,098
Now aren't you going to
thank me for saving you?

167
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,765
-Course.

168
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,098
What do you want?

169
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:46,565
OK.

170
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:52,798
-You cut that out right now.

171
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:56,365
You sure got a lot of
nerve, you know that, buddy?

172
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:58,231
-I see you're being shy again.

173
00:08:58,265 --> 00:08:59,365
Come on, give me your hand.

174
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:00,131
-You want it?

175
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,198
Here, take it.

176
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,031
OK, enough stalling.

177
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:04,965
Let's fight.

178
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:05,798
-Wait, Ranma.

179
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:07,198
-Ow, quit it.

180
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,998
-Hey, Ranma, how can you fight
in your weakened condition?

181
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:11,631
You're not feeling
well, remember?

182
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:14,231
Why don't you go take it easy,
and let Akane and I take it

183
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,698
from here, all right?

184
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:18,865
-Hey, what's the
deal with these two?

185
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,931
ANNOUNCER: The crowd is
getting really restless.

186
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,465
There seems to be some objection
about Furinkan's last minute

187
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,965
pair substitution
into the competition.

188
00:09:28,998 --> 00:09:31,298
-No, that's not what
we're mad about.

189
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:32,565
-Where's your sexy costume?

190
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:34,131
We can't see your body.

191
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:36,265
-That boy's costume
is really pathetic.

192
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:41,765
-Leave everything to us.

193
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,831
We can solve all
your fashion needs.

194
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,165
ANNOUNCER: What?

195
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:48,965
It seems the Kolhotz fashion
club is entering the arena.

196
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:49,498
-Go, girls.

197
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:54,265
-Hey.

198
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,731
Our job here is done.

199
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:09,298
Farewell.

200
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:12,098
ANNOUNCER: A brand new
look for a brand new pair.

201
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:12,965
Let the match resume.

202
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:18,598
-Hey there, Ryoga.

203
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:21,531
You have learned how to
skate by now, haven't you?

204
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,165
-Yeah right, Ranma.

205
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:25,131
It took me more
than five days just

206
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,198
to find this stupid school.

207
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:30,165
You think I had time
to practice my skating?

208
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:33,265
Hey, so long as I can
stand up, it's OK, right?

209
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:34,631
-No, it's not OK.

210
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:37,331
This is martial arts ska-- huh?

211
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:40,498
Can I please accept
my apologies.

212
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:44,665
I'm sorry I was unable to you
during the competition I know

213
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:47,531
you must be terribly
disappointed.

214
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,598
Do you have a fever?
Are you feeling OK?

215
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,231
-How about after the match,
I'll take you on a date?

216
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:57,631
-Right.

217
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,731
Here I come.

218
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:00,365
-Hello, miss.

219
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,665
Are you all right?

220
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,298
-Oh, Ranma, just look at you.

221
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,598
Go rest and let me handle this.

222
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,765
-I agree, Akane.

223
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,431
I'll skate with you, OK?

224
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:08,931
-K.

225
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,265
-No way.

226
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:12,231
Ryoga's with me.

227
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:12,831
-Now what?

228
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:19,798
-You said you could
stand up, you jerk.

229
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:23,165
-I can, just not
for very long, OK?

230
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:24,398
-Here we go again.

231
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,265
ANNOUNCER: Here we go
again, ladies and gentlemen.

232
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,131
How will this couple fare
against the dreaded Good Bye

233
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,498
Whirl?

234
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:45,798
-Let go of her hand
and I'll stop spinning.

235
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,098
-Come on, let me go already.

236
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:49,998
-Let you go?

237
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:51,198
Think again.

238
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:52,131
-I'll make you.

239
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,298
-Now the grand finale.

240
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:04,265
You might've been hurt.

241
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:05,531
Are you all right?

242
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:06,498
ANNOUNCER: There it is.

243
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:08,731
The devastating Good Bye Whirl.

244
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:11,065
Yet another loving
couple is cruelly

245
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,631
separated before its time.

246
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:14,765
-Hear that?

247
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:17,298
-I guess they were never
meant to be together.

248
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:20,265
-How awful to be betrayed
by a man you trusted.

249
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,831
Your heart must be breaking.

250
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,231
Don't you fret, princess.

251
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:26,865
I'll take good care of you.

252
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:28,465
-Only in your dreams, pal.

253
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:34,131
-Does it hurt?

254
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:35,331
Does it hurt?

255
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,566
My Charlotte.

256
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,699
-Huh?

257
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,532
-You're Azusa's
little Charlotte.

258
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:51,032
-What?

259
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:11,482
Don't be ridiculous.

260
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:13,815
And don't distract me in
the middle of the match.

261
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:14,749
-Oh, no.

262
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,615
Azusa knows her
little Charlotte.

263
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,515
Look, that's her little collar.

264
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:29,882
-Ah, there must be some sort
of a horrible misunderstanding

265
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:32,649
or something.

266
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:33,582
-No, no, no.

267
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:34,949
There's no mistake.

268
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,249
Look at this.

269
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,182
Azusa knows because she
locked it with her little key.

270
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:41,349
That makes you my little
Charlotte for sure.

271
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:42,815
-I am now Charlotte.

272
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:44,682
You're confused, that's all.

273
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:46,582
I'll tell you my real name.

274
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:47,549
-It's P-Chan.

275
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:49,015
-That's right.

276
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:50,949
Who are you calling P-Chan?

277
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:52,582
-You like Charlotte better then?

278
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:02,282
Ranma, how dare you
embarrass me like this?

279
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:03,682
I won't allow it.

280
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:05,749
-You there, what are you
doing to my girlfriend?

281
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,315
-I ain't your
girlfriend, you jerk.

282
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:18,649
-My dear, you're as
innocent and naive as ever.

283
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:21,382
Huh?

284
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:23,449
-You've made a fool
of me in public

285
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:25,382
for the last time, Saotome.

286
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,849
-Hey, I just help you
do it to yourself.

287
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:29,215
-OK then.

288
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:31,582
Let's settle it once and for
all-- a skate to the death.

289
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:36,182
-You there, stop bullying
her and fight me.

290
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:37,615
-Oh, my Charlotte.

291
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:41,149
-Gotcha.

292
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:52,915
-Why'd you do that, you-- ah!

293
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:55,815
-Don't you hurt Azusa's
little Charlotte!

294
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,415
ANNOUNCER: Ladies
and gentleman, what

295
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,715
a startling turn of events.

296
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:11,249
Mikado Emperor
Sanzenin has just been

297
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:14,049
felled by his delightful
partner, Azusa Shiratori.

298
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:15,715
Will he be able to
recover in time?

299
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,082
-Cold water.

300
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:25,449
-I'm doomed.

301
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:27,015
-I'm a girl already
so I don't care.

302
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:29,682
But I guess you're
in trouble, huh?

303
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,315
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
If I turn into a pig

304
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,682
while Akane's watching, I'm
going to end it right now.

305
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:39,482
ANNOUNCER: Th-- the
rink is destroyed.

306
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:42,049
-Don't look at Azusa.

307
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,749
-Mikado Sanzenin is now
being carried off the ice

308
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:45,882
by paramedics.

309
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:47,282
What does this mean for
the rest of the match?

310
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:50,282
His partner Azusa goes
to his side in concern.

311
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,182
-Cute blanket.

312
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:54,815
-You give that back to me.

313
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,282
I need it.

314
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:59,782
-You give Azusa back
her little Marteen now.

315
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:07,715
Marteen, Marteen, Marteen.

316
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,249
-Hm, what do you think?

317
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,482
-I'd say he's a goner.

318
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:13,049
Look it.

319
00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:19,149
ANNOUNCER: That's it,
ladies and gentlemen.

320
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:20,315
That's all she wrote.

321
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:22,982
Kolhotz High's Golden Pair
has forfeited the match

322
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:23,849
to Furinkan High.

323
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:32,849
[rumbling]

324
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:39,249
-Uh oh.

325
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:51,715
-Ranma, it's not over yet.

326
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:52,482
Fight me.

327
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:53,815
-You mean right here?

328
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:54,815
-Yeah, right here.

329
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:03,249
-Any more bright ideas?

330
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:04,249
-Shut up.

331
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:41,149
-Come back here, Ryoga.

332
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,149
-Ranma?

333
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:08,049
That's enough, you guys.

334
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:08,549
-Huh?

335
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:12,849
-Oh, hi, Akane.

336
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:13,549
-We're busy.

337
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:14,682
Get lost.

338
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:16,749
-What is wrong with you two?

339
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,915
-I thought I told you
to butt out, Akane.

340
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:22,282
-Hey, wh-- what'd
I-- oh, never mind.

341
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,949
I want you to tell me why you
two hate each other so much.

342
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:26,249
-Oh, that's easy.

343
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:29,815
-I'll tell you everything,
Akane, after I defeat Ranma.

344
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,749
-What do you mean
after you beat me?

345
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,282
-Akane, no!

346
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:52,615
-Ah jeez, I told
her to butt out.

347
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:54,282
But she never listens.

348
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:54,782
Huh?

349
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:01,249
-You mean--

350
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,349
-She doesn't know how to swim?

351
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:11,515
Hey.

352
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:12,449
-Now what?

353
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:14,349
-You sure you want to do this?

354
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:18,182
[scream]

355
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:23,549
-Oh, Akane.

356
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,282
-Charlotte!

357
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:39,715
Charlotte, where are you?

358
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:41,649
Come to Azusa, Charlotte.

359
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,115
Come out.

360
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,482
Where are you?

361
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:46,282
Oh, Charlotte.

362
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:03,149
Oh, Oscar!

363
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:12,949
GIRL: Look, she's awake.

364
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,115
-Akane, are you OK?

365
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:24,415
-Catch.

366
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:26,115
-What happened to P-Chan?

367
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:27,649
Why he's soaking wet.

368
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,182
GIRL: He saved your life, Akane.

369
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:31,015
He pulled you from the pool.

370
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,515
-Nobody knows where
he came from though.

371
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:35,182
-Is that right?

372
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:36,749
Thanks a lot, P-Chan.

373
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,815
-Save some thanks for
Ryoga while you're at it.

374
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:40,215
-What?

375
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:42,715
-Hey, he helped drag you from
the pool too, you know, Akane.

376
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:43,782
-Oh.

377
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:46,115
-Speaking of which,
where is Ryoga now?

378
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,082
-I think he went
home, didn't he?

379
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,382
[whimper]

380
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,549
-Well, that's where we
should be going too.
