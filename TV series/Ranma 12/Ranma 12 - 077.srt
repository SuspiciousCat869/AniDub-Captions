1
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
-What a haul!

2
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,333
What a haul!

3
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:01,300
[laughs] Woah!

4
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,466
How did those get
up in that tree?

5
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:04,666
How sweet!

6
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:07,700
No fair.

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,266
These belong to some kid.

8
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:11,233
I've got no use for these.

9
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,266
Do you want them?

10
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,366
-Oh, how can I thank you?

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,166
I see the wind finally blew
them down from that tree.

12
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:26,200
-Actually, I-- that is,
they-- well, you see, I--

13
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,200
-I guess you can't always
judge a book by its cover.

14
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,700
At first sight, I
thought you were

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,333
one of those underwear thieves.

16
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,433
-Oh, well, I-- you can never
be too sure about these things.

17
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,133
Is it hot today,
or is it just me?

18
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,433
NARRATOR: Happosai's
happy heart.

19
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,900
-What a haul, what a haul!

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,900
Is it good to be alive or what?

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,900
[cheers]

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,866
Oh?

23
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,866
Another one of
mine that got away?

24
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,066
Here, pretty, pretty, pretty.

25
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,933
-That's far enough you!

26
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,600
Oh, it's you.

27
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
-I got lost.

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,966
I was going to ask directions.

29
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:02,507
I--

30
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,700
-I'm so sorry.

31
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,366
How silly of me to have thought
you were actually a thief.

32
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:08,100
-Who, me?

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
No, no, no ma'am.

34
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:12,533
-So, what are you doing here?

35
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:13,633
Your legs, they're shaking.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,666
You poor thing.

37
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,033
You must have caught a chill.

38
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,700
Some tea will warm you right up.

39
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,995
-K.

40
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:30,866
-Thanks for waiting.

41
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,433
I'm very sorry
thing are so untidy.

42
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,433
Meeting twice in one day.

43
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,733
What a coincidence.

44
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,233
-You know, I was just
thinking the very same thing.

45
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,633
-It's fate, then.

46
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,066
HAPPOSAI (VOICEOVER):
It could be.

47
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,500
Why else would my
heart be beating so?

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,500
-What can you do, huh?

49
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,533
Terrible.

50
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,333
That underwear
thief, how terrible.

51
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,600
-It certainly is terrible.

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,500
Why no one has been
arrested for those crimes

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,833
so far is beyond me.

54
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:05,133
I could never ever
forgive someone like that.

55
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,833
What?

56
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,133
What was that sound just then?

57
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,066
-Oh, nothing, dear.

58
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,833
Nothing but an old
man fluffing up

59
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,933
his cushion to make
himself more comfortable.

60
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:17,666
-Oh, I see.

61
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:19,933
That's right.

62
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,533
I have some tangerines
from the country.

63
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:22,566
Want some?

64
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,633
-I love tangerines.

65
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,400
-Oh, yeah right.

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,300
Tell us another one.

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,233
-But I'm not making
it up, though.

68
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,666
Oh, you little ingrate.

69
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,133
When did you get
so darn cynical?

70
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,933
-Oh, so is that when
she gave you the teacup?

71
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:36,833
Or--

72
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:37,900
-Yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,633
-Here, I'll show you.

74
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:40,433
You see?

75
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,566
See?

76
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,700
-So you come home with a
dumb look on your face,

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,600
and you've got an
even dumber story,

78
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
and we're supposed
to believe you?

79
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,166
You must think we're stupid.

80
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,733
-Then don't believe me.

81
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,966
We know it's true, don't we?

82
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,533
-Oh yeah, right.

83
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:58,433
-So now he's not only stealing
underwear, but tea cups, too?

84
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,800
-Why won't you believe me?

85
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:02,407
Safe.

86
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,600
Poor thing.

87
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,666
How awful for you to have
touched Ranma's head.

88
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:09,533
Forgive me, my dear,
for ever risking you.

89
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,900
We'll go back to see
her at the preschool.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,433
OK?

91
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,400
-Preschool?

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,733
What are you doing there?

93
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,166
-Say, your friend wouldn't
happened to be called Madori,

94
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:18,966
would she?

95
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,900
If so, I might know her.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,666
-She's a real good
looker, ain't she?

97
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:25,266
-So how do you know her, then?

98
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:25,966
-Yeah.

99
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,566
So how do you know her?

100
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,033
-Well, for one thing,
it's a small town.

101
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:33,000
And I hear she's really
popular with the local kids.

102
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,933
-Since you know her, I'll just
come right out and say it.

103
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,633
I'm going to marry
that girl someday.

104
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,200
-So, are you going to tell her
about the underwear stealing

105
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,133
before or after the wedding?

106
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:54,674
-Please.

107
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,966
-So you don't think
she'll approve, then?

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,733
-Miss Madori, play with me.

109
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,166
-Play with me first.

110
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,266
-No, with me!

111
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:10,966
-OK, OK.

112
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:11,966
Well all play together.

113
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:12,500
All right?

114
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,566
Oh, hello there.

115
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:18,307
-Hello.

116
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,200
Sure is a coincidence
running into you like this.

117
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,333
-How are you?

118
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,900
-I'm fine.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,533
-Well, would you
like to join us?

120
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,566
-You really mean it?

121
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,800
-Why, sure.

122
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,341
-Hooray!

123
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:37,166
-I don't like him.

124
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,000
-Me neither.

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,500
-Children, be nice.

126
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,100
Now, wouldn't you rather
that we all played together?

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,133
-My name is Happy.

128
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,666
What's yours?

129
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:47,900
-What do we say?

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,866
-Aw, come on!

131
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,800
[complaining]

132
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,600
-Do these come off?

133
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:58,666
-Watch it.

134
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,066
-Did that hurt?

135
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,433
-Happy, honey, play nice, OK?

136
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:03,974
-Ow!

137
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,100
Happy will be good.

138
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:10,766
-OK, Happy.

139
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:11,700
Here it comes.

140
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,366
-Gotcha.

141
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,000
-It was supposed to be my turn.

142
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,766
-The things I do for love.

143
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,300
Here I come!

144
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,300
You're it, you're it.

145
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,200
Here I come, Teach!

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,766
-Come and catch me if you can.

147
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,266
Huh?

148
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,600
[laughs]

149
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,800
-Ready or not, here I--

150
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,733
-That's not nice.

151
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,333
So close, and yet--

152
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:55,874
-Sorry.

153
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,033
-That hurt, you know?

154
00:07:59,133 --> 00:07:59,933
-Sorry.

155
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,300
Want to make something of it?

156
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,966
-What's wrong?

157
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,066
Is he bullying you?

158
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,266
-He didn't do it on purpose.

159
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:08,100
Here.

160
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Try not to hit people next time.

161
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,141
K?

162
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
-Hiya, Teach.

163
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,866
-What's wrong?

164
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:20,766
Did you forget something?

165
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,266
Come on.

166
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,933
-I like to drink tea.

167
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:28,833
So, how about you?

168
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:30,400
-Me too.

169
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,600
-For joy!

170
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,333
For joy!

171
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,400
MISS MADORI: What's wrong?

172
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,233
HAPPOSAI: I'm just so happy.

173
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,200
You're just so nice.

174
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,766
No one has ever been
this nice to me before.

175
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,400
All my disciples
ever do is bully me.

176
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,966
They betray me, and I have
to sit there and take it.

177
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,533
It's too much to bear.

178
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,566
They kick me.

179
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,466
They punch me.

180
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,533
They do whatever
they like to me.

181
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:02,766
Oh, Miss Madori, it's so
unfair-- until I met you.

182
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,466
I had no idea how
measurable I was.

183
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:10,666
-Let's see how it fits.

184
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,533
So, would you mind trying it on?

185
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,233
-Your mean it's for me?

186
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,600
-Only if you like it.

187
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,633
-Like it?

188
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:22,600
I love it.

189
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,533
Green is my new favorite color.

190
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:37,833
-Here.

191
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,233
Mustn't catch a cold.

192
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,933
-I won't.

193
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:43,133
-He what?

194
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,966
He gave up his
underwear collection?

195
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:46,400
I don't believe it.

196
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,000
-I didn't believe it either.

197
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,066
Now I'm not so sure.

198
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,966
However, if it is true, then--

199
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:55,733
-Then our future as the peaceful
inheritors of the Anything

200
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,200
Goes School of Martial
Arts is assured.

201
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,133
-Oh, Tendo.

202
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,100
-Oh, Saotome.

203
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,900
Do we dare hope
for a normal life?

204
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,133
-Uh huh.

205
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,600
And here they say girls
have an active fantasy life.

206
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,466
-So, any suggestions
for tonight's dinner?

207
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:17,366
-That's it for a warmup.

208
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,533
-Ain't you tough?

209
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:25,700
No more messing around.

210
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you ready or what?

211
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
-Bring it on, punk.

212
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,533
-We'll just see about that.

213
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,633
Take this!

214
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,066
-Come to papa, baby.

215
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:39,466
-Don't think so.

216
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:40,633
-Why you little--

217
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:41,800
-Ready for round two?

218
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,700
Here it comes.

219
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,500
-Come on, come on.

220
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
-Well?

221
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,066
-Just turn the eyes away.

222
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:47,615
That's all.

223
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,400
-See?

224
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:48,941
See?

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,833
See?

226
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:50,733
-I can do it.

227
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:51,766
I can do it.

228
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:52,733
Just don't look.

229
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,300
Don't look.

230
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,700
Don't-- don't--

231
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,600
-It's just like I thought.

232
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,366
-Poor guy.

233
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:00,066
-Come on.

234
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,200
One more time.

235
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,233
-How'd you feel about a
pair of Pop's underwear?

236
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,066
-No thanks.

237
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,433
-Some guy's sumo diaper?

238
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,633
-Can't even look at it.

239
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,766
-What about Akane's bra?

240
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:09,666
-Let me at it!

241
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,633
Let me at it!

242
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,833
-Do it right or
don't do it at all.

243
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:14,766
-OK, Akane.

244
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,133
You want to see serious?

245
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,566
I'll give you serious.

246
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,600
-Sir, yes sir.

247
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,533
-How's about this?

248
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:21,466
-A big bra?

249
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:22,133
I love big bras.

250
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,933
-Not good enough.

251
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,800
Try again, worm.

252
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,433
-Lookie lookie,
polka-dot undies.

253
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:30,666
-Not even close.

254
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,666
-Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't hurt you.

255
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:36,500
-Miss Madori, Miss Madori.

256
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,300
-Well, that's good
enough for me.

257
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,266
Get ready, Ranma.

258
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,166
Because it it's
last thing I do, I'm

259
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,100
going to learn how to
stop stealing underwear.

260
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,766
You'll see.

261
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,033
-You can do it, Master.

262
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,600
The entire future
of the Anything

263
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Goes School of Martial Arts
depends on your success.

264
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,433
-Not to mention
our own happiness.

265
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,966
-Don't worry, Miss Madori.

266
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,433
I'll do it just like you said.

267
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,208
Miss Madori.

268
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,175
I'm going to do it, Miss Madori.

269
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:25,808
You'll see.

270
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:50,175
I said no.

271
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:52,575
Bad hand.

272
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:53,116
Just behave.

273
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:54,342
Be good.

274
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:57,242
But oh, the color, the sparkle.

275
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,208
MISS MADORI (VOICEOVER):
I could never, ever

276
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,175
forgive someone like that.

277
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:04,775
HAPPOSAI (VOICEOVER): I could
never bear for her to hate me.

278
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,408
I have to keep my promise.

279
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:07,542
I just have to.

280
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:10,942
Just keep the eyes closed.

281
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,275
That's the trick.

282
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,708
-Hear that sound, Tome?

283
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:16,042
-Sure did, Tendo.

284
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,475
At last the end is in sight.

285
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,708
HAPPOSAI: Just one
whiff couldn't hurt.

286
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,575
HAPPOSAI: Good morning, Kasume.

287
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:39,442
-Good- good morning.

288
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:40,708
-What a beautiful day.

289
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:44,708
-I-- I just finished
hanging those to dry, so--

290
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:45,642
-That's nice, dear.

291
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:50,975
Have you ever seen such
beautiful bonsai in your life?

292
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,975
Look how well they're growing.

293
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:55,408
I must be doing something right.

294
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:56,175
Don't you think?

295
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:02,842
You know, I've never noticed
how beautiful they were before.

296
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,842
Wonder why?

297
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,808
FEMALE: Hey, Kasume.

298
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:10,508
You still want me to
bring in the laundry, or--

299
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,442
-Yes, please.

300
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:13,508
Jeez Louise.

301
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:16,742
A big family sure
makes a lot of laundry.

302
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:17,508
-Hello, dear.

303
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:18,408
How are you?

304
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:19,808
-Yeah, yeah, Gramps.

305
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:20,908
Whatever.

306
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:21,449
Oh no.

307
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,508
-Here you go, dear.

308
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,442
You dropped this.

309
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:26,983
-Thank you.

310
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:32,008
-What in the world
happened to him?

311
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,042
-Come on.

312
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,342
You've got to admit--
he really is trying.

313
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:39,342
-I don't know.

314
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:41,342
We'll see how long it lasts.

315
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:43,175
-Ranma, show the
Master some respect.

316
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,908
-It's OK.

317
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:46,708
I'll show you all.

318
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:50,808
-I am so proud of you.

319
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:52,475
-Actually, it's kind of boring.

320
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,575
-Don't you start.

321
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:54,975
-I was just kidding.

322
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:58,008
-I believe you're trying to give
up women's underwear, Master,

323
00:14:58,108 --> 00:14:59,775
but for how long?

324
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,342
-A true martial artist
should be able to withstand

325
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:03,575
any and all temptation.

326
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:08,708
-Aw, geez, that was cold!

327
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,142
What-- what are you doing?

328
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:15,508
-Somebody pinch me, because I
just died and went to heaven.

329
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:16,442
-Master, no!

330
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:20,175
-Back to the drawing
board, freak!

331
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:20,742
-Oh, Master.

332
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:23,008
How could you?

333
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:25,208
MISS MADORI (VOICEOVER):
I could never, ever

334
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:26,775
forgive someone like that.

335
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,775
HAPPOSAI (VOICEOVER):
No more underwear.

336
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:32,508
No more looking at Ranma.

337
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,975
No more anything.

338
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:35,675
I promise.

339
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:37,816
-Ta da.

340
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:39,683
-Ta da?

341
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,208
You can do it.

342
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,142
You can do it.

343
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,042
Just don't look.

344
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:45,742
-Hey there.

345
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:46,542
You like what you see?

346
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,175
-You can do it, Happy.

347
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,642
-Miss Madori.

348
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:55,808
-Pretty good, huh?

349
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:58,575
Come on and get it, hot stuff.

350
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:04,342
RANMA (VOICEOVER) Why does this
always end up happening to me?

351
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:07,342
-Please, boy, please.

352
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:08,642
Our happiness depends on it.

353
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:11,908
-Son, the entire
future of the Anything

354
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:13,908
Goes School is in your hands.

355
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,375
-What do you say, Gramps?

356
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,675
How is the training holding up?

357
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:23,342
-What's the matter with you,
prancing around in that getup?

358
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,275
Ain't you going to catch cold?

359
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,742
If you can't learn
to respect yourself,

360
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:30,642
young lady, what makes you
think that others will?

361
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:35,308
-Look, look.

362
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,708
Look at the sand castle
I made, Miss Madori.

363
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:39,175
Hey, it's Happy.

364
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:40,142
-Heya, kids.

365
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:41,108
How's it going?

366
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:43,775
-Hey there.

367
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,075
-Nice day, don't you think?

368
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:46,142
-Sure is.

369
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:48,008
-It's that old grandpa
I told you about.

370
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,708
-So, how are you, anyway?

371
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,075
Things been going well
since last time I saw you?

372
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,308
-Yes, very well.

373
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:54,442
Thank you, Happy.

374
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:57,042
-I'm the one who should
be thankful, actually,

375
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,275
if only for my new attitude.

376
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,275
Things are so
different for me now.

377
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,708
I don't know how to
begin to thank you.

378
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:04,942
-I didn't do anything.

379
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,308
But you're welcome.

380
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,575
-He's really changed, hasn't he?

381
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,275
-I don't believe it.

382
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,775
-It's proof-- he
really does love her.

383
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,275
-How can you be so sure?

384
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,375
-Because it's true love, stupid.

385
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:17,408
Don't you know anything?

386
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,008
-Guess not.

387
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:22,142
-Akane, Ranma, what
are you doing here?

388
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,408
-Watching the freak.

389
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:26,242
What about you?

390
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:29,542
-We're just the concerned
about the master, that's all.

391
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:31,442
-We had to see it
with our own eyes.

392
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,742
-Well, now you've see him.

393
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:37,642
-So what is the master doing
at a preschool, anyway?

394
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:40,642
-Dad, it's like he's
a whole new person.

395
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:43,875
-Then what he told us about
the training was true.

396
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:45,008
-Just see for yourself.

397
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:48,208
-We hardly dared to hope.

398
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,075
Our master reformed at last!

399
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:53,542
-OK, now blow.

400
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,675
There you go.

401
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,575
-Cut it out.

402
00:17:59,342 --> 00:17:59,783
-Hey!

403
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:02,308
You cut that out!

404
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:03,575
What do you think
you're doing, anyway?

405
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:08,142
Don't you know that
picking on a girl

406
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:11,208
is the single worst
thing a boy can do?

407
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:13,542
Flipping up skirts to get
a look at their underwear

408
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:14,742
is even worse.

409
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:17,675
-Flipping up skirts to get
a look at her underwear

410
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,342
is even worse?

411
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:21,442
That's what he said, all right.

412
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,208
-Don't you want to grow
up to be big and strong?

413
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:25,608
Take me, for example.

414
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:31,408
You don't think I got to be the
man I am today by-- by letting

415
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:37,442
my baser instincts overrule
what I knew to be true?

416
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:41,475
And I-- just do what I say.

417
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:43,808
What I-- I--

418
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,108
-Are you drunk, mister?

419
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:48,383
Hey mister.

420
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,742
Help, come quick!

421
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:52,508
-Oh no!

422
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,508
-Master!

423
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:54,142
-Master!

424
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:54,808
-Hey, freak!

425
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,442
-Help me.

426
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:00,208
-Oh, no.

427
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,042
What do you want me to do?

428
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,308
-I-- I did it all for
you-- gave up my evil ways.

429
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:07,242
-Shh.

430
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:08,608
Just save your strength.

431
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,908
-For you-- for
you-- all for you.

432
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:16,175
-It must have been
all the training.

433
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,342
-The master living
a righteous life?

434
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:20,375
What were we thinking?

435
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:22,142
-He won't die, will he?

436
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:26,308
-It will take a lot more than
that to kill the old goat.

437
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:26,875
-But--

438
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:27,808
-Don't give up.

439
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:28,842
Hang in there.

440
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:30,942
Somebody go, call a doctor!

441
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:34,075
-Why bother when he'll be
coming out of it all on his own?

442
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:36,742
-I expect it will be any
minute, right, Saotome?

443
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,942
-You know it.

444
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:43,675
It seems to be taking a
little longer than usual.

445
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:47,242
-So it seems, Tendo,
so it would seem.

446
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:48,842
-It'll be soon, though.

447
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:50,475
-Just like I thought.

448
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:51,775
Here you go, Gramps.

449
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,508
Come and get it.

450
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,842
Come and get it.

451
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,075
You know you want it.

452
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:56,142
-Honestly, Ranma.

453
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,242
It's going to take a
lot more than that.

454
00:19:58,342 --> 00:19:59,775
-Come on, Gramps.

455
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,175
Get it.

456
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:01,942
-Uh huh.

457
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:02,508
It's working.

458
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:05,875
Come on, Master.

459
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:07,475
Come on, come on, come on.

460
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:08,942
-What's the matter
with you people?

461
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,442
Have you all gone
completely insane?

462
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:11,983
Huh?

463
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:16,242
-We'll let him be
the judge of that.

464
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:18,383
-Huh?

465
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:23,775
-I would've thought
it would work.

466
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,042
-Of course it wouldn't.

467
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:25,908
-You faker, you!

468
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,242
-Huh?

469
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:32,975
What do you know?

470
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,175
-That's it, then.

471
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,075
Fair thee well.

472
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,042
[laughs]

473
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:42,042
-I'm back, I'm back!

474
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:44,275
I got my undies and all
is right with the world!

475
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:52,508
Sweet joy!

476
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,049
Sweet joy!

477
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,042
-So much for that.

478
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:57,075
-Well, I guess there's
not fighting fate.

479
00:20:57,175 --> 00:20:58,508
-Fate schmate.

480
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,375
What about the
future of our art?

481
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:01,442
-Ranma, do something!

482
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:05,375
What happened to boo
hoo, Hopposai is dead?

483
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:06,375
-That's different.

484
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,342
-Happiness and joy!

485
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:08,342
Happiness and joy!

486
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:09,808
The undies are back!

487
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:10,775
-Do you mind?

488
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:23,642
-What was I-- how did these--
you-- you don't understand!

489
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,342
I-- it's not what
you're thinking.

490
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:27,242
Honest!

491
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:28,342
-It's not, huh?

492
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:29,375
Yeah, right.

493
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,108
-I actually worried about him.

494
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:36,075
-I couldn't help it.

495
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:37,542
You've got to believe me!

496
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,358
NARRATOR: I don't believe it!

497
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,391
Kuno in love with Nabiki?

498
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,125
There's something
fishy going on here.

499
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:27,525
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
extra, extra, Kuno and Nabiki,

500
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,025
