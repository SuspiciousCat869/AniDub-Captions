NARRATOR: The Date Monster
of Watermelon Island.

3
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:07,216
Would you look at the
size of this watermelon?

4
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:08,316
Hey, Saotome!

5
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,516
Pretty big, huh?

6
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,583
This is just good
fortune coming our way

7
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:15,283
for our daily deeds, Tendo.

8
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:18,249
In Tokyo, these babies
would cost around 5,000 yen.

9
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,616
But over on
Watermelon Island, I've

10
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:23,349
heard that they're actually in
season the whole year round.

11
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,816
It's been so long since
we've all been on a trip.

12
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:34,783
Yeah, you're right.

13
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:35,483
It's really nice.

14
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:50,857
Huh?

15
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:58,649
[screaming]

00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:04,383
WHIMPERING]

17
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:13,216
What the-- it's Kuno!

18
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:14,183
What happened?

19
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,649
I wonder what Kuno-baby
was doing in the ocean.

20
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:31,916
Well, I would say
he was up to no good.

21
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:32,916
Yeah.

22
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:34,316
Nabiki, stop that.

23
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,316
[laughing]

24
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,949
He was in the
water for some time.

25
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:40,349
Yeah, and it was freezing.

26
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:44,516
Mmm.

27
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,216
That was a good batch.

28
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:49,483
Have another, Tendo.

29
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,116
Here, allow me.

30
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:53,083
Why, thank you.

31
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:55,849
Huh?

32
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:56,983
You all right, Kuno-baby?

33
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:06,016
Hey, you OK?

34
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:12,683
Listen to my heart.

35
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:14,583
With every beat, it cries
out, take this girl,

36
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,916
and together our love
will make history!

37
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:24,016
How dare you strike
me, barbarian?

38
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:25,283
Chill out.

39
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,049
I'm Ranma, you idiot!

40
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,316
Or are you too stupid
to remember anything?

41
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,049
I guess I don't.

42
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:34,883
Huh?

43
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,249
Huh?

44
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:37,149
Huh?

45
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:39,583
Mm-mm-mm.

46
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:40,549
Just who--

47
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:41,090
Huh?

48
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:47,449
Who am I?

49
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:48,049
Tell me.

50
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:56,116
Could he have a
case of amnesia?

51
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,616
You're saying that you
don't know who I am?

52
00:04:58,716 --> 00:04:59,583
I haven't a clue.

53
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:04,383
Does this girl ring any bells?

54
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:09,716
Thanks a lot. [sneeze] Huh?

55
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:10,257
Uh.

56
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:10,765
Um.

57
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,224
Uh.

58
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:12,149
Um.

59
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,016
[groaning]

60
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:17,949
[groaning]

61
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,383
Oh, you're the one--

62
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:26,116
Did you remember something?

63
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:27,549
This is for you.

64
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:30,083
KUNO (VOICEOVER): You
gave me a love letter.

65
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,349
[laughing]

66
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,049
KUNO (VOICEOVER): It
was Valentine's Day.

67
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,949
We went to the amusement
park-- [groan] And then there--

68
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,616
Was what?

69
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:45,449
Our first kiss.

70
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:50,183
Would you stop
making stuff up, huh?

71
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,783
He's turned into
some kind of pervert.

72
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:55,083
I don't think Kuno-baby's
changed at all.

73
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,183
OK, so you're telling
me you don't even

74
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,349
have the slightest clue
of who I am, Kuno-baby?

75
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:09,516
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,549
And the 5,000 yen I lent you?

77
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,949
Oh, is that so?

78
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:14,490
Hmm.

79
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,283
Would you stop toying
with him, Nabiki?

80
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:22,283
You're right.

81
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,316
I should have said
it was 10,000 yen.

82
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,649
KUNO (VOICEOVER): Who am I?

83
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:28,190
Hmm.

84
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:33,183
Huh?

85
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:36,283
When we found you, you
were wearing one of these.

86
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:39,749
What are you saying?

87
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,883
I'm saying your head was
stuck inside a watermelon.

88
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,983
So what's up with that?

89
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,649
Keep away from me!

90
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:48,549
[screaming]

91
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,549
Come on, after him!

92
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,549
No!

93
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:55,016
[screaming]

94
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,449
[screaming]

95
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:03,949
Oh, no!

96
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,916
[screaming]

97
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:08,416
What the--

98
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:11,883
[screaming]

99
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,849
[gasping]

100
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:19,849
Kuno-baby?

101
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,316
[screaming]

102
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,816
Knock it off already!

103
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,283
[growling]

104
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:29,783
[screaming]

105
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:35,216
Man, where did he
learn to do that?

106
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,716
KUNO (VOICEOVER): I can't
believe what I just did.

107
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:45,749
Here's the way I figure it.

108
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,416
Kuno was training on Watermelon
Island and lost his memory.

109
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:53,716
Beyond that, I don't
have a clue, Saotome.

110
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:57,683
Please, can you tell
me who I am? [sobbing]

111
00:07:57,783 --> 00:07:59,883
Kuno, tell me.

112
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:03,516
Your memory-- did you lose it
while training to fight me?

113
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,316
Huh?

114
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,249
Oh!

115
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,016
I just knew you'd
come back to me again!

116
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:20,483
Let's forget about our
past and start over!

117
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,216
It's our destiny to be as one,
and no matter how hard you try,

118
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:26,116
you can't fight destiny!

119
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,949
Get your mitts off
of me, you creep!

120
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:32,016
By the looks of it, Kuno
hasn't really changed at all.

121
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,483
I heard that these sand
baths help cure all ailments.

122
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,383
I told you, I am not sick.

123
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,883
You just lost your memory.

124
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:49,649
Who did?

125
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:50,849
You did!

126
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,016
Jeez, you think I'm laying
up to my neck in sand

127
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,649
with you because I like you?

128
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:58,816
Good point.

129
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,549
Ah!

130
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:01,649
I remember!

131
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,583
You do?

132
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,116
That's it!

133
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:06,183
I must have lost my memory!

134
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,849
[groan]

135
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:18,883
Man, this whole amnesia
thing is getting pretty lame.

136
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:19,949
Hey, Ranma!

137
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:20,583
Huh?

138
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:21,716
How's Kuno doing?

139
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,449
Forgive me, but I
wish there was some way

140
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,083
I could remember who you are.

141
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:33,983
I can't wait.

142
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,416
Let her go, you creep!

143
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:39,257
Huh?

144
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,483
[gasp]

145
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,716
Be thankful I went easy on you.

146
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:52,116
Ranma couldn't move.

147
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,049
Ooh, what a hunk!

148
00:09:58,983 --> 00:09:59,983
Hmph.

149
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,716
I am Tatewaki Kuno,
17 years of age,

150
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:06,616
devilishly handsome,
and master of the sword.

151
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:08,516
That is all you
need to know, girls.

152
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:11,716
Now, are there any questions?

153
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:14,249
So you have amnesia?

154
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:16,116
That's so romantic.

155
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,749
I am on a journey seeking
out my long lost love.

156
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:20,290
Cool.

157
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:26,383
[laughing]

158
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:29,749
Now this is becoming
interesting. [laughing]

159
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:30,949
Ranma, are you OK?

160
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,390
[laughing]

161
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,390
So, tell me, Kuno, do you
remember anything at all?

162
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,490
Go on.

163
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,890
Well, I remember that
once, I was in love.

164
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,290
Boy, I must say, Kuno-baby
sure knows how to shovel it,

165
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,157
doesn't he?

166
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:11,057
You're not kidding.

167
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,390
I finally found you, darling!

168
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:16,931
Oh!

169
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,157
You've returned!

170
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:37,424
--[laughing] The big doofus
never saw it coming!

171
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:39,324
[groan]

172
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:42,157
Once you get your
memory back, we'll

173
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:45,690
have a little contest to
see who's the strongest.

174
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,624
And you don't stand a chance.

175
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:50,457
What in the world does she
think she's doing, anyway?

176
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:52,424
What are you asking me for?

177
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,957
After all, that is your fiancee.

178
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:58,957
When you lost your memory,
you were wearing a watermelon.

179
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:01,824
Maybe if I put it back on,
it'll jar your memory back.

180
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:09,957
[screaming]

181
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,590
You gotta concentrate on
trying to remember, Kuno!

182
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,890
Huh?

183
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,857
OK.

184
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:21,990
Must concentrate!

185
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,857
Must try to remember!

186
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:28,724
Must focus on what happened!

187
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:29,857
Yes.

188
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:30,824
OK.

189
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:31,790
It's coming.

190
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,724
It's coming!

191
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:36,357
Just concentrate
a little harder!

192
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:39,424
Just a little harder!

193
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:42,357
[groaning]

194
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:42,898
Yes!

195
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:43,824
That's it!

196
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:51,957
Did you remember?

197
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:54,724
[laughing]

198
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:56,657
Yes I do.

199
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:57,757
I trained.

200
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:58,757
To what?

201
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:03,524
Go out with you! [laughing]

202
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,924
Ranma, run for it, now!

203
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:07,624
[scream]

204
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,024
Oh, man!

205
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:16,024
Come back here, my love!

206
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:17,524
[scream]

207
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:20,990
[shouting]

208
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,957
Wait for me!

209
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,457
Come back to me, my precious!

210
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,457
Get away from me!

211
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,957
[interposing voices]

212
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:34,424
Stop it!

213
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:36,457
Help!

214
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:37,590
Look, Saotome.

215
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,357
They're headed straight
for Watermelon Island.

216
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:40,624
Huh?

217
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:41,824
Ranma?

218
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:44,390
Why on Earth would
anyone in their right mind

219
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,890
want to go that dump?

220
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,724
Oh, my.

221
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,824
I just had a thought.

222
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:52,490
Don't you think it's a little
dangerous leaving those

223
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,090
two alone on a deserted island?

224
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,090
It's just not safe.

225
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,857
[laughing]

226
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:07,524
Yoo-hoo!

227
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:08,657
Come on out!

228
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:13,724
We're the Adam and Eve
on this desert island!

229
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:14,390
Oh, man!

230
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,324
Huh?

231
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:22,557
Watermelon Island is a legendary
training area for swordsmen?

232
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:23,924
Yeah.

233
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:26,090
And rumor has it that some of
those who venture over there

234
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,824
start to lose their memory from
the endless hours of training

235
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:30,057
they go through.

236
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:42,957
[laughing] Here you are.

237
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:47,390
Oh, great.

238
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,990
If you value your life,
you will date with me!

239
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,890
Get away, you freak!

240
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,557
[shouting]

241
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,824
Huh?

242
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:00,057
[groan]

243
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:03,257
--[laughing] That's
what you get for be--

244
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,531
Huh?

245
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,090
Finally, alone with the girl of
my dreams on a deserted island.

246
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,290
Unfathomable.

247
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,757
The years just seem
to have slipped by.

248
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:31,557
I have a happy wife and
four beautiful children!

249
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,357
Dinner's ready!

250
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:37,124
Now, I long for a fifth child.

251
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:39,124
[screaming]

252
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,024
You're awake, my love.

253
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:46,757
It-- it was a dream.

254
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,024
Well, I am out of here.

255
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,290
You can't leave here!

256
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,524
We're dating!

257
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:52,924
In your dreams, melon head.

258
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:55,357
Ugh, I've had enough of you.

259
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:58,990
For me to regain my
memory, we must date.

260
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,424
Oh, man, even with amnesia,
you don't change, do you?

261
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:06,257
Date with me, date
with me, date with me!

262
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:09,190
You don't realize you
can't get away from me.

263
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,024
Wait, I said!

264
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:13,357
There's a waterfall over there.

265
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,290
Yeah, he's right.

266
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,757
Hey, Kuno, I think your memory
is starting to come back.

267
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:20,757
I mean, how else would
you have known that there

268
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,224
was a waterfall there?

269
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,357
Will you be serious
for a few seconds?

270
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:38,957
Now that you mention it, this
waterfall does seem familiar.

271
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:39,498
Really?

272
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:53,657
[panting]

273
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,724
Now all I have to do
is find those two.

274
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:02,165
Huh?

275
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,590
What's this?

276
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,557
Attention, trainees.

277
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,557
Please pull on rope.

278
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:20,290
I guess this somehow was
a part of Kuno's training.

279
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,831
Hmm.

280
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,231
Huh?

281
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,090
Maybe if I follow the
watermelons, I'll find them.

282
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,224
Ah, yes.

283
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,524
The last thing I remember,
I was standing here

284
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,524
training with the melons.

285
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:43,657
Yes, keep going.

286
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:45,957
This is great!

287
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:46,657
No.

288
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:48,190
I just can't do this.

289
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,790
Come on, just keep
trying, you moron!

290
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,590
The only way my memory will
return is if you date with me!

291
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,557
There's no way that
we're gonna date!

292
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,390
You may have forgotten my
superior fighting ability.

293
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,324
[gulp]

294
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,757
Oh, I can't seem to shake
the bad feeling about this!

295
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:30,057
Scream if you wish, my
sweet, but there is no one

296
00:18:30,157 --> 00:18:33,224
within miles who can hear you.

297
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:35,524
Now you will be all mine.

298
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:37,490
[whimpering]

299
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,957
I command you to
surrender yourself to me!

300
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,857
[scream]

301
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:55,824
What the--

302
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:59,290
[screaming]

303
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,690
Those insipid watermelons are
interfering with all my plans!

304
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,157
[shouting]

305
00:19:08,724 --> 00:19:09,590
Huh?

306
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,057
Suck on this!

307
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,524
Hmm?

308
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:15,990
Hmph!

309
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,490
[laughing]

310
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,724
If you wish, I will
stand here all day!

311
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,657
RANMA (VOICEOVER): He's
unknowingly slicing up

312
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:25,157
the watermelons that he avoids.

313
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:26,324
That's amazing.

314
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:28,857
Kuno's body must be
unconsciously reacting

315
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:32,324
to the watermelons and
attacking them automatically.

316
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:35,657
Make the right decision
and say you'll date with me.

317
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,757
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Man,
I gotta take a chance

318
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:38,924
and see if this works.

319
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,390
[shouting]

320
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,357
You are completely
powerless against me!

321
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:46,824
Oh, Kuno!

322
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,324
Hmm?

323
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:50,457
Oh, she's changed her mind!

324
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,024
Here.

325
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,057
A gift for you!

326
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,424
Huh?

327
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,357
[shouting]

328
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:57,398
Huh?

329
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:01,857
Ha!

330
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,490
Well, I guess the date's off.

331
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:10,124
You mean Kuno knocked
himself out when he

332
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:12,024
hit the melon on his own head?

333
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:15,424
Yeah, like what's
his name's dog thing.

334
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:17,424
While training against
all those watermelons,

335
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:20,324
I guess Kuno got conditioned
to automatically attack

336
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:22,690
any and all
watermelons on sight.

337
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,690
Do you think that's how he lost
his memory in the first place?

338
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,224
Probably.

339
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:27,765
Huh?

340
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:30,057
[groaning]

341
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:32,224
Are you OK, Kuno?

342
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,990
Akane Tendo and Ranma Saotome?

343
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,524
He's got his memory back!

344
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:38,890
Hey, you're back to normal!

345
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,524
The last thing I remember
is I was training, and then--

346
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:44,857
I gotta admit, all the
training you've done

347
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:46,324
has really impressed me.

348
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:49,290
But I hate to tell you, you've
still got a pretty long way

349
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,257
to go until you're at my level.

350
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:53,290
I don't know what
you're talking about.

351
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,457
Huh?

352
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:56,624
Weren't you--
weren't you training

353
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:59,024
so that you could
beat me one day?

354
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,024
Now that Akane Tendo has
graced us with her presence,

355
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:04,357
allow me to display my talents.

356
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:04,898
Huh?

357
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,024
Observe!

358
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:17,924
Witness my precise
swordsmanship!

359
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:21,024
I shall impress the girls next
summer with this technique!

360
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,757
I only wish the
pigtailed girl were here!

361
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:26,224
[laughing]

362
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,090
Want to change
into a girl for him?

363
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,090
No way.

364
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,479
[theme song]

365
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:18,369
RANMA (VOICEOVER): The legend
says that one day, a panda

366
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:20,635
will come down the river
to bring happiness and joy

367
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:22,969
to the people of the land.

368
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,002
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Legend of the Lucky Panda!

369
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:28,135
We'll see you there.
