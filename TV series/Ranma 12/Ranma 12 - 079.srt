-Listen up, stupid.

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,300
There's an energy center
right below the belly button

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,500
that can have an effect
on how strong you are.

Most folks don't know about it,
see, which is why it's an art.

Anyway, all martial

does is focus energy.

-Where do you
think you're going?

67

Ain't you interested in becoming
the world's strongest man?

Stand still and
lift up your shirt.

It'll just take a minute.

-Hey, if I'm the strongest
man in the world,

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,566
then that means
I can beat Ranma!

You're the one who

It's here.

-These?

Oh, just a couple of souvenirs.

You know, I thought
it'd be a challenge,

99
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,500
but I gotta tell you, it was
too easy taking those dojos.

Don't worry, I've
been here all week.

after the fight, shall we?

00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,566
I've got a feeling you'll be
singing a whole 'nother tune.

-You've sure got an
attitude, I'll give you that.

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,200
-You just can't scrub it
off, it don't work that way.

168
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,633
-Ah, listen you.

169
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,166
I never asked for this, OK.

170
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:50,366
Now get this dumb thing
off of me right now!

171
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:54,000
-OK, OK, so I'll
tell you already!

172
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,566
-Ah!

173
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,266
You, you will?

174
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,433
-There's only one way to
remove the mark of the gods,

175
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,400
and that's to fight someone
even stronger than yourself.

176
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,533
Once you do--

177
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,733
-The mark will disappear.

178
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,433
-So is that why you want to
challenge all these dojos?

179
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,600
-They were a lot easier
than I thought they were.

180
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,166
Eh, no one's a
challenge to me anymore.

181
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm practically invincible.

182
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,833
Yep, not even you can
beat me now, Ranma.

183
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,500
It's sad, but that's
the way it is, I guess.

184
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,041
-Humph.

185
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,533
-Well, that's that.

186
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,300
-Wait!

187
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,833
Don't go yet!

188
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:34,366
Look, you gotta let me
try to help you, Ryoga.

189
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:37,366
look, I told you-- the
only way is for me to lose.

190
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:42,166
-I know that, which is why
you've gotta let me try.

191
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,833
Ryoga, listen to me.

192
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:46,600
We're not just
enemies, we're rivals.

193
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,433
-Huh?

194
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,333
We are?

195
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:49,800
-Of course we are.

196
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Why else would we be
fighting all the time, huh?

197
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,033
That's why you gotta wait.

198
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,400
You owe it to me, man.

199
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,500
-Ranma--

200
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,333
-Come on!

201
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,900
We practically grew up together.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,500
-Ranma, I, I, I don't
know what to say!

203
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,633
I-- [sobbing] You're
too good to me.

204
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:09,666
I misjudged you.

205
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,133
Forgive me, please!

206
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,633
-Hm, now.

207
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:18,000
Hiya, take this! [grunts]

208
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,000
[yells]

209
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,966
[screams]

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,466
-Hey!

211
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:29,333
Where'd you go?

212
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,033
Come back!

213
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,033
OK, that's it.

214
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:36,466
The man's going down!

215
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,861
[crash]

216
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,361
[crash]

00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:55,427
[painful yell]

[groaning]

220
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,961
[whimpering]

221
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:09,315
-Well, are you convinced yet?

222
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:11,115
So what's it going to take, huh?

223
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:15,415
-A lot more than you've
got, you arrogant jerk.

224
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:18,382
-That's enough.

225
00:12:18,482 --> 00:12:19,182
[grunts]

226
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:21,415
-Yeah, that's what you think!

227
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:21,956
Hiya!

228
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:25,848
[crash]

229
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:28,082
[crash]

230
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,715
-What are they doing?

231
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,915
-Gee, Akane, I wonder.

232
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:32,982
Construction maybe?

233
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:35,448
-Unable to settle their
differences outside,

234
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,882
the two have moved it
inside to the dojo.

235
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:40,082
-Are they having a fight?

236
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:41,748
-Oh, dear.

237
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:42,448
whole

238
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:44,048
-Oh, come now, Kasumi.

239
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:45,782
Don't sound so disapproving.

240
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:48,882
If two healthy young men
can't engage in little sparing

241
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:52,282
now and again, what's the use
of being a martial artist, huh?

242
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:54,048
Uh, boys will be boys.

243
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,515
-Meanwhile, those boys
are wrecking the dojo.

244
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:00,448
Boys may be boys, dad,
but personally, I'm

245
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:02,082
glad I'm a girl.

246
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:02,882
[slurps]

00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,148

00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:07,048
[breathing heavily]

249
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:07,589
-Huh?

250
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,948
[thud]

251
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:12,415
[thud]

252
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:13,882
[thud]

253
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:17,082
-Here you go, Ranma.

254
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:19,415
This ought to even
the odds a bit.

255
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,482
-Man, now I know that
you've gone and lost it.

256
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:23,548
-You be quiet!

257
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,448
I'm just doing
what I have to do--

258
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:27,615
whatever it takes
for me to lose.

259
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,482
You've got to beat me, remember?

260
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:32,215
If you don't, I'll never
get rid of this stupid mark.

261
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:34,548
You're the only hope
that I have left.

262
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,748
-Let's not drag it out then.

263
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:40,948
I'm going to make you
lose right here and now!

264
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:41,489
Aaaah!

265
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:44,548
[crash]

00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:45,948

00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:48,982
-OK, I'm ready!

269
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:49,815
Ranma?

270
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,215
Come at me at any time!

271
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,448
[grunting]

272
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,348
-All right, enough is enough.

00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:01,389
[gasps]

274
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:02,382
-Sorry.

275
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:04,948
-Ranma, how'd the
fight with Ryoga go?

276
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,648
[snoring]

277
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:14,082
[grumbling]

278
00:14:14,182 --> 00:14:16,648
-I just know it's going
to be in here somewhere.

279
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,315
Ah, this ain't it,
neither is that.

280
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:20,615
This ain't it, neither is this.

281
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:21,582
This ain't it, neither is that.

282
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:22,148
This ain't it.

283
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:22,848
This ain't it.

284
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:23,482
This ain't it either.

285
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:24,023
Nope.

286
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:25,915
[seething]

287
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,115
[grumbling]

288
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:29,048
All right, now this is it.

289
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:31,715
I ask you, am I the
man, or ain't I?

290
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:32,948
Ha, ha!

291
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:35,882
Now that I've got this
scroll, I'm going to-- ugh!

292
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:36,915
Ah!

293
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:40,115
You're going down
man, you just wait.

294
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,515
[sighs]

295
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,315
-Saotome, you big jerk.

296
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:51,282
I should have know better
than to count on you.

297
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:56,182
[sighs]

298
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:59,082
-(THINKING) If I can't get
rid of this stupid work.

299
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:01,048
If Akane somehow sees it--

00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:04,715
-That is so lame!

303
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,682
What a loser!

304
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,148
[laughs]

305
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:10,982
-Then the only one I
can count on is myself!

306
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:12,648
Ranma's no help at all!

307
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:20,482
Ra, Ranma?

308
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:21,948

00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,882
[chuckles]

310
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:28,015
-Get ready, Ryoga,
because I'm not

311
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:30,448
the same man that I used to be.

312
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:34,115
Because now I got a super
secret new ultra technique!

313
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:35,215
[screams]

314
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:37,815
-(THINKING) Super secret
new ultra technique?

315
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:39,015
Dare I to hope?

316
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,248
[seething]

317
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:43,348
-Look, up in the sky!

318
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:44,282
-(THINKING) Ha!

319
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,115
He fell for it, the moron.

320
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:49,348
Like the wolf who waits for
just the right moment to attack.

321
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:53,815
Strike of the wolf's fang!

322
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:58,123
-Hm.

323
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:02,015
[grunting]

324
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:02,556
-OK.

00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:07,782
Saotome School of
Sneaky Attacks step

326
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:11,982
two-- keep things on the level,
and your enemy on the ground.

327
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:14,315
Then, like the tiger,
strike from above.

328
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:17,582
Look!

329
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:18,848
There's 100 yen!

330
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,648
-So how dumb do you think I am?

331
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:31,615
-Hey, uh, you know, don't

you who's dumb!

-I'm sorry, man.

346
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:04,448
I failed you, didn't I?

347
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,548
I'm just too weak, that's all.

It's not you who
failed, it's me.

00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:26,715
I'm just too darn strong
for my own good, that's all.

It's not up to you to
fix my problems, that's

Get them belly down and you
got 'em where you want 'em.

Remember, it's
for your own good.

So try not to hold
it against me, huh?

367
00:17:56,915 --> 00:17:59,182
Payback time!

What kind of jerk
would do such a thing?

00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,148
It's not even good graffiti!

(REMEMBERING AKANE) It's
not even good graffiti!

Ah, it's not that bad.

395
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:15,182
You know, the way I see it, that
mark of yours could be a curse,

396
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:16,515
or you could make it a blessing.

397
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,448
-And how, how am I
supposed to do that?

398
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:22,882
-It all depends on
your attitude, see.

00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,815
For one thing, you can--

-Isn't it great?

00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:40,882
Oh, and I can make
it dance, too.

-And that ain't all, neither.

00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:47,482
You can do parties,
weddings, anniversaries,

all that kind of junk.

414
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:51,382
You'll be laughing all
the way to the bank.

415
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:57,448
Man, just think of all the
possibilities, will ya?

I'll never again dare
