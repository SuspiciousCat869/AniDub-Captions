AKANE (VOICEOVER):
"Akane's Lost Love.

00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:49,489
These Things Happen, You Know."

4
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:51,456
-Running errands today, Kasumi?

5
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:52,589
-I'm going to Dr. Tofu's.

6
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,356
-Kasumi?

7
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:04,956
-Dr. Tofu is completely in
love with my sister Kasumi.

8
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,189
-Oh?

9
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,689
Well, are you sure
about Dr, Tofu?

10
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:09,289
I mean, he didn't
make an announcement

11
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:11,123
about it or anything, did he?

12
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:12,223
-Uh-uh.

13
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:15,889
But it's so obvious that
anyone could see it.

14
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:16,889
-Hm.

15
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:19,656
-Somebody in there?

16
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:20,556
Hello, you two.

17
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:21,923
What can I do for you?

18
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:22,423
-Huh?

19
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:23,256
Uh-- us?

20
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,489
Nothing right?

21
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:27,656
-Ranma, why don't you
come into my office,

22
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,223
and let me take a look
at that cheek of yours.

23
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:31,123
-OK.

24
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:33,156
-You too, Akane.

25
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,889
-Well, I should--
um-- get going.

26
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,923
-But Akane, I've
already made tea.

27
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:40,889
-I'm really sorry.

28
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:43,523
-Hmm?

29
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:44,289
-Well, OK.

30
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:49,756
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Oh, great.

31
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,789
Now I'm stuck here.

32
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:53,723
-So let me see
that injury, Ranma.

33
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:59,856
Hm.

34
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:04,223
If I didn't know better, I'd
say this was Akane's work.

35
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:07,756
-Huh?

36
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,089
Well, how did you know that?

37
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,489
-The angle of the ball.

38
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,489
That and the depth of the
stitch marks on your cheek.

39
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:15,756
-Whoa, even the junk
she hits people with

40
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,589
has Akane's name all over it.

41
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:19,556
-Don't act like I did
it on purpose, Ranma!

42
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:21,389
It was all your fault!

43
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:22,523
-Oh, no.

44
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:25,056
Akane, I didn't know you
really hit that ball.

45
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:26,189
-Huh?

46
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:30,189
-I was only joking with you.

47
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:31,123
-Moron.

48
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:32,123
-It doesn't matter.

49
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:34,289
It's nice to see
Akane full of spirit.

50
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:35,489
-But-- but I--

51
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:36,889
-It makes you what you are.

52
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:39,256
-Yeah, it makes you a tomboy.

53
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,289
-Why don't you shut up, Ranma?

54
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:42,923
-Ooh, I hit a nerve.

55
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,456
You're even more like a
tomboy when you're angry.

56
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:46,089
-Hmph.

57
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:47,123
You're a pervert.

58
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:48,456
-Hey, watch it.

59
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,356
-Dr. Tofu, can't you see
what a pervert Ranma is?

60
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,489
-Hey, I thought I told you
to stop calling me that.

61
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:54,356
-It's true.

62
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:55,856
You always look at me.

63
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:56,423
Admit it!

64
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:56,923
-Ha.

65
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:57,856
You wish.

66
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:58,956
There's not much
there to look at.

67
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,323
-So you're saying that
you never look then?

68
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:01,756
-Well, why would I?

69
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:02,589
You're just boring.

70
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:04,123
That's all.

71
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:04,889
AKANE: Hey!

72
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:05,589
RANMA: Hey, what?

73
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:14,356
[yawn]

74
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:15,823
-Oh, good afternoon.

75
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,023
-Oh, Kashumi dear.

76
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:19,123
How are you?

77
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:21,223
Lovely weather we're
having, don't you think?

78
00:04:21,256 --> 00:04:24,123
I-- I think left
the kettle on, dear.

79
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:25,089
Buh-bye now.

80
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:30,623
Oh, good grief.

81
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:32,223
Don't tell me you're
gonna go in there.

82
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:33,023
-Well, yes.

83
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,256
My back's bothering me and--

84
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,723
-You'll be making
a grave mistake

85
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:36,723
if you know what I mean.

86
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:37,889
She's in there.

87
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,223
-Not her.

88
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:41,789
I guess I'll have to reschedule.

89
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,756
My back pain and me and all.

90
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:49,923
-All right, Ranma.

91
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,389
Now, let's have a look.

92
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:52,723
KASUMI: Hello.

93
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:53,223
-Kasumi.

94
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,223
-Hello there.

95
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:00,923
Good afternoon, Dr. Tofu.

96
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,556
-Hi, Kasumi.

97
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,023
What an amazing
coincidence that we

98
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:09,856
should meet here of all places.

99
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:10,856
-I guess.

100
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,189
What was that horrible
cracking noise?

101
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:14,156
-Noise?

102
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,123
No, I never noticed any noise.

103
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:19,723
-Ranma, what's the matter?

104
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:21,923
-Kasumi, are you a
friend of Ranma's too?

105
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,456
He's one of my regulars.

106
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,789
Lately, he keeps getting
these bruises from somewhere

107
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,656
and his joints keep dislocating.

108
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,689
Isn't that right, Ranma?

109
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:34,723
So, Kasumi, what's up?

110
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:38,656
-I came to return the book that
I borrowed from you, Dr. Tofu.

111
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:41,689
Also, I'm not sure if it's
a fitting gift or not, but--

112
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,489
-Well now, thank you so much.

113
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:47,423
Oh look, everyone.

114
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:51,889
It's a mask.

115
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:53,856
Actually it's fitting
very well, Kasumi.

116
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,689
-But that's the wrapping
for the present.

117
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,089
Here.

118
00:05:58,123 --> 00:05:59,256
-A dish of candy.

119
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,823
Oh, how sweet of you, Kasumi.

120
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,723
Oh, dear.

121
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,489
Kasumi, if I'm gonna
wear this lovely mask,

122
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:09,656
I won't be able to eat this.

123
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,323
-Uh-- Doctor.

124
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:14,756
-What exactly is
the problem, Akane?

125
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:15,889
-I'm Ranma.

126
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,389
-OK, what is it, Ranma?

127
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:18,856
-My neck is killing me.

128
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:19,723
-Another injury?

129
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,756
Oh, what'll I do
with you, Ranma?

130
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,456
Let's see now.

131
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:25,123
There.

132
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:26,089
you're cured.

133
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:27,456
-It hurts.

134
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:30,023
-Mr. Saotome, do me a
favor and bring Kasumi

135
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,389
some tea or
something, would you?

136
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:41,323
-Akane?

137
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:42,823
-Huh?

138
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:46,323
-That Dr. Tofu is such a
character, don't you think?

139
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:48,323
-You think so?

140
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:50,989
You might not believe this,
but he's completely different

141
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:52,256
when you're not around.

142
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,623
-Oh, you don't say?

143
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:56,089
Why is that?

144
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:56,889
-Buh-bye.

145
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:58,923
-Hm?

146
00:06:58,956 --> 00:06:59,523
-I gotta go.

147
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:01,323
See you.

148
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:03,189
-I wonder if something's
bothering Akane.

149
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,689
She's acting very strange.

150
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,156
-Well, I'm outta here.

151
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,823
-Betty, Betty, be a dear and
go fetch Kasumi some tea,

152
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:11,323
would you?

153
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:12,189
Thanks.

154
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,723
-I heard Kasumi's in there.

155
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:15,089
-So much for our golden years.

156
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:16,456
-Hello.

157
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,356
Bye.

158
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:17,823
-Akane!

159
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,823
Hey, Akane!

160
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:27,223
-To go in there now for an
exam could cost you your life.

161
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,223
-And he's usually such
a fine young doctor too.

162
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,356
-Huh?

163
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:52,589
RANMA (VOICEOVER): What?

164
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:53,423
Is she crying?

165
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:08,656
-What are you doing here, Ranma?

166
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:10,956
-Now that's more like
the Akane I know.

167
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,889
-Just what did you mean by that?

168
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:15,656
Surely you don't
expect me to believe

169
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,489
that you're here to cheer me up?

170
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,556
-What's the big deal?

171
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:19,623
Why should you believe it?

172
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:23,256
Hey, I'm cured.

173
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:24,856
-How nice for you.

174
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,156
-There now.

175
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,889
I'm glad to see you're back
to your normal self again.

176
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,289
-What's did you say?

177
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:30,523
-Now that's the ticket.

178
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:31,023
-Hmph.

179
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,089
Why are you following me?

180
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:54,889
-Why should you care?

181
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,089
-Don't tell me you're
worried about me?

182
00:09:57,123 --> 00:09:59,523
-Why should I be worried
about someone like you?

183
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:00,589
-You shouldn't.

184
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:02,889
So stop following me already.

185
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:04,423
-Who says I'm following you?

186
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:05,723
-You're annoying me.

187
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:06,956
-Well, that's OK.

188
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,956
-No, it's not OK.

189
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:12,056
-Well, sorry.

190
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,823
-Now I get it.

191
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:14,756
-What do you get?

192
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:22,889
-Oh, I see.

193
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,289
I think you really
do like me after all.

194
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:28,056
-What?

195
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:28,923
-Admit it.

196
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:30,356
That's why you're following me.

197
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:31,889
-Akane, wait.

198
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,389
How could I ever like a
non-cute girl like you?

199
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:37,889
-Catch me if you can!

200
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:39,389
-Wait!

201
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,389
Huh?

202
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:41,889
Whoa!

203
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:54,723
You tricked me.

204
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:56,123
-Haha.

205
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,956
Gotcha.

206
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:00,056
-So what'd gotten
into her today?

207
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:14,823
Thanks to you, now I've
gotta go take a bath.

208
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:18,556
Say--

209
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:19,289
-Huh?

210
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:21,889
-I've got a better idea.

211
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:24,056
How much money do
you have on you?

212
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:24,856
-Why do you ask?

213
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:27,189
-Lend me some 'cuz I'm starving.

214
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:30,623
let's go and get some food.

215
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,089
-You really are acting
different today, Akane.

216
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:36,456
-If you lend me some money,
it'll be my treat, Ranma.

217
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:40,656
-Ranma.

218
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:39,698
-Whoopee.

219
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:50,898
-Still hungry?

220
00:12:57,465 --> 00:13:00,165
so I'm not all dainty
and delicate like Kasumi.

221
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:01,498
Big deal.

222
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,331
-Hey, that is not what I said.

223
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:20,098
-Well, for as long
as I can remember

224
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:24,831
Dr. Tofu's been in love
with my sister, Kasumi.

225
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:26,131
-How do you know?

226
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:27,265
-I just do.

227
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:30,365
Weren't you watching
him back there?

228
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:31,798
He was out of it.

229
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:36,165
Whenever Kasumi's around, Dr.
Tofu always gets like that.

230
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:39,198
He's been like that
for a while now.

231
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:41,831
-Akane, if you put all
your time into practicing,

232
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:45,198
you won't ever have any
time to get married.

233
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:46,698
-I'll find the time.

234
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:48,165
-Knowing you, the
man you'll marry

235
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:50,065
will have to be even
stronger than you are.

236
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:51,065
Where will you find him?

237
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:54,131
-But I've already
found him, doctor.

238
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:56,865
-Who is he?

239
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,998
-Is anyone here?

240
00:13:59,031 --> 00:13:59,498
-Kasumi.

241
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:06,131
-I made some red beans and rice,
and thought I'd bring you some.

242
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,231
-Hello, Kasumi.

243
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,298
What an amazing
coincidence that we

244
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:11,398
should meet here of all places.

245
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,231
-I hope Akane isn't
too much trouble.

246
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,798
-Oh, no trouble.

247
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:20,065
I was working out some of
the kinks in her muscles.

248
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:36,365
-And-- and it gets even worse.

249
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:38,898
Akane, you've certainly
lost a lot of weight.

250
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,798
-Oh.

251
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:44,365
There's lint all over you.

252
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:44,831
-Kasumi.

253
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,931
You really shocked me
there for a moment, Kasumi.

254
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:51,798
Ow.

255
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:52,298
Ow.

256
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:53,665
Ow.

257
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:56,498
-And then, Dr. Tofu
ran all over town,

258
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:58,565
carrying Betty on its back.

259
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,231
-Haha.

260
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,465
Tell me you're kidding.

261
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,165
-I wish I was.

262
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:04,131
-Dr. Tofu would never
do something silly

263
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:07,898
like that for my sake.

264
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:08,731
-Come on.

265
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:09,765
You're pulling my leg, right?

266
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:10,898
-It's the truth.

267
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:13,098
-Man, he's really
got it bad, don't he?

268
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,098
-It's all true.

269
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:15,798
-Stupid jerk.

270
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,131
-He's really in love.

271
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,598
-And that leaves you with
a really broken heart now,

272
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:21,065
doesn't it?

273
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:24,098
Uh-- I-- Uh--

274
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,465
-I'm going home.

275
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,265
-Oh, OK.

276
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:51,098
I'll--

277
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:52,098
-By myself, Ranma.

278
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,498
If it's the same to you.

279
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:54,431
Stupid me.

280
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:55,931
It's not like I
didn't know better.

281
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:57,365
-Hey, you never know.

282
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:58,465
I mean, it could happen.

283
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:00,998
It's not impossible, right?

284
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:04,731
-Would you just stop trying
to cheer me up, Ranma?

285
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:07,531
I've got a broken heart, or
have you forgotten already?

286
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,198
-Well then--

287
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,231
-Then what?

288
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:12,165
-You gotta realize
these things happen.

289
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:17,098
Just give it up, Akane.

290
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:18,965
-And who are you to
lecture me on love?

291
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:20,865
You don't know a thing about it.

292
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,765
-I'm only trying to
help you out here.

293
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,565
-I don't need your help!

294
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,265
-Oh, is that so?

295
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:28,565
-Yes, it is.

296
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:29,698
-Fine, then!

297
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,465
Just don't come crying
to me the next time

298
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:34,265
you get all weepy and
mooning over some dumb guy.

299
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:35,565
-How can you say that?

300
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:36,865
RANMA: Get used to it.

301
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:38,931
You don't need my
help, remember?

302
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:39,598
-That's right.

303
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,631
I don't!

304
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,198
And don't tell me
how to live my life!

305
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,465
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Oh great.

306
00:16:57,498 --> 00:16:59,965
My school bag, I forgot
it at Dr. Tofu's clinic.

307
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,298
-Pop, give me some hot water.

308
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:29,265
Thanks, Pop.

309
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,398
-Wait.

310
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:32,665
Ranma, tell me.

311
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:34,398
What happened to Akane?

312
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:36,831
-I dunno, She's probably
boo-hooing her eyes

313
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:38,531
out somewhere, I guess.

314
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:40,298
-You fool!

315
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:41,531
-What's your problem?

316
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:42,898
-Listen, Ranma.

317
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:47,231
Let me tell you is this-- how
his thoughtless words broke

318
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,165
my heart.

319
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:50,665
Have you heard
these words before?

320
00:17:50,698 --> 00:17:52,565
-Where'd you hear
something cheesy like that?

321
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:54,965
-I read it in that magazine.

322
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:57,265
-So what're you telling me for?

323
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:59,998
-It means that sometimes
we hurt the ones we love.

324
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:01,898
When Akane's feeling
bad about something,

325
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:03,665
you should be the
one to comfort her.

326
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,431
You're her fiance after all.

327
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:08,165
-Which I wouldn't be, if you'd
bothered to ask me first!

328
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:09,765
-What's done is done, my boy.

329
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:13,831
Look after Akane.

330
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:16,031
You're old enough to know
how women are sometimes.

331
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:27,165
Listen to me, Ranma.

332
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:29,298
Sometimes people hurt
each other without even

333
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:33,098
knowing that they're doing it.

334
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:37,065
Even I, your own father, have
been known to make mistakes.

335
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:38,598
Why when I was a young man--

336
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:47,431
-No, it can't be true.

337
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:53,398
-It's true, Natsuko.

338
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,398
I don't think we can
see each other anymore.

339
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:57,965
-But why?

340
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:00,798
Don't tell me there's someone
else in your life besides me,

341
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:01,965
is there?

342
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:04,365
-Now that you
mention it, there is.

343
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:05,631
-But you said you loved me.

344
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:08,198
How could you be so
cruel and thoughtless?

345
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,498
-Well, I love her
more than I love you.

346
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:21,431
-Is she beautiful?

347
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:24,798
-Actually, she's a much better
dresser than you, so yes.

348
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,265
I'd say so.

349
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:28,798
She's got great style.

350
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:31,098
It was a hard choice for
me to make, you know.

351
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:33,465
But she's so kind
and gentle, you see.

352
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:34,798
And sweet and innocent.

353
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:39,998
Of course, it doesn't hurt
that her family is very rich.

354
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:42,331
I guess you can understand
why I love her more than you,

355
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:43,698
right, Natsuko?

356
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:47,165
You won't give me any
trouble, now will you?

357
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,165
-Trouble this!

358
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,631
-I gotta snap
myself out of this.

359
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:03,198
Huh?

360
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:17,731
If we're gonna fight,
at least get into it.

361
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,231
How do you expect me
to work out my anger

362
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,331
if you won't fight back?

363
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:29,265
-Akane, don't you ever get tired
of being angry all the time?

364
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:30,398
-I like being angry.

365
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,731
-Well, that's too bad.

366
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,598
-Why's that?

367
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:38,965
-'Cuz you're really
cute when you smile.

368
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:39,765
-Huh?

369
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:40,265
-Gotcha.

370
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:47,965
-Huh?

371
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:52,965
Hey, no fair.

372
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:53,931
That didn't count.

373
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:05,698
-'Cuz you're really
cute when you smile.

374
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,865
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I wonder.

375
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:18,631
Did he mean that?

376
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:28,498
-What're you making
that goofy face for?

377
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:29,731
I think I'm gonna be sick.

378
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,531
-What are you doing in my room?

379
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:43,931
-Hm.

380
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:46,665
Ranma, I thought that you
already had your neck fixed.

381
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:48,465
-Well, I did, Pop.

382
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:49,398
but it's gotten worse.

383
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:58,365
-Looks bad.

384
00:21:58,398 --> 00:21:59,731
This oughtta take about a week.

385
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:06,031
-Ranma.

386
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,560
[theme music]

387
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:40,450
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Some new guy's

388
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:43,016
come to our school to
settle a grudge with Ranma.

389
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,083
His name's Ryoga Hibiki,
and he hasn't got a clue.

390
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:47,650
I'm serious.

391
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:49,616
he's traveled half of
Japan on foot just trying

392
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,083
to find this school.

393
00:23:51,116 --> 00:23:56,683
Next time on Ranma 1/2-- "Enter
Ryoga, The Eternal Lost Boy."

394
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:58,816
See you there.
