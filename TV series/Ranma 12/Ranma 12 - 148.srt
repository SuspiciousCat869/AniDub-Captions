Pandas chomping at bamboo.

Raccoons chomping at your shoe.

Lizard leaping--

6
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:49,048
Father, that's a nice piece
of bamboo you've found.

7
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:50,415
Thanks, Kasumi.

8
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:51,915
You like it?

9
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:54,215
The bamboo gods have outdone
themselves this year.

10
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:58,048
KASUMI: And just in time for
the Tanabata Festival of Lovers.

11
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:00,382
Hm?

12
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:02,348
You know better than that.

13
00:02:02,382 --> 00:02:03,582

AKANE: Wow.

18
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,882
This is incredible.

19
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,482
This is the one
time every year when

20
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:22,015
the star known as Princess Ori
meets her starry lover, Kengyu.

21
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:25,682
It's so beautiful.

00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,448
How romantic.

23
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,882
Lay off the mushy stuff, Akane.

24
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,615
You're giving me the creeps.

25
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:31,848
You're the creep here!

26
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:33,148
Anyway, this is a
festival of lovers,

27
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:35,482
so it definitely has
nothing to do with you!

28
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:36,948
Right.

29
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,182
You really are made out of
steel, aren't you, Ranma?

30
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,182
Steely is as steely does.

31
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:42,715
What did you say?

32
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:44,215
KASUMI: Akane!

33
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,115
Huh?

34
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:47,115
Kasumi, what is it?

35
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:48,248
Be careful up there.

36
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:50,915
The balcony railing is
getting kind of loose.

37
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:51,782
I will.

00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:54,448
The star disappeared.

What?

41
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:57,282
Take a closer look.

00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,415
OK.

43
00:02:58,448 --> 00:02:59,048

00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:12,415
Orion moved just now.

00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:13,982
Look!

53
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:14,948
Over that way.

00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,656
Alane, where do you
think you're going?

66
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,656
Are you nuts?

67
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:44,856
You just fell off a balcony!

68
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,956
I'm sure it landed
right around here.

69
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,156
It couldn't have been a star.

70
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,589
It must've been a
weather balloon.

71
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,323
Otherwise, there'd
be cops everywhere.

72
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,656
I know what I saw!

73
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,223
It's your head injury!

74
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:57,123
There's nothing wrong with my
head or my eyesight, either!

You wouldn't be
Princess Ori, would you?

00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:27,156
Hey!

82
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,289
Knock it off.

00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,156
You are.

00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,756
I'm almost positive.

86
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,256
You must be a star.

87
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,256
You can tell?

88
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:38,556
You know I'm a star?

89
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:41,523
Mhm.

Oh!

Princess Ori?

93
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:50,056
Princess Ori of the
famous Japanese fairy tale?

94
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,689
Princess, how did
you end up on Earth?

95
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:54,823
I'm so busy during
the lovers' festival.

96
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:57,856
I thought I'd take some time
off while I had the chance.

97
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,023
So what's the deal
with your love, Kengyu?

[gasp]

99
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:03,956
He's a very nice man.

100
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:05,556
Who'd have thought
the Princess herself

101
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:08,523
would make an appearance right
before the Festival of Lovers?

102
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:11,623
This rundown old house isn't
fit for royalty like yourself,

103
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,856
but I hope you'll try to
make yourself at home.

104

welcome would have been enough.

With those clothes on, you
look like an ordinary girl.

108
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,456
Our place is pretty
simple, but I

109
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,389
hope you'll make
yourself comfortable.

110
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:29,089
Huh?

111
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:29,723
Thank you.

Princess Ori helped to make it.

118
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:13,423
I wanted to do something in
return for all your kindness.

119

I really hope you like it.

120
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:16,789
Well, you can
probably rest assured

121
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:19,223
that it won't be as bad
as somebody's cooking.

122
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:20,523
Who would that be?

123
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:22,689

131
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:36,423
I mean, offerings are
a rare treat for us.

Aw.

138
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:54,523
She could be your twin, Akane.

139
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,123
Huh.

140
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,123
Tendo, in the fairytale,
isn't Princess Ori

141
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:09,389
supposed to grant three
wishes or something?

142
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:10,389
Huh.

143
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:12,023
Saotome, she's not a genie.

144
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,456
The princess is
just doing chores

145
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:17,523
until her prince
comes looking for her

146
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,456
with a pair of glass slippers.

147
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,023
Ah.

148
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,456
You know, Tendo, I don't think
that's the right fairytale,

149
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:24,056
either.

150
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:28,756
We have no idea.

151
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,623
I'm sorry for causing
all that trouble.

152
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,689
Hey, it's nothing
to apologize about.

153
00:07:38,723 --> 00:07:40,923
In fact, it made us happy
to know you have flaws

154
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:43,523
just like us earthlings do.

Huh?

159
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:48,989
Look out!

Wow.

00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:02,889
How'd she move so fast?

164
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,189
GENMA: Why, you!

165
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:07,723
Huh?

166
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:08,723
That's Pop!

00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:16,289
Come on.

172
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:17,356
Talk to me.

173
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,889
Be on your guard, Ranma.

174
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:21,789
The man who did this to
us has martial arts moves

175
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:23,423
that are unbeatable.

176
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:24,289
[groan]

177
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:25,089
Hang in there, Pop.

178
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:27,356
KENGYU: I'll challenge
anyone simply

179
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:28,523
for the thrill of victory.

180
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:29,123
What?

181
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:37,423
You're the guy who goes around
destroying training halls!

182
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,489
Correct.

183
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:39,689
[mooing]

184
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:41,423
And that's your sidekick?

185
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:42,856
I'll take you on, farm boy.

186
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,589
But first, get that cow
out of my training hall!

187
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:47,656
Watch it!

188
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,389
She's Moochan.

189
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:50,389
[mooing]

190
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,123
[groan]

191
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:54,589
Yeah, whatever.

192
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:57,189
Come on!

193
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:58,189
[yelling]

194
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:00,723
[groans]

195
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:05,056
Let's see you dodge
this, you little cowpoke.

196
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:06,189
[groan]

197
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:08,989
(VOICEOVER) This guy's
not so strong after all.

198
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:09,989
[laughter]

199
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,723
Huh?

200
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:17,656
I'll wipe that
smile off your face!

201
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:19,856
Kengyu Superstar Maneuver!

202
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,189
[groan]

203
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:27,589
What?

204
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:29,489
What happened?

205
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:31,023
[laughter]

206
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:34,156
Let's go, [inaudible].

207
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:35,123
[mooing]

208
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:36,989
[groan]

209
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:39,156
Hey.

210
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:40,556
Not so fast.

211
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:41,289
[groan]

212
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:45,289
How do you feel, Ranma?

213
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,323
Are you OK?

214
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,156
[groan]

215
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:48,923
Now I know!

216
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,223
I should have been cautious!

217
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,723
Who were you fighting?

218
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:52,623
I don't know.

219
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:54,423
Some freak with a cow.

220
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:55,856
A cow?

221
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:58,123
What exactly did
the man look like?

222
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:01,189
I've just figured out who
the young man is, Ranma.

223
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:02,256
Huh?

224
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,456
He's known as the
Training Hall Destroyer,

225
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:07,756
and he roams the countryside
with his menacing cow.

226
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:09,223
He's considered
extremely dangerous

227
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:13,089
and should be
approached with caution.

228
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:13,571
Huh?

229
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:18,071
[gasp]

230
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:22,805
Sorry.

231
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:24,338
I had a feeling it might be him.

232
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:25,671
You know him?

233
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,105
It's my boyfriend, Kengyu.

234
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,238
Kengyu?

235
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:30,938
You mean your boyfriend
from the fairytale?

236
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,005
Yes.

237
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:33,271
The real reason that
I descended to Earth

238
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:35,471
was so that I
could look for him.

239
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:37,038
I owe you all an apology.

240
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,705
It's all my fault that he's
come here to your training hall

241
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:40,638
and roughed you up.

242
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:41,805
[gasp]

243
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:45,205
[animal sounds]

244
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:52,620
[animal sounds]

245
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:59,001
The Milky Way style of
martial arts, you say?

246
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,401
And you used to be a member?

247
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,634
Now it makes sense.

248
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:09,134
My parents arranged for Kengyu
and I to marry one another.

249
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,501
Huh?

250
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:11,468
[gasp]

251
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:14,868
This story seems
vaguely familiar somehow.

252
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,134
That's the funny thing
with folk stories.

253
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:18,268
Don't you think?

254
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,368
ORI (VOICEOVER): Kengyu
was like a different man

255
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,434
when we were first engaged.

256
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:25,134
Even though my parents
had arranged our marriage,

257
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:27,468
we were deeply in
love with each other.

258
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,434
There was only
one small problem.

259
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:35,934
Yah!

260
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:36,901
[groan]

261
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:39,501
Kengyu, you're such a klutz.

262
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:40,801
[laughter]

263
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,234
Sorry about that.

264
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,601
You're pathetic.

265
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:46,201
And you expect to inherit the
martial arts training hall?

266
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:48,868
I don't know.

267
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,434
Thanks again, Moochan.

268
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,234
[mooing]

269
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:53,301
Don't rely on her.

270
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,901
You've got to stand
on your own feet.

271
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,168
Well, I don't have
any talent of my own.

272
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:00,168
I'd be happy just to live my
life without all this pressure.

273
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,401
You're the princess.

274
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,601
So I don't have to work so hard.

275
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:04,934
[laughter]

276
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:07,368
Quit that, Moochan.

277
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:09,834
Stop being such a wimp
hanging around in the cow pods

278
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,401
and swapping spit
with that bovine,

279
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:16,301
and start making an effort
to be strong, will you?

280
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,434
Uh.

281
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:18,434
Oh.

282
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:19,968
Sorry for raising my voice.

283
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:23,168
After that, he left on a long
term training expedition.

284
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:29,468
An arranged marriage
to someone else?

285
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:32,234
But Father, Kengyu
hasn't run away.

286
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,901
He's vowed to
become strong, and I

287
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:36,468
know he's out there
somewhere training.

288
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,501
The wedding's July 7?

289
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:40,034
All right, Father.

290
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:44,201
If Kengyu hasn't returned by
then, you'll have your way.

291
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,168
No prob.

292
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,868
We'll help you find
him before then.

293
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,901
It's not exactly that
simple, I'm afraid, chuckles.

294
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,334
Sure, it is, Akane.

295
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:55,034
All we have to do is get
Kengyu back by the seventh.

296
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:56,468
What makes you think he'll go?

297
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,534
I've got my ways
of making it happen.

298
00:12:58,568 --> 00:12:59,568
Yeah, right.

299
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:02,934
Except for one thing-- you lost.

300
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,134
Yes.

301
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,934
But if Kengyu's travelling
the countryside training

302
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:09,768
as intensely as it sounds, then
I suspect that marriage might

303
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:12,168
be the last thing on his mind.

304
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:13,068
[gasp]

305
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:14,301
[gasp]

306
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,668
Huh?

307
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:18,768
How could you say that?

308
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,534
A woman's hopes should
never be crushed.

309
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:22,334
[groan]

310
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,834
AKANE: Princess Ori.

311
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:33,168
Sorry I ran out like that.

312
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,634
I've been nothing but a
terrible burden to you all.

313
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:36,868
Don't be ridiculous.

314
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,268
You haven't been a
burden to any of us.

315
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,768
And we've still got two
days to find Kengyu.

316
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:41,634
That's right.

317
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:43,268
So there's still hope.

318
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:44,068
Come on.

319
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,634
Why don't we work out a bit?

320
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:48,434
I'm not very good, but I'd love
to be your sparring partner.

321
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:49,034
Huh?

322
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,401
[fighting sounds]

323
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:01,401
[groan]

324
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,401
You're good!

325
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:09,568
So are you.

326
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:10,601
Thanks, Akane.

327
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,101
I feel so much better.

328
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,301
My pleasure.

329
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,968
I'd love to work out with
you anytime, Prince Ori.

330
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,668
Hey, don't you think
we have a lot in common?

331
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:20,934
I've been thinking
the same thing.

332
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:22,634
Except for the fame and stuff.

333
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:25,234
Your fiancee sure
seems really nice.

334
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:26,101
Ranma?

335
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:27,401
No way!

336
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,568
That guy is so frustrating,
I could just dropkick him.

337
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,668
Akane, I used to think Kengyu
was like that before, too.

338
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:35,801
[gasp]

339
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:39,668
Hm.

340
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,701
Kengyu keeps moving
from place to place,

341
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,301
busting up all the
training halls.

342
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:46,668
So if I look around long enough,
I should be able to find him.

343
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:47,601
Hi!

344
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:48,201
Huh?

345
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:53,968
[laughter]

346
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:58,034
Sensei, I guess that just
leaves you now, doesn't it?

347
00:14:58,068 --> 00:14:59,901
Why, you!

348
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:00,968
Huh?

349
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,268
(VOICEOVER) This'll
be a perfect chance

350
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,468
to watch him and find
out his weaknesses.

351
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:06,468
[laughter]

352
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,068
[gasp]

353
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,034
Kengyu Super Star!

354
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:14,534
[gasp]

355
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:15,034
[meowing]

356
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:17,401
[scream]

357
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:23,368
[purring]

358
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:28,001
[groan]

359
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:32,168
A kitty cat.

360
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:42,268
Huh?

361
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:43,268
Kengyu?

362
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,968
What are you doing here?

363
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:49,468
Kengyu, come home with me.

364
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,134
I heard about your marriage.

365
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,401
All the stars are
talking about it.

366
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:54,734
Congratulations.

367
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,534
It won't happen if
we go back together.

368
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:57,168
No chance!

369
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,034
[gasp]

370
00:15:58,068 --> 00:15:59,668
I'm staying here
to get stronger.

371
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,468
Forget about that, Kengyu.

372
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,601
I was far too harsh on you.

373
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:06,401
Please, come back home with me.

374
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:07,001
Huh?

375
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:13,468
You were right about me
needing to be strong.

376
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:17,801
One day, I hope to have my very
own martial arts training hall.

377
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:18,768
Oh, Kengyu.

378
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,001
Don't you get anything?

379
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:22,668
We'll have to make him go.

380
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,068
You again.

381
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:26,601
Yeah, and last time you
had a couple lucky shots.

382
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,401
But now it's payback time.

383
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:29,701
Another match?

384
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:30,568
Sure thing.

385
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,134
I'll take you on.

386
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:33,268
Here's the deal.

387
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:36,968
If I win, you have to
return to the Milky Way.

388
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:38,201
Hm.

389
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:40,001
Pretty high stakes, but
I'll accept your challenge.

390
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:43,001
You don't stand a chance, fool.

391
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:47,401
And if you lose, you have to be
my beloved [inaudible] servant.

392
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,301
[groan]

393
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:58,034
(VOICEOVER) What can
I do to defeat Kengyu?

394
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:58,516
Ranma?

395
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:04,316
Wouldn't you be better off
getting a good night's sleep?

396
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,750
I'm trying to figure
out how to win the match.

397
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:08,483
Over the Kengyu Superstar move?

398
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:09,883
Yeah.

399
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,750
I don't know how I can
counter that move of his.

400
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:14,616
Kengyu is one strong
opponent, Akane.

401
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,650
I know.

402
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:17,616
Why don't you practice on me?

403
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,950
Right.

404
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:20,416
Like defeating a
weakling like you

405
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,683
is going to help me against
someone like Kengyu.

406
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:25,516
[scream]

407
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,916
What's the matter?

408
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,616
Can't take a punch from a
little weakling like me?

409
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,183
[drums]

410
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,683
We shall now commence a one set
match between Ranma and Kengyu.

411
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:43,316
No holds barred.

412
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,050
So do what it takes, and
may the best man win.

413
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,383
Start.

414
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,783
[yelling]

415
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:50,350
[fight sounds]

416
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,950
(VOICEOVER) As long as
my back's to the wall,

417
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:54,650
I can't take Kengyu's
kick in the head.

418
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:55,550
What?

419
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,216
You call this fighting?

420
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,783
[groan]

421
00:17:58,816 --> 00:17:59,983
My arm's stuck.

422
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:02,150
I-- I can't get it
out of the wall.

423
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:03,116
[laughter]

424
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,883
[groan]

425
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,483
Kengyu Superstar Maneuver!

426
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:10,250
This is too easy.

427
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:11,516
[groan]

428
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,550
Kengyu Superstar!

429
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,850
[scream]

430
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:16,750
Running is all Ranma
can do to avoid getting

431
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:18,250
kicked in the back of the head.

432
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:20,316
Kengyu knows that, and
he's playing to him.

433
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,116
He's wearing Ranma down.

434
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,616
But it's not until Ranma's
completely exhausted

435
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,350
that he'll use the full force of
his Kengyu Superstar Maneuver.

436
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:30,316
Ranma.

437
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,283
[sigh]

438
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:32,616
[laughter]

439
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:37,650
(VOICEOVER) Kengyu,
why are you doing this?

440
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,150
Where did this
confidence come from?

441
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:42,483
[gasp]

442
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,750
(VOICEOVER) I don't stand a
chance at this rate, Akane.

443
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,616
I've got to win!

444
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,550
[groan]

445
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:49,883
Now!

446
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,750
Kengyu Superstar Maneuver!

447
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,316
[scream]

448
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:57,283
Huh?

449
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:58,550
[groan]

450
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,950
Ha.

451
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,783
So this is what the real Kengyu
Superstar kick is all about.

452
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:08,316
He catches
everyone's attention,

453
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,750
and then he gets his cow
the kick his opponent

454
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,183
in the back of the head.

455
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,683
That's the Kengyu
Superstar Maneuver.

456
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,816
That's ridiculous.

457
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,783
What's the matter?

458
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:18,483
Did you just figure it out?

459
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:23,783
Why, you dirty-- I'm going
to get you good, Kengyu.

460
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:25,050
[laughter]

461
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,616
Get a load of my
exploding roundhouse kick!

462
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,183
KENGYU: I'm sorry!

463
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:36,316
Today's the Tanabata
Festival of Lovers.

464
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,550
We made it just in time.

465
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,783
Thank goodness for that.

466
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:40,950
Thanks so much
for all your help.

467
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:43,583
I've learned not to rely on
Moochan's strength anymore.

468
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,550
[mooing]

469
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,450
Kengyu, you might be stronger
than before, but being kind

470
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:49,516
is what really counts.

471
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,550
You better treat her good now.

472
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,683
Yeah, I know.

473
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,183
Akane, I hope we meet again.

474
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,283
Me, too.

475
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:02,183
Huh?

476
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:04,883
What's this?

477
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,550
Next, it's your return, Akane.

478
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,083
I really hope you'll work
things out with your boyfriend.

479
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:10,716
What?

480
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,616
No!

481
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,783
You don't understand!

482
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,383
Come on, [inaudible].

483
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,383
[mooing]

484
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,950
[laughter]

485
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:23,750
Goodbye, Princess Ori!

486
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:25,350
Please, come back again!

487
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,383
RANMA: Akane.

488
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,650
Akane?

489
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:33,583
Hey, Akane!

490
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,350
Huh?

491
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:37,283
Ah, you finally came to.

492
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:39,016
Thank goodness my
daughter's all right.

493
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,716
I told you to be careful.

494
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,750
Lucky thing you've
got such a hard head.

495
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,283
What are you doing?

496
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:46,216
Let go!

497
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,150
[groan]

498
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,983
Just relax.

499
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:53,683
Don't you remember falling
off the balcony a second ago?

500
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:54,850
What?

501
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:56,016
Then where's the
princess and Kengyu?

502
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,683
Right where they're
supposed to be.

503
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,016
Take a look in the
sky, and you'll

504
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,116
see they're right
where you left them.

505
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,616
Huh?

506
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,616
[sigh]

507
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,483
(VOICEOVER) Was it a dream?

508
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:06,916
The whole thing?

509
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,583
But it all seemed so real.

510
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:11,183
Huh?

511
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,650
It's here.

512
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:20,583
So it wasn't a dream.

513
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:21,550
Get on.

514
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,716
I'll piggyback you inside.

515
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,316
Huh?

516
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:26,632
Mhm.

517
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,732
Hey, Ranma.

518
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:34,198
Yeah?

519
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:34,798
Nothing.

520
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:35,665
Forget it.

521
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:37,565
Come on, tell me.

522
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,198
Just drop it, would you?

523
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:46,260

or an X. Next time on
Ranma 1/2-- Wretched Rice

Cakes of Love.

528
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:27,682
We'll see you there.
