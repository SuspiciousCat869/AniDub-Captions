THEME SONG: (SINGING IN
JAPANESE) Smile again!

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,466
MAN: Now please, Dr. Tofu,
just try it for a month.

3
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:47,266
Yes, but I already have
four different subscriptions.

4
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,800
So why not make
it five newspapers?

5
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,200
I'm really not interested.

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,666
Well, what if I gave
you an offer you simply

7
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:58,000
couldn't refuse, huh?

8
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,866
How about these two tickets
to the amusement park

9
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,500
absolutely free?

10
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,041
Interested?

11
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,933
Oh, good morning.

12
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,900
Oh, hi Kasumi.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,566
How are you doing?

14
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,866
[clipping]

15
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:17,066
It looks much better now.

16
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,333
Uh, thanks.

17
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:21,266
I see you're a
friend of Dr. Tofu.

18
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:22,933
Maybe you're
interested in these?

19
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:23,733
They're free.

20
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:24,666
Yes.

21
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,566
The amusement park
looks like fun.

22
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,700
Yes, I go there
all the time myself.

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,533
[giggling]

24
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:30,933
In that case, I'll take them.

25
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:35,100
They're all yours if you could
just sign on the dotted line.

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,766
Oh, sure.

27
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,100
Uh, sign.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Yes, uh, well there you go.

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,466
MAN: You might want
to sign the contract.

30
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:42,666
Huh?

31
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:46,133
MAN: I just hope you never
have to operate on me.

32
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,633
KASUMI (VOICEOVER): Tendo family
goes to the amusement park.

33
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,100
Amusement park?

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,266
For free?

35
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,233
Oh please, the amusement park?

36
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,433
I am much too old for that.

37
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:03,966
But Nabiki--

38
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,166
BOTH: Hm?

39
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,500
I thought it might be
fun for the whole family.

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,833
NABIKI: Well, it is free.

41
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,200
I thought Dr. Tofu
wanted to take you there

42
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,033
on a date, Kasumi.

43
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,300
He wouldn't want
us tagging along.

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,200
I think it would be more fun
if all of us went together.

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,233
RANMA: Hm, it says here each
ticket is good for six people.

46
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:31,600
One, two, three, four, five,
and with me it makes six.

47
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,066
Oh, and in the fine print,
it says pets are not allowed.

48
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,566
Sorry, P-chan.

49
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,633
[clears throat]

50
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,366
You know, maybe a
family outing together

51
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,533
is just what we all
need, not that I'm

52
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,833
really interested in going.

53
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,033
Mhm.

54
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,533
I have to agree with Tendo.

55
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,200
I mean, how often
do we get a chance

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,733
to do things with the kids?

57
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,600
Good, then it's settled.

58
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,300
How about we all go on Sunday?

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,400
BOTH: Yes, we're going!

60
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,800
What's all the hubbub?

61
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,866
It sounds like a party.

62
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:04,366
Uh, well, we were just
talking about-- hey!

63
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:07,233
What are you doing
with my underwear?

64
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,700
Ah!

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,100
Come back here!

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Oh!

67
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,666
Why, you little worm!

68
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:12,400
HAPPOSAI: What'd I do?

69
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,066
AKANE: Worm!

70
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:13,766
HAPPOSAI: What'd I--

71
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:14,600
AKANE: Give those back!

72
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,400
HAPPOSAI: Come and get them!

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,900
So we don't tell him.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,466
All agreed?

75
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:20,166
ALL: All agreed.

76
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,233
It's going to be
a beautiful day.

77
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,300
Oh, Kasumi.

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,700
Hm?

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Ah, what happened here?

80
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,400
I wonder who could
have done this.

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,466
Come on, Kasumi.

82
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:51,866
We gotta go.

83
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:55,366
Yeah, we should hurry because
Happosai hasn't come home yet.

84
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:59,066
Although the fact that he's
not around does bother me.

85
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,366
Come on, boy.

86
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,166
We haven't got all day.

87
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:04,666
And besides, don't
you think making

88
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,566
Dr. Tofu wait for us is rude?

89
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,200
Hm.

90
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,100
Mm.

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,600
Hm?

92
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,166
Hm.

93
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,500
Mm-mm.

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,333
I guess I'll wear these again.

95
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:19,866
KASUMI: Is anyone home?

96
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,333
Huh?

97
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:22,800
Oh!

98
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,341
Ah!

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,733
[crash]

100
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,966
[chuckling]

101
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:40,833
We'd like to thank
you for inviting us.

102
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,766
[chuckling]

103
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,600
[screaming]

104
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,633
Those three are so immature.

105
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,400
Would you like a little tea?

106
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,666
Uh, yeah sure.

107
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,433
I-- I'd love some.

108
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:05,400
Thank you.

109
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,400
Are you all right, Dr. Tofu?

110
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,166
DR. TOFU: I'm fine.

111
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,000
Why?

112
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,166
He's such a smooth operator.

113
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:12,707
Nabiki!

114
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:19,866
[grunting]

115
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,166
[sniffing]

116
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,033
My turn, boy.

117
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,600
Let me show you.

118
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,666
Wait a second, Saotome.

119
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:29,966
It's my turn.

120
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:33,333
GENMA: Excuse me, Tendo, but
I think I was here first.

121
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:34,600
SOUN: Hey, that's not fair!

122
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:41,233
Tell me, Akane, are
you having a good time?

123
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,166
Yeah, sure.

124
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:43,966
It's just-- it's just--

125
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:45,066
Hm?

126
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,900
Well I hope that, you
know, with my family

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,466
here that we're not
getting in your way.

128
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:50,600
Don't worry about that.

129
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,333
I-- I just want to make
sure you're having fun.

130
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,600
Are you sure?

131
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,600
Yeah, I'm sure, but I
appreciate your concern, Akane.

132
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,266
Hey, when we get off of here,
let's go get something to eat?

133
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,100
Yeah, sure, OK.

134
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,633
DR. TOFU: You're a shy
one like me, aren't you?

135
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,533
Yeah I guess a little bit.

136
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,900
Oh, I wish there was
something I could do to get

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,233
poor Dr. Tofu over his shyness.

138
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,266
Ah, good.

139
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,433
I'm starving.

140
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,533
I'd like seven peach
dumplings please.

141
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,466
SHAMPOO: Seven peach
dumplings coming up.

142
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,666
It's you, Shampoo.

143
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,966
Hello, Dr. Tofu.

144
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:36,200
What bring you to
the amusement park?

145
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,933
Well, I came here with
everyone from the Tendo Dojo.

146
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,433
Does that mean Ranma
come with you too?

147
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:46,333
DR. TOFU: Uh, mm,
well-- what the?

148
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,000
SHAMPOO: What is matter?

149
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,866
Ugh, I think I dropped
my wallet somewhere.

150
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,066
I must have.

151
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,933
Shampoo make you deal.

152
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:57,600
You no have to pay Shampoo
if you take me to Ranma.

153
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,333
Yeah, sure.

154
00:07:59,433 --> 00:07:59,874
Huh?

155
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,233
[quacking]

156
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,100
I can't believe she's here.

157
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,666
I mean, who would
have ever thought

158
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,933
Shampoo would be working here?

159
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,500
I had feeling Ranma would come.

160
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,366
It must have been
fate that led you here

161
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,900
to be with your Shampoo.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Well, they finally
decided to show.

163
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,933
[laughter]

164
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:25,233
You didn't even come close
to my high score, Tendo.

165
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,333
Oh yeah?

166
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,466
At least I wasn't the
one who was hogging

167
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,100
the game the whole time.

168
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,100
Yes, but practice makes
perfect, my friend.

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,733
Look at you, Saotome,
talking like a big shot

170
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,466
just because you beat
me at whacking moles.

171
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,166
Oh yeah?

172
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,233
Well I still beat you.

173
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,433
Isn't it a beautiful day?

174
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,233
And I think now is the
perfect time for a picnic.

175
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,533
Nabiki, why don't you
bring out the lunch?

176
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:46,866
You got it.

177
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:47,766
Ugh!

178
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,566
KASUMI: What is it, Nabiki?

179
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,107
Ah!

180
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,833
RANMA: It's the freak.

181
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,433
KASUMI: How did he get here?

182
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,266
I hope he didn't ruin lunch.

183
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:00,833
It's gone.

184
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:01,374
ALL: Ah!

185
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,733
You-- you forgot all about me.

186
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,166
[crying]

187
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,133
When I came home,
I saw you were all

188
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,200
packed up and ready to leave.

189
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,166
At first I thought you'd come
and ask me to join you, but no.

190
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:22,533
That's why I hid in
the picnic basket.

191
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,933
By the way, I have a feeling
the mayonnaise was a little off.

192
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:26,933
Please don't cry.

193
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,766
We were in such a
hurry this morning

194
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,033
I guess no one
remembered to tell you.

195
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,033
Are you saying
that you're sorry?

196
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:34,100
KASUMI: Yes.

197
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,700
So who wants to go
on the whirl-a-wheel?

198
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,400
ALL: Here's your whirl-a-wheel.

199
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,733
Oh man, I am so hungry.

200
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,866
Now I'll have to buy something.

201
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,800
Hey, what's wrong, pops?

202
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,766
Nothing.

203
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:50,800
You sure?

204
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,933
Nothing.

205
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,333
Ah, I admit it.

206
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,600
I spent every last yen we
had playing that stupid mole

207
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,666
game back there.

208
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:57,833
What?

209
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,366
Are you serious?

210
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,833
That's right, Akane.

211
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:04,066
Every last yen is long gone.

212
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,933
[gasp]

213
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,266
Now what do we do?

214
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,533
Don't look at me, Akane.

215
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,700
I'm almost tapped out myself.

216
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,600
I think I have just enough
left for the train home.

217
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,100
How dare you waste everything
we had on an idiotic mole game.

218
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,266
Well, come to think
of it, it was easy.

219
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:25,733
[arguing]

220
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,466
[sigh]

221
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,666
Oh man, I'm starving.

222
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,066
[grumbling]

223
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,933
GIRL 1: Wow, you see they're
giving away a full course

224
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:41,633
dinner?

225
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:42,766
GIRL 2: Yeah, for two.

226
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:46,500
GIRL 1: All you gotta do
is win the go kart race.

227
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,466
Huh?

228
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,500
Dinner?

229
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,533
And full course?

230
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,766
Did she say it was free?

231
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:55,900
ALL: Count me in.

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,833
Win the race, win a dinner.

233
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,033
Where's the track?

234
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,000
NABIKI: Let's see.

235
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,066
Here it is.

236
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,866
Go kart race circuit.

237
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:07,066
Boy, the motor's powerful,
but the body is pretty small.

238
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,866
It seems sized more
for women than for men.

239
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,566
And that means--

240
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,366
That means we've got
a good shot at winning.

241
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,800
Come on, girls!

242
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
We've got a go kart race to win!

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,533
Yeah, let's show them
what girls can do!

244
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,466
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER):
Full course dinner--

245
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:25,833
that prize made for
Ranma and Shampoo.

246
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,766
Well, you can count me out.

247
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:29,866
I'm not much suited
for the cars.

248
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:30,766
Dr. Tofu?

249
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:31,900
Huh?

250
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,766
I was thinking maybe you
could teach me to drive.

251
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:35,700
[gasp]

252
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,066
Kasumi?

253
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,533
You're not serious,
are you, Kasumi?

254
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,074
Yes.

255
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:56,702
ANNOUNCER: Good
afternoon, everyone,

256
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:58,935
and welcome to go
kart circuit one.

257
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,302
There's only five
minutes left to sign up

258
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:03,402
for the hyper kart grand prix.

259
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:06,735
And remember, the
winner gets 10,000 yen

260
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:09,335
plus a course dinner for two.

261
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,168
Oh, somebody please pinch me.

262
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:14,068
Every prayer I've ever
made just came true!

263
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:22,468
Saotome, after I win this,
I'll have my revenge on you

264
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:24,568
for defeating me
in the mole game.

265
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:25,835
Ha ha ha!

266
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:28,202
I'd like to see you
try and beat me.

267
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:30,502
O-- OK, Kasumi, when you
turn the wheel to the right,

268
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:32,835
the car will go right, and
when you turn it to the left,

269
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:33,535
it will go left?

270
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:34,602
You understand?

271
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:37,868
Actually, Kasumi's
over there, Dr. Tofu.

272
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:38,968
All right.

273
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,002
I think I found the
brake and the gas pedal.

274
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:44,968
This is easier than I
thought it would be.

275
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:47,402
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I'm going
to win this for Kasumi and Dr.

276
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,968
Tofu, and they can
have the dinner.

277
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,535
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
My sweet Akane,

278
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:55,835
I will do whatever it
takes to let you win.

279
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,202
Hey, Ryoga.

280
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:01,135
Ryoga, are you here to try and
win that full course dinner

281
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:01,968
too?

282
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,635
Yeah, and don't get in my way.

283
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:06,168
Well, I don't know how
to break it to you, pal,

284
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:10,135
but that big old dinner has
my name written all over it.

285
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:13,502
You seem pretty
sure of yourself,

286
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,502
but I guess talk is cheap.

287
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:19,402
We'll see who the better driver
is when they drop the flag.

288
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,502
Well, enough chit chat.

289
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:22,668
I gotta get myself ready.

290
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,768
It's almost time to start.

291
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,102
Oh, I almost forgot.

292
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:27,768
Good luck.

293
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:31,568
Ranma!

294
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:32,202
Ah!

295
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:33,968
Who is that girl?

296
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:37,902
Her name's Rinko, and she's the
best darn go kart driver ever

297
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:38,868
to run circuit one.

298
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:39,868
Really?

299
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,768
Yeah, she even
holds the lap record.

300
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:44,935
She'll race anybody, and so far
nobody's been able to beat her,

301
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:45,935
including the boys.

302
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:50,802
Ranma.

303
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,402
This is going to
be interesting.

304
00:13:55,335 --> 00:14:00,002
MOUSSE (VOICEOVER): Ranma
Saotome, you're going down.

305
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:02,768
ANNOUNCER: It's time to start
the hyper kart grand prix,

306
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:04,068
ladies and gentlemen.

307
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:05,868
The rules are simple.

308
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:09,902
The first to cross the finish
line of this three kilometer

309
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:11,335
circuit is the winner.

310
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:19,135
10 seconds to green.

311
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:29,502
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, 1-- green!

312
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,435
[engines revving]

313
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:33,402
Ah!

314
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:34,868
[crash]

315
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,068
Akane!

316
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:39,302
ANNOUNCER: There's a crash
on the starting grid!

317
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:42,968
I-- I guess I must have left
the silly thing in reverse.

318
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:44,168
ANNOUNCER: Good news.

319
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:48,368
She looks OK, and she's
about to rejoin the race.

320
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:50,135
Outta my way, Saotome!

321
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:52,502
Quit cutting me off!

322
00:14:52,602 --> 00:14:55,868
See you at the finish line!

323
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:59,202
Pardon me.

324
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:01,435
I wonder where those two
ever got their license.

325
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,602
ANNOUNCER: The leaders are
coming up to the hairpin!

326
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:08,502
RINKO (VOICEOVER): If big
red thinks she can beat me,

327
00:15:08,602 --> 00:15:09,968
she's got another thing coming.

328
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:15,868
Whoa, she's fast!

329
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:19,802
But there ain't no way
I'm losing to a girl.

330
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:20,802
See that?

331
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:22,268
Where'd they come from?

332
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:24,768
There goes our dinner.

333
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:28,268
Wait up, girls, 'cause your
big daddy's coming on home!

334
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:29,735
Who is that creep?

335
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:31,735
Come on, we better step on it!

336
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,002
Coming through!

337
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:40,535
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER): And that
goes for anyone in Shampoo way,

338
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:44,702
because the dinner is
all mine and Ranma.

339
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:46,168
That's odd.

340
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:48,868
I wonder why so many cars
have retired from the race.

341
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:52,335
That gives me a
better chance to win!

342
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:53,368
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Oh no!

343
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:55,135
I can't see Akane anywhere!

344
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:56,402
Hey, buddy.

345
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:57,535
You're sitting in the pit.

346
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:02,535
Ah!

347
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:07,502
I can't believe she's
catching up so fast!

348
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,502
You're mine.

349
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:10,043
Hey!

350
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:10,902
Watch it!

351
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,335
ANNOUNCER: Wait a
second, it looks

352
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:13,902
like we have a new leader!

353
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:15,402
Ah!

354
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:19,368
No on has ever beaten me.

355
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:21,368
I have had enough!

356
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:25,335
Shifting to overdrive and
coming through, slowpoke!

357
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:27,335
Ah!

358
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:28,335
Come on!

359
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:28,876
Come on!

360
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:29,868
Come on!

361
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:31,302
You better move it
or lose it, sister!

362
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:32,602
Ah!

363
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:36,268
Man, this chick's gotta be
certifiably off her rocker.

364
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:46,735
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Huh?

365
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:48,635
Shampoo?

366
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:50,702
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER): The
time has come for Shampoo

367
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:55,202
to take Akane out for good and
make it look like accident.

368
00:16:55,302 --> 00:16:56,668
[crash]

369
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:57,435
Shampoo!

370
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:59,102
Watch where you're going!

371
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,068
What wrong?

372
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,702
You no like to race
against Shampoo?

373
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:03,535
So, you want to
play rough, do you?

374
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:06,035
Well two can play that game!

375
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:07,468
[crash]

376
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,435
Where you learn to drive?

377
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,202
ANNOUNCER: It's shaping
up to be a real dog

378
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,735
fight for first place!

379
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:22,135
Ah!

380
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,102
I can't believe how
good my car handles.

381
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:25,635
How about you, Saotome?

382
00:17:25,735 --> 00:17:29,268
What's it like
driving in my fumes?

383
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,268
Dad!

384
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:31,768
Mr. Saotome!

385
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,235
Get out of the way!

386
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:33,776
Ah!

387
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:34,276
Ah!

388
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:41,768
Careful, Akane,
I think you might

389
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,768
be driving a bit too fast.

390
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:46,635
Look out, ladies, 'cause
I'm right behind you!

391
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:47,968
Yahoo!

392
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,602
It's about time I step on it
and get back into this race.

393
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:52,143
Banzai!

394
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:56,035
Ha ha!

395
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:58,002
That's what you
get for passing me.

396
00:17:58,102 --> 00:17:59,968
Not to finish you off.

397
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,468
Huh?

398
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:04,902
Make way!

399
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:08,535
Care to join me for a lovely
full course dinner for two?

400
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:11,602
There's no way I'm ever
gonna let you win, you freak.

401
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:13,202
Ah!

402
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:14,935
I'm getting sick
of being passed.

403
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:15,476
[crash]

404
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:15,976
Ah!

405
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,735
Watch it!

406
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:20,635
You better get of road,
old lady, or Shampoo

407
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:22,535
be forced to give
you a little help.

408
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,768
Who does she thinks she is?

409
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,502
Calling me an old lady!

410
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:30,035
ANNOUNCER: They're really
dicing it out for the lead.

411
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:33,502
Oh, it looks like I'm pretty
far back, so I've gotta hustle.

412
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:37,702
But I already have the gas pedal
pushed right down to the metal.

413
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:38,335
Huh?

414
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,802
Hey Mousse, hurry!

415
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:47,135
Time to fire her up.

416
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:47,684
Yeah!

417
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:54,235
Hm?

418
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,235
[crash]

419
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,702
Ah!

420
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,202
Hey!

421
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:01,002
MOUSSE: No one can stop me now!

422
00:19:01,102 --> 00:19:02,935
Have you lost your mind?

423
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:04,068
Ah!

424
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,368
Saotome, you've got to
let me win at something.

425
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:09,302
You can suck on
my tailpipe, Tendo.

426
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:16,868
Mr. Saotome, I think
you're driving too fast.

427
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:17,835
Slow down.

428
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:20,002
Would you get lost
and let me race?

429
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:24,968
Hey, why don't you mind own
business and quit bothering me!

430
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:26,935
What is he doing?

431
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,402
Look out!

432
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:28,943
[crash]

433
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,868
Ah!

00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:34,335
What's going on here?

435
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:37,302
Everyone's gone nuts!

436
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:39,302
HAPPOSAI: Hey, how about
a little room here?

437
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,268
What are you talking about?

438
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:42,768
You're in my way!

439
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:43,735
[crash]

440
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:45,235
Huh?

441
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,202
OK, that's it.

442
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:50,502
I've had it playing games
with these two bit smart aleck

443
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:51,368
punks.

444
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:52,635
I didn't want to
have to do this,

445
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:56,068
but now it's time to take
out the heavy artillery.

446
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:56,735
Happo-fire!

447
00:19:56,835 --> 00:19:57,735
What are you doing?

448
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,435
Unhand me, you cad.

449
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:01,635
I gotta stop you from
blowing everything up.

450
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,568
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

451
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,568
Take your hands off me.

00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:05,535
Hey, that's my line!

453

I'm really glad that you
won the dinner, Kasumi.

482
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,702
And thanks for
inviting all of us.

483

I just hope you don't mind
that we're eating all of it.

484

That's all right, Akane.

485
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:18,102
