When you were standing straight,
you beat me right away.

bent down to catch

you, I, I hit it, right?

that I noticed
your mark, winking.

[inhales]

337
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,408
-OK, ready?

338
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:01,375
[straining]

339
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:08,749
There!

340
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:12,308
You're not--

341
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:22,775
[nervous laughter]

342
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:25,842
-Huh?

343
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:27,708
Ah, mommy!

344
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,675
[everyone talking at once]

345
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:35,575
-Ryoga, Ryoga, wha,
what, what are you?

346
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,542
Ranma?

347
00:18:39,642 --> 00:18:41,842
-Were'd they come from?

348
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,475
-We, uh, loaned them
the dojo for their club.

349
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:46,808
[chuckles]

350
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,508
-Oh man, it figures.

351
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,008
[cheering]

352
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:59,442
-(THINKING) Somebody shoot me.

353
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,908
[crying]

354
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:07,875
[whack]

355
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:09,475
-You lose.

356
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:13,742
[gasps]

357
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:15,108
-Look, the mark faded away.

358
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,575
-Like magic.

359
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:18,108
-What a performance.

360
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,008
-Thank you.

361
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,375
Thank you very much.

362
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:22,208
[applause]

363
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,475
-(THINKING) So that's it!

364
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:30,108
Ryoga's been in training
for this club meeting.

365
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:31,649
-Akane?

366
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:36,308
Thanks to your friend Ryoga,
the party's a huge success.

367
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:41,075
I guess you must be
very fond of him.

368
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:43,208
-Oh, I've never seen
anything like it.

369
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,475
Oh, bravo.

370
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:45,016
Bravo!

371
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:52,608
-I still don't get it though.

372
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:56,742
Why did Ryoga and P-chan
have the same mark?

373
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,042
-Uh, gee, Akane, I don't know.

374
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:01,575
Maybe to practice his
drawing or something?

375
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:03,708
-Uh, I guess so.

376
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:04,249
Maybe.

377
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:08,975
-(THINKING) Poor jerk.

378
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,208
I wonder if he's OK.

379
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:15,042
-How, how could I?

380
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:19,042
I, I flashed my stomach
to all those people!

381
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:20,375
[sobbing]

382
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:22,175
-Well, uh, look at
the bright side.

383
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:23,642
You got rid of the mark, right?

384
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:25,542
Plus, in the end
you got a big laugh.

385
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,808
[laughs]

386
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:30,542
-You don't know what
you're talking about!

387
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:32,975
That kind of a
laugh I don't need!

388
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,475
[sobbing]

389
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:37,408
I'll never be able
to face Akane again!

390
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:38,875
[sobbing]

391
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:39,842
Ah!

392
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:40,383
-Ryoga!

393
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,475
(THINKING) I can't blame
him for being hurt.

394
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,342
He might be gone
a while this time.

395
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:48,442
[laughing]

396
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:49,642
-P-chan!

397
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:50,942
-Huh?

398
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,842
-Come here!

399
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,408
[squealing]

400
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,542
[laughing]

401
00:20:56,642 --> 00:20:58,208
Oh, welcome back!

402
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,142
The mark, it's gone!

403
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:04,042
It's better this way.

404
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:05,375
[giggles]

405
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:07,142
-I take it back.

406
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:11,308
Looks like he's still plenty
invulnerable after all.

407
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:13,775
[happy squealing]

408
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:20,142
[squealing]

409
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:48,008
[theme music]

410
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:17,958
-Oh, Kasumi, you're right.

411
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:21,425
He really is good
at catching eggs.

412
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,691
NARRATOR: Ranma, can't you
see you're not as good?

413
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,858
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
the Egg Catcher Man.

414
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:31,458
We'll see you there.
