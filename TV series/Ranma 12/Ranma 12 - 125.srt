00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,300
Hustle it up.

00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,233
We gotta hurry.

00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,700
MALE VOICE 2: Don't
worry about it.

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,833
We're working as hard as we can.

Darn thing ripped again.

NABIKI: Very sad.

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,900
Why don't you show
me how, Nabiki?

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,441
Sure.

16
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:25,400
Bullseye.

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,433
Oh, golly, the
carnival! [laughs]

18
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,533
Would you quit moving
around so much, Master?

19
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:32,866
Don't you love it when
the carnival comes to town,

20
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,066
eh, Tendo?

21
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:42,600
Hey, this looks fun.

"Curse of the Scribbled Panda."

CARNIVAL BARKER: Step right up.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,866
See 3,000 year-old cursed
Chinese wall scrolls

26
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:54,866
right before your eyes.

[gong]

28
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,600
What you are about
to see may shock you.

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,600
Gaze upon them freely, but
tell no one what you have seen.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,133
Because if you do,
you shall be cursed

31
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:16,633
with a lifetime of bad luck.

32
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,866
Please heed my words, children.

33
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,033
Here is the first one.

34
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:23,900
One to go, please.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,566
You got it.

36
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,433
Hurry, hurry.

37
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:28,833
Huh?

38
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,733
When my great-grandfather
finished painting this,

39
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,766
he mysteriously passed away.

40
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:36,166
He was 95.

41
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,033
Number two.

42
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:42,500
After my 98-year-old father
finished this one, he too died.

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,666
Oh, my.

44
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,133
Huh?

45
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,333
But prepare yourself,
because I have yet

46
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:48,666
to show you the last one.

47
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,133
Why, thank you.

48
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,133
Hey, come back here.

49
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:59,866
It is time to reveal the
third work of evil art!

50
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,233
Give me back my takoyaki!

51
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:06,774
Huh?

52
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:13,166
Thanks, Pop.

53

[groans]

54
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, no.

55
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,541
The seals!

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,900
The horror!

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,866
[wails]

58
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:40,900
What's happening?

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,900
I think something came
out of those wall scrolls.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,933
Do you realize
what you've done?

61
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,100
You can't possibly understand
what you've unleashed.

62
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,200
For 3,000 years those
cursed wall scrolls

63
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,033
have been painted
by cursed artists

64
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,666
using cursed brushes
on cursed scrolls

65
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:59,400
by cursed thought in their
minds, on a cursed day.

66
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,400
But now you've
removed the seals!

67
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,200
OK.

68
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,133
So what?

69
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,133
For generations
my family has kept

70
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,133
the evil trapped in
those wall scrolls

71
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,400
and now you've released them.

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:11,966
Hmm?

73
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,900
[worried cries]

74
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,366
They've left the building.

75
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,366
This is very, very bad.

76
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,266
What is that?

77
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,000
I have no idea.

78
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,133
They look like those Chinese
monsters I've read about.

79
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:40,866
Yeah, right.

80
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,766
Let's go.

81
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,733
They don't know what
they're dealing with.

82
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,133
[yelling]

83
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,133
Hey, look.

84
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,100
There's Daddy!

85
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
That's it, Father.

86
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,066
You show them!

87
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:04,033
Prepare to meet your maker.

88
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,966
Because you're going down.

89
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,433
Good luck!

90
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:09,433
Over there!

91
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:10,400
You're gonna burn!

92
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,533
Let go of my sword!

93
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,766
We've got to help.

94
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,600
That must be the third one.

95
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
Be on your toes, Ranma.

96
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:39,433
[growls]

97
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:43,433
[giggles] Yes, I'm free!

98
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:44,733
What the--

99
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,866
Oh no.

100
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:48,700
This is the third cursed
painting come to life!

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,333
You're kidding.

102
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,000
What is it?

103
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,633
Are you blind?

104
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,233
It's a panda.

105
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,333
How abstract.

106
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:57,500
It's a doodle, Kasumi.

107
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,300
[grunts]

108
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,633
So how in the heck are we
supposed to get rid of him?

109
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,900
Place this seal on
the panda's forehead.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,700
And then they will all
return into the scrolls.

111
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
All of them?

112
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,466
Yes, but you must do it
before the hour of the ox,

113
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:26,033
or they're here for good.

114
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,500
Hour of the ox?

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,733
Around 2:00 in the
morning your time.

116
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,833
Oh.

117
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:35,566
Oh, it's so wonderful
to be free at last!

118
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,466
And it was you who set me free!

119
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:39,766
Oh, thank you kind stranger.

120
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,200
Thank you.

121
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,100
Huh?

122
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,066
No!

123
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,133
Please!

124
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,433
I can't go back to
living in that picture.

125
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,900
Never!

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,133
That panda-- it's
not female, is it?

127
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:53,800
Can't you tell by looking?

128
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,133
I'm finally free Oh, please.

129
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,233
Please don't send me back.

130
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,466
Just one night.

131
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,933
That's all I ask of you.

132
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:05,300
I just want to live
my dream of having

133
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,733
a date with a wonderful man.

134
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:11,866
That-- that is my
one and only dream.

135
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:14,533
I feel so sorry for her.

136
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:15,900
What harm would
it be in letting

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
her be free for one night?

138
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,400
You think?

139
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,941
Hmm.

140
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,233
If your dream comes
true, will you leave?

141
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,700
Uh-huh.

142
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,700
[chuckles]

143
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,566
Hey, what are
you scheming, boy?

144
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,866
I think you know.

145
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,333
But you can't mean--

146
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:45,933
Aw, don't you
feel sorry for her?

147
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,000
Hey little panda--

148
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,966
[gasps]

149
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,000
Look!

150
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,866
I think I found you
the perfect date.

151
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,800
No!

152
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,233
This is my worst nightmare.

153
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,200
I don't want to date
a fat and ugly panda!

154
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,766
But he's the only
other panda I know.

155
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:06,307
Hmm.

156
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,666
[grunts]

157
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,566
Check out that couple.

158
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,633
That's a couple?

159
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:25,366
[giggles]

160
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,366
Aren't they cute?

161
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,133
Well--

162
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,100
Oh, please.

163
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,933
Don't tell me you're
jealous, Akane.

164
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,833
As if.

165
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:33,800
Open wide!

166
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,233
I have a surprise for you!

167
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,533
Your favorite, takoyaki.

168
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:40,733
Well?

169
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,133
Did you like it?

170
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,133
Mmm.

171
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,666
Excellent.

172
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,233
He's just being nice.

173
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,200
You try one.

174
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,466
I would, but my
mouth doesn't move.

175
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:53,600
I see. [laughs]

176
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,500
Oh, look.

177
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,333
I just love balloons.

178
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,900
What's your favorite color?

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,133
Your favorite is mine too.

180
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,066
[laughs]

181
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,466
Try and catch me.

182
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:07,433
Oh, you little vixen.

183
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,433
I'm right behind you!

184
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,333
I'm gonna get you!

185
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:15,600
What the heck am I doing?

186
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,000
What's wrong?

187
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,766
You've had enough fun, right?

188
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:21,200
What are you talking about?

189
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,666
Hey, don't go!

190
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:32,266
I've had enough of that
little furball's tricks.

191
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,300
The seal?

192
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,300
I, uh, lost it.

193
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,733
What?

194
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,433
I though I put it in here,
but maybe it's in here.

195
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,900
You--

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,366
Oh, Ranma!

197
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:49,366
There is another
way to put her back.

198
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,766
What do you mean?

199
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,966
You could try persuading her to
go back into the painting using

200
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,866
all your manly charms.

201
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:57,366
Who, me?

202
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,566
But time is
quickly running out.

203
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,033
Remember the hour of the ox.

204
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,533
Let go of my sword.

205
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:17,266
I'm still waiting, my sweet.

206
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:21,200
[music playing]

207
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:44,814
How big do you think?

208
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:45,481
That's it.

209
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,447
Go, Father!

210
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,014
Oh.

211
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:55,781
Please put your
money into the can.

212
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,322
Thank you.

213
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:04,947
Look, it's a giant panda.

214
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:07,281
You go for it, Saotome.

215
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:08,081
Your money, please.

216
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:09,547
[grunts]

217
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:19,347
I love the way
cotton candy feels.

218
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,747
How about you?

219
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:22,814
Want some?

220
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,181
Yeah, sure.

221
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,414
Thanks.

222
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:26,581
You like it?

223
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:27,681
Not bad.

224
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,781
I'm so happy when I
see that you're happy.

225
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:35,014
Really? [laughs]

226
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:37,247
I can't believe he's
flirting with her.

227
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:41,014
[giggling]

228
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:42,247
It's OK, Akane.

229
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:45,314
He's just putting on an act.

230
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:47,614
That's all.

231
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:48,414
He's just--

232
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:51,581
RANMA: You are such a tease.

233
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:52,681
PANDA: Oh, stop it.

234
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:53,314
That it.

235
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:54,547
I've had enough.

236
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,581
I've got to put a stop to this.

237
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:00,081
Ranma--

238
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:00,629
Akane.

239
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,481
What's up?

240
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,347
Don't you remember?

241
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:03,147
We had a date.

242
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:05,847
We did?

243
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:07,147
You idiot.

244
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,814
Stop fooling around and do
what you're supposed to do.

245
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,914
If she isn't back in
the painting soon,

246
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,281
we'll never get
rid of any of them.

247
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,647
Ranma, who is she?

248
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:19,114
Is she your girlfriend?

249
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,347
Of course not.

250
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:26,781
Give me a break here.

251
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:27,847
Why, just look at her.

252
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:31,514
She's way too uncute
to be my girlfriend.

253
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:33,947
How's that for
uncute, you jerk?

254
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,514
I can't believe how much
cash I scammed today.

255
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:40,147
Normally this would
take me a whole week.

256
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:40,688
Huh?

257
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:48,581
Was what you said the truth?

258
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:50,514
What was it that I said?

259
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:53,381
Is that girl really
not your girlfriend?

260
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:54,614
Of course she isn't.

261
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,547
That's just what
I wanted to hear.

262
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:58,447
I wish you and I could
be together forever.

263
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:07,714
Geez, is Ranma still only
at this phase of his plan?

264
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:08,947
He's such a slowpoke.

265
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:15,247
Aah!

266
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:15,881
Nabiki!

267
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:16,647
Oh, Ranma?

268
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:18,414
I have an idea.

269
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:19,081
Really?

270
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:19,622
Mmm-hmm.

271
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,981
I have never been so happy.

272
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:29,381
Huh?

273
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:31,714
Nabiki, have you seen Ranma?

274
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:32,781
Yeah.

275
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,381
He's at the park putting
on the performance

276
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,681
of his life for that panda.

277
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:37,581
Huh?

278
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:40,614
[sobs] Oh, the pain.

279
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,481
It's tearing me up.

280
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,481
What's wrong?

281
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:45,447
You can tell me.

282
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:47,847
It suddenly dawned
on me how completely

283
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:50,314
fragile and temporary
our love has to be.

284
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:51,581
What do you mean?

285
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:55,247
It doesn't matter that
we're two crazy kids in love.

286
00:14:55,347 --> 00:15:02,147
It's just that you're a
panda and I'm a human.

287
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:04,047
Oh, no!

288
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:06,881
It breaks my heart,
but you're right.

289
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,781
It wouldn't have ever worked.

290
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,214
You can't blame yourself.

291
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:14,747
It was fate that brought us
together and tore us apart.

292
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,147
Don't worry, Ranma.

293
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,947
I understand.

294
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:23,014
Are you sure?

295
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,414
Yes, Ranma.

296
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:27,681
And now it's time
I said farewell.

297
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:31,481
I don't know if I'll have the
courage to say farewell, kid.

298
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,914
Then I'll say it for us.

299
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:35,381
Farewell, Ranma.

300
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,347
Boy, he could work
on a soap opera.

301
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:45,888
Yeah.

302
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:56,547
[whirring noises]

00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,981
[explosion]

304
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:14,003
Ranma, oh, Ranma.

305
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,514
Now it'll work.

306
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:30,481
Well she does have a point.

307
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:34,147
[growls]

308
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:37,947
I never figured
this would happen.

00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:41,881
[screeching]

310
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:50,281
Aw, man.

311
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:53,414
And I thought they
were superheroes.

312
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,847
I've had way too much to drink.

313
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,947
(PANTING) I can't
take it anymore.

314
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:01,914
You know, I'm going to
have to start to work out.

315
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:05,847
At least you tried your best.

316
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,814
OK, now I'm totally confused.

317
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:10,947
I have had it with
that stupid idiot Ranma.

318
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:18,847
[screams]

319
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:25,747
Akane!

320
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:26,288
Ranma!

321
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:31,681
I'm coming!

00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,647

[screams]

324
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:37,581
Someone help me!

325
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,581
Let go of Akane!

326
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:43,014
[screams]

327
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:45,014
Akane!

328
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,481
Attaboy, Ranma!

329
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:49,347
The three of us combined
don't have enough energy

330
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:51,814
to fight them, so we'll
have to rely on Ranma.

331
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:52,781
Ranma.

332
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:54,281
Caught your
attention, Amaguriken?

333
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:58,181
[grunts]

334
00:17:58,281 --> 00:17:58,722
Ranma!

335
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,047
[groans]

336
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,514
Ranma!

337
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:07,055
Akane!

338
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:12,981
You let me go!

339
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:16,381
Let me go, or you'll be sorry!

340
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:16,922
Akane!

341
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:33,714
The time has come for me to
return to the wall scroll.

342
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,181
Come on, you two.

343
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,681
We're going home!

344
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:49,147
Ranma, you made my dream
of having a date come true.

345
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:50,647
I got to ride on
the merry-go-round,

346
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,981
and I got to have a balloon.

347
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,814
It was so wonderful.

348
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:58,681
But the time has come
for me to say goodbye,

349
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:01,714
and I thank you,
Ranma, for everything.

350
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:03,514
Was it really that
much fun for you?

351
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:09,081
Can I ask you one last favor?

352
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,447
You go ahead and ask
me anything you want.

353
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:14,914
Uh, OK.

354
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:16,714
How about a kiss?

355
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:18,047
Hmm?

356
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:19,747
Huh?

357
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:20,288
Oh.

358
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:21,414
Why not?

359
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:22,947
She's only a doodle.

360
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:24,047
[grunts]

361
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:27,747
PANDA: All I ask for
is just one little kiss

362
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:30,214
and then my life
would be complete.

363
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,047
Oh, please?

364
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:47,714
Oh, pretty please?

365
00:19:47,814 --> 00:19:49,947
Ranma, you can't
be serious about--

366
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:05,081
Oh, Ranma.

367
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,947
You're so shy and naive.

368
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:07,914
OK, then.

369
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:10,347
Let me help you.

370
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:12,747
No, you can't!

371
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:14,214
Yes.

372
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:17,614
[moans]

373
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:20,814
Head butt.

374
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:23,247
Huh?

375
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:28,647
Thank you, and
goodbye to everyone.

376
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:29,714
Was it fun?

377
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,114
Yeah.

378
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:32,514
Then it's time.

379
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:33,055
OK.

380
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:42,247
Thank you.

381
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:43,181
Thank you.

382
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:46,714
She wanted a kiss
on her forehead.

383
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:49,314
I've got to say, I'm
proud of you, boy.

384
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,414
CARNIVAL BARKER:
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

385
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:02,947
Get your tickets.

386
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,714
For the first time ever,
witness my latest piece

387
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:09,181
of Chinese art, seen
for the first time.

388
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,081
[gasps]

389
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:19,781
Pretty impressive, don't
you think? [laughs]

390
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:23,081
Yes, I think he's
captured Ranma rather well.

391
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,581
I'd say he's
right on the money.

392
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:27,547
Yeah, right.

393
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:31,047
[laughter]

394
00:21:41,462 --> 00:21:45,828
[music playing]

395
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:18,516
NARRATOR: Near the beach, where
the Tento family's vacationing,

396
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:20,783
lies the mysterious
Watermelon Island.

397
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:23,283
What secrets does it
hold, and why did Kuno

398
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:24,416
lose his memory there?

399
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:26,683
Next time on "Ranma One
Half," the date monster

400
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:27,716
of Watermelon Island.

401
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:31,316
We'll see you there.
