1
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:43,876
-Morning!

2
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,510
-Hi Akane, how ya doing?

3
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,276
Hey where's Ranma?

4
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:48,010
You're usually together.

5
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,576
-Well, uh, he kinda
overslept again.

6
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:52,710
-That dumb Akane.

7
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,576
It wouldn't have killed
her to have woken me up

8
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:56,243
before she left the
house this morning.

9
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:57,610
But oh, no!

10
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,610
Oh, man am I late!

11
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,476
PRINCIPAL: Good morning
and aloha everybody!

12
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:05,343
Me hope that today you fight
just as hard as yesterday!

13
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:07,243
And be good little ke-ke, yeah?

14
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,976
Me have such big fun
yesterday, so me tell meself,

15
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:14,210
Big Kahuna, you gotta give them
ke-kes some big fun too, yeah!

16
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,076
So today me bring
you new big present.

17
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:18,176
-Now what is it?

18
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:19,843
Whatever it is, I'm
sure we won't like it.

19
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:22,410
-So what kind of haircut
is it going to be today?

20
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,043
-Oh, how you get to be
such a cynical wahine?

21
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,243
When kids no trust
island elders,

22
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:30,843
whole village got a
big problem, yeah?

23
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,443
That why we make this!

24
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:34,776
ALL: Huh?

25
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:37,343
PRINCIPAL: It's
the statute of me!

26
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:38,810
When you come to
the school, ke-ke,

27
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,943
me want you to show the respect
on hands and knees, yeah!

28
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:44,810
-You've gotta be kidding!

29
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,943
-That is totally unreasonable!

30
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,043
-Now ke-ke, be good!

31
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:51,843
Me is Big Kahuna, yeah?

32
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:52,843
-Ha ha!

33
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:55,810
He makes it just in time.

34
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,243
-Yeah, hooray!

35
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,410
-He deserved that.

36
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,910
-That's Ranma for you.

37
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,043
-Huh?

38
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:03,176
-Here's to the start
of a beautiful day.

39
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:04,076
-But what did I--

40
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:06,576
-Just sit back and enjoy it.

41
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,976
-That Ranma is one bad ke-ke.

42
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:13,810
This time he went
push me too far!

43
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,110
NARRATOR: Enter Kuno, the
Night-Prowling Knight.

44
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,976
[humming]

45
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:25,943
-Hey-a hey-a!

46
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:28,443
Welcome to the
principal's office!

47
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,410
-Well why is it
you've summoned me?

48
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,876
-Maybe you think you better
than Big Kahuna, yeah?

49
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:36,576
-Your point?

50
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:39,543
-Mr. Kuno, at this year
Furinkan High School,

51
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:42,276
there be many, many
wonderful student, yeah?

52
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:44,376
But you be the most
wonderful of all!

53
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:46,243
-Tell me something I don't know.

54
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:50,943
-Mr. Kuno, Big Kahuna
ask favor of you.

55
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:55,076
What you say to be the Big
Kahuna's the right hand man?

56
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,710
-And what is this?

57
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,210
"I, Tatewaki Kuno
do hereby affirm

58
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,443
myself to be the duly sworn
deputy of the school principal.

59
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,776
Signed, Furinkan
High School principal

60
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:10,110
on the such and such
today of--" Hmm.

61
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,910
-What me say wrong?

62
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,710
-As though I would ever
consent to sign my name

63
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,710
to such an ignoble
pledge as this.

64
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,343
-Me hear wahine go
crazy for deputy!

65
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:22,543
-They do?

66
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:25,043
You don't want a
demerit, do you?

67
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:25,976
N-- n-- no, sir.

68
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,710
D D-- d-- don't hurt me, sir!

69
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,976
-You're so righteous!

70
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:33,943
-Champions of virtue
make me so hot.

71
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,243
-Heh heh heh.

72
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:36,476
-Something wrong?

73
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:41,610
-Very well I shall consider it.

74
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,576
-Me just knew you'd say that.

75
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,943
-Augh, what the heck is that?

76
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:50,310
-Ugh how tacky!

77
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,543
-Somebody do something!

78
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:52,876
-There's one here too!

79
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,910
-Maybe we can transfer
to another school.

80
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,243
-There's not a single
work of art in the bunch.

81
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:00,776
-Yeah, kinda makes
you sick, you know?

82
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,810
-On your knees, worm.

83
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,743
-Augh!

84
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:04,976
-On your knees, worm.

85
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:05,876
-On your knees, worm.

86
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,910
-On your knees, worm.

87
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,443
I--

88
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,176
-Let me go!

89
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,776
Say, uh, aren't you
one of the teachers?

90
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:17,943
What about you over there?

91
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:18,510
-Yeah!

92
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,176
What about you?

93
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:22,276
-It's not our fault!

94
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:23,876
-Please, I got a wife
and kids at home.

95
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:25,210
I can't afford to lose this job.

96
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,610
So please don't tell on us.

97
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,943
-So please don't tell on us.

98
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:29,076
-Oh yeah, right.

99
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:30,710
We're supposed to feel
sorry for you because--

100
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,476
AKANE: Ranma!

101
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:32,176
-Huh?

102
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:32,743
-Come quick!

103
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:34,143
-What's wrong?

104
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:37,010
-The principal's got the entire
Kendo Club turned against us!

105
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,243
-He's done what?

106
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:39,210
-Look, over there!

107
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,143
-Yo, Kuno!

108
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,110
How's it going?

109
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,376
-How dare you speak
to me so glibly.

110
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:48,776
Listen well, Ranma Saotome.

111
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:51,843
I Tatewaki Kuno do
hereby vow to put an end

112
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:53,710
to your days of
unfettered tomfoolery.

113
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,043
Ha!

114
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:56,443
-Gee, what's the
matter with you?

115
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:58,143
Your underwear too tight again?

116
00:05:58,243 --> 00:05:59,776
-Silence, wretch!

117
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,243
-So, why don't
you tell me again,

118
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:03,276
why it is you're so ticked off?

119
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,376
-Ha!

120
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:08,343
As if you of all people
don't already know!

121
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:11,810
For some time now not only you,
but this entire student body

122
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,910
has been engaged in
licentious behavior.

123
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,743
Starting today,
I mean to enforce

124
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,276
a new standard of
moral behavior.

125
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:19,676
-Say, this wouldn't
have something

126
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:22,143
to do with the principal and
his crazy ideas, now would it?

127
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:24,076
-How little you know.

128
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,376
As if I, Tatewaki
Kuno could ever

129
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:29,510
be motivated by anything other
than pure and abiding love

130
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,243
for this school!

131
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:32,910
-Pure and abiding love, huh?

132
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,110
-Yeah, that's the first
I've ever heard of it.

133
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,976
-Your disregard for school
rules is bad enough.

134
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,710
But to flaunt your improper
and immoral sexual union

135
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,843
with a young maiden who's but
scarce come into full bloom--

136
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:50,043
-Now would be a good
time to shut up.

137
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,010
-Fiend!

138
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,176
Care you nothing
for propriety, then?

139
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:56,776
Show him the error of his--

140
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,143
-Stupid principal, now he's
siccing Kuno and his homeboys

141
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:00,076
on me, too.

142
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:06,776
-Come on, you guys.

143
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,143
Fighting among
ourselves is just what

144
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:09,876
that crazy principal wants.

145
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,910
-Never fear my
sweet Akane Tendo,

146
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,976
once that pompous
idiot Kuno is gone,

147
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,176
you won't have to worry anymore.

148
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:21,010
Together you and I can forge
a new era of unity among the--

149
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,910
-That's right, once the odious
Kuno is no more you and I will

150
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,443
be free to have some--

151
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:29,410
-Hey if she's not
Kuno's, she's mine.

152
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,143
-What a sorry bunch of losers.

153
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,876
PRINCIPAL: Oh, this
won't do at all!

154
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:37,643
-I may be down, but
I'm far from out!

155
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:39,710
Ranma Saetome, I challenge you.

156
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,410
-Hey that's fine with me
Kuno, but if you're really

157
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,843
in charge of school
morals, well then,

158
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:48,910
there's something else you
should be checking into first.

159
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,543
-What?

160
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:52,410
-Ha ha ha, what a haul!

161
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,810
Ha ha!

162
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,476
-Happosai?

163
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:56,376
-Wow, Akane!

164
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,243
I

165
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,576
-Fiend!

166
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:02,043
-Take that!

167
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,043
HAPPOSAI: My collection!

168
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:08,376
-If you're really
in charge of morals,

169
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:11,476
Kuno, then this is the guy
you should be dealing with.

170
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:12,443
-Ranma!

171
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,843
How dare you!

172
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,610
-How dare you, you little--

173
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,343
-Speak for yourself!

174
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:19,884
-Ranma!

175
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:20,776
-Hmm.

176
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:21,710
Pipsqueak.

177
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,776
-Bravo!

178
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,343
Such strength!

179
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:25,643
Such style!

180
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:27,543
You a very amazing
martial artist.

181
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:28,576
-Who are you?

182
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,810
-Me think maybe you
want to help kids

183
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,310
learn good moral as
deputy Tatewaki coach?

184
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,343
What do you say?

185
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:36,276
-What?

186
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:39,776
-It sounds like
a bad idea to me.

187
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,343
-No kidding, especially
seeing as how the freak don't

188
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:44,443
care for much 'cept for
girls' underwear anyway.

189
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,410
Why would he want to?

190
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,243
-Very well, I accept.

191
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:47,784
-Huh?

192
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:48,284
-Hee hee!

193
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:49,310
Ha!

194
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,576
-As though I would ever consent!

195
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:56,510
-The first thing you learn is
to speak when you're spoken to!

196
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,010
And you'll learn that
with proper training,

197
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,276
even someone like this can
become your worst enemy.

198
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,143
-He can?

199
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,910
-Enough!

200
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,010
The very thought that I,
Tatewaki Kuno oftimes called

201
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,843
the Blue Thunder
of Furinkan High

202
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:13,943
should ever be trained
by the likes of you.

203
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,243
And as for you
Ranma Saetome, I'll

204
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,710
await you at the
back of the gym.

205
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,076
-I'll be there.

206
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:28,110
-See that you are,
or you'll be sorry.

207
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,576
Ha ha ha.

208
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:31,943
-You sure it's a
good idea, Ranma?

209
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,443
-I know it isn't.

210
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:35,576
But if I don't go,
Kuno will never

211
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,710
let me hear the end of it.

212
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,110
-Of all the night's
haul, I'd have

213
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,910
to say this little
pink one's my favorite.

214
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,543
Hey!

215
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:48,376
Who just did that?

216
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:55,076
Dear me, look at what
the cat dragged in.

217
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:56,976
Ranma beat you up again, huh?

218
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:59,976
-If you wish, you
may become my coach.

219
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:02,776
-Oh so the likes of
me are finally good

220
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:03,610
enough for you then?

221
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,110
Are they?

222
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,110
-Well will you coach
me or won't you?

223
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,651
-Hmm.

224
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,143
Well.

225
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,076
Eh, why not.

226
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,410
We'll start first
thing tomorrow.

227
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,810
-Oh I see.

228
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,210
So the master will be in charge
of this training then, will he?

229
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,510
-That's bad news
for you, boy, seeing

230
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,210
as the master will know
your moves in advance.

231
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,210
-But Dad, Kuno's already
refused his offer.

232
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,010
-And besides, I mean, why
would the old freak even

233
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,276
bother in the first place?

234
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:30,610
-Hey, you didn't do
anything to make him angry

235
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,243
again, did you Ranma?

236
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:33,576
-Come on, Akane.

237
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,210
You think I'd actually do
something like that on purpose?

238
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,210
-Actually, it does make sense.

239
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,510
Being perverse is the
master's joy in life.

240
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,543
-Truer words were never spoken.

241
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,510
Why, he has no morals
at all, has he.

242
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,310
HAPPOSAI: Traitors!

243
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,076
-Huh?

244
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:47,076
-Grandfather!

245
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:49,210
-How cruel can you be?

246
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,810
I can't believe you
would even say that!

247
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,310
They-- they say parents
are misunderstood

248
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,343
by their children.

249
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:56,776
That's how I feel!

250
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,743
Why I'm only doing
it for his own good.

251
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:02,243
I'm trying to make Ranma into a
stronger martial artist, that's

252
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:02,876
all.

253
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:03,743
Don't you see that?

254
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,910
-(in unison) Master forgive us.

255
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,976
We're not worthy.

256
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,176
We'll never be worthy!

257
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:12,343
-Hmm.

258
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,610
Then you should know,
Ranma, that Kuno

259
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,610
came asking for my
help this evening.

260
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,810
-He-- he what?

261
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,843
-You should also know that
should you lose to him,

262
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:23,343
you'll be wearing this
cute little number!

263
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:26,510
-Oh no I--

264
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,410
-You'd better prepare yourself.

265
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,119
PRINCIPAL: OK!

266
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:49,719
Time for the be training now.

267
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,019
You make me proud, yeah!

268
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:53,853
-I train for one thing--
to defeat Ranma Saotome.

269
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:56,886
-Same difference, yeah?

270
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:59,019
-That being said,
I await instruction

271
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,453
on how training might
best be achieved.

272
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,719
-Ranma's main gift is speed.

273
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:06,053
So until you can more or
less keep up with him,

274
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:07,719
you haven't got a chance, kid.

275
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:11,686
-In other words, if I
strike without mercy--

276
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,086
-I'm not talking
about attitude, fool.

277
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:15,686
All the attitude
in the world's not

278
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,319
going to help you if you
can't get in a couple of hits.

279
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:20,286
What you need is energy.

280
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,119
Can you guess what
I've got in here?

281
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,486
-What, protein powder?

282
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:24,719
-No you moron.

283
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,786
Use your brain for once.

284
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:29,819
These here are the makings
for my super secret speed

285
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,186
of light elixir.

286
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:32,786
-Speed of light elixir?

287
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,386
-What that?

288
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:37,819
-Prepared properly it makes
you not only faster than light,

289
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,419
but graceful as a
swallow in flight.

290
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,053
-Graceful as a swallow.

291
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:43,319
-Aloha!

292
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:44,986
-I'll take it!

293
00:12:45,086 --> 00:12:46,586
-Hmm.

294
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:47,127
-I see.

295
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:53,219
-It's part of your
training, stupid.

296
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:56,419
To start.

297
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,953
-It looks like a map.

298
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,719
-On it you'll find the first
of several clues leading

299
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:03,653
to the necessary ingredients
for the speed of light elixir.

300
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:06,986
-Very well, I'll set
Sasuke to it immediately.

301
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,853
-Do it yourself, you idiot!

302
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:11,719
-"To begin, go 50
paces to the east.

303
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:14,186
Then go 15 paces due south.

304
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:22,847
Finally open the door and
look up toward the ceiling."

305
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,153
[women scream]

306
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:32,819
-Please stop screaming!

307
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,486
I-- I can explain everything!

308
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:41,786
-Deputy in charge of school
morals cannot do such thing!

309
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:43,986
-Now that he's paved
the way for me--

310
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:45,086
-Say again?

311
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:47,486
-You're supposed to
be setting an example!

312
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:48,986
-There's been a mistake!

313
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:52,419
I only came for-- ah, I got it.

314
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,319
-Can't say I'm surprised.

315
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,253
The ones who pretend to be good
are usually worse than anybody!

316
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:03,619
KUNO: Somebody help me!

317
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:07,686
-Let's hit him so hard he'll
never be able to raid us again.

318
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:08,853
-Gotta go!

319
00:14:08,953 --> 00:14:12,053
KUNO: But it's not my fault!

320
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:15,353
-But you take them only
for training, yeah?

321
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,719
-Come to papa, baby!

322
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,486
-Me know nothing.

323
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:22,819
-Vengeance is mine.

324
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,319
How dare you use me as
an instrument of evil!

325
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:28,586
Couldn't you have found
somewhere else to put this?

326
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:29,553
-Silence.

327
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,253
Do you want the
elixir or don't you?

328
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:32,419
-Yes, of course.

329
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,419
-Then unless you're
willing to dare any danger

330
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,886
and endure any humiliation
in strict accordance

331
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:39,119
with the training schedule
as I've set it out for you,

332
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,953
you ain't got a chance
of getting your hands

333
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:44,386
on the speed of light
elixir and defeating Ranma.

334
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:46,253
KUNO (VOICEOVER):
Saotome defeated.

335
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,953
Just imagine.

336
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,353
-You're so righteous!

337
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:52,586
-Champions of virtue
make me so hot.

338
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:54,686
-Then a champion I shall become!

339
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:57,986
[women scream]

340
00:14:58,086 --> 00:14:58,686
-Huh?

341
00:14:58,786 --> 00:14:59,586
FEMALE SPEAKER: Jerk!

342
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:01,019
Get out of here!

343
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,086
-Forgive me!

344
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:05,419
I came not to peep
but to-- there it is!

345
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,886
Ah, coming through!

346
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:08,319
FEMALE SPEAKER: Get out of here!

347
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,019
-Ha ha!

348
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,286
I got the second one!

349
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:18,353
The things a man does for love!

350
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,353
-Shutup and take a beating.

351
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:26,253
FEMALE SPEAKER: Scram!

352
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:26,919
-Ah!

353
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,253
An underwear thief!

354
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:29,153
-Somebody catch him!

355
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:30,386
-Call the police!

356
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,886
-The third clue has got
to be in here somewhere.

357
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,819
But soft what light
through yonder--

358
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,786
-So would you mind telling me
what you're up to there, pal?

359
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:45,186
Is that underwear?

360
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:47,219
Better show me some ID, buddy.

361
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,786
-I'm in training, you see?

362
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:50,453
-Uh-huh.

363
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:51,386
Come on pal, let's go.

364
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:52,853
-Don't you patronize me.

365
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,786
-Then don't go
stealing underwear.

366
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:56,786
The proof's right over there.

367
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:58,753
What the-- wh-- where'd it go?

368
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:00,019
-If you'll excuse me.

369
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:00,853
Hey!

370
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:01,819
Just don't let it happen again.

371
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,153
KUNO: Ranma Saotome,
where are you?

372
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:11,086
-Can I, uh, help you?

373
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,653
-Kindly give this
letter of challenge

374
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:14,319
your immediate attention.

375
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:16,719
Meet me after school
in the usual place.

376
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:17,786
I'll be waiting.

377
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:21,253
Signed, Tatewaki
"Blue Thunder" Kuno.

378
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:23,553
-Why write it if you were
going to read it anyway?

379
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:24,086
-Yeah.

380
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:25,119
-Akane Tendo?

381
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:26,186
-Uh, yeah?

382
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,686
-I regret that I am
unable at this time

383
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,253
to fulfill my pledge to you.

384
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:31,819
Yet once I've defeated
the vile Saotome,

385
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,586
rest assured that I shall indeed
become your champion of virtue.

386
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:36,619
-That's okay, really.

387
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,719
-Until then.

388
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:39,819
-Can you take him?

389
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,653
-Akane, I haven't lost
to him yet, have I?

390
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:49,719
-Ready, Saotome?

391
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:50,260
-Anytime.

392
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:59,953
And since when the heck
have you been so fast?

393
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:00,786
-Ha ha ha ha.

394
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,686
You're no longer a match for me.

395
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:05,419
-I just wasn't paying
attention is all.

396
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,086
-Who would've thought that
the dirt from my fingernails

397
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:15,286
was so strong?

398
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,586
-The fingernail?

399
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,886
-At worst, I figured he'd
give himself a stomach ache.

400
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:19,427
Ha!

401
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,653
-Is that your best?

402
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,186
Compared to the
tortures I've endured

403
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:28,353
at the hands of angry maidens,
your blows barely touch me.

404
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,319
-Now I'm getting serious!

405
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:42,053
-Ranma!

406
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:45,586
-He's headed for
the water fountain!

407
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:48,519
-I counted on the fact that he'd
believe whatever I told him,

408
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:50,386
but he may be
believing it too much!

409
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:55,119
-And now to end your suffering.

410
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:59,853
Prepare to-- Th-- th--
the pig-tailed girl!

411
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,053
-Kuno darling!

412
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:03,819
Be a lamb and lend me
your sword for a sec, huh?

413
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:04,719
-But I--

414
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,319
-You wanna hold me, don't you?

415
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,086
If you don't let
go of the sword--

416
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:08,853
-What's this?

417
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,353
I can hold you in my arms?

418
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,786
RANMA (VOICEOVER): If he don't
let go of it, I'm done for.

419
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:13,886
His attacks are just too--

420
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:15,286
-Forgive me, pig-tailed girl.

421
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,319
-Hmm?

422
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,053
-Despite the pleas
of my lover's heart,

423
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:20,753
my warrior's soul forbids it.

424
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:25,453
Nevertheless, if I
were to free one hand--

425
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:26,119
AKANE: Psst!

426
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:27,653
Ranma!

427
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:30,086
-You're a lifesaver.

428
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:32,453
-Pig-tailed girl,
wherefore art thou?

429
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:33,586
Huh?

430
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:35,119
-So, you happy to see me?

431
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:36,219
-Damn your eyes!

432
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,219
Where have you hidden
the pig-tailed girl?

433
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,853
How dare you interfere in
the amores of your betters!

434
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,386
-I gotta think of
something quick.

435
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:47,219
I can't take much
more of those hits.

436
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:47,986
-Run!

437
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,419
Run like the worm you are!

438
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:55,386
-Just as I feared, my
too-efficient training

439
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,519
has produced an
unstoppable killing machine

440
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,486
whose sword-based attacks
rival those of Japan's greatest

441
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:01,719
warriors.

442
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:04,119
-And all from the dirt
under your fingernails, huh?

443
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:05,819
-Hey, is it my
fault that even the

444
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,886
crud that piles up
under my fingernails

445
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:09,886
is too strong for
my own good, huh?

446
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:11,286
-Me not worthy!

447
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:12,853
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Ranma lose to Kuno?

448
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:16,253
I can't believe it!

449
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:17,219
-Run, worm!

450
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,353
Run!

451
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:19,719
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
There's gotta be some way

452
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,886
to block his attacks.

453
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,119
OK.

454
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:25,386
-Akane Tendo and the
pig-tailed girl both, with one

455
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:28,319
fell swoop I claim
my two fair maids!

456
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:29,853
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
The only time he's

457
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:31,686
got any muscle is
when he's striking

458
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:33,586
something right in front of him.

459
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:36,519
Therefore, if I only pretend
to be moving in close--

460
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:43,219
-Saotome!

461
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,353
-Ranma!

462
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:45,686
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I'm
falling right into it!

463
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,219
-I think I have a stomach ache.

464
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,086
FEMALE SPEAKER: He did it!

465
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:56,919
PRINCIPAL: Wipe out.

466
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:03,919
-Yo, Kuno are you
all right, man?

467
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:04,886
-Ranma!

468
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,153
You did it!

469
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,453
-Congratulations, Ranma.

470
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:11,553
You became strong after all
and rose to the challenge,

471
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:12,753
like I knew you would.

472
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:15,286
-Actually it wasn't
me being strong at all

473
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:17,053
it was Kuno being weak.

474
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:18,819
-Speaking of which--

475
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:19,886
-Oh my stomach.

476
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,486
It pains me so.

477
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:24,653
It must be that speed of
light elixer that I drank.

478
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:28,919
-Or maybe your stomach, he no
like dirt of fingernail, yeah?

479
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,519
Fingernail dirt!

480
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:32,919
Why you wretched
fossil of evil, how

481
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:36,019
dare you make mock of
Tatewaki Kuno, not once

482
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,386
but a second time.

483
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,919
You-- Help me!

484
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,853
-But Ranma, even if it wasn't
because of the medicine,

485
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:46,186
those sword blows
of Kuno's were fast.

486
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,153
He's never been
that fast before.

487
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:49,719
So why do you think
it is he could

488
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,986
move so quickly this time?

489
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:53,986
-Gee Akane, I don't know.

490
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,686
Maybe it's because
when he was chasing me

491
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:58,053
he kept wanting to be
your champion of virtue

492
00:20:58,153 --> 00:20:59,153
or something?

493
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:01,053
-Or maybe it's because
the fingernail dirt

494
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:04,419
of such a strong martial artist
gave him the strength of 10.

495
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,553
-(in unison) Be quiet, you!

496
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:07,319
-Though the lover
himself may die,

497
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,319
his love for his maiden
fair will never--

498
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:17,353
-Oh no, wipe out!

499
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:20,219
You think you beat
me, Ranma Saotome?

500
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,519
But you no beat me yet,
me make new statue.

501
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,819
-On your knees.

502
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,153
-That right, now I teach him!

503
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:32,719
Hit student, not principal!

504
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:34,819
Principal is headmaster,
which mean Big Kahuna!

505
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,719
So no hit the big--

506
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:39,586
-On your knees, worm.

507
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:18,868
NARRATOR: Hey, no fair!

508
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:21,401
Why'd you put that stuff
on Ranma's back for?

509
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,401
What?

510
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,368
What do you mean
he'll lose his power?

511
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:27,335
Next time on Ranma
1/2, Ranma gets weak!

512
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:29,335
We'll see you there!
