[music playing]

2
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,200
-Blow, wind!

3
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,700
To Be Young is to Go Gung-ho.

4
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,233
-Aloha, everybody.

5
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:50,333
And once again, me have very
exciting news for you all.

6
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,300
[sighs]

7
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,200
-You just watch it be another
one of those dumb rules of his.

8
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,000
-Well actually,
Ranma, I hear it's

9
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,666
supposed to be some
kind of new teacher.

10
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:05,033
-Oh, so you mean in other
words, the big loser's

11
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,966
calling in the
reinforcements on us.

12
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:07,933
Is that the deal?

13
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,700
-Shut up!

14
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,866
Big exciting news is that
starting today, Furinkan High

15
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,666
School has new teacher.

16
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,033
Boys and girls,
little cake is all.

17
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:19,833
Me now introduce,
Higuma Torajirou!

18
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,966
-Higuma Torajirou?

19
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:27,300
Isn't that Japanese for bear?

20
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,033
Give me a break.

21
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,233
-Did you hear, the word's that
wherever this Higuma transfers,

22
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,300
the students end
up having a riot.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,266
-Well that could be
good or bad, I guess.

24
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,600
-Anything to wake 'em up, right?

25
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,900
-You said it.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
-Of course unless
he come soon, me

27
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,633
have to find new, new teacher.

28
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,541
What?

29
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,333
[screams]

30
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:11,300
-What does youth mean to you?

31
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,900
-That's closer, closer, clos--

32
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,933
-I was born with the
name Higuma Torajirou,

33
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,100
but I'd rather
you call me coach.

34
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,433
-What's he take us for?

35
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,833
-Like we'd really
fall for his dumb act.

36
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:41,066
-Well I figure, any enemy of the
principal, is no enemy of mine.

37
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,533
-I don't think so.

38
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:43,333
No fair.

39
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,033
Do over.

40
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:44,600
Time out.

41
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,400
-Are ya with me?

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,800
-Yeah!

43
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,766
-One, two, one, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two, one, two,

44
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:56,600
one, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two.

45
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,733
-He plenty bad coach.

46
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,600
Why he go and want to
do that to headmaster.

47
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,966
Teaching in the island if
not for the Big Kahuna.

48
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:04,966
Bad coach.

49
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,466
-OK, what does
youth mean to you?

50
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,566
It comes but once in your life.

51
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:17,400
You must make the most
of each and every moment.

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,166
Romance, friendship, in
sports, scholarship, reading,

53
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,566
amateur theatrics,
what is not important?

54
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,866
[sighs]

55
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:33,133
Whatever it is that moves
you to passion, go for it!

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,466
Akane Tendo, what does
youth mean to you?

57
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,566
-I guess I'd have
to say martial arts.

58
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,266
[laughs]

59
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:50,566
-That's enough!

60
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,333
Is it funny to you that a
girl believes in something?

61
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:56,200
To a Japanese, fitting
in is everything.

62
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,133
But you must never
let peer pressure

63
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,000
get in the way of
any of your dreams.

64
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,033
That my friends is youth.

65
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,600
And that's why I salute
you, Akane Tendo,

66
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,800
for having a dream.

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,282
-Thanks.

68
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,300
-Ukyo Kuonji?

69
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:17,874
-Sir!

70
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,566
-What warms your heart?

71
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,233
Please, tell the class.

72
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:23,774
-Hmm.

73
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,300
One youth special, ready to go.

74
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,500
-Yes!

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,633
Excellent.

76
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,533
May such feelings burn
always to keep you warm.

77
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,533
-Oh, great.

78
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,433
Now she's falling for it too.

79
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:48,666
-Ranma Saotome, what
feelings burn in your heart?

80
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,366
-Gee, I don't know,
guess I'd have

81
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,966
to say anything
goes martial arts.

82
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,633
-No, no, no!

83
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,933
That's not youth
I hear speaking.

84
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,566
Say it with feeling.

85
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,300
I'll ask again, Ranma
Saotome, the feelings that

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,733
burn in your heart,
what are they?

87
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,533
-I told ya.

88
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,466
Anything goes, school
of martial arts.

89
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:10,566
Yada, yada.

90
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,600
-No, no, no!

91
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,141
No!

92
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,033
Try saying it like this.

93
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,766
I, Ranma Saotome, believe
in the anything goes school

94
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,633
with all my heart and soul.

95
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,933
Please, have that ready
for tomorrow morning.

96
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,966
-Uh, OK.

97
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,133
[laughing]

98
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,466
-Cool, huh?

99
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,466
-Are we enjoying our youth?

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,633
-Uh, yeah?

101
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,833
-No riots yet, I guess.

102
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,200
-Yeah, it won't
be the first time

103
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,266
the headmaster's misjudged.

104
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,266
-His students seem to like him.

105
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:09,133
Guess I can't blame him for
wanting to be his friend.

106
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,933
-The kids can use
someone like him around.

107
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,033
-I'm guessing no
girlfriends, right?

108
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:17,066
-What makes you say that?

109
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:22,266
-Boys, boys, there's
nothing to be ashamed about.

110
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:23,400
-But, what if we--

111
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,700
-Yeah, what if we get dumped?

112
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,700
-All right.

113
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,966
What is youth if
not taking chances?

114
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:33,100
How can you learn from
mistakes unless you make them?

115
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,300
So you get dumped?

116
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,233
Learn from it.

117
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,233
Study it.

118
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,533
Next time, do better.

119
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,266
-We'll try it, some day.

120
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,466
-Pardon?

121
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,933
Don't you someday me!

122
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,733
The time to act
is now, not later.

123
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,400
So this girl that you
like, tell me her name.

124
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,466
Don't you trust me boys?

125
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,066
After all, I suppose
I can't blame you.

126
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,666
-That's not it.

127
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:02,566
-It's not?

128
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,233
Then you do trust me.

129
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,933
The key is confidence,
boys, remember that.

130
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,333
You just leave the rest to me.

131
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:13,766
There's nothing to
be ashamed about, OK?

132
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:15,966
-OK.

133
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,766
-Excellent, let's run.

134
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,700
-Boy, what a great teacher.

135
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,066
-If you say so.

136
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,300
-So you gonna practice?

137
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,266
-I, uh, what?

138
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:35,700
-You know, I believe, et cetera.

139
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,400
-Sure.

140
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,366
-Fine, don't practice.

141
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,700
But don't blame me though
when you get detention.

142
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,333
-Failure of youth.

143
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,966
-Hmm, well I'll be.

144
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,266
Perhaps there hope for him yet.

145
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,900
-I, Ranma Saotome,
love the anything

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,066
goes school heart and soul!

147
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,033
-Encore.

148
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:13,933
Encore, my boy.

149
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,500
-Enough of that.

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,400
-OK, everyone, listen up.

151
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Hiroshi and Daisuke have an
important declaration to make.

152
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
-You wouldn't?

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
-In front of everyone?

154
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,733
-Come on, no
embarrassment, remember?

155
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,066
Stand up for your dreams.

156
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,000
-All right.

157
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Guess this means
I'm off the hook.

158
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,533
-Well, let's have it boys.

159
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:38,400
-But, I--

160
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,500
-Does it have to be now?

161
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,333
-Come now, what is it that's
so hard about saying, Akane,

162
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,800
I love you?

163
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,341
-What?

164
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,433
-But we never--
Akane, I'm sorry.

165
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,100
We never meant--

166
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,266
-You see.

167
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,033
That wasn't so bad.

168
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,533
Now Akane are you ready
to give them an answer?

169
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,066
-Are you stupid or what?

170
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,233
-You're absolutely right.

171
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,733
I am stupid.

172
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,433
However, you're even stupider.

173
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:09,600
-Huh?

174
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,300
I what--

175
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:16,100
-Give your teacher credit
for doing his homework, huh?

176
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,266
You and Akane Tendo are engaged
to be married, are you not?

177
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,300
-So what's that
got to do anything?

178
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,300
-Everything, because
you stubbornly

179
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,900
refuse to make your feelings
for your fiancee known,

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,900
those two boys are in agony.

181
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,100
-You make us sound like--

182
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,033
-Like we're losers.

183
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,933
-Allow me to put in plain.

184
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,633
You, Akane, I love!

185
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,433
While you, Saotome, I detest.

186
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,200
Shoo, I stay.

187
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,400
Out of the way.

188
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,366
-Take it out on me if you must.

189
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:56,666
Young emotions are
strong, but don't

190
00:10:56,766 --> 00:11:00,066
make the mistake of thinking
that just because your thwarted

191
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,600
in your goals now, that you
won't someday achieve them.

192
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,833
Because you will,
you will, I promise.

193
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,429
Strong emotions in the
young are a sign health.

194
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,129
And yet no emotion is so
strong that a good hard run

195
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:27,563
can't put it all right.

196
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:28,263
What say you?

197
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:28,963
Will you run?

198
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:32,396
-Sadly, I regret
that I must decline.

199
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:36,996
-Hmm, another time, perhaps.

200
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:40,663
It's decided.

201
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:45,463
A parent teacher
conference it is then.

202
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,529
May I have your
attention please.

203
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,363
I'd like to share with you
an important announcement.

204
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:01,463
-Gee, I can hardly
wait to hear it.

205
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:05,396
-Ranma Saotome, because
you have refused

206
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:09,163
to be honest with your feelings,
many of your fellow students,

207
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:12,029
including your
fiancee, Akane Tendo,

208
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:14,096
have been made to suffer.

209
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:16,496
Truly, the situation
is regrettable.

210
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:18,463
-I'll kill him!

211
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,463
-Are you listening,
Ranma Saotome?

212
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:22,496
Until you can--

213
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:23,829
-Shut up already, will ya?

214
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:25,696
It's got nothing to do with you.

215
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,096
-You're absolutely right.

216
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,329
It doesn't.

217
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:29,329
-Then why are you--

218
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,629
-It has to do with
your youth, my boy.

219
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:32,529
Your youth.

220
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:35,096
Seize the day, lad, carpe diem.

221
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:37,396
-Ah, man, what
planet are you from?

222
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,429
-What have I done?

223
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,029
You're right, it has
nothing to do with me.

224
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,296
I just don't care.

225
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:48,329
These are the things
I hear every day.

226
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,996
Not that I'm blaming you
or your fellow students.

227
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:52,863
In fact, if I had
to blame anyone,

228
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:54,096
it would be we, faculty.

229
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:59,763
I Coach Higuma, do hereby
affirm my most solemn vow.

230
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:22,829
Away with the
textbooks, what meaning

231
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,029
have they to the
healthy and active body?

232
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,029
-Like theme of big
island sportsman who

233
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,396
take the fish out of net only
to catch later on the hook,

234
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:36,763
Big Kahuna see his plan
for ungrateful [inaudible]

235
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,496
finally start to reel
them students in.

236
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:47,463
-One, two, one, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two, one, two,

237
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:48,096
one--

238
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:48,963
-Not good enough.

239
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:54,363
Now what do you want from me?

240
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:57,496
-Ask not what I want from you
but what you want from me.

241
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:59,529
Trust your youthful
feelings, let your anger go.

242
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:04,829
-My dear sir, I assure that
that is the least of my worries.

243
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:05,396
-No excuses.

244
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,063
Don't you see?

245
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,029
It's because we
bottle up our feelings

246
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:10,029
that we're so miserable.

247
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:20,496
-Welcome to Ucha--

248
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:22,896
-Uyko?

249
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,029
-You really came.

250
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,329
I thought the conference
thing was just a joke.

251
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:27,696
-Poor thing.

252
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:30,796
I can't believe you're being
forced to work like this.

253
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,029
-Nobody forces
me, I own my own--

254
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:34,363
-Don't shield them.

255
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,396
What sort of a parent
allows a daughter

256
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:39,829
to put herself through high
school by cooking okonomiyaki.

257
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:43,296
Your father died at an early
age and your stepmother,

258
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:46,096
not thinking you're good enough
for her three daughters, sent

259
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:49,196
you to Tokyo to the slave
away in some hell hole--

260
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:50,296
-Whoa, whoa, slow down.

261
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:51,163
You don't understand.

262
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:52,529
-Don't speak!

263
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:55,663
I know the pain you're
going through all too well.

264
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:57,529
I just want you to
know that no matter

265
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,263
what, you can count on me.

266
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:01,663
I'm here for you.

267
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:04,463
-Thank you, please come again.

268
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:10,263
Well, there goes this
afternoon's profits.

269
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:12,496
-Poor girl, is all life is?

270
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:13,563
Profits?

271
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,629
Would it help if I
spoke to your guardian?

272
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:16,796
-Welcome to-- huh?

273
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:19,196
Hey, what do you
know, there he is now.

274
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:20,229
-He's here?

275
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,596
Where?

276
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:27,096
Mr. Kuonji, I'm Coach Higuma
from Ukyo's school. [laughing]

277
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:31,029
Sir, I don't presume to tell
you how to raise your ward.

278
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,829
But, might it be best if
you hired someone else

279
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,196
to do the cooking?

280
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:36,263
Don't play dumb.

281
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:38,096
Sir, if you promise
to let her go free,

282
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,529
I swear I'll do anything
you ask, anything.

283
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:45,129
-Well there sure ain't
no flies on that panda.

284
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,029
-Going somewhere?

285
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:53,263
-I was just, uh--

286
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:54,629
-Uh huh.

287
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:57,129
More like you were sneaking away
before the coach comes over.

288
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:58,396
-Do you blame me?

289
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:00,929
Can you give me a reason
why I should stay?

290
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,563
-Scaredy cat.

291
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:03,763
-What?

292
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,896
-I shouldn't have to say
it but where does leave me

293
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,096
if you take off?

294
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:11,729
-Hey, you're the one who
thinks he's so great, remember?

295
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:14,096
-We're talking
about you, not me.

296
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:16,663
-Well then I say that you should
be the one to talk to him,

297
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:19,463
Akane, seeing as how you're
such great pals and all.

298
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,629
-You're such a jerk!

299
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,863
-Never said I wasn't.

300
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:23,696
See ya.

301
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,163
-Ranma, wait up.

302
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:30,929
-Oh, man.

303
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,463
-It's coach Higuma.

304
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,229
I know how you two must feel.

305
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,063
Still, you mustn't.

306
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:41,829
You mustn't elope.

307
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:44,129
-Elope?

308
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:45,696
-But we're not--

309
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,329
-Don't explain.

310
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:50,629
I must confess, even I
was unaware of how far

311
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:51,796
your feelings have come.

312
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:53,963
If only I'd listened
more carefully

313
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,696
to what you were telling me.

314
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:56,729
Forgive me.

315
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:59,696
However, elopement
is not the answer.

316
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:02,729
Perhaps if I were to come
inside and talk to your parents?

317
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,496
Sir, please!

318
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:20,529
I don't presume to tell you
what's best for your children,

319
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:23,596
but might you allow
young Ranma and Akane

320
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:25,163
to go on with the marriage?

321
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,563
-What?

322
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:28,896
-Yes, I realize they're young.

323
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:31,729
Yes, I realize that
up until this moment,

324
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:34,396
you've probably never given
a thought to your daughter

325
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:35,996
getting married someday.

326
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,863
-Actually, uh, we, uh--

327
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:39,329
-Sir, I know.

328
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,829
I'm not so old myself
that I've forgotten

329
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,296
what it's like to be young.

330
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,796
Please sir, please
allow them to marry.

331
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:50,396
-That's right, daddy, why not?

332
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:50,945
-Nabiki!

333
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:53,029
Say something.

334
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:54,429
-Who me?

335
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:58,363
-So that's all it is. [laughing]
Why didn't you say so earlier?

336
00:17:58,463 --> 00:17:59,429
-Dad?

337
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,196
-Sir, I wish I could
be so light hearted.

338
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,996
I'm just worried for
their future, that's all.

339
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,663
They are such good kids.

340
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:09,929
-Here you go.

341
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:14,629
So father, what did I miss?

342
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,163
-I'm not sure we would.

343
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,463
-I'm not saying
it has to be now.

344
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:21,096
They're young, they've
still got plenty of time.

345
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:24,429
I know you're opposed to their
marriage, but can't you just--

346
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:26,463
-But I'm telling-- I--

347
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,429
-Think it over.

348
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:29,129
That's all I ask you.

349
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:30,163
-But, I--

350
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:31,596
-Think, that's all I ask.

351
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:33,763
-I, just--

352
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:37,429
-I'm afraid that you
have lost me, daddy.

353
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,663
-Don't argue with your father.

354
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:41,796
-Akane's all grown
up now, father.

355
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,763
Might she be allowed to
make up our own mind?

356
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:47,863
-I know that you're
right, but still--

357
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:50,963
-Just say yes, daddy,
and get it over with.

358
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,129
-Very well then.

359
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:53,429
I consent.

360
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:54,896
-You do?

361
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:56,996
You hear that kids,
your father just

362
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:58,496
gave his OK to the marriage.

363
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,496
Aren't you happy?

364
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:07,463
With this, my work here at
Furinkan high school is over.

365
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,563
-What?

366
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:10,529
-So you're going to go
bother someone else?

367
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:13,763
-Wherever there's a Japanese
high school student in distress

368
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,496
I'll be there.

369
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,563
In the East, I'll be
running with those

370
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:20,196
who suffered the pangs
of unrequited love.

371
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:23,096
In the West, I'll be running
with those studying hard

372
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,929
to get into a good college.

373
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:27,196
In the South, I'll
be running with those

374
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,963
who've taken to vandalism.

375
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:30,696
Most of all, in
the North, I'll be

376
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,063
running with those who know
the heartbreak of psoriasis.

377
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:36,896
-That sounds like
a lot of running.

378
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,763
-What is youth, if not to run?

379
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:45,629
-OK, students, listen up.

380
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:50,296
Today me have a very,
very news for you all.

381
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,729
Sadly, new teacher
just tell me he no

382
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:55,596
when be teaching here
at Furinkan no more.

383
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,629
Now, Big Kahuna present to you,
one last time, Coach Higuma!

384
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:07,963
-Students, faculty-- I
haven't been here long,

385
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,229
but I feel we've come
to know each other well.

386
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:12,296
I know you'll
continue the fight.

387
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:14,363
Remember, youth comes but once.

388
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,696
If you stop running,
you stop living.

389
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:18,996
And so for that reason
I propose to you

390
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:21,396
a final faculty
student rugby game!

391
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:30,996
Let's here it for the
spirit of Furinkan!

392
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:40,770
-Aloha!

393
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:48,563
-Here goes.

394
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:06,096
-Maybe Big Kahuna get self
caught in own fish net

395
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,263
this time.

396
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,996
-Farewell, youthful students!

397
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:12,937
-Goodbye!

398
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,696
-I give you, youth!

399
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:34,663
-Oh, no.

400
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:48,129
[music playing]

401
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:16,858
-Come on!

402
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,591
You don't really want to
study under my dad, do you?

403
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,158
I'd think twice If I were you.

404
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:23,091
You may live to regret it.

405
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:26,525
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
a formidable new disciple

406
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,658
appears.

407
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:31,258
We'll see ya there.
