There's not a moment to lose.

-I guess I wasn't
imagining it after all.

to be here somewhere.

What's that?

209
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,539
It's all Happosai's fault?

210
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,839
-That old man do very bad thing.

211
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,039
Why he punish Ranma?

212
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,172
-When I found him in
Ranma's room the other night

213
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:52,272
with that smell of
incense in the air,

214
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:55,906
I should have known
he was up to no good.

215
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,939
And yet the only reason it
worked was because Ranma

216
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,606
himself willed it.

217
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:01,406
-Oh!

218
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:02,472
-Oh, ho, ho, ho!

219
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:05,039
Then maybe I'll just
stay this way, huh?

220
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,106
-The moment he allowed the
vigilance of his yang, or male,

221
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:11,039
side to subside, his
ying, or female side,

222
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:13,172
was able to assert
itself and break free.

223
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,439
-But still, it stay with Ranma!

224
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,839
GENMA: Hm.

225
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:21,072
As a father, it seems now I have
a duty to both of my children.

226
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:24,039
For Male Ranma, my duty
is to see him wed Akane

227
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,039
and inherit the Tendo Dojo.

228
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:29,972
For Female Ranma, it's to
catch her a rich husband.

229
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:30,606
Heh.

230
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:31,239
Heh.

Yes!

00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:37,172
That way I'll have it made
in the shade! [laughs]

want it, then fine.

here for you.

-What evil can have
befallen my poor boy?

266
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:54,272
-Now that is the question,
isn't it, Saotome?

267
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,806
Are you sure there's nothing
the boy wants to tell me?

268
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:58,106
GENMA: Bite your tongue, Tendo.

269
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:01,172
He's just an innocent
victim of circumstance.

SOUN: Oh, is he now?

271
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,939
-The boy side of me separate
from the girl side of me?

Just what the heck
is going on here?

273
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:13,706
-All humans have two sides
to their personality.

274
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:17,472
That girl side of yours is the
embodiment of your evil side.

275
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,672
AKANE: So you're saying
that Girl Ranma is

276
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,006
kind of like his bad
side come to life?

277
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:24,372
COLOGNE: That's exactly
what I'm saying.

278
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:27,239
-I don't think the two sides
can stay separate forever.

279
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:30,239
-Hm, and they do seem
attracted to each other.

Oh, no you don't!

Uh, you know, a joke?

286
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:45,039
-All joking aside, unless
we do something soon,

287
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:47,772
Ranma will become the
slave of his evil side.

288
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:50,672
-But what can we do to help him?

00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:52,872
COLOGNE: For starters,
we've got to make sure

290
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,339
that evil girl
stays away from him.

291

Once she lures you
to the outside,

she'll make you her slave.

you apart long enough.

Was it so wrong of
me to want to get

00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:09,788
in touch with
Ranma's better half?

317
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:11,721
Still, I should have
asked permission
