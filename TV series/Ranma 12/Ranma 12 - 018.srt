00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,894
You don't want to
disappoint her!

169
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,661
Well, now what?

170
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,594
-Ranma, where she?

171
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,994
-I-- I-- I don't know.

172
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:51,827
-You hide, Ranma.

173
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:54,061
You too must die!

174
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:59,861
-Akane?

175
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:00,894
OK, that's it.

176
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:01,961
You've done enough damage!

177
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,361
Huh?

178
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:09,061
-Hm?

179
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:12,594
-Oh, my.

180
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:22,061
-That poor girl defeated
by male Ranma this time.

181
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:22,727
-Huh?

182
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:24,194
It was an accident.

183
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:27,194
-Yeah, you beat her fair
and square, all right.

184
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:27,961
-He's right.

185
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,627
You did win.

186
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:32,727
Don't be so modest now, Ranma.

187
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,494
-Mhm.

188
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,761
-But then that would mean--

189
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:45,061
-That would mean she's gonna
be after the male Ranma too.

190
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:57,161
[stuttering]

191
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:00,661
-Wait.

192
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,561
You didn't lose.

193
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,127
It was an accident.

194
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:07,161
-Be a man, and take
your Kiss of Death.

195
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,661
-Wo ai ni.

196
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:17,561
-Wo ai ni?

197
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,361
It's you I love?

198
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,761
-Huh?

199
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:22,561
-Love?

200
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:23,027
-Huh?

201
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,161
-What the?

202
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:31,961
-Oh my.

203
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:35,761
-Ranma.

204
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,856
-Huh?

205
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:49,889
-Huh?

206
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:50,389
-Hm?

207
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,257
-Airen!

208
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:10,057
-Hmph.

209
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,957
-Hmph.

210
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,457
-Huh?

211
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,624
-Oh.

212
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:19,124
-Hmph!

213
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:23,390
-Huh?

214
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,290
-That's enough.

215
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:26,324
What's the fuss?

216
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:27,557
What's going on?

217
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,024
-Oh, father.

218
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:31,924
-Hm.

219
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:34,657
-Well, father, I-- I don't
know all the details,

220
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,824
but it seems this girlfriend
of Ranma's followed him

221
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,090
all the way from China so
she could finish him off,

222
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,524
or so they could
finish something.

223
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:42,324
Yeah, something
like that I think.

224
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,457
-Girlfriend?

225
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,257
Well?

226
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,824
-What do you mean, I don't know?

227
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:47,290
That's not how it happened.

228
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:48,990
-But it's mostly
how it happened.

229
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,424
Right, Ranma?

230
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:53,957
-She has never seen me
as a guy before, OK?

231
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,590
-So you say.

232
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:56,724
-Hm?

233
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:59,524
-Still, you two seem to
be very close friends.

234
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:00,590
-Oh, great.

235
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:02,024
Are you trying to tell
me that you see me

236
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,890
that way too, Mr. Tendo?

237
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:07,090
-I can't see you any other way.

238
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:09,524
[moaning]

239
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:23,257
-Ranma, as far as I'm concerned,
our engagement never happened!

240
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:35,257
-Well, then, son.

241
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:41,424
Tell us again how you
got yourself into this.

242
00:13:41,457 --> 00:13:43,257
-Hey, I already told you.

243
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,424
I got no idea.

244
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:51,224
-The book of Amazon Tribal law?

245
00:13:59,224 --> 00:13:59,690
Huh?

246
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:00,390
-What?

247
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,624
What does that book say?

248
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:08,824
-You know perfectly well I
can't read a word of Chinese.

249
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:11,624
-Well, then why didn't
you just say so?

250
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:12,724
-Hm, good idea.

251
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:15,324
-The laws of the Amazon
Tribe are as follows.

252
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:16,757
-Well, hello, Nabiki.

253
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,657
Welcome home.

254
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,357
-In the event an Amazon is
defeated by an outsider,

255
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,257
and if that outsider
is a woman, the Amazon

256
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,624
must give the kiss of death
and kill without delay.

257
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:36,124
However, if that outsider is
a man, she must marry him.

258
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,524
-Oh.

259
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:39,890
-Huh?

260
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:41,457
That's a joke!

261
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,957
No way.

262
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,790
-Do I look like the
kind of girl who'd

263
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:47,857
joke about a thing like this?

264
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,057
-Maybe.

265
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,690
-Do go on.

266
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,190
-You can't read that.

267
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,690
Just admit it.

268
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,124
-Read Chinese?

269
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:56,490
Of course I can't.

270
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:57,190
-Ah-hah.

271
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:58,724
So were you joking then.

272
00:14:58,757 --> 00:14:59,457
-Wrong.

273
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,957
I don't joke.

274
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,924
Look.

275
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:03,057
It's written in
Japanese right here.

276
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:03,557
-Huh?

277
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,424
-What?

278
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:06,257
-And I missed that completely?

279
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:11,957
-Ranma, you-- you dummy!

280
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:29,124
OK.

281
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:29,624
That helped.

282
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,824
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
That fiance stuff

283
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,557
was all their idea anyway.

284
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,257
All we ever do is fight.

285
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,557
It's not like we're
in love or anything.

286
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,024
-Listen up, Akane is my fiance.

287
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,824
You touch her,
and I'll kill you!

288
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,757
-OK, Shampoo, let me
explain it a different way.

289
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,757
That Amazon stuff is all
right when you're in China.

290
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,157
But you're in Japan.

291
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,357
Now forget about that kill the
girls, and marry the guys rule.

292
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:15,924
-Rules?

293
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:17,390
In other words--

294
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:21,057
-She's trying to catch
herself a husband, Akane.

295
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,957
-Oh, you two.

296
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,157
-Why don't you go and make
up with him now, Akane?

297
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,357
-You don't really think he's
got the guts to cheat on you,

298
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:29,990
do you?

299
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,757
-So now you understand, Shampoo?

300
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,424
-Mhm.

301
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,790
-You didn't listen
to a word I said.

302
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:43,657
-Wode ailen.

303
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,357
-Hm, wode airen--
my beloved husband.

304
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,424
-Grr.

305
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:50,724
-Stop that.

306
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:53,057
I know you don't want to
hear this, but listen.

307
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,424
[giggle]

308
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:58,390
-You-- you and I, we--

309
00:16:58,424 --> 00:16:59,524
-Oh.

310
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:04,024
Guess he forgot what he
was gonna say, eh, Akane?

311
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,124
-Ma-- marry you?

312
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,124
I mean, I can't 'cuz--

313
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,457
-Wo ai ni.

314
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,690
-Hm, wo ai ni.

315
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,390
I love you, it says, Akane.

316
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:15,790
-Enough!

317
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:17,157
OK?!

318
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,890
-So we-- well, that's
why we should--

319
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:22,657
you know-- just get to
know each other better.

320
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,890
Yeah, that's--
that's what we-- uh--

321
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:25,857
-Airen.

322
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,624
-Stop and listen
to yourself, son.

323
00:17:28,657 --> 00:17:29,390
It's sad.

324
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,524
RANMA (VOICEOVER): It's funny.

325
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,757
She's been trying to kill me all
this time so I never noticed,

326
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:46,190
but that Shampoo
really is kind of cute.

327
00:17:46,224 --> 00:17:49,090
Man, if only Akane
were that nice.

328
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,557
-Ryoga, why'd you do that?

329
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,890
-You know, watching Akane
get jealous over a jerk

330
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:03,524
like you really makes me sick.

331
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:04,024
-What?

332
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:10,924
Hey, stupid, if Akane's
jealous, then that's her--

333
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:11,757
-Me?

334
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,224
Jealous?

335
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,424
Never.

336
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:15,357
We were never engaged in
the first place, remember?

337
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,424
So go ahead!

338
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:19,090
And get to know her
better all you want!

339
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:22,857
-Uh-- Akane, wait.

340
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,824
Akane.

341
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:26,790
Hey!

342
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:29,290
You coulda hurt
somebody with that!

343
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:30,790
[scream]

344
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:31,290
-Huh?

345
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:31,857
Eek!

346
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,757
-Ranma, I kill!

347
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,690
Ranma!

348
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:41,690
-Wait a minute!

349
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,557
-When he's a boy,
she just wants him.

350
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,690
When he's a girl,
she wants him dead.

351
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:51,657
-Come on.

352
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,157
-Ranma!

353
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:00,990
-Well, they really do need to
get to know each other better,

354
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:02,757
now don't they?

355
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,257
-Mhm.

356
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:09,190
-Mhm.

357
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:10,657
Ha.

358
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,157
-Stay-- stay away!

359
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,090
Stay away from me, I said!

360
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,557
-Ranma!

361
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,957
-Hey, watch it.

362
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,757
-I figure 2000
yen will cover it.

363
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,590
-Huh?

364
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:35,824
-I just saved your life, silly.

365
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,857
-Airen.

366
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,257
-I don't believe this.

367
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,224
I'm outta here.

368
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:49,790
Now what?

369
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,024
Ryoga?

370
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,224
What'd I ever do to you?

371
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:53,724
Huh?

372
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:01,190
-Airen!

373
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,757
-Aw, man.

374
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,724
Being a guy has gotta
be safer than this.

375
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,257
-Pss, Ranma.

376
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,024
How would you like this?

377
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:21,524
-Hm.

378
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,390
Hurry it up.

379
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:29,690
-With tax, your
total is 5,000 yen.

380
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:31,890
-Hey, kinda steep, isn't it?

381
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:34,790
-Do you want it, or, don't you?

382
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:35,424
-Ah!

383
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:36,490
OK, I'll take it.

384
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:37,424
Don't pour it out!

385
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:39,690
Hurry up, and give
it to me. hurry!

386
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:40,357
-Come again.

387
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:46,057
-No, wait!

388
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,757
It's me!

389
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,290
-Airen?

390
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:51,990
-Ha.

391
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,957
-Wode airen!

392
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,657
-That's worse!

393
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,857
-Ryoga!

394
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,290
Did Nabiki put you up to this?

395
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:04,257
Huh?

396
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:04,757
-Ranma!

397
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,924
-Somebody help me!

398
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:20,924
Help me, please!

399
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:22,924
-Ranma!

400
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:24,357
-Leave me alone!

401
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,890
-I kill!

402
00:21:25,924 --> 00:21:27,857
-Go away!

403
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,357
Help!

404
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:43,057
-You know, Saotome, with you
and your son in this house,

405
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,757
there's never a dull moment.

406
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,857
I'm so glad you're here.

407
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,090
I'm so glad you're here.

408
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,590
[crying]

409
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,024
-Ranma.

410
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:10,465
[theme music]

411
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:42,461
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Shampoo, what do

412
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:44,861
you think you're
doing with P-chan?

413
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:45,728
Huh?

414
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:47,028
Kiss of Death?

415
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:47,794
Fine then.

416
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,661
I'll accept your challenge.

417
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,061
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
