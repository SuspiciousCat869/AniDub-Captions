1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:09,700
[theme song]

2
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,495
Oh yeah, me lovely fans.

3
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:48,628
It's a beautiful
afternoon, kick it,

4
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:52,562
so I bless y'all with a diddy
on me sweet ukulele that I be

5
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:55,262
bringing back from Hawaii.

6
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:57,528
Eek!

7
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:58,462
Me god!

8
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,462
Me sweet ukulele!

9
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,095
Anything what sweet going
sour, me got a tingly feeling,

10
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:06,362
and it smells like
a sour puss milk.

11
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:11,128
Something nasty gonna happen
at me precious Furinkan High

12
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:13,295
School.

13
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:17,062
AKANE (VOICEOVER): "The Musical
Instruments of Destruction."

14
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,462
[laughter]

15
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:21,062
Catch.

16
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:30,095
That was very nicely
done, Mr. Green Turtle.

17
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:31,895
Catch.

18
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:34,328
You really are a little glutton.

19
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:01,695
Sasuke, do you realize the
significance of this year?

20
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:03,295
Yes, sir.

21
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,028
One time each decade, we clean
the Kuno House treasure vault,

22
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:07,295
and this is the
chosen year to do it.

23
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:08,895
Correct, my man.

24
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,528
Now let us begin the New Year's
Eve grand cleaning of the Kuno

25
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:12,962
family treasure vault.

26
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:14,962
A thousand pardons
for pointing this out,

27
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,828
but Master, it's still
summer, is it not?

28
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,062
Quiet, you fool.

29
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:24,895
Do you not see the
obvious reason?

30
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:33,595
Sweep, man!

31
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:35,128
Sweep for your life!

32
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:39,295
If we get a head start, we
might just finish by New Year's.

33
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:43,828
You know what they say, many
raindrops doth a shower make.

34
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:48,595
And showers of dust
doth endless toil entail.

35
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,195
Attack!

36
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:55,528
Oh, fine.

37
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,495
[scream]

38
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:01,995
Oh, my poor master.

39
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:06,628
Are you all right, Master?

40
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:09,328
Hah, t'is only a minor scratch.

41
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,095
Huh?

42
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:10,928
What's that box?

43
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:17,495
The seal's coming off.

44
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:19,628
Oh.

45
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:22,028
You're going to like
this, Master Kuno.

46
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:26,495
You see, it's an antique hand
drum, and quite an old one too.

47
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:27,162
Antique drum?

48
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,862
Master Kuno, something wrong?

49
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:44,428
This antique, I feel the
drum beckoning, beckoning

50
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:46,995
me to play it.

51
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:49,595
This drum has been
awaiting my birth.

52
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:53,962
And now, at last, I've found it!

53
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,395
I think that's what
it's telling me.

54
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:59,528
And now the chosen one will
answer to the drum's call

55
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:00,828
and strike it!

56
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:02,195
Uh, Master Kuno.

57
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:06,162
Yo!

58
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:26,062
[scream]

59
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:39,862
Long ago, the gods
bestowed upon humans two

60
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:41,495
of the most
mysterious instruments

61
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:42,895
on the face of the earth.

62
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:45,628
The instruments had the
power to churn the oceans

63
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,562
and make the mountains rumble.

64
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,262
They could destroy
anything around them.

65
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:53,162
People called them the
instruments of power,

66
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:55,028
and fearful of its
tremendous danger,

67
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,428
sealed them away forever.

68
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:58,828
Oh, Master Kuno, you must
lock that drum of power

69
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,362
away at once.

70
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:03,295
A great instrument such as
this with a long and spectacular

71
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:06,795
history shouldn't be stored
away in a dingy cellar.

72
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:09,028
I'll use this instrument
for world peace.

73
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:11,628
I'll be responsible
for this drum.

74
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,262
That's exactly what
I was afraid of.

75
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:14,662
What was that?

76
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:15,428
Nothing.

77
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,662
Nothing at all.

78
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:18,128
The more I look at
this drum, the more

79
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,928
it seems to shimmer and
command my continued attention.

80
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,728
And the more I continue
to stare at it,

81
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,595
the more it makes
me want to-- makes

82
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:29,262
me want to-- (SINGING) it makes
me want to shout, come on now!

83
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:30,562
Master Kuno, please.

84
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:33,728
Just teasing.

85
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,895
But on a serious
note, I can't help

86
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,228
but wonder where that other
instrument of power is.

87
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:44,528
How did I get here?

88
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:47,262
Why, I'm in my rose garden.

89
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,795
How on earth?

90
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:58,495
Is it you that I
heard beckoning to me?

91
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:07,762
It's almost as if this lute
is beckoning, beckoning

92
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:11,628
me to play its
strings, as though I

93
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:13,828
need to hear the notes played.

94
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,762
My heart if pounding.

95
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:24,610
What's this?

96
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:33,895
Listen, Sasuke,
I want you to help

97
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:35,795
me find that other
instrument of power

98
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:37,395
no matter how long it takes.

99
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:42,162
Yes, sir/

100
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,228
[chatter]

101
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:48,428
I'm dying.

102
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:50,895
Jeez, my ice melted already.

103
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,562
Quit acting like
such a little wimp.

104
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,095
I'm not.

105
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:56,095
But it ain't fair having to
take courses in the summer.

106
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:57,828
Oh, how can I
sleep at night when

107
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,562
it's possible the
other instrument might

108
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,995
fall into the wrong hands?

109
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:03,662
Hey, Kuno.

110
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:05,828
How it hanging?

111
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:08,662
Trust you, Ranma
Saotome, just when

112
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:10,895
I was thinking about
preserving world peace

113
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:14,095
and saving the
unenlightened masses.

114
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:15,462
How dare you!

115
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:19,395
Huh?

116
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:20,595
What's with the bongo drum?

117
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,395
It's a hand drum not a bongo.

118
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:26,495
And this drum will save the
world from all its suffering.

119
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:27,195
Huh?

120
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:28,262
Kuno baby?

121
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:29,395
So that's with the drum?

122
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:31,428
I think he's going to
play it or something.

123
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:35,028
Fellow students, listen to
the drum bestowed on mankind

124
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:37,928
by the very gods themselves.

125
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:39,095
Yo!

126
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:46,895
Ranma?

127
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:52,628
Hah!

128
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,428
Perhaps now, you
won't underestimate

129
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:55,828
the power of this drum.

130
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:15,495
So this is a powerful,
ancient instrument.

131
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:17,028
You're sure it's not a fake?

132
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:18,028
Of course.

133
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:19,795
This gift was
conferred by the gods

134
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:22,228
upon the intellectual,
brave, and powerful,

135
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,228
yet gentle and
chivalrous, yours truly.

136
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,395
Let's face it, even
the gods themselves

137
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:28,828
make mistakes sometimes.

138
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:32,095
So in other words, that
drum holds powerful secrets,

139
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:32,795
doesn't it?

140
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:33,928
Oh, my Pigtailed Girl.

141
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:35,395
I want that drum too.

142
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:36,428
Please?

143
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:38,328
Pretty please, let me have it.

144
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:39,695
You're adorable.

145
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:42,762
Stooping to a new
low, desperado?

146
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,295
Puh-lease?

147
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:48,328
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Just hand
over the stupid drum, Kuno.

148
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:51,828
So my Pigtailed Girl wants to
hear my hyper drum performance

149
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:52,895
too, does she?

150
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:54,595
Your wish is granted.

151
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,195
I will now demonstrate the drum.

152
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:56,662
Hang on!

153
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,295
Don't.

154
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:57,895
Yo!

155
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:08,028
Ah, yes.

156
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:11,595
My soul is revived by
the sound of its beat.

157
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:12,362
Huh?

158
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,062
What ails you?

159
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:14,528
Are you awake?

160
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:21,762
The way to rouse this beauty
is with a passionate kiss

161
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:24,695
from her prince.

162
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,395
Kick it!

163
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:29,862
[inaudible] there's a trouble
to a man in this school,

164
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,695
no be allowing such behaving.

165
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:34,428
Sweet Congo beans.

166
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:35,762
Me classroom!

167
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:39,528
Somebody better start
doing some 'splaining.

168
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:41,395
What the heck is going on here?

169
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:42,695
He's gonna pay for that.

170
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:47,495
How dare he interrupt
my kiss of love!

171
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:49,495
Take this!

172
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,062
Touch me, son.

173
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:54,562
You know you cannot be bringing
no bongos in the classroom.

174
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:57,062
This is not a bongo drum.

175
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:57,895
Behold!

176
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:58,377
Yo!

177
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,628
What?

178
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:07,828
Oh my god!

179
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:13,428
Oh, no.

180
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:14,995
What have I done?

181
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:17,362
I lost control and struck
the hand drum again.

182
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:21,562
Hmph.

183
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,828
Showed him though.

184
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:26,328
Man, this situation
is way out of control.

185
00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:27,995
Hey, look at the principal.

186
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:28,662
Huh?

187
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:30,228
Cool, yeah.

188
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:32,195
Oh, me precious ukulele.

189
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,228
That's all right.

190
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:56,195
I'm OK.

191
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,062
What happened to him?

192
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:06,228
I've never seen him
look so depressed before.

193
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,728
I get the feeling
that something bad's

194
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,695
about to happen
here at Furinkan.

195
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,362
Something really bad.

196
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:15,328
[laughter]

197
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,023
It's OK.

198
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:36,589
I don't miss it.

199
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:48,123
My poor father.

200
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:49,456
What a tragic sight.

201
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:53,723
What on earth has my
brother done to him?

202
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:55,589
Sasuke.

203
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:56,056
Ma'am?

204
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:57,823
Ma'am?

205
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:59,756
Look at this, Father.

206
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:00,356
Here.

207
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:09,956
Me sweet ukulele.

208
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,789
It be back.

209
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:14,023
Ah, that's not a ukulele, sir.

210
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:14,923
It's a--

211
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:16,523
That's right, Father.

212
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,823
It's a hyper ukulele that can
counter the destructive powers

213
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:20,389
of my brother's hyper drum.

214
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:23,689
This is one ukulele that will
never let you down, Father.

215
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:27,989
Now get back there and challenge
your son like the man you are.

216
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,256
Oh, Kodachi.

217
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:41,323
[laughter]

218
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,589
[murmuring]

219
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:05,856
Strike the drum.

220
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,323
Don't strike the drum.

221
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:12,889
Strike it, and after-- if
I do, if I strike it-- ah!

222
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:13,889
Prepare yourselves!

223
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:16,423
I'm about to strike.

224
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:16,946
Yo!

225
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,589
Kuno really needs
to get a grip.

226
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:25,556
That's the sixth
explosion already today.

227
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:26,256
Come on, Ranma.

228
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:27,756
Do something, will you?

229
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:28,989
Right.

230
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:30,189
Asking me to stop
that's like saying,

231
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:31,889
why don't you swallow
a hand grenade?

232
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:33,056
Gimme a break.

233
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,156
You're the guy who's
always bragging

234
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,923
about how nothing can beat you.

235
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,356
I said "nobody" can.

236
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,489
I didn't say "nothing."

237
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:42,723
Uh-oh.

238
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,523
I've caused yet another
catastrophe with this drum.

239
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:46,523
OK, Kuno.

240
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:47,589
That's enough.

241
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:49,789
The novelty's starting
to wear off here.

242
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,756
[bell]

243
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,656
PRINCIPAL KUNO (ON SPEAKER):
Attention, me lovely students.

244
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,789
I be bringing y'all some
coconut, good, refreshing news.

245
00:14:58,823 --> 00:14:59,823
The principal.

246
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,356
He's back to normal.

247
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,156
We be holding a special event
here at the school today.

248
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:07,223
All students assemble
outside on the double.

249
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,156
Oh, that's some
kinda sad response.

250
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,923
Make it simmer.

251
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,156
Make it boil.

252
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:27,989
Whoo!

253
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,489
It's sweltering out here.

254
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:31,456
Now get on with your event
and let us get back inside.

255
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:37,223
Cockroach no business in a
foul fight, and you no business

256
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:41,156
putting down the ukulele master.

257
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,189
Hey, I've seen
that symbol before.

258
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:45,123
This be your lucky
day, me boy, cause

259
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:47,489
this be the day you
hear me new ukulele.

260
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:51,889
Wait.

261
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:55,023
That's a lute, not a ukulele.

262
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:56,723
This not be a lute.

263
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,456
This a ukulele.

264
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,989
Listen, keiki, you hear
the ukulele bestowed

265
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,189
by the gods themselves.

266
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:04,423
Wait a second.

267
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,123
I've heard that line
somewhere before.

268
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:09,089
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

269
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:09,689
Uh-oh.

270
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,989
This stinking mackerel
be set out to dry.

271
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,423
Now, me lovely students.

272
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,756
Pull up a seat and
let's be a jamming.

273
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:35,323
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

274
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:42,856
The principal has an
instrument of destruction too.

275
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:45,689
Ranma.

276
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:46,489
What?

277
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:49,256
Hey, where'd all my fans go?

278
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:01,523
So, you were the one
who had the audacity

279
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:03,689
to steal the other
instrument of power.

280
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:08,523
--[shout] Me be waiting for you,
keiki, so stop the cowballing,

281
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:10,823
and fight like the
man, not the monkey.

282
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:11,823
Right.

283
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,189
I'll accept your challenge.

284
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:17,423
And I'll show you
who's the master.

285
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:19,989
I, Tatewaki Kuno,
will not allow you

286
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,756
to bully weaklings such as this.

287
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,256
Huh?

288
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,689
That better not be me you're
calling a weakling, Kuno.

289
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:26,289
Yo!

290
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,723
Ranma!

291
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:33,123
Yo, [shout].

292
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:34,889
You be harming the
weak nanny goat you

293
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,089
claiming you want to protect.

294
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,623
Who you calling
a weak nanny goat?

295
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:39,756
Be silent, man.

296
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,456
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

297
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:47,256
Does Ranma think he's
helping here or what?

298
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:49,356
Now you've gone too far.

299
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:51,989
All right, you brazen
defiler of all traditions,

300
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,589
come at me with all your might.

301
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:56,389
Me ukulele against
your little bongo drum?

302
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:59,123
Let's see who's
got the most power.

303
00:17:59,156 --> 00:17:59,989
It's not a bongo.

304
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:00,889
It's a hand drum.

305
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:02,789
Yo!

306
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:06,689
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

307
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:08,989
I've had enough of this!

308
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,823
Yo!

309
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

310
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:14,723
Well, it looks like Ranma's
on his own this time.

311
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:18,356
Yeah, but why do they have
to take it out on him for?

312
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,723
Oh, my poor, sweet,
darling Ranma.

313
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:22,689
Kodachi?

314
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:24,756
How about explaining
what's going on?

315
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:26,689
Yo!

316
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:29,656
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

317
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:31,723
It all started when
I saw how devastated

318
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:34,423
my father was after losing
his beloved ukulele.

319
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:36,723
I thought that I'd give
him that ancient hyper lute

320
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:38,456
to replace it, that's all.

321
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,756
But I never thought
it'd come to this.

322
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,156
So you're the one who's
behind all of this.

323
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:47,989
Oh, Ranma darling,
this is all my fault.

324
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:49,289
Prepare yourself.

325
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:52,856
I'll destroy you for
the sake of world peace.

326
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:54,189
Fine, me soldier man.

327
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:57,389
You be going down first
for the sake of peace.

328
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,156
World peace, my butt.

329
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:01,389
Why don't they work on a
little family peace first?

330
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:02,823
Forget about world peace.

331
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:04,589
We've gotta help Ranma.

332
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,089
Mistress Kodachi.

333
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:07,356
Sasuke?

334
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:08,689
I've been reading
about these instruments.

335
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:10,989
I think I found out how
to put a stop to them.

336
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:12,523
Seriously?

337
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:14,456
According to this text, it
says the power of the instrument

338
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,289
should diminish if
you find a greater

339
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,023
sound that will overwhelm them.

340
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,656
Yeah?

341
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:21,589
Where are we gonna
find something louder

342
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:24,156
than those things?

343
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:25,489
I know.

344
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:27,423
Akane, we're going
to need your help.

345
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:30,323
Wh-- what do you need me for?

346
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:33,989
Um, Nabiki, what's the
deal with this mic here?

347
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:35,223
Just relax.

348
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:36,956
We're going to get
you to yell and blow

349
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,223
those instruments away.

350
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:39,756
Hey, why do I have
to be the one up here?

351
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:42,489
Cause you've got the loudest
voice of anyone in this school.

352
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,589
Come on, Sis, do
it for the kids.

353
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:45,556
Do it for Ranma.

354
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,056
Why should I have
to save Ranma?

355
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:48,889
Look, it's Ranma.

356
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:52,223
He got out of there.

357
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:53,823
Oh, Ranma.

358
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:55,856
You must be in agony.

359
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:57,489
Ranma, you've gotta stop this.

360
00:19:57,523 --> 00:19:59,056
Just leave those two alone.

361
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,789
Snap out of it, Ranma darling.

362
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:03,489
You're our only hope for
stopping them and saving

363
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:04,256
the school.

364
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,723
Get your hands off of him.

365
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:08,089
You started it, so you
should be the one to stop it.

366
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,589
Butt out and leave
this between us men.

367
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,423
Ranma, I've got an
idea that might--

368
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:15,556
What's a weakling like
you gonna do to stop them?

369
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,189
I've had all I'm gonna
take from those two.

370
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:19,956
I know I can finish them off.

371
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,823
I know you can too, darling.

372
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:23,123
Hey, Kodachi.

373
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,456
When did you show up?

374
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,123
Whoa, hey, watch the hands!

375
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,756
The hands!

376
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:29,889
Uh-oh.

377
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:31,356
Akane's starting
to see red again.

378
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:33,323
I've been worried sick
about you being thrown around

379
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:37,989
like a rag doll, and this is
how you choose to repay me?

380
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,489
Now's your chance.

381
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:40,223
Let it rip.

382
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:45,556
Ranma!

383
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:47,923
Ranma!

384
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,523
You jerk!

385
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,189
What did you say?

386
00:20:59,223 --> 00:20:59,789
She did it.

387
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:18,023
Oh me god.

388
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:19,889
Good lord, that awful sound.

389
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:21,256
What could it have been?

390
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:31,789
I'm beat.

391
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,857
[theme song]

392
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,573
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
A mysterious dog

393
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,873
that Ryoga meets in the
mountains and a special letter

394
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:20,407
delivered to Akane.

395
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,940
Next time on "Ranma
1/2," "A Ninja's Dog

396
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:24,073
is Black and White."

397
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:25,440
We'll see you there.
