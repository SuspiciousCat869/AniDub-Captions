What's this, another dream?

RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
Maybe it's a sign.

I can't seem to beat Ranma.

16
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:30,600
Akane got no idea
how I feel about her.

17
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,233
I'm so sick of this body of
mine, I had to leave town.

18
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,433
Outside it's pouring rain.

19
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,600
Ranma and Akane are
probably living it up.

20
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,533
And I'm stuck in here by myself.

21
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:46,133
I just don't get it.

22
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,566
Can it be she really loves him?

23
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,366
How can she though?

24
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:55,033
The way they're always
fighting-- I bet she doesn't.

25
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,700

looked at him that one time.

-Guess he forgot what
he was going to say.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,441

OK?!

42
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,500
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
She's been trying

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
to kill me all this
time so I never noticed,

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,133
but Shampoo really
is kind of cute.

45
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:52,933
Gee, if only Akane
were that nice.

-Ryoga, why'd you do that?

48
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,500
-You know, watching Akane
get jealous over a jerk

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,133
like you really makes me sick.

50
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:05,674
-What?!

51
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:09,766
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
How can she love him

52
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,500
when it's so obvious
he doesn't deserve her?

53
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,966
When I think of the things
that jerk's put me through--

54
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:19,433
-Hm?

55
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:19,974
What?

56
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,433
-Ranma, prepare to die!

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,441
-Huh?

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,833
--[chuckles] I found
you, Ranma Saotome.

59

-You know this guy?

60
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,566
-I feel as though
I've been waiting

61
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,600
for this moment for
thousands of years.

62
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,100
Why didn't you
come to the fight?

63
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:56,033
-But I-- Ryoga, I waited
for you at the agreed place

64
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:58,000
for three whole days.

65
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,833
-Three days?

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,633
-Oh, sure, you
waited three days.

67
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,700
But when I got there
on the fourth day,

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,333
you already turned tail and ran.

69
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,100
-Fourth day?

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,300
-Ryoga, let me ask
you a question.

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,300
Tell me if I'm wrong,
but the place where

72
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,500
we agreed to meet
for the fight, it

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,400
was in the vacant lot
behind your house, right?

74
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,400
So why the heck did I have
to wait three days for you

75
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,133
to show?

76
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:35,933
-Don't patronize me!

77
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,300
Do you think I
was just strolling

78
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,166
around Japan for my health?

79
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,000
-So what were you doing?

80
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,033
-Listen, you have absolutely no
idea the troubles I've endured.

81
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:51,233
Ranma Saotome, today is
the day I shall break you!

82
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:04,766
-What?

83
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,033
No, this is Enoshima.

84
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,266
-No, you idiot, this is Asaksa.

85
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,533
Can't you read a map?

86
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:13,566
-Where did they move
that cursed lot?

87
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,700
-What are you, nuts?

88
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,000
-You gotta be kidding,
this is Yokohama.

--[panting] I finally--

00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,600
Damn you, Ranma Saotome!

wasn't the worst of it.

Not only does he blow
off my challenge,

96
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:42,966
he goes running to China.

97
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:46,833
And then me, stupid me, like
a moron goes off chasing him.

98
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:49,200
Oh, that was when the
real tragedy started.

99
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:52,433
Oh, if only I'd known.

100
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,666

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,266
-Who are you?

168
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,200
-What's the matter?

169
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,666
That-- that fellow
yelled so loud,

170
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,566
I thought he was being
murdered or something.

171
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,666
-That was maybe just
a little too hot.

172
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,000
-Man, who the heck are you?

173
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:05,900
-I kind of got lost and I
thought I'd spend the night.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,233
Why do you ask?

175
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,966
MAN 1: Oh, well, uh, heck of
a storm out there, ain't it?

176
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,066
Why, I never seen a--

177
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,033
-Get to the point!

178
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,900
MAN 1: You ain't
seen a pig, has you?

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,033
RYOGA: Why do you ask?

180
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:17,266
-You didn't go in
at it, did you?

181
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,366
-Are you saying that
I'd eat my own friend?

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,333
I'd, uh, kind of
like to go to bed

183
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,566
now, so if you wouldn't mind--

184
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:28,366
MAN 1: Dang, could have sworn
that little runt was in there.

185
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,200
MAN 2: Maybe it done run away.

186
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,366
MAN 3: Of course it
ran away, you moron.

187
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,633
Didn't we just say runaway pig?

188
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,566
-[squealing]

189
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,366
-Close call, huh?

190
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,100
Whoa, hey, cut it out.

191
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,066
What are you doing?

192
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,266
I'm saving my first
kiss for Akane.

193
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:52,533
I didn't just say what
I think I said, did I?

194
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:54,874
Oh, Akane!

195
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,133
-Come back here,
you little runt.

196
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,533
Do you think you're the
only one who's suffering?

197
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,466
Oh, you scratched
me, you little beast.

198
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,266
You ruined my
perfect complexion.

199
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,100
-Ranma!

200
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,333
What do you think you're doing?

201
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,000
-Oh, you little coward.

202
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,366
Look at you, hiding
behind Akane.

203
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:11,833
-Ranma!

204
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,800
-[growling] [squealing]

205
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,200
-Little runt.

206
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,566
-Stop it!

207
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,107
-Hey!

208
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,866
-Are you OK?

209
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,200
Oh, he's scared.

210
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,133
Poor baby.

211
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,133
Come on, let's go.

212
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:36,900
-Just hold it.

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,933
Where are you going?

214
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:39,466
-We are going to bed.

215
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,433
-But you can't.

216
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,733
He's a-- that pig is a--

217
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,566
-Well, go on.

218
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,800
-He's a-- he's not really a--

219
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
-Don't worry, baby.

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,833
I won't leave you
with that nasty Ranma.

221
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,533
Be a good boy and
stop crying, OK?

222
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,400
-[gasp]

223
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:56,941
-What?

224
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,533
-I don't believe this.

225
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,400
Keep your stupid baby.

226
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,766
See if I care.

227
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:08,200
-At this rate though, I'll
probably never be able to--

228
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,700
AKANE: God, you're such a jerk.

229
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,966
All I did was worry about you.

230
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,800
RANMA: I'm a guy, I have
to take care of myself.

231
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,300
AKANE: How can you call yourself
a guy with a body like that?

232
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,733
I don't even know
why I bother to--

233
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,233
-What the--

234
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,666
-Oh, watch out.

235
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,600
-Let me go.

236
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,033
-I ain't holding you because
I like you or nothing.

237
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:28,574
-Get real.

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,041
-Ah!

239
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:39,333
-If I'm such a bother to you,
then why don't you just-- ugh!

240
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,766
-Oh!

241
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,733
-Ignore me, will you?

242
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,274
-Butt out!

243
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,241
Akane.

244
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:54,233
-I, uh, I mean,
I-- I'm sor-- uh.

245
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,300
-Don't bother.

246
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,500
I-- I really couldn't care less.

247
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
I want nothing to do with you.

248
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,166
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): I can't blame
Ranma for everything, though.

249
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,133
Oh, Akane, why can't
I just-- or you.

250
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,466
Why can't we--

251
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:28,933
[gasp]

252
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:43,448
There, I did it again!

253
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,982
I didn't mean too, but it's--
it's like my fingers are trying

254
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:51,782
to tell me something, something
I'm just to chicken to-- like

255
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:53,748
that other time up
in the mountains.

256
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,682
-OK, any time.

257
00:13:57,782 --> 00:13:59,248
-All right, prepare yourself.

258
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,248
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Not with
the eyes, but with the mind.

259
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:14,148
See with the mind's eye.

260
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:14,689
-Yeah.

261
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,748
-Nice try, sonny boy.

262
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,182
-No way, I felt it!

263
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:33,082
-If you'd just clear your
mind like I told you,

264
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:34,348
you'd be able to do it.

265
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,282
-Oh no, now you listen up.

266
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:37,915
The only thing that's
on my mind right

267
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:40,082
now is how I'm going
to defeat Ranma.

268
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:41,848
My mind is absolutely clear.

269
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:48,848
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): It's true,
Akane's been in my heart

270
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:50,082
from the very beginning.

271
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,748
But I can't blame her for
my getting distracted.

272
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,748
That's something I've got
to figure out on my own.

273
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:58,348
Like the time Moose and I
were teaming up on Ranma,

274
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,248
all I could think about
was how big of a jerk

275
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,548
Ranma was being to poor Akane.

276
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:04,048
-You couldn't have
been hiding this!

277
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:05,415
It's too big!

278
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:07,415
-I'm not called the master of
hidden weapons for nothing.

279
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:08,015
Take this!

280
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:11,148
-No, Ranma.

281
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,115
Take this!

282
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:17,615
[screaming]

283
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:19,115
-[scream]

284
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:21,015
-Now you've really made me mad!

285
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:22,382
[grunting]

286
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:28,615
-But I thought you
were weaker as a girl!

287
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,015
-You've never heard
of adrenaline?

288
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:31,648
Eat it!

289
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:34,082
-You caught me by surprise
last time, that's all.

290
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:37,482
Let's see you deal with a box
eye tenketsu breaking point.

291
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:39,148
-Run for it, Ryoga!

292
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:41,815
That cannon ball you're standing
next to is really a time bomb.

293
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:42,948
It's gonna blow!

294
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:43,489
Run!

295
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:46,415
-It's heavy!

296
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,848
Somebody, help me!

297
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:52,782
Hey, come on!

298
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:55,248
You stupid scaredy cats!

299
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:56,715
Oh, no, you don't.

300
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:01,915
-You can't use my
own chain against me.

301
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:03,315
No fair!

302
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:04,748
-Time to reel you in.

303
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:08,315
So tell me, do you
want to find that key,

304
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:09,982
or do you want to die?

305
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:10,848
-Find it!

306
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:11,582
I want to find it.

307
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:15,115
It's gone!

308
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,548
-What do you mean, it's gone?

309
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:18,982
-Look harder, idiot!

310
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:20,448
-That-- that-- that tickles.

311
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:28,382
-I found it!

312
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,815
Gee, that was close.

313
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,315
-P-chan, where are you?

314
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:36,489
-Akane!

315
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:37,648
-Akane!

316
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,548
-Oh, P-chan, where can you be?

317
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:40,548
P-chan!

318
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:42,482
-No, Akane!

319
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:43,415
-Akane, run!

320
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:44,415
Akane, don't go near it!

321
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:45,382
-It's gonna blow!

322
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:45,923
Run away!

323
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:46,423
-Ranma!

324
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:46,935
And Ryoga!

325
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:49,082
-Akane, run!

326
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,515
-Just shut up and come with me.

327
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:51,082
-Why?

328
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:51,982
Why should I?

329
00:16:58,482 --> 00:16:59,348
A bomb?

330
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:00,948
I don't have time for jokes.

331
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:02,848
I'm worried about
my poor P-chan.

332
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:03,648
-Forget P-chan.

333
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:04,582
We gotta go!

334
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:07,482
-Akane, P-chan's fine.

335
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:08,948
-Why should I believe you?

336
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:11,215
He's fine, I tell
you-- just fine.

337
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:12,248
-But I--

338
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,582
-Why do you gotta
be so darn stubborn?

339
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:15,982
-What did you say?

340
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:18,882
-Stubborn as a mule, twice
as ugly, just as strong.

341
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:21,082
-I don't have to say here
and take this kind of abuse

342
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:21,682
from you.

343
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:22,682
That's it.

344
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,115
I'm going home!

00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:36,182
-Uh, you weren't kidding.

347
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:37,148
-Maybe even stubborner.

RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Ah, that's
what I always do, isn't it?

350
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:52,915
At the last minute,
let Ranma get away.

351
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:54,782
If I were a better
martial artist,

352
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:56,848
I'd be able to control
myself, stop getting

353
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:59,348
distracted during fights
with Ranma every time

354
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,382
Akane's smile comes
up in my mind.

355
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:07,182
Can it be my feelings for Akane
are what's keeping me back?

356
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:11,582
The way I want to
hurt Ranma, the way

357
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:15,848
I feel about Akane-- that's it!

358
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:16,982
I've decided.

359
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:19,248
Until the day I can
beat, Ranma, I just

360
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,648
won't let myself
think about her.

361
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:21,782
That's all.

362
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:24,548
And then when I do, when
that day finally comes,

363
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:26,015
then I'll go to her.

364
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,715
And then I'll-- without
fear, without regret--

365
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:33,248
then on that day, I'll tell her
how I really feel about her.

366
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:34,248
-I'm ready.

367
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,548
Thanks for waiting.

368
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,089
Ryoga?

[giggles]

00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:42,715
Bet you thought I'd
never come out, huh?

00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,982
-Oh no, I-- uh, well, I-- uh--

372
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:48,715
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): This
has got to be a dream.

373
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:51,748
Why else would she-- that is
unless she kind of, sort of

374
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:53,148
likes me too.

375
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:53,689
-Stupid!

00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:54,189
Stupid!

00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:54,689
Stupid!

00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:55,197
Stupid!

379
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:55,656
Stupid!

380
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:57,615
-What?

381
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:58,715
Ryoga, what's--

382
00:18:58,815 --> 00:18:59,615
-That didn't hurt.

383
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:01,648
That means it is a dream.

384
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:07,515
[grunts] That one
hurt a little bit.

385
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,382
It really is real then.

386
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:14,448
-Uh, uh, let's get
out of here, Ryoga.

387
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:15,148
-Sure.

-What matter, Ryoga?

389
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:17,915
You no want kiss me?

-Of course, but--

-OK, now close eye.

-He fell for it!

395
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:41,282
-This wouldn't be
a date, would it?

396
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:42,482
-Sure is.

397

-Yes!

398
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:46,015
So where do you
want me to take you?

-I don't-- don't know.

-OK, that's what
the guides here for.

Let's go to a movie.

RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Oh, Akane,
thank you for that day.

405
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:00,615
I may not see you for a while.

406
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,548
I'm going to go even
further into the mountains

407
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:03,815
and train like there's no--

408

-Say, you feel like
taking a-- huh?

409
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,915
Where'd it go?

410
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:12,382
Hey, little pig, where'd you go?

411
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:14,315
Oh well, guess
the danger's over.

412
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:16,048
I've rested long enough.

413
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:16,915
Time to go.

414
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,715
That's strange, I guess I
must have taken a wrong turn.

are you doing here?

-Way to go.

You should have
said something, man.

You were leaving town because
of your new girlfriend.

got it all wrong.
