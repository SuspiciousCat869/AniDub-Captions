-Did you hear?

9
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:55,802
Last night there was a sighting.

10
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:56,902
-What kind of sighting?

11
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:00,168
-This kind, of course.

12
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,102
-Oh, please.

13
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,602
Grow up, will ya, Akane?

The next thing I know, you'll
be saying there's a tooth fairy.

-Hey, you never know.

00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:10,035
I mean, a lot stranger things
have been known to happen.

17
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:11,202
-That's right.

Compared to boys
who turn into girls,

ghosts don't seem so weird.

-Hey, don't get personal.

21
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,302
-Well, there is that
story about Furinkan

22
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,568
being built on an
Indian graveyard.

23
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,768
-I heard back in samurai
days it was a prison.

24
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,768
-I heard back when
school was being

25
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:26,668
built, lots of kids
used to get hurt pretty

This is our school.

30
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:35,568
We've got to do something.

31
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:37,002
-What kind of something?

32
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:38,035
-Ha.

33
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,235
Something like ghost
busting, you mean?

34
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:41,502
-Something exactly like that.

35
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:43,268
Let's all meet
here later tonight.

36
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:45,602
People who want to come
along, raise your hand.

00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:46,335
-Count me in!

38
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,902
-Me, too!

39
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:48,602
-So will I!

This ain't the

-What are you writing, Ukyo?

43
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,002
-Hm?

44
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:56,568
Well, ghost busting's
pretty hard work, right?

45
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:59,002
I'm thinking of making
some okonomiyaki.

46
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:00,202
-That's a great idea!

47
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:01,668
Maybe I'll come after all.

48
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:03,068
-You do that, sugar.

49
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,835
Heck, I'll even
give you a discount.

50
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:05,968
-You mean I gotta pay?

51
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:07,502
-Gee, why aren't I surprised?

52
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:08,735
-You know how it is.

53
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:12,768
Single girl on her own's
gotta make a living somehow.

00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,202
-Ghost busting, you say?

55
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:15,435
How exciting.

56
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:18,535
-While they're at it, shame
they can't bust up some

57
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:19,735
monsters, as well.

58
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:22,368
-Hear, hear.

59
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:24,802
-Hit me.

60
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:25,735
-Yes, sir.

61
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:26,968
-What's that again
about a monster?

62
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,435
-My, what a monstrous
appetite you have.

63
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,835
-The better to
feed yourself with.

64
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:32,735
-You got it, buster!

65
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,468
How else am I gonna
store up enough energy

66
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:37,202
to go ghost busting
with Ranma tonight?

67
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:40,435
-I don't remember inviting you.

68
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:43,368
-There are going to be
girls there tonight, right?

69
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:44,968
-Sure, I guess.

70
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:45,668
-Hoo hoo!

71
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:46,902
Better take a nap, then.

72
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:48,235
Gotta be fresh for the ladies.

73
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,735
-Is that all he
ever thinks about?

74
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:57,202
-You don't really believe
in ghosts, do you?

75
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:59,235
-But Kasumi, there's
so much evidence.

76
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,502
Even a reliable witness
like the school janitor

77
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,002
says he saw
something that night.

78
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,068
And we still don't know how
all those windows got broken.

79
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:09,268
-So, are you two heroes
just being shy, or what?

80
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:15,735
-Perish the thought, eh, Tendo?

81
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:17,502
-Why on Earth would
we have to bust ghosts

82
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:18,702
when there's Ranma and Akane?

83
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,502
-So you're not scared?

84
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:25,502
-Sc-sc-sc-scared?

85
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:26,635
-Oh, silly me.

86
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:28,568
What do I know anyway, right?

87
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:30,668
And here I thought it
would be such a good way

88
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:34,235
to get publicity
for the dojo, too.

89
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,802
-Why, that's a great idea.

90
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,635
Good girl!

91
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:37,735
What do you think, Saotome?

92
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:39,068
Isn't that great?

93
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,535
-S-Saotome?

94
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,902
You'll come with me,
won't you, Saotome?

95
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:51,335
You'll come, won't you?

96
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,768
You will come, won't you?

97
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:55,702
You will come, right?

98
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:56,243
Right?

99
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,102
-OK.

100
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:03,802
The x's mark all known
locations of the alleged ghost.

101
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,768
A thorough investigation
was conducted

102
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:08,702
at each site, including where
the janitor was attacked.

103
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,768
However, a lack of
correlating data

104
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:12,368
leads us to only one conclusion.

105
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,968
We have no idea what
the ghost is up to.

106
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:31,702
-I've got a bad
feeling about this.

107

[scream]

108
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:33,835
-Quit that!

109
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,502
-Quit what?

110
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,502
I didn't do nothin'.

111
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:36,435
Why'd you hit me?

112
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:38,735
-You just grabbed
me, you pervert!

113
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:39,902
-It wasn't me.

114
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:41,168
-I see.

115
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,035
-Come here, babe, and
jump into my arms.

116
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:46,035
And allow me to soothe the
savage beating of your breasts.

117
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:46,835
-Beat this.

118
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:48,702
-Listen up, playtime's over.

119
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:50,668
Are we ready to kick some butt?

120
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:52,402
-Oh, yeah.

121
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:54,335
-Rather than tromping
around in a big group

122
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:58,868
and scaring off the ghost, let's
split up into smaller teams.

123
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,702
-I'll just go with
these girls here.

124
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:01,768
-Eek!

125
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:02,902
-No you don't.

126
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,235
I ain't taking no
chances with you, gramps.

127
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:04,776
-No fair!

128
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:05,868
No fair!

129
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,668
-Heads up, everybody.

130
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,535
Let's show them
what we're made of.

131
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:25,402
-Walking around the
school at night is creepy.

132
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,902
-If there really are ghosts
here, I wish they'd come out,

133
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:28,868
already.

134
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:32,802
Man, I'm so bored
I could scream.

135
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:35,768
[screaming]

136
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:36,309
-Downstairs!

137
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:36,809
-Come on!

138
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:42,109
Huh?

139
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:46,902
-Are you OK?

140
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:48,535
Hang in there.

141
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,502
-What the--

142
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,302
-It's a shotput sliced in half.

143
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:54,068
Look, the cut's so clean.

144
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:57,668
There's something out there.

145
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,735
-Ranma?

146
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,768
-Saotome, look at the wounds.

147
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:02,602
It's almost like
he was windburned.

148
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:04,035
-Yeah, but by what?

149
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:04,568
-It's here!

150
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:09,035
Please, you gotta help me!

151
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:10,602
-Hey, you're from our class.

152
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:11,568
-What happened?

153
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:13,035
Did you see?

154
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:17,335
-It's here, I tell you!

155
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:19,302
-Who's there?

156
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:21,302
He's from our class, too.

157
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:22,768
-It's here!

158
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:26,868
-Did you guys hear that?

159
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:27,802
-Good.

160
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:29,368
It's about time we
saw some action.

161
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:33,168
-Speaking of action,
where's the old man?

162
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:33,935
-There!

163
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:35,135
I bet that's where he is!

164
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:47,935
-Now wait a sec.

165
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:48,735
Ah-ha!

166
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:49,568
I knew it!

167
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,368
They're wrapped in toilet paper.

168
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:53,868
Why are they wrapped
in toilet paper?

169
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,402
-Ranma.

170
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,768
That's another three down.

171
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:58,602
-Coward!

172
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,168
Come out!

173
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:02,735
If you're so tough,
what are you hiding for?

174
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,468
You coward!

175
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:05,935
Kay, then.

176
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,368
If you won't come to
me, I'll come to you.

177
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:25,035
-Two grown men are hunting
ghosts like a couple of kids.

178
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:27,902
What nonsense, eh, Saotome?

179
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,102
-You said it, Tendo.

180
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:30,643
-Huh?

181
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:34,702
-What's that?

182
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:37,668
-The wind, probably.

183
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:38,209
-Huh?

184
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:55,402
[screaming]

185
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:55,943
-Huh?

186
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,568
Why, it's just a model skeleton.

187
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,068
Don't be afraid.

188
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:09,002
[screaming]

189
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:09,802
-Huh?

190
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,635
It was just a specimen, Tendo.

191
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:15,035
Nothing for a grown man
like you to be afraid of.

192
00:10:15,135 --> 00:10:18,268
-It's not nice to fool with
science projects, Saotome.

193
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:18,809
-Hm?

194
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:24,935
-S-Saotome?

195
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:27,635
-Just pretend you don't see it.

196
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,968
-I'd say we've checked
this floor enough for now.

197
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:30,935
How about you, Saotome?

198
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:31,835
-I'm with you, Tendo.

199
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:32,802
I'm with you.

200
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:34,602
[scream]

201
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,268
-Why am I wishing
I didn't hear that?

202
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:37,235
-Hear what?

203
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:38,668
-That's our cue.

204
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:39,635
-Let's go.

205
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:46,143
-Huh?

206
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:50,302
-Dad!

207
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:53,102
-What the heck could've
done with to them?

208
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:54,068
[howling]

209
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:55,868
[screaming]

210
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,202
-It's Hiroshi and Daisuke.

211
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:05,168
Oh, goodie.

212
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,902
This means we're
the only ones left.

213
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,668
What?

214
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,135
-Ranma.

215
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,135
It's coming from inside the gym.

216
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:17,864
Ranma?

217
00:11:59,123 --> 00:11:59,956
-Ha ha ha!

218
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,589
Scared ya, didn't I?

219
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,589
-How dare you sneak up on me!

220
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,823
You practically gave
me a heart attack!

221
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:09,223
Why, you little-- This ain't
no time for playing around!

222
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:15,623
Here it comes.

223
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:16,164
Wah!

224
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:23,823
-Ha ha ha!

225
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:25,056
Oh, poor little Ranma.

226
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:27,489
But hey, since you're
in the body for it--

227
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:28,289
-You little freak.

228
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,156
Admit it, why don't ya?

229
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:31,356
There's no ghost here.

230
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:32,489
Only you.

231
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:34,289
-And why would I want
to haunt a high school

232
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,156
when I can stage panty raid?

233
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,689
If you didn't want me to
come, why didn't you say so?

234
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:41,356
-I did say so.

235
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:42,856
-Maybe you did,
but would it have

236
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,856
killed you to let me tag along?

237
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:48,589
-Cut it out, will ya?

238
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,656
Huh?

239
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:52,556
-Ranma, the ghost is here!

240
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:53,356
-You see?

241
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:54,456
I told you it wasn't me.

242
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,923
Put this on, and
I'll forgive ya.

243
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,889
-Don't you ever quit?

244
00:12:58,989 --> 00:12:59,856
-Put it on.

245
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:00,856
Put it on!

246
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:01,823
-Put this on!

247
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:16,123
-Akane!

248
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:19,556
[shout]

249
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:20,097
-Huh?

250
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,089
Uchan.

251
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:30,289
This was a family heirloom hand
forged by the great Masamune

252
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,089
himself.

253
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:37,223
Why didn't the ghost just
kill me while he was at it?

254
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:38,689
-Cry over your spatula later.

255
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:41,156
Right now I think
it's coming this way!

256
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:41,697
Let's go!

257
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,223
-Ranma, you little ingrate.

258
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:52,523
And after all I've
done for you, too.

259
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,923
You'd better not
come crying to me

260
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:55,556
when that ghost shows up again.

261
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:56,456
Hello.

262
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:58,223
Nice underwire.

263
00:13:58,323 --> 00:13:59,189
Oh, pshew.

264
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:01,623
That's not a bra.

265
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:02,556
I knew it.

266
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:05,189
It's a fencing helmet!

267
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:08,089
Should have known no bra
could smell that bad.

268
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:09,423
Phew!

269
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:12,023
There's nothing like the scent
of a man to make you sick.

270
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:23,389
-I'll stop him for sure tonight.

271
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:36,389
-How am I supposed to fix this?

272
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:39,189
Good spatulas don't just
grow on trees, you know?

273
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,823
-Less chance of that
ghost ambushing us here.

274
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,456
Wish he'd hurry up
and come already.

275
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:45,889
-But Ranma, what
if it doesn't come?

276
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:49,723
-Just the three of us left
here-- how can I stay away?

277
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,223
-I've got a question.

278
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,423
-Huh?

279
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,223
-Do you think I'll still
be able to cook with this?

280
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:55,223
-Excuse me?

281
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:06,956
-Not too subtle, is he?

282
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,789
-Talk about making an entrance.

283
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:19,823
-Why, you--

284
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:21,789
-Uchan, look out!

285
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,289
[scream]

286
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,289
-Uchan!

287
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:27,256
-That's it!

288
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:35,723
Here goes!

289
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:42,989
-If it ain't Sasuke--

290
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:43,789
-Please.

291
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,956
Please, be merciful to him.

292
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:47,456
-What do you mean, to him?

293
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,256
Kuno?

294
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,556
-You mean that he's the ghost?

295
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:00,589
-Sad but true.

296
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:03,623
And it's all my own fault.

297
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:05,423
-You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

298
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:09,856
How dare you pretend to be a
ghost and jerk us all around?

299
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:10,856
Take this!

300
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:18,264
-Yah!

301
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:26,323
-Ranma!

302
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:28,256
-Master Kuno, please forgive me.

303
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:40,656
-When did Kuno get so
good, all of a sudden?

304
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:43,489
-Ah, but he isn't Master Kuno.

305
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:45,189
He's Miyamoto Musashi.

306
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:47,356
-Miyamoto Musashi?

307
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:48,223
-None other.

308
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,689
It all started a week ago.

309
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:53,889
It took place in the room
they use for the kendo club.

310
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,223
As was his usual
custom, Master Kuno

311
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,156
was immersed in deep meditation.

312
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:01,123
-The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo?

313
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:04,056
The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo?

314
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,323
The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo?

315
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:08,723
The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo?

316
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:11,623
The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo?

317
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:14,989
The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo?

318
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:15,530
Ah!

319
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:24,689
-M-master Kuno.

320
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:30,723
-Akane Tendo or
the pigtailed girl?

321
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:33,523
-Master Kuno?

322
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:36,656
-Where on Earth did you
get that ugly stick?

323
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:37,223
Oh!

324
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,689
I take it back!

325
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,556
Sasuke, tell me
where you found this.

326
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:42,889
-Yes, master.

327
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:45,623
It was found hidden in the
ceiling of the kendo club dojo.

328
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:49,723
-Can it be the very same bokto
carved by the great Musash

329
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,956
himself from the oar used
during his legendary journey?

330
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:56,889
Can it be that the
old legends are true?

331
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:57,656
-Legends, my lord?

332
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:00,456
What sort of legends?

333
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,056
-Once, dear Sasuke,
there was said

334
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:05,023
to be a kendo instructor who
purloined funds from the club

335
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:08,023
treasury, using them to purchase
a legendary wooden sword,

336
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:11,056
or a bokto, from
an antiques dealer.

337
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,956
And all this time
it's been hidden

338
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,589
in the ceiling of the dojo.

339
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,023
-I-- I don't understand.

340
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:16,856
-Ha!

341
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,889
Of course you don't, my friend.

342
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:23,689
Fortunately, dear
Sasuke, I am not you.

343
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,123
I am to be the new Miyamoto
Musashi, don't you see?

344
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:28,789
As if it weren't
already obvious enough,

345
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:33,089
this bokto is all
the proof I need!

346
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:34,556
[shout]

347
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,489
-M-- Master Kuno!

348
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:38,923
-I feel the need for violence.

349
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,689
The energy is out of control.

350
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:46,323
-Master Kuno!

351
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:46,864
No!

352
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:52,523
Master Kuno hasn't
been himself since.

353
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:55,523
He vanishes during the
day, only to reappear

354
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:59,189
at night, when he prowls
the halls of his school,

355
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:01,489
like a ghost.

356
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:02,889
Poor Master Kuno.

357
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:05,523
He's possessed by
the vengeful spirit

358
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:08,589
of Miyamoto Musashi
inside that cursed sword.

359
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,156
-I wouldn't be surprised
if that bokto and Kuno

360
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:13,456
were on the same wavelength.

361
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:17,223
-I'm sure Kuno didn't fight too
hard when the sword took over.

362
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,723
-You know, I hate to say it, but
we've got to help the guy out.

363
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:22,056
-Yes.

364
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:25,689
That's what I want to do, too,
but I've run out of ideas.

365
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,456
-He was too much for you, huh?

366
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:28,289
-I'll say.

367
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:31,689
He's beaten me 35 times already.

368
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:34,089
-You've really been trying, huh?

369
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:35,523
-For all the good it's done me.

370
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:44,089
-Prepare to taste
the wrath of 1,500

371
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:46,389
years of Japanese history!

372
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,389
Prepare to die!

373
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:51,623
-We both know that
ain't you talking.

374
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,956
It's that dumb sword.

375
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:54,456
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

376
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:02,889
-Otsu, you've come back to me.

377
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:03,423
-Otsu?

378
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,356
-You know, Otsu.

379
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,723
As in Musashi's
long lost lady love.

380
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,523
-Lady Otsu, my love, my life.

381
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,323
Come let us live
together as man and wife.

382
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:14,789
[scream]

383
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,230
-Huh?

384
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:38,223
-Ha ha ha!

385
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:39,189
What a haul!

386
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:40,156
What a haul!

387
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,023
-The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo.

388
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:54,723
The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo.

389
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,956
The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo.

390
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,756
The pigtailed girl
or Akane Tendo.

391
00:20:58,856 --> 00:20:59,289
-Master Kuno.

392
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:00,489
Master Kuno!

393
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,889
-You're interrupting
my meditation.

394
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,656
-Take a look what we found
while cleaning the floor.

395
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:07,089
Tah-dah!

396
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:09,389
-Why, it's an antique scabbard!

397
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:11,856
Judging from its
extraordinary length,

398
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:13,756
it must be the one
used by Sasaki Kojiro

399
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,089
in his great battle
against Musashi.

400
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:18,623
-And look what else we found.

401
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:21,956
-Why, it's the wooden stew pot
lid used by Tsukahara Bokuden

402
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:23,889
to block the blow
of an assassin.

403
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:25,189
-Don't forget these, master.

404
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,289
-Indeed, these must
be the straw sandals

405
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:29,489
of the fleet-footed
warrior Chiba Chusaku.

406
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,189
-And there's this, too.

407
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,389
-Ah!

408
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,723
The skin of the tiger
wrestled by Kato Kiyomasa.

409
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:36,689
-Is he a sucker for
antiques, or what?

410
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:37,689
-No kiddin'.

NARRATOR: Ranma, I don't care
how much of that love potion

413
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:18,819
you've swallowed,
there's no way you

414
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,319
can be in love with
Shampoo's great grandma!

415
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:22,519
Is there?

416
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:25,219
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
All It Takes Is One,

417
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,919
The Kiss Of Love Is
The Kiss of Death.

418
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,519
We'll see ya there!
