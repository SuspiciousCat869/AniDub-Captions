We'll run in the sun
and play in the waves,

and it'll be just the
two of us out having fun.

Won't it be won-- dah?

You little--

to tell me that, OK?

00:17:24,684 --> 00:17:27,118
Why don't you try helping
me out, instead of playing

video games and sitting
around eating all day?

Now this is what
you're going to do.

You're going to take
him outside and you're

as Pop, though.

whether he'll even come home.
