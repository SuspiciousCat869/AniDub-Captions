00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,933
A secret sauce?

4
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:41,633
When's it ready?

5
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,000
Can I taste it?

6
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:46,933
Would you quit jumping around?

7
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:49,600
Can't you see that I'm
trying to work here?

8
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,400
I just hope Father
doesn't find out

9
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,233
I borrowed his special little
recipe, or I'm in big trouble.

[grunting]

11
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,466
Well, I guess this is it.

12
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:21,033
Time to test my secret sauce.

13
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,633
This secret
okonomiyaki sauce has

14
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,700
been aging for the last decade.

15

[clock chiming]

18
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,300
I wonder what was
wrong with Ukyo.

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,233
She's never missed a
day of school before.

20
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:58,900
I don't know.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,533
Maybe she got sick.

22
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:07,833
You're saying you're depressed
because you ruined some sauce?

23
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,466
You mean you skipped
school for that?

24
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,166
Ukyo!

25
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,033
Hmm?

26
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,033
Care for a taste?

27
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,300
It's disgusting!

28
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,466
How could I have
failed like this

29
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:30,600
after devoting my entire
life to making okonomiyaki?

30
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,333
I still remember
the day I made it.

31
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,566
There!

32
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,100
Now all we have to do is
let it cure for a few years.

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
[laughing]

34
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,166
I don't understand
what went wrong.

35
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:51,100
I'm positive I followed my
father's recipe exactly.

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,933
Ranma, honey, do you
remember if I made

37
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,633
sure the lid was sealed tight?

38
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,133
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was.

39
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:01,700
So you're saying this is the
same sauce from back then?

40
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,166
[sigh]

41
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,400
I want to get a little taste.

42
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,400
[scream]

43
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,266
Oh, I really did it now!

44
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:31,533
A little of this, and this,
and some of this, and, oh!

RANMA (VOICEOVER):
[laughing] Man,

46
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,600
if Ukyo ever found out what
really happened, I'd be toast.

47
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,200
Oh, don't worry.

48
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,166
I think you should just calm
down and have some porridge.

49
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,666
I just made it.

50
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:45,700
You made it?

51
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,300
Are you-- are you
trying to kill her?

52
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,066
Oh, thank you, Akane.

53
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,566
I will have some.

54
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,066
[groaning]

55
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:03,707
Ukyo!

56
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,400
Because you live
on your own, Ukyo,

57
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,833
I think it's in
your best interest

58
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,700
to stay with us for a while.

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,733
At least until you
feel well again.

60
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,366
Thank you so much for the kind
offer, but it's not that bad.

61
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:21,933
Hold on.

62
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,300
Uh-uh.

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,933
Not only are you suffering from
the psychological distress,

64
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,500
but you ate Akane's food.

65
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,966
[groaning]

66
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,433
Hey!

67
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,033
Don't worry about it, Akane.

68
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,566
I'm sure I'll feel better soon.

69
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,100
I'm so sorry.

70
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,766
Hey, and-- and if you need
anything, you can just ask.

71
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:40,307
Huh?

72
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:41,366
Ranma?

73
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,600
How come you're suddenly
being so nice to me?

74
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,900
Uh, no reason.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,666
No reason at all.

76
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,100
Why do you ask, anyway?

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,533
Come on, Ukyo.

78
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:58,466
We've been friends for
a long time, right?

79
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,433
[growling]

Saotome.

81
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:07,233
Well, if I'm going to
stay, will you help?

82
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,433
And I think that
should go over there.

83
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:10,200
Sure.

84
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,866
Is that all her junk?

85
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:15,266
So is she moving in here?

86
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:18,233
Ukyo, are you planning on
moving into Ranma's room?

87
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,433
Of course not.

88
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,166
I'm only going to
stay until I get out

89
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:24,333
of this depression from
ruining that sauce.

90
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,733
Ranma, are you OK?

91
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,100
Uh, yeah, sure.

92
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,500
Um, I'm fine.

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,566
[laughing]

94
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,966
Hey, Ranma, are you trying
to hide something from us?

95
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:36,033
[crash]

96
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:37,700
So now what are
you going to do?

97
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,433
About what?

98
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,966
And why is it you're suddenly
being so nice to Ukyo?

99
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,700
I don't know what you're
talking about, Akane.

100
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,233
I am starting to smell a rat.

101
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,900
Are you sure there
isn't something

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,066
you're not telling me?

103
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:51,766
Huh, Ranma?

104
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:52,966
Yeah.

105
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:56,166
Now, would you quit asking
me so many questions?

106
00:06:56,266 --> 00:07:00,033
Are you sure about that?

107
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:04,366
Anyway, it's kind of hard
to explain the relationship

108
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,333
between me and Ukyo.

109
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:07,866
You wouldn't understand.

110
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:10,200
Huh?

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,533
Oh, man, I never thought
Ukyo would get so depressed

112
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,633
over stupid sauce.

113
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,600
I've got to think
a way out of this.

114
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,400
Ranma, honey, want
me to scrub your back?

115
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,233
I can't just stay here and lie
around doing nothing at all.

116
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,266
[gurgle]

117
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,400
OK, sit up, Ranma, honey.

118
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,200
[whimpering]

119
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,400
How come so shy?

120
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,866
Come on, we grew up together.

121
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:40,066
Well, uh, you know, I, uh--

122
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,500
Huh?

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,866
[growling]

124
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,533
Man.

125
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,400
Why won't Akane ever
listen to what I

126
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,900
have to say before she hits me?

127
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,333
Huh?

128
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:01,200
Ranma honey.

129
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,200
I've been waiting for you.

130
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,233
It'll be just like when we were
little kids, sleeping together

131
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,100
when we were camping.

132
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,966
Uh, I think I'd better not.

133
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,500
What are you waiting for?

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,766
And please, don't tell
me that you're shy again.

135
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:18,000
This-- this is not good.

136
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,466
[screaming]

137
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,200
Hey, I didn't do
anything, Akane!

138
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,833
But you were going
to, weren't you?

139
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:30,900
--[laughing] Well, now, Ranma,
for a person who's living

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,966
in his fiancee's house for
free, what are you thinking?

141
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,400
But it's not what
it looks like!

142
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,133
[growling]

143
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,733
I don't care if they
are just friends!

144
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,700
It just isn't right having
a girl sleep in his room!

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,833
Why you--

146
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,733
[shouting]

147
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,433
[scream]

148
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:06,966
Now what?

149
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,900
Don't tell me you
slept up in the tree.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,833
Yeah.

151
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,700
And to think that
Ukyo's probably

152
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,500
all nice and comfortable,
all snuggled up in my bed.

153
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,933
If you keep this up, you're
going to catch a cold.

154
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:21,666
Well, I can't do anything about
it until Ukyo feels better.

155
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,033
So when do you think
Ukyo will leave?

156
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,500
You listening?

157
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,266
[gagging]

158
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:38,833
What is that smell?

159
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:39,866
Oh, it reeks!

160
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,966
What is going on out here?

161
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:46,900
[growl]

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,900
I hope you don't
mind, but I thought

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,400
I'd make breakfast for myself.

164
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,000
Even if it is a mistake
I made a long time ago,

165
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,000
you all have to understand,
I still have my pride.

166
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,133
And while everyone might
think this sauce is revolting,

167
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,700
I still have got to eat it.

168
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,100
I've never witnessed
anything quite so brave.

169
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,066
Hey, don't do it!

170
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,700
Ukyo!

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,533
Ranma, honey.

172
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:19,766
Ranma?

173
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:20,600
Ranma?

174
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,233
[growling]

175
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:30,966
Delicious.

176
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:32,333
Oh, no!

177
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,433
Ranma, honey!

178
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,933
Ranma, are you OK?

179
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,400
I'll go make him a bed.

180
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,366
Oh, brother.

181
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,247
So, Ranma, what
happened to your face?

182
00:10:59,347 --> 00:11:03,314
It looks like you've been
trying Akane's cooking again.

183
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,881
UKYO (VOICEOVER):
Ranma honey saved me

184
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,081
from eating that okonomiyaki.

185
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:13,481
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Something isn't right.

186
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:16,181
So, Akane, what do
you want to talk about?

187
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,381
Um, don't you think
that Ranma's been

188
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,181
acting really strange lately?

189
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,414
Well, I guess
maybe a little bit.

190
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:24,647
I thought so.

191
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:28,014
What I can't seem to figure
out is the reason why.

192
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:30,781
To be honest, I never
really thought about it.

193
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:35,881
According to the
recipe, we have

194
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:37,981
to make sure the vat
is sealed, and then we

195
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:40,047
have to let it sit for 10 years.

196
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:40,814
What?

197
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:42,381
We have to wait 10 years?

198
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:43,281
That's right.

199
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:44,614
But don't worry.

200
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:46,814
When it's done, I promise
you'll be the first to try it.

201
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,347
That is, for a price.

202
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,614
Then what?

203
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:54,314
I seem to recall making a
really important promise.

204
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,981
Huh?

205
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,481
OK, if it tastes good--

206
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,814
Hmm?

207
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:01,981
Then you have to promise
that you will look after me

208
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,714
for the rest of my life.

209
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,114
Yeah, OK.

210
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:09,747
That must mean that Ranma
still remembers the promise

211
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,714
he made to me back then.

212
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,181
And that's the reason why
he ate that disgusting sauce

213
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:16,247
at breakfast.

214
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:19,947
Because he wants to spend
the rest of his life with me!

215
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:22,547
But I go and ruin that sauce.

216
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:25,514
Oh, another stupid
Ranma promise.

217
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:32,214
That's what you get
for eating that sauce.

218
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,247
Oh, man, it hurts.

219
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:38,981
Maybe that's because you
have some explaining to do.

220
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:41,014
What do you mean?

221
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:43,047
Like what you did
when you were little.

222
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:45,114
Huh?

223
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:48,081
Then-- then-- then you know?

224
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,381
Then it's true.

225
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:50,414
Hmm.

226
00:12:50,514 --> 00:12:52,881
Something I'll never
be able to forget.

227
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,014
But-- but Ranma, when
you two were little,

228
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:56,881
didn't you think Ukyo was a boy?

229
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:57,947
So?

230
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:59,314
What does that have
to do with anything?

231
00:12:59,414 --> 00:13:01,347
I guess that's true, but--

232
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,347
Listen.

233
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:03,714
Even if it's something
that happened

234
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:07,147
when Ukyo and I were still kids,
I still can't hurt her, OK?

235
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:07,688
Hmm?

236
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:12,614
[gagging]

237
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:17,714
Ukyo.

238
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:21,447
I have decided to
dispose of my sauce.

239
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:23,414
[gasp]

240
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:27,481
So please, tell me honestly
that it tastes horrible.

241
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,681
Ranma, I have to put
being an okonomiyaki chef

242
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:32,381
over my happiness.

243
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:34,247
UKYO (VOICEOVER): And
I can leave this behind

244
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,547
if I hear you say it.

245
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:42,047
All I have to do is eat this
one last time and I'm free.

246
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:46,714
One, two, one, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two, one, two,

247
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:47,947
one, two, one!

248
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:07,647
It's actually pretty tasty.

249
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,647
Serious?

250
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,347
You-- you really liked it?

251
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:13,647
I'm touched!

252
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:15,914
Ranma honey!

253
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,814
[groaning]

254
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:23,614
Well then, now you'll have
to spend the rest of your life

255
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:24,981
with Ukyo!

256
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,114
Huh?

257
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:28,247
I'm going to have to put
my happiness over being

258
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,614
an okonomiyaki chef after all!

259
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:33,347
What in the world are
you two talking about?

260
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,081
Don't play dumb, Ranma.

261
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:35,814
But I--

262
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:41,547
I'm so happy you remembered.

263
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,714
Huh?

264
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:46,447
When we were little
kids, the promise we made!

265
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,981
OK, if it tastes
good, then you have

266
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,847
to promise that you
will look after me

267
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:54,347
for the rest of my life.

268
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:55,314
Yeah, OK!

269
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:58,114
[laughing]

270
00:14:58,214 --> 00:14:59,514
Huh?

271
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:02,547
I may not be much of
a woman now, Ranma,

272
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,581
but I promise to be a good wife.

273
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:07,047
[nervous laughter] Um.

274
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:14,247
Uh, Ukyo, are you sure we
made this promise back then?

275
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,314
Ranma, honey, are you
telling me you don't remember?

276
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:19,281
[nervous laughter]

277
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:21,247
Is this true, Ranma?

278
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:29,414
What a stench!

279
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:32,314
[groaning]

280
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,881
Ranma honey ate this
horrible okonomiyaki

281
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:38,781
with the ruined sauce and
said that it tasted good!

282
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:40,881
He couldn't have done it
if it wasn't for love!

283
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,481
Come back here, you
worthless little cheat!

284
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:43,022
Come here!

285
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,314
[crashing]

286
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:47,214
Oh, my.

287
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:51,014
This just gets
more complicated.

288
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,247
Ranma, you idiot!

289
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:58,281
Honestly, saying that
he'd take care of Ukyo

290
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:01,147
for the rest of his life?

291
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:02,047
Wait a minute.

292
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:04,381
He can't be serious.

293
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:07,181
But then again, he did remember
that promise with Ukyo.

294
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:14,181
Ranma, if you want to keep that
promise and take care of her,

295
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,147
fine!

296
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,647
Ranma, honey,
Akane says it's OK.

297
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:20,981
Well, Akane, you were still
uncute until the very end,

298
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,447
weren't you?

299
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:23,847
Good bye, Akane!

300
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:26,314
Huh?

301
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,814
Huh?

302
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:30,281
No, Ranma, wait!

303
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:31,781
You can't leave without me!

304
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:32,781
I'm sorry!

305
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:36,314
Huh?

306
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:37,347
Wait a minute.

307
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,314
I'm not the one who
should apologize!

308
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:42,614
[screaming]

309
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:47,647
You've got to believe me!

310
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:48,881
I'm sorry, Mr. Tendo!

311
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:49,914
I'm sorry!

312
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:51,481
It's just a
misunderstanding, really!

313
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,547
I-- I--

314
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:55,881
Huh?

315
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,281
Now why in the world am
I apologizing to you?

316
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:01,114
I really don't know.

317
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:03,047
Maybe it's because
you're a complete idiot.

318
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:08,481
You mean you're the
one who made that sauce?

319
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:09,681
Yeah.

320
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:11,881
Because I was the one who
spilled the first batch.

321
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,247
So what made it
taste so rotten, huh?

322
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:17,181
It could have been either
the insect wine or maybe even

323
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:19,447
the powdered cuttlefish.

324
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:22,581
Then what about the
promise you made with Ukyo?

325
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:24,047
I forgot.

326
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:25,881
You moron!

327
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:27,214
Don't worry about it.

328
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,614
I'll just explain it
to her and apologize.

329
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:32,314
I really hope this works.

330
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:34,747
Man's got to take
responsibility for his actions.

331
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:35,547
I'll do it.

332
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:36,088
Huh?

333
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:44,914
Ukyo, we gotta talk.

334
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:48,547
Oh, Ranma, honey, you're
just in time for dinner!

335
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,847
Huh?

336
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:51,647
Uh.

337
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:54,314
It'll be just the two of us.

338
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:56,214
I'm so happy.

339
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:58,881
The bride and her
husband to be, all alone.

340
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:01,147
But-- but you don't understand.

341
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,014
Ahh!

342
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,781
Ahh.

343
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:05,214
[laughing] See?

344
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:07,281
I'll make a good wife for you.

345
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,214
[laughing]

346
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:10,147
Ahh.

347
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,547
Ahh.

348
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,647
What would you
like to try next?

349
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:17,481
Uh, how about the sauce broth?

350
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,447
Ranma!

351
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:22,247
Weren't you going
to explain things?

352
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:24,914
Or was your little promise to
me like every other promise

353
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:26,614
you seem to make?

354
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:29,281
Am I sensing a conflict here?

355
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:30,947
Remember what you told me?

356
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:33,014
[nervous laughter] Oh, right.

357
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:33,947
Ukyo?

358
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:34,488
Ahh.

359
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,181
Ahh.

360
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:36,722
Ow!

361
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:43,247
And so I'm the one.

362
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:46,747
After I spilled your sauce,
I concocted a new one.

363
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,581
Look, Ukyo, what
Ranma really means

364
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:53,481
is that he was being nice to you
because he was feeling guilty.

365
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,814
Ranma.

366
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:58,481
Hey, if you want to kick me
a few times, go right ahead.

367
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:10,681
--[sigh] Oh, you
poor little thing.

368
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:13,314
It was Akane who put you up
to this, wasn't it, Ranma?

369
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:14,181
Huh?

370
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:14,947
Huh?

371
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:16,081
No.

372
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:18,514
It's not like-- what I
mean is, Akane never--

373
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:20,647
I just knew you
were behind this.

374
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,047
What do you mean?

375
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:25,214
If you think Ranma's
just going to run back,

376
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:27,347
you're in for a
real disappointment.

377
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:30,381
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect what's mine.

378
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:31,881
Why would I--

379
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,214
Yeah, and I'm not lying!

380
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:34,147
Just hold on.

381
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:37,114
Huh?

382
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,314
It's time you
told her the truth.

383
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:41,214
I don't get it.

384
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,614
Ranma, Akane, you
both know you haven't

385
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:46,614
told her the entire story.

386
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:47,681
Huh?

387
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:49,647
But Nabiki, we just
told her everything.

388
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:51,281
OK, Ukyo.

389
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,614
Here's the deal.

390
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:55,914
You probably already knew
these two were engaged,

391
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:58,114
but here's the part
you don't know.

392
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:04,581
Your attention!

393
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:09,214
Our happy couple are,
in fact, married!

394
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:09,947
It's the truth.

395
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:12,981
Oh, my.

396
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:14,047
Huh?

397
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:14,581
Huh?

398
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,381
We're what?

399
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,581
[screaming]

400
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,081
Come on, go along
with the program.

401
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:21,247
What have you got to lose?

402
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:22,347
You're right.

403
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:23,781
I've got nothing to lose.

404
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:25,814
I'm so happy for you two!

405
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:30,947
I'm so sorry, Ukyo.

406
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:32,781
We should have told you.

407
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:33,322
Huh?

408
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:36,722
Lies!

409
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:37,214
Lies!

410
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:37,747
Lies!

411
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:38,647
They're all lies!

412
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:44,247
We can't hide the
truth anymore, darling.

413
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:46,147
Have you gone nuts?

414
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,914
[crying]

415
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:49,581
Akane!

416
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,847
Just play along, OK?

417
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,714
OK, I will.

418
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:57,281
I mean, I'd do anything to
help you get out of this jam.

419
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,847
To help me out of this jam?

420
00:20:58,947 --> 00:20:59,388
Huh?

421
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:01,614
Hm?

422
00:21:01,714 --> 00:21:04,214
So just what are you
two talking about?

423
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:07,614
Well, we're just
your average couple.

424
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:08,814
And we had a little argument.

425
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:09,447
Oh, darling.

426
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:09,988
Would you stop it?

427
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:11,747
[laughter]

428
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:14,247
I get it.

429
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:15,747
Aren't you two cute?

430
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:16,614
Shut up.

431
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:20,081
I'm so happy for you.

432
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:21,214
Oh, Akane.

433
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,214
How I've waited for this day.

434
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:31,847
UKYO (VOICEOVER):
I'm not backing down

435
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:34,647
until I can expose
them of their charade.

436
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,514
[theme song]

437
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:18,515
AKANE (VOICEOVER): He's
a make believe husband,

438
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:20,182
and I'm a make believe wife.

439
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:23,382
Oh, how long are we gonna
have to keep this up!

440
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:26,548
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Ukyo's Secret Sauce, Part Two.

441
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:28,715
We'll see you there!
