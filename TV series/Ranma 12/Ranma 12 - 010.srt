-I'm sorry, P-Chan, but
I have to leave you here

169
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:18,005
until my classes are over, OK?

170
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,272
I won't be long.

171
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,672
What a good boy you are.

172
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:23,472
I'll be back soon.

-Hello, Ryoga.

174

Aren't you just a
pwecious wittle piggy?

175
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:37,605
Thanks to you,
they all think I'm

176
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,905
some kind of pervert
or something.

00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,172
Remember that fight you're
always yelling about?

Well, I'm ready if you are.

-What is that?

Oh, you slippery little runt.

Wait!

Thank you.

What's going on here, Ryoga?

You're the one who's always
wanting me to fight you.

Have you forgotten?

How could you ever
understand my feelings?

How could you ever know
the suffering I've seen?

210

It's been hell, I tell you.

Somehow, I managed to
make it back to Japan.

-Ranma, are you all right?

330
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,340
Just hang in there, OK?

331
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:41,006
-Huh?

332
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,973
Leave it to me.

333
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:43,406
-Why you little--

334
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,006
-Here we go.

335
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:04,173
Phew.

336
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:05,940
Akane, thank you.

337
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:09,040
-Wh-- I-- I was just
protecting P-Chan.

338
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,473
-Jeez, how uncute of you.

339
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,206
WOMAN: Oh, dear Pork Chop.

340
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,706
-Huh?

341
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:24,306
-And here we've
grown so fond of him.

342
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,673
-I'm sure he would have
been a credit to the family.

343
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:31,940
Aw, how cruel fate is.

344
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:34,873
Guess we'll have to find another
heir for the family, mother.

345
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:36,973
-Oh.

346
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,373
-Don't worry, mother.

347
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:41,706
We'll find one who looks just
like our long lost Chiro Chiro.

348
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,306
-What is the matter
with you, pop?

349
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,040
Aw, jeez.

350
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:59,773
I don't know why I was sticking
up for Ryoga like that.

351
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:01,540
That was really stupid of me.

352
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:04,573
What was I thinking?

353
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:07,306
I mean, if I'd been
smart, I would of

354
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,606
let that rich couple keep
him, and then everybody

355
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,073
would have been happy.

356
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:13,273
That's what I should have done.

357
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,440
RANMA (VOICEOVER): OK, then.

358
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,473
Hm?

359
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:25,306
-Hm.

360
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,573
-Uh.

361
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:29,206
AKANE: You're
unbelievable, Ranma!

362
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,573
[scream]

363
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:33,640
NABIKI: You're kidding.

364
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:35,440
He tried to sneak
into your room again?

365
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:37,540
You're quite the Romeo,
aren't you, Ranma?

366
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:38,806
KASUMI: But it isn't right.

367
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,973
He can't keep doing this.

368
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:42,740
SUON: Initiative,
son, that's the way.

369
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,706
[panda grunting]

370
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,073
KASUMI: Father, don't
encourage him like that.

371
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,406
Yes, sir, a little initiative
will go a long way.

372
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,373
KASUMI: It doesn't matter
that they're engaged.

373
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:52,940
They're still too young to.

374
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:57,040
-Oh, what have I
done to deserve this?

375
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:58,940
-We're not listening, are we?

376
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:11,327
[theme music]

377
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:40,516
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Looks like they

378
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,749
want me to compete in the
upcoming rhythmic gymnastics

379
00:23:42,783 --> 00:23:43,716
competition.

380
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:45,816
Get a load of my
opponent-- Kodachi

381
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,683
the Black Rose is
something else.

382
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:49,749
Hey, what do you mean she
fell in love with Ranma

383
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:50,949
at first sight?

384
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:54,316
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
"Ranma Meets Love Head-On!

385
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,549
Enter the Delinquent
Juvenile Gymnast!"

386
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,483
See you there.
