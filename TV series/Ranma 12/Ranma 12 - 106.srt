00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:08,344
[theme song]

3
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:48,333
-And now for their first
act as a married couple.

4
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,566
[laughing]

5
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,107
-Yah.

6
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,400
[cheering]

7
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,600
-Now the happy pair will touch
lips for the very first time.

8
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,833
-Ahh, gha.

9
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,933
Just a dream-- only a dream.

10
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,933
Thank goodness.

11
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,266
What time is it?

12
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:26,300
Is it dark?

13
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,833
Why is it still night?

14
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,300
-Bonjour, [french].

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,933
-Stop doing that.

16
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:39,366
FEMALE SPEAKER:
"Dinner at Ringside."

17
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,133
-I hope you like it.

18
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,800
We have had it made
especially por vous.

19
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,633
-Grr.

20
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:55,500
MADAME ST. PAUL: We will
now step up the pace.

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,966
We have only but one
week till the wedding.

22
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,233
-Ah, I'm not ready.

23
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,133
[bell ringing]

24
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,933
-With this, I make you ready.

25
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,400
-Hm?

26
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,200
-Put this in your mouth,
and the worst part is over.

27
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,933
Grr.

28
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:17,433
-Ah, [speaking french].

29
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:21,333
This too, for love
of you, I will do.

30
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:25,866
-Gha, I might not
make another week.

31
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:26,407
Gha.

32
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,066
-You can't really fit
one of those, can you?

33
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,066
-I know, that's the problem.

34
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,266
Battle dining is basically
battle eating, right?

35
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:47,000
-It seams to me what you
really need is strategy.

36
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,066
One, fight for every bite.

37
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,433
Two, seize your opponent's food.

38
00:03:56,533 --> 00:04:00,266
And three, prevent swallowing.

39
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,700
RANMA SAOTOME: I'd say
that about sums it up.

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,666
-OK, but what if
your opponent does

41
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,700
the very same thing to you?

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,000
-Right, which is why
with my small mouth,

43
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,600
the Parlay du Foie
Gras is the only chance

44
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,500
I've got, if I've
got the guts that is.

45
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,566
So you got that?

46
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,933
Don't let anyone in, OK?

47
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,366
-Yeah, but shouldn't I--

48
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,966
-The best way to help
is to stay there.

49
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,766
And I better not
catch you spying.

50
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:34,900
--[sigh] Still, why would
he practice the Foie Gras

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,700
in there?

52
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,733
-What I don't get is why does he
need hot and cold running water

53
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,033
to practice to
Parlay Du Foie Gras.

54
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,866
-I don't know.

55
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,600
-Pull the rope, Pop.

56
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,466
-OK, here comes.

57
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:02,700
-Strike hard, strike quick,
hit only the right one.

58
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,241
Yah.

59
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,633
Ahh.

60
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,600
-[gasping] Oh.

61
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,100
-It's nothing.

62
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,466
There's no need to be alarmed.

63
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:19,366
-But Dad, why is Ranma
screaming like that?

64
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,033
-Either you trust
him or you don't.

65
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:26,366
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing else you can do.

66
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,900
Have faith, Akane.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,833
He'll be fine.

68
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,300
-Huh?

69
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,766
RANMA SAOTOME: [screaming]

70
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:32,733
-Huh.

71
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,166
Ranma?

72
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,100
-[screaming]

73
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,533
-It's a good thing Akane's
not watching, hey Boy?

74
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,933
-Thanks for the sympathy.

75
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,233
[screaming]

76
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,100
[bell ringing]

77
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,000
-End of the dining interval.

78
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,700
-Grr, why won't you eat?

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,233
-Oh, forgive me.

80
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,566
I did try to eat,
Madame, truly I did.

81
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,833
Only I'm so nervous
about the wedding, I--

82
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:07,000
-I would suggest that you
try harder, Mademoiselle.

83
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,033
There are only three days left.

84
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,800
-Yes, I know.

85
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,466
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's
my bath time, so-- [grunting]

86
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,433
RANMA SAOTOME: Now do it again.

87
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:20,974
Ahh.

88
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:22,033
-Huh?

89
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,466
-Well Boy, do you give up yet?

90
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:26,900
-Not a chance.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,233
There's no way I'm letting that
Picolet jerk say he beat me.

92
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,200
[screaming]

93
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:55,466
--[screaming] Somehow
without my noticing,

94
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,833
my weight has gone up.

95
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:03,066
Could this be Mademoiselle
Ranma's doing?

96
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,866
-Now do it again.

97
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,933
Hurry up.

98
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:06,600
Come on, do it.

99
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,066
-Rawr.

100
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,533
RANMA SAOTOME: [screaming]

101
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:14,474
-Ahh.

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,233
MADAME ST. PAUL: And that is
why I think it is the Foie Gras.

103
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,600
PICOLET CHARDIN II:
And then-- what?

104
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,733
Vraiment?

105
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,933
-At this point, I do not
think there is any doubt

106
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,033
what Mademoiselle
Ranma is practicing.

107
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,433
In fact, I can prove it.

108
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,066
-No.

109
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,833
-For one thing, there
is her strange behavior.

110
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:48,933
For another, there is the
sudden loss of weight.

111
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:52,000
Finally, there is
my own weight gain.

112
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,300
The only conclusion can
be Parlay du Foie Gras.

113
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,841
-No.

114
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:04,133
-However, the Parlay du Foie
Gras has its own dangers.

115
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,500
Mademoiselle will pay
the price to use it.

116
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,933
Indeed, everyone who
has used it before her

117
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,900
had met with the bad end.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,833
-Ah.

119
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:20,666
MADAME ST. PAUL: Met
with the bad end.

120
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,966
-Oh, no.

121
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,466
And for that
reason, I don't want

122
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:34,300
you to practice it anymore, OK?

123
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
-So does that mean you
volunteer to take my place

124
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
and be his wife?

125
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,041
-I--

126
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:48,533
-If I can't get this corset
off, I can't be a guy again.

127
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:53,233
If that happens, I don't
care what happens to me.

128
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,200
But there's still
just the one way out--

129
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,633
beat that jerk at
his own stupid game.

130
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,266
RANMA SAOTOME
(VOICEOVER): Can he do it?

131
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,666
He seems so weak.

132
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,933
Oh, why can't it be over?

133
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,433
-Ready, Boy?

134
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,833
-Ready.

135
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:22,374
Yah.

136
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,866
-Mm, it seems he's gotten
better at the forks.

137
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:34,566
-And he avoids the kettles
while hitting all the buckets.

138
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,033
AKANE TENDO: You're going to
demonstrate the Parlay du Foie

139
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,533
Gras for us?

140
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,733
-Uh-huh.

141
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,300
And if I do it right, you
won't believe your eyes.

142
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,433
-[gulp]

143
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:50,166
-Let me do this right.

144
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:53,100
Parlay du Foie
Gras, Saotome style.

145
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,466
-Hm, the padlock?

146
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,900
-[gasps]

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,300
-I did it.

148
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,300
-Dad, did you see?

149
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,033
-Uh-uh, uh-uh.

150
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,000
-What about you?

151
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,200
-Uh-uh, uh-uh.

152
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,566
-If you didn't see
it, then that means

153
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,000
I finally did the Parlay
du Foie Gras right.

154
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,200
Thank goodness, I finally-- ahh.

155
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,500
-Ranma.

156
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,900
Ranma.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,133
Snap out of it.

158
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,400
You've got to.

159
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,733
-Uh-huh.

160
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,966
Ah, uh?

161
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,300
-I knew this would happen.

162
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,033
You should have stopped
when I told you.

163
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:41,133
Ranma, hey, where
are you go-- hey.

164
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,166
Ranma, you need your rest now.

165
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:47,233
-I've got no time to rest, not
till I beat that jerk Picolet

166
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,733
at battle dining.

167
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,066
-But you can't.

168
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,733
Your body's in no
shape to fight.

169
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,800
-There's two days
left till the wedding.

170
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,800
If I don't beat him
before then, I'm

171
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,733
gonna end up married to him.

172
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,366
-Dad.

173
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,833
-That is what happens
when you fight a duel.

174
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,333
You know that.

175
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,333
-[sigh]

176
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:19,000
Ranma.

177
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,541
Huh?

178
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,566
How did that
watermelon get there?

179
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:33,266
Unless it's the
Parlay du Foie Gras?

180
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:36,500
-My dear Monsieur
Picolet, I regret

181
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,333
it is my unhappy duty to
teach you the Anti Foie Gras.

182
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,400
RANMA SAOTOME: Monsieur,
I have a favor to ask.

183
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,400
PICOLET CHARDIN II:
Of moi, Mademoiselle?

184
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,400
-Oui.

185
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,733
My mind, Monsieur, is uneasy.

186
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,533
Am I making the biggest
mistake of my life?

187
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:12,333
How can I be sure that
you're man enough for me?

188
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,533
-You require the proof?

189
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,966
-A pre-wedding
demonstration of your skill

190
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:20,033
would set my mind at ease.

191
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:24,166
If, for example, you're
unable to beat me,

192
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:27,000
then I shouldn't have
to marry you, right?

193
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,600
[lightning]

194
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:34,633
I also want the key to this
iron corset, of course.

195
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,333
MADAME ST. PAUL:
[cackling] But of course.

196
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:41,700
Le marriage is the
serious business.

197
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,033
If the match before the
wedding helps ease your mind,

198
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,600
then the match we shall have.

199
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,366
-Hurray, I feel so
much better already.

200
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,033
MADAME ST. PAUL
(VOICEOVER): It will not

201
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:57,900
be so easy as you think,
Mademoiselle Ranma.

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,733
RANMA SAOTOME (VOICEOVER):
It won't be easy.

203
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,966
But the only one eating crow
at this thing's gonna be you,

204
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,466
lady, not me.

205
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,766
-Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight, in this very ring,

206
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,066
the martial art known
as battle dining.

207
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,300
[cheering]

208
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,800
-He's the Prince of Pate
and the Sovereign of Snails.

209
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,666
Say hello to Picolet Chardin.

210
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:33,166
[cheering]

211
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:39,533
And in this corner, the one who
would be bride, Ranma Saotome.

212
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:43,000
-Ha, hi, thank you for coming.

213
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,466
-What do you think?

214
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:45,766
Will he win?

215
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,900
-I don't know.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,866
But if he loses, I get
all I can eat for life.

217
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:52,600
-I will now explain the rules.

218
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,600
The winner is the one
who eats the fastest.

219
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,000
However, if that
eating can be seen,

220
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,033
then you get this penalty.

221
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,266
First, we get to call you pig.

222
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:06,566
Also, you get extra plate.

223
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,107
-Hmm.

224
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,033
PICOLET CHARDIN II (VOICEOVER):
At last, mademoiselle,

225
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,433
you will be mine.

226
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:15,933
RANMA SAOTOME
(VOICEOVER): Remember,

227
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:19,066
if you lose, you'll
never be a guy again.

228
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,033
As far as what comes
after that, I'm

229
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,466
probably better off
not thinking about it.

230
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:25,833
I've gotta win.

231
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,933
That's all there is to it.

232
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,515
-Ready?

233
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,866
[screaming]

234
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,200
-[gasps]

235
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,133
AKANE TENDO (VOICEOVER):
Look, Ranma's pile is taller.

236
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:50,033
While Picolet clears
his own plates,

237
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:53,866
Ranma feeds him food off his.

238
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,966
No one can see you
eat is the rule.

239
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:59,400
But foie gras stuff feeding
takes advantage of that.

240
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,866
It's kind of scary.

241
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:06,133
-Here, have some foie
gras Saotome style.

242
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,733
MADAME ST. PAUL (VOICEOVER): So,
Mademoiselle has mastered it.

243
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:13,433
However, the Chardin style
has tricks of his own.

244
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:17,066
-I am sorry, but the
foie gras is filling.

245
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,066
-Huh?

246
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,033
What?

247
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,000
Ahh.

248
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,400
-Oh.

249
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,666
--[laughing] Chardin foie gras
counterattack, s'il vous plait.

250
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:31,000
-But I don't-- how did you?

251
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Gha, ahh.

252
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,166
-S'il vous plate, get it?

253
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,666
-Ahh.

254
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:42,666
-Eww.

255
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:45,266
MADAME ST. PAUL:
[cackling] Did you

256
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:47,100
think you could win
with that one trick?

257
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,633
Surely, Mademoiselle, you
have something else to try.

258
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:54,433
-Actually, now that
you mention it, I do.

259
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:55,400
-Ahh.

260
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,766
-[grunting] [screaming]

261
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:03,000
-How does she think
of these things?

262
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,833
-[screaming] Huh?

263
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,566
-Now that's tough.

264
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,733
How's Ranma going to use
the Foie Gras with soup.

265
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,366
RANMA SAOTOME (VOICEOVER):
OK, soup, soup, what can I do?

266
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,333
Aha, yah.

267
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:27,300
Saotome Soup Ribbon, aha.

268
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,966
-[gulping]

269
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,866
[cheering]

270
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:35,966
-She-- she has the lead.

271
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:38,833
-So, you ready for
the next course?

272
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,533
-Hmm, are you?

273
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,900
What the?

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,966
-Surprise.

275
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,400
[cheering]

276
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,100
-Oh yeah?

277
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,100
[grunting]

278
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,600
-Now that's a move that
would come in handy.

279
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,066
-Eww.

280
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,833
-Now that was true elegance.

281
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,000
-Ugh.

282
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,800
-I am tired of the defense.

283
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,633
From now, Mademoiselle,
I begin the attack.

284
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:12,633
-Shut up and fight.

285
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,466
[gasping]

286
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:30,133
MADAME ST. PAUL:
You are the pig.

287
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,500
Penalty plate.

288
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,066
-You must think of some new
way to feed me, Mademoiselle.

289
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,600
RANMA SAOTOME (VOICEOVER): He's
right, I need something else.

290
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,600
The question is what?

291
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,633
Maybe I can cause
a penalty at least.

292
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,600
Grr.

293
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,600
Hi-yah.

294
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,600
-Ranma, it's no use.

295
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,100
Picolet can counter
it, remember?

296
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,066
-Now, Mademoiselle, you
are repeating yourself.

297
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:53,607
-Oh.

298
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,066

-How did you-- ahh.

301
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,366
-Right there, I can see him eat.

302
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,733
-Penalty, penalty.

303
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,700
-Where?

304
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,333
-Cheater.

305
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:19,100
-Grr, I protest.

306
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,233
-Impressive.

307
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,466
I want you for my wife
even more than before.

308
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:26,300
-First you gotta beat
me though, remember?

309
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,100
-In that case, let's
put an end to this.

310
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,766
Chardin school special attack.

-[slurping]

going to-- [shuddering]

[gasps]

314
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,900
-Now that was really disgusting.

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
-Yeah, but it's smart too.

316
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
Because while he's
eating food like that,

317
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
he can't be attacked.

318
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,633
-Yes, but in this case,
the truly disgusting

319
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,166
is also truly brilliant.

320
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,666
[laughing]

321
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,133
MADAME ST. PAUL (VOICEOVER):
Bravo, Monsieur Picolet.

322
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,966
The defeat of Mademoiselle
Ranma is now inevitable.

323
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,366
-[gasp]

324
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:14,933
-[grunting] It's not over yet.

325
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:18,200
-Look, all the food on
his plate is disappearing.

326
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,533
-Incroyable.

327
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,633
-Where is he putting-- huh?

328
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,700
-The Chardin chef is the best.

329
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,233
-I must have the recipe.

330
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,733

333
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:37,666
MADAME ST. PAUL (VOICEOVER):
The battle is won.

334
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:38,466
-No good.

335
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:39,833
-Huh?

336
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:42,266
-The battle's gone on too long,
and all of Ranma's reserves

337
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,700
are down to nothing.

338
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,366
And he's burning
himself out as we speak.

339
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:48,833
-Oh no, the bad end.

340
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,966
-Oh man, can't see.

341
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,800
My eyes are starting to blur.

342
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,466
Oh, Picolet has
got one plate left.

343
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,666
-The victory is ours.

344
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,966
-And now for the gran finis.

345
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,866
RANMA SAOTOME: Oh no you don't.

346
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:07,407
-Huh?

347
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,333
-Oh no, it's headed right back.

348
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:14,966
-Now I've done it.

349
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:19,666
If only I weren't so weak with
hunger, maybe I could think.

350
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:28,033
Mm, no good, no strength.

351
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,766
Oh, yeah, that's it.

352
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,200
-[laughing] Huh?

353
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,366
-May I be excused?

354
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:40,300
-[screaming]

355
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,266
[cheering]

356
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,733
-He won.

357
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,666
[cheering]

358
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,133
-Congratulations, Mademoiselle.

359
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:57,433
As promised, I release you from
the obligation to marry me.

360
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,866
-Hey, at least it's over, right?

361
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,366
-Oui, but remember,
Mademoiselle,

362
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:07,133
you are always in my heart.

363
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,833
-Hey Picolet, don't
worry, some day you'll

364
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:12,533
meet a girl twice
as good as I am.

365
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:15,966
-Farewell, Mademoiselle, adieu.

366
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,666
-Ah, he ain't so bad.

367
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:21,666
-Sure had a crush on
you, though, didn't he?

368
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,533
Oh yeah, did you
ever find out what

369
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,800
that bad end was
supposed to be about?

370
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,766
-Malnutrition, I don't know.

371
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:31,766
-For your loss to me and
the school, Monsieur,

372
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:35,200
I demand one of your
daughters as payment.

373
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,266
-Oh, you don't quit, do you?

374
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:37,807
-No.

375
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,702
[theme song]

376
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,004
FEMALE SPEAKER: I love summer.

377
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:19,570
But I'm scared to swim.

378
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,370
This year though, it's
going to be different.

379
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,104
Principal Kuno, please teach me.

380
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:26,604
Next time on "Ranma 1/2",
"Swimming with Psychos."

381
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:29,070
We'll see you there.
