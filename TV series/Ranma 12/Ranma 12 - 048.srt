AKANE (VOICEOVER): "The
Killer From Jusenkyo."

00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:20,002
CHAIRMAN: Moving on to the
next order of business,

4
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:22,668
I see Jusenkyo visitors
has gone up again.

5
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,268
Why, I heard the
number of those who'd

6
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:27,868
fallen into the cursed
springs is at 144 persons.

7
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,835
I know we've all been
under a lot of pressure.

8
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:31,268
But gentlemen, our
heaviest season

9
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:32,535
is just around the corner.

10
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:34,702
And if we're going to do
something about this problem,

11
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:37,702
we got to do it now!

12
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:38,968
-Mr. Chairman.

13
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:40,502
-Yes, Vice Chairman?

14
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:42,368
-I'm ready to make my report.

15
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:44,568
The following five
miscreants have flagrantly

16
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:47,535
violated our Jusenkyo
code of conduct.

17
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,068
This one has violated
the code of modesty,

18
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,802
abusing his ability
to transform--

19
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:52,935
VICE CHAIRMAN (VOICEOVER):
--and wantonly

20
00:02:53,035 --> 00:02:55,035
exposing himself at the
slightest opportunity.

21
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:57,702
He must be punished.

22
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,268
VICE CHAIRMAN: This
one has violated--

23
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,835
VICE CHAIRMAN (VOICEOVER):
--the code of public safety,

24
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,568
threatening the
health and well-being

25
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:04,435
of innocent bystanders.

26
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:07,735
He, too, must be
dealt with harshly.

27
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:09,535
VICE CHAIRMAN: This
one's violated the code

28
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:10,802
of self-gratification--

29
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:12,702
VICE CHAIRMAN (VOICEOVER):
--using a Jusenkyo ability

30
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:14,335
as a means for
personal retribution.

31
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:15,902
VICE CHAIRMAN: This one's
up for duplicitous--

32
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,168
VICE CHAIRMAN
(VOICEOVER): --conduct,

33
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:18,568
sneaking into the bed
chambers of innocent maidens.

34
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,235
VICE CHAIRMAN: And
this one's violated--

35
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:21,535
VICE CHAIRMAN (VOICEOVER):
--the code of fair play with his

36
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,868
unsportsmanlike conduct and--

37
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,302
VICE CHAIRMAN:
--murderous intent.

38
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,168
If we don't make an
example out of them,

39
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:29,035
how will we enforce discipline?

40
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:30,835
We mustn't forget our mission.

41
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:33,435
We mustn't forget
our sacred duty.

42
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:37,635
We must never,
ever, never forget!

43
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:38,568
TOGETHER: Never forget.

44
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:42,002
If we forget,
strike us down dead.

45
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,702
Never forget!

46
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:45,243
Huh?

47
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:50,402
-Never forget.

48
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,135
Let me punish 'em.

49
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,202
-Heh-heh.

50
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:59,068
Actually, we were
hoping you'd say that.

51
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:01,535
The method is left
to you, Kinnii.

52
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:04,235
But you must stop them
from abusing their Jusenkyo

53
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:05,835
transformation powers.

54
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:12,202
-They'll learn to control
themselves or else.

one weak spot of his,

59
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,935
he'd really be
perfect for the job.

60
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,002
-Uh, yeah.

61

Almost forgot.

62
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,235
Chairman, perhaps we
should also accompany him.

The only young
girls he could fool

are the ones who take
their teeth out at bedtime.

Shouldn't you help him?

better, I'd suspect

the Cult of the Muscle
Sword was involved.

of China's most
ancient disciplines.

00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:57,568
And what's this?

168
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:58,402
An armband?

169
00:08:58,502 --> 00:08:59,668
-[gasps]

170
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:02,335
Yes, it is.

171
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:04,702
This means the secret
Jusenkyo Preservation

172
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:05,735
Society's involved.

173
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,468
-Preservation Society?

174
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:10,268
-So how come we never
heard of them, then?

175
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:13,835
-Because they're a
secret society, stupid.

176
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:16,868
Nobody knows what
their true purpose is.

177
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:18,902
All I know was
that if you violate

178
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:21,002
their so-called
Jusenkyo code, they

179
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,502
come after you,
maybe even kill you.

180
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:24,202
-[gasps]

181
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,868
-Oh, poor Mr. Saotome.

182
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,002
I hope he's all right.

183
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,135
-Can't they just let him
off with the warning?

184
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,335
-What do you know?

185
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,702
Guess they old guy needed
a bodyguard after all.

186
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:35,002
-Better hope he's not
the vengeful type.

187
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:38,702
I'd hate to have a visiting
beef from the other side.

188
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:39,302
-Come on.

189
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:40,168
Cut it out.

190
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:42,502
-Oh, Saotome.

191
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:46,002
-I have a feeling Shampoo and
that bird brain, Mumu the Duck,

192
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:47,568
have fallen into
their hands as well.

193
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:48,502
-What are we gonna do?

194
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:49,635
We've got to help them.

195
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:51,835
-And I know just the
way to save them.

196
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:53,368
Ranma, you shut up
and come with me.

197
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,002
-Then I'm coming too.

198
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,502
-Yeah, right.

199
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,668
"You shut up and come
with me," he says.

200
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:07,635
-Here.

201
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,568
Let me give you a
hand with those.

202
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:11,068
-Back off!

203
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:13,302
Say you, how do I know
this isn't some plan

204
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:15,902
to get me to steal some
girl's gym short for ya, huh?

205
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,335
-Oh, they'll come, all right.

206
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:20,002
If there's one thing those
jerks from Jusenkyo can't stand,

207
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,335
it's someone who violates
their cold of decency, morals,

208
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:23,035
and ethics.

209
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,235
-Who, like you?

210
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,568
-Hey, have a little
faith, will ya?

211
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,302
-That getup you're
wearing doesn't exactly

212
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:29,435
inspire confidence.

213
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:30,002
-Huh?

214
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:31,135
What-- what?

215
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,035
You're saying you don't
like my work clothes?

216
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:34,768
-What I'm saying is
that I'm sorry I ever

217
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,235
listened to you in
the first place.

218
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,335
Ranma, come on.

219
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,768
We can think of some
better plan on our own.

220
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:39,868
-Yeah, no kidding.

221
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:47,002
Say, you wouldn't be
from Jusenkyo, would you?

222
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:47,968
-So there.

223
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:49,568
Maybe next time
you'll believe what

224
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,668
your elders are telling you.

225
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:52,568
Good luck, you two.

226
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:53,235
Got to go.

227
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:53,935
-Hey, wait a minute.

228
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:54,702
Put those gym shorts--

229
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:55,935
VICE CHAIRMAN: Don't move.

230
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,068
One, abusing the
ability to transform

231
00:10:58,168 --> 00:10:59,368
is grounds for punishment.

232
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:01,035
Two, endangering
others with disability

233
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:02,602
is grounds for punishment.

234
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:04,468
Three, breaking either
rule number one or two

235
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:06,068
is also grounds for punishment.

236
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:07,468
-Enough with the rules.

237
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,235
He's broken them all anyway.

238
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,902
-Let me punish him.

239
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,335
-No, don't.

240
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,835
-Ranma!

241
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:15,402
-No!

242
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:16,802
No, don't do it!

243
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:20,309
Oh.

244
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:21,635
-OK, you.

245
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:22,176
Huh?

246
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:27,102
-What just happened?

247
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:42,922
KINNII: Oh, who has done
this dreadful thing?

248
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,155
-You did it, stupid.

249
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,122
-I did this?

250
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:48,822
Buildings are made
out of wood, and wood

251
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:50,488
is made out of living trees.

252
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:52,188
We must let the tree
know how much we

253
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:54,688
appreciate its sacrifice.

254
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,188
-What's with him?

255
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:59,155
-The one weak spot in an
otherwise perfect warrior.

256
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:00,255
-Weak spot?

257
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:01,322
-That's right.

258
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:03,255
Once while he was
training in Jusenkyo,

259
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,255
Kinnii slipped and fell
into a cursed spring.

260
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:07,688
VICE CHAIRMAN
(VOICEOVER): There's

261
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:09,855
a legend which
says 999 years ago,

262
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:14,755
a young priest drowned in a
spring called Fushaniichuan.

263
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,988
-Now anyone who falls
into that spring

264
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,555
takes the body of
a young priest.

265
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,055
Tragic story.

266
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:20,988
-Huh?

267
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,388
Hey, wait a minute.

268
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:25,155
Doesn't that mean he's
breaking your dumb code too?

269
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:28,288
-But priests are good for
society, not incentives

270
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:29,155
from moral turpitude.

271
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:30,888
-What's that supposed to mean?

272
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:34,655
-I'm against violent-- aah!

273
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,288
-Oh.

274
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,855
Oh, how dreadful.

275
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:39,388
Doesn't he know that buildings
come from wood and wood

276
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:40,655
comes from living trees.

277
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:41,988
Oh, we must thank the wood--

278
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:44,955
-Stop thanking the dumb trees
and help me find my father.

279
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,122
-Father?

280
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,488
-You, know, the big jerk
who turns into a panda.

281
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:50,555
-Aah!

282
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:52,188
I've done a dreadful thing.

283
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,488
A dreadful thing.

284
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:56,222
Oh, please let me
take you to him.

285
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:57,555
-Do you mean you'll help us?

286
00:12:57,655 --> 00:12:59,122
KINNII (VOICEOVER):
Of course I will.

287
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:00,788
It's the very least I could do.

288
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:02,722
RANMA (VOICEOVER): This
place you're taking us

289
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:04,188
to-- it's not in China, is it?

290
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:05,455
KINNII (VOICEOVER): Heavens no.

291
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:08,622
It's in Japan, but it's
just a little far from here.

292
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,155
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
I hope he's OK.

293
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,488
Hand in there, Pop.

294
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:12,588

00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:23,422
What do I look like?

501
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:24,122
A priest?

502
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:25,588
-You little ingrate.

503
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:27,222
Maybe this will teach
you some respect.

504
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:30,622
-Aah, you stupid old man!

505
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,022
GENMA: You ignorant little pup.

506
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:33,455
KINNII: Stop it, you.

507
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:34,355
No fighting.

508
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:36,088
Please, everyone.

509
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:38,388
Can't we all just get along?

AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Aw, gross, Ranma!

512
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,382
You're acting like
you really are a girl.

513
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,548
Please don't laugh with
your pinkie finger stuck out

514
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:22,582
like that.

515
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:25,482
Next time on "Ranma
1/2," "Am I Pretty?

Ranma's Declaration
of Womanhood."

00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,582
We'll see you there.
