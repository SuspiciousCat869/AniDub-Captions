at the old geezer.

00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:39,922
Don't you think he
looks half dead?

5
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:41,622
His skin's so pasty
looking and I'd

6
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:45,988
say his head's too
big for his body.

AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ryoga

You stole my--

Mm, this stuff's so good.

16
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,055
I found it in that
cupboard over there.

17
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:24,355
Man, it is really good.

18
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:26,522
Do you even have
the slightest idea

19
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:28,855
of what you've just
done to me, boy?

20
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:31,622
You, thief-- you stole
all of my sweets.

21
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:34,155
And I need them for energy
after a hard day's work.

22
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,155
But I don't think that
means anything to someone

23
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:38,222
as selfish as you.

RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Akane, as
I speak, my journey takes me

While I'm here,
I hope to buy you

32
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,855
a stuffed one as a souvenir
of my undying devotion to you.

33
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:15,622
And maybe-- just maybe--
when you hug it at night,

34
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:17,555
you'll think of me.

Excuse me, could
I have another?

37
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:50,522
I still don't understand
why you asked me here.

38
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:53,988
It can't be just
to buy me dessert.

39
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:58,555
Because I'm getting old.

Huh?

41
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:02,255
It's about time I
handpicked someone

42
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:07,055
to take over the Saotome School
of Anything Goes Martial Arts.

43
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:07,922
Huh?

44
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,288
But what about Ranma?

45
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:14,155
Ranma isn't the
right man for the job.

46
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:23,222
In martial arts,
there is no family.

47

Only the most deserving
must carry on.

48
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:29,355
As far as Ranma goes,
I think I've him

49
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:33,488
by being too protective, and
after careful consideration,

50
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:44,822
Ryoga, my boy, Ryoga, you've
got potential for the job.

51
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:50,322
Ryoga, become my disciple
and carry on the school.

52
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,522
No way.

53
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,288
This is just some
kind of trick you

54
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:02,955
and Ranma have come
up with, isn't it?

No, wait.

I can't believe
Mr. Saotome would

ask me to do such a thing.

Is that the best
you can do, Ranma?

At this rate, you'll never be
able to take over the Saotome

I never wanted any part of it.

I stole your sweets?

How dare you talk back
to your father like that?

80
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,955
You should be ashamed.

81
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:17,088
Hey, Pops, I'm not the
one with the problem here.

82
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,655
SAOTOME: Oh, and I see this
is the way you show respect

83

gotta earn respect.

Hey, Ryoga, so have
you decided yet?

You can't be serious, Saotome.

00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:51,955
The Saotome School
needs someone strong,

someone who won't be burdened
with family problems.

96
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,588
Well, then I can only assume
you've put a lot of thought

97
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:04,588
into your decision.

98
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:07,055
You bet.

in fact inherit the Saotome

Go on.

102
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:23,722
Then what would happen
with Akane's engagement?

103
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:24,588
SAOTOME: She's right.

That's a good question.

But I don't want--

106

From now on, Ryoga and
myself will be inseparable.

120
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:56,022
I can't figure out
what you're thinking.

121
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,022
But when you come to
your senses, Pops,

122
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:00,288
would you please let me know?

123
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:02,855
Maybe it's you who should
come to his senses, boy.

124
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:09,022
When you realize
what you've done,

125
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:11,222
perhaps then you'll
admit your mistake

126
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,355
and ask for forgiveness.

127
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:15,355
That's all I have to say.

128
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:33,922
I can't just sit back and
let all of this happen to me.

Oh, we're out of milk.

133
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:45,688
You scared me.

134
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:48,622
RANMA: You want me to go
out and get you some milk?

135
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,755
Oh, that's OK.

00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:50,955
It's pretty late.

Hey, I think the corner

taking this whole thing

seriously.

144
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,822
He probably still
doesn't even have a clue.

00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:26,888
I'm sure of it.

when you call me master.

Master, I personally
guarantee I can beat Ranma.

149
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:42,722
Ryoga, I must confess it pains
me a great deal that I have

150
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,955
disgraced my own flesh
and blood by telling you

151
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:47,322
all of his weak points,
so that you can embarrass

152

that boy of mine in public.

153
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:53,222
But I'm must for the
good of my school.

00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:54,922
Then I cannot fail you.

Ryoga, look.

156
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:03,155
That star represents
my entire empire.

157
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,655
Your mission is
to reach up for it

158
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:09,222
and become the new shining
star of the Saotome School.

00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:12,163
RYOGA: OK.

160
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,963
So has your dad moved
back into the house?

161
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:35,229
Who cares?

162
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:39,696
If he likes sleeping in a
lousy tent, I say let him.

163
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:42,296
Ranma, do you think
there's a chance that Ryoga

164
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:44,796
is going to take over
your father's school?

165
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:47,629
[grunting]

166
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:52,163
Stay on your toes, boy.

167
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:55,563
[grunting]

168
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,763
Listen carefully, Ryoga.

169
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:04,729
In order to defeat
Ranma, you must

170
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:06,129
learn his special techniques.

171
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,296
That's it, Ryoga.

172
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:13,296
Keep going.

173
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:17,529
Harder, harder, feel the burn.

174
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:18,496
That's it.

175
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:31,129
They seem pretty serious.

176
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:32,096
Hm.

177
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:33,563
Huh Hey, wait.

178
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:45,263
This really bugs
you, doesn't it?

179
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,363
Not a chance.

180
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:48,563
Please don't lie.

181
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:49,763
So what's your point?

182
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:52,329
One okonomiyaki to go.

183
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:55,629
It is so nice to see
you two getting along.

184
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,496
Mind your own business.

185
00:12:57,596 --> 00:13:00,363
Let's go Ranma.

186
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:04,396
Oh, by the way, Akane, I just
heard Ryoga's your new fiance.

187
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,829
You must be really
excited about that.

188
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:07,663
Huh?

189
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:09,996
Well, you must have heard wrong.

190
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,396
Oh, and from the
rumors going around,

191
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:14,329
Ranma, is it true
that Ryoga is going

192
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,429
to take over your dad's school?

193
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,663
I guess.

194
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,963
What?

195
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,729
If that's the
case, then it looks

196
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:23,296
like you'll be moving out of
the Tendo house pretty soon,

197
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:24,196
hey, Ranma?

198
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:25,829
Moving out?

199
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,463
Yeah, I suppose
she has a point.

200
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:29,763
Hey, I got an idea.

201
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:31,329
You could move in with me.

202
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:32,596
You've got to be kidding.

203
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:33,729
Think about it.

204
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,996
We're already engaged,
so you can move in here

205
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,429
any time you wanted to.

206
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,229
That's a stupid idea.

207
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,696
Maybe not.

208
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:46,229
Akane, I'm going to
stay here a but longer.

209
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:51,463
UKYO: By the way, Akana, that
okonomiyaki is on the house.

210
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,129
Why, you jerk, Ranma!

211
00:13:58,563 --> 00:13:59,829
Calamari as usual?

212
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:01,063
Sure.

213
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:05,463
Or maybe something in to
help me keep up my strength.

214
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:08,996
Ra-- Ranma, I mean, I know
that we've always been engaged

215
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:12,429
and all, but it's so sudden.

216
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:13,629
You know?

217
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:17,363
Not that I, you know--
I'm so embarrassed.

218
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:22,229
I bet Ryoga's going to
challenge me any day now.

219
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,196
[grunting]

220
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:30,178
Kick.

221
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:30,637
Kick.

222
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:33,063
Kick.

223
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,063
Good one.

224
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:44,396
[screaming]

225
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:56,296
If you want to win, Ryoga, your
moves must be more precise.

226
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,229
Right.

227
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,896
But the hour fast
approaches when

228
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,763
you must do battle with Ranma.

229
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:12,629
Master, what's wrong?

230
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:16,796
It is time to reveal the
last of Ranma's weaknesses.

231
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:17,629
Stop it.

232
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:20,029
I can beat him without knowing.

233
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:23,129
I've trained too long
and too hard to lose.

234
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:26,129
Don't be so sure, my boy.

235
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:29,829
Master Saotome, didn't you tell
me that I was the shining star?

236
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,370
Huh?

237
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,529
I've got a big mouth.

238
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:44,229
Hey, Akane, this wouldn't be
me takeout, would it, Akane?

239
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:50,963
Oh, and here I am starving.

240
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:20,029
This match will determine
who will inherit the Saotome

241
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,396
School of Martial Arts.

242
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:27,304
Begin.

243
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,529
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Pop.

[screaming]

245
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:48,663
Wow, I didn't think
Ryoga was that good.

246
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,129
You're right.

247
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:53,563
[gasping]

248
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:56,529
It's turning out to be
quite the intense battle.

249
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:58,163
Ryoga and Ranma are
fighting toe-to-toe

250
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:00,663
without so much as showing
any signs of tiring.

251
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:03,563
And still the question remains
in this fight to the finish--

252
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,563
who will be the
last one standing

253
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:08,296
and win the honor of
being Akane's fiance?

254
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,063
Come on, Ryoga!

255
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:26,063
I'm cheering for you this time
for special personal reasons.

256
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,696
Don't you dare lose, Ryoga.

257
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:34,763
SAOTOME (VOICEOVER): It's
time to stop toying with him.

258
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:55,404
Huh?

259
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,529
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Did Mr. Saotome just

260
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:03,229
signal Ryoga to block?

261
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:06,096
That means Ryoga knows when
Ranma's going to strike.

262
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:08,196
Well, after all
that, does this mean

263
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,596
Ryoga's our new brother-in-law.

264
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:12,629
Yes, I guess it does.

265
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:14,496
I've had it.

266
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:17,463
[screaming]

267
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:28,329
SAOTOME (VOICEOVER):
Forgive me, Ranma.

268
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,463
But I need someone
who won't lose focus

269
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,863
on his job with family problems.

270
00:18:32,963 --> 00:18:35,429
Oh, sure, I remember how
hard we trained together

271
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,963
as I groomed you to take
over the Saotome school.

272
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:49,529
Goodbye, Ranma.

273
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:58,329
What does he think he's doing?

274
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,463
This announcer has no
idea what's going on here.

275
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:05,363
Huh?

276
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:07,796
Huh?

277
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,696
[screaming] I hate cats!

278
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:12,696
I hate 'em!

279
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,663
Please tell me this
isn't the major weakness

280
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:21,063
of Ranma's the master was
going to tell me about.

281
00:19:21,163 --> 00:19:22,963
This is so pathetic.

282
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,996
Here's your big chance, Ryoga.

283
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:27,796
This might be your
last opportunity, boy.

284
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:31,296
It's time to get revenge for
Ranma stealing my sweets.

285
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:32,263
Do it!

286
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,629
What did you say?

287
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,963
Your revenge for your
sweets being stolen?

288
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:50,729
This was about you
getting your revenge?

289
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:52,829
Why don't you
explain to everyone

290
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,896
how you could do this do your
own son over some stupid sweets

291
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,529
you had stashed away.

292
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:01,163
Tell us, Saotome, is what
Ranma's saying the truth?

293
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:07,063
This is all a misunderstanding.

294
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,696
Misunderstanding?

295
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:10,529
Ranma, you've
got to believe me.

296
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,329
I was just training
Ryoga so that you

297
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,063
could have a more equal
partner to work out with.

298
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:17,796
You can't very well blame
you for that, now, can you?

299
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:20,429
How can you stand
there and lie like that?

300
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:21,829
OK, I admit it.

301
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,263
I was just trying to teach you
a lesson for stealing my sweets.

302
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:25,996
Now, back off!

303
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,229
RYOGA: So Ranma's right.

304
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,263
Huh?

305
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:30,829
You were just using
me, weren't you?

306
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:31,529
SAOTOME: No.

307
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:32,663
How can you say that?

308
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,796
Why, you've always been
like a son to me, Ryoga.

309
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:40,163
And besides, why would
I lie? (LAUGHING)

310
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:44,629

AKANE: Ranma, I
brought you some tea.

312
00:20:57,596 --> 00:21:00,229
There ain't no way
in a million years

313
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:04,863
I'm ever going to forgive
Pop for what he did to me.

314
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,663
Akane, did you happen to bring
those sweets I asked for.

315
00:21:09,863 --> 00:21:12,429
No, I think we're
all out of them.

316
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:21,029
Doesn't she realize this is
how the whole mess started

317
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:22,429
in the first place?

318
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:25,696
Would somebody please tell me
why all this weird stuff always

319
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:26,663
happens to me.

320
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:34,063
Ah, Ranma, I see
you're becoming more

321
00:21:34,163 --> 00:21:36,063
like your old man every day.

go to the amusement park,
only to find that there's

326
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,496
no lunch, or any money.

327
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:22,963
Now, what do we do?

328
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:25,496
Next time on "Ranma

goes to the amusement park.
