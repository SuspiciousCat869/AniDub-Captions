break for breakfast.

-Oh yeah?

17
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:14,248

Don't I get to have

You'll be going to the same

you talking about?

00:04:10,315 --> 00:04:12,848
Ranma's your fiance remember?

36
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:16,182
You should walk him to school.

AKANE: Hey Nabiki,
that's not fair.

38

Huh?

39
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,415
Well come on then,
let's get going.

What are you waiting for?

I'll just go alone.

leave for school yet.

-I don't want you hanging
around me all the time

when we're at school,
you understand?

-Don't worry about that.

51

Hey, what'd do that for?

55
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,182
-You're in no position
to be picky about women.

-Hm?

told you 1,000 times.

Good morning.

-That's OK, don't bother.

to school as a girl, do you?

--[sigh] Oh boy, what a
way to start things off.

Hey, don't be afraid.

This is Betty, my skeleton.

How could you tell?

He's a really strong
martial artist.

He certainly doesn't
look it, does he?

you said you hated guys.

That's right, I hate boys.

you're going to be late.

-It's OK.

She knows what she's doing.

This happens every morning.

They fought for the privilege
of your company, Akane.

If they could manage
to defeat you, that is.

little, she is fierce.

Wilt thou spar with me?

-Man, you sure are popular
with the guys around here.

-Just stay out of the way,
or you're going to get hurt.

-Aren't you being awfully
familiar with Akane?

-Well, yeah.

-Who do you think you
are, insolent whelp?

Tell me how you know Akane.

KUNO: Wait.

00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:05,482
Huh?

147
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,815
-Is it not the custom to
give one's own name first?

148
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:11,748
Fine then, mine I shall give.

149

I am the undefeated captain
of this school's kendo club.

into the hearts of my enemies.

Tatewaki Kuno, age 17.

-Did he just call
himself Blue Thunder?

156
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:38,915
-Have you heard that?

157
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:41,515
-Nope, it's news to me.

158

himself Shooting Star.

00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:06,382
Here, hold my bag a sec.

167
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:09,482
And I accept your challenge.

168
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,277
-Hey, look over there.

169
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,210
Someone's trying
to take on Kuno.

170
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:36,477
-Talk about living dangerously.

171
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,410
[crowd excitement]

172
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:49,777
-The vengeance of
heaven is slow but sure.

173
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,510
-Ha.

174
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:59,410
-So, you've been
hounding Akane, eh?

175
00:13:59,444 --> 00:14:04,644
I Tatewaki Kuno shall
bring you to justice.

176
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,444
Hounding?

177
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,910
Who's hounding anybody?

178
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:11,177
-He's just staying
with my family, Kuno.

179
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:11,910
-Silence fool.

180
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,651
Blast.

181
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:33,577
[gasps] Why you
slippery little--

182
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,110
-Hey you hold on a second.

183
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,244
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

184
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:45,077
You've got the wrong
idea about me and Akane.

185
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,510
-Wow, they're so fast.

186
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:51,710
RANMA: Akane means
nothing to me.

187
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:52,877
KUNO (VOICEOVER): He's good.

188
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,077
-If you want a girl who's
more likely to kill you

189
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,377
than kiss you, then
you can have her.

190
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,644
-[growl]

191
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:07,710
-I won't allow you to
talk that way about Akane.

192
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:09,344
-Why you little scum.

193
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:10,277
-Quit that.

194
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:21,844
AKANE: Mister Saotome?

195
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:36,405
-[grunt] [crowd murmurs]

196
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,577
RANMA: What was that all about?

197
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,344
Aw, jeez, if it hadn't a rained,
I'd-- I'd have nailed that

198
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:14,944
clown one-- one--

199
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:17,677
AKANE: I wouldn't be so sure.

200
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,744
-Wha-- What do you mean?

201
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,244
-I mean your throat.

202
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:25,410
-There's a bruise?

203
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,444
From that?

204
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:36,877
Wow, and to think he didn't
touch me once, that's not bad.

205
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,244
-If he had, you'd be breathing
through your neck now.

206
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,110
Looks like a pretty even
match, wouldn't you say?

207
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:52,444
-Oh, I don't know maybe,
then again maybe not.

208
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:56,844
-Oh.

209
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,477
-So you're telling me you didn't
even feel him doing it to?

210
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,710
-And to think that I thought
Ranma Saotome was good

211
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:11,244
when he doesn't even
know how to spell.

212
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:13,844
My name is written this way.

213
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,777
-Isn't it more like this?

214
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,310
-You realize that I hate you.

215
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:28,177
-Oh, I'm so scared.

216
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:46,010
TEACHER: It seems we have a new
student here at Furinkan High.

217
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:47,944
His name is Ranma Saotome.

218
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:49,977
He's just returned
from a trip to China,

219
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,610
so let's all be sure to give
him a warm ni hao welcome.

220
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:58,077
However, that doesn't excuse
the fact that he and Akane Tendo

221
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,544
were late, so go
stand in the hall.

222
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,377
AKANE: This is your fault.

223
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,844
-How could it be
my fault, it was--

224
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:18,944
-Shh!

225
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:20,744
-It was your flight.

226
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:24,077
-Yes, but every morning I
manage to finish my fight

227
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,510
before it's time
for school to start.

228
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:29,877
-Yeah, what was that
all about anyway?

229
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,277
-At the beginning
of the semester,

230
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,077
Kuno made this stupid speech.

231
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:39,677
-The vengeance of
heaven is slow but sure.

232
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,344
If you wish to take Akane out,
you must defeat her in combat.

233
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:48,477
I Tatewaki Kuno will
permit no other terms.

234
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,810
Now am I making myself
absolutely clear?

235
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:14,277
KUNO: Fiance?

236
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,410
He's her fiance?

237
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:20,810
-Uh-huh.

238
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:22,744
My daddy and his daddy decided.

239
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:25,777
Akane's going to marry Ranma.

240
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,810
-[groan] Not Ranma!

241
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:34,777
TEACHER: Kuno, go
stand in the hall.

242
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,277
-Yes sir.

243
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:46,644
RANMA: You mean you fight
with Kuno every morning?

244
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:50,244
-And for some
reason I always win.

245
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:51,638
Somehow.

246
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,044
-Well, a lot of times when a
guy fights with a girl, he, uh,

247
00:19:57,077 --> 00:19:57,777
lets her win.

248
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,544
-Don't underestimate me.

249
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,944
Why not try me
for real sometime.

250
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:07,177
-Violent or not,
you're still a girl.

251
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,377
I don't fight girls.

252
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,777
Not even you, Akane.

253
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,177
-Well, what about
if you're a girl?

254
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,777
-Don't you dare!

255
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,777
Hey!

256
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,044
Hey, what do think you're-- Huh?

257
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:22,877
AKANE: Oh Kuno, not again.

258
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,277
-Never Ranma Saotome.

259
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,344
I shall never accept
your engagement to Akane.

260
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:29,610
-Shh!

261
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:30,944
-No, no, no, no.

262
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:36,644
-I Tatewaki Kuno shall never
allow it. [crowd excitement]

263
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:44,377
-Wait, it's not true.

264
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,144
It's--

265
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,244
-Our parents decided.

266
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:47,877
We never--

267
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,044
-Watch out.

268
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:57,477
-Stand your ground.
[crowd gasps]

269
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,344
-This is no place
to fight, Kuno.

270
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:01,077
If you want to fight,
then follow me.

271
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,644
-That I shall. [crowd murmurs]

272
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,910
-They have got to be kidding.

273
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:24,810
-Here's a nice shortcut.

274
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:28,210
-[yells] [screams]

275
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,610
-But this is the third floor.

276
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:34,010
-Don't worry Akane,
it's not a problem.

277
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:34,510
Whoa!

278
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,893
Water!

279
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:40,560
Why does it always
have to be water?

280
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,262
-Ranma?

281
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:13,382
