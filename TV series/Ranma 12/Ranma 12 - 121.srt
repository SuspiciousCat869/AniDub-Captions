Yeah.

attacks the guide

with some pantyhose
or something,

18
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:39,340
and makes off with a list of
everyone who's been there.

But still, why would
someone do that?

00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:45,807
I can't imagine it would
have monetary value.

21
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:48,473
It's probably got
nothing to do with money.

22
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:51,073
It's maybe revenge or
something like that.

00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,240
Well, attacking with
pantyhose, though?

That's just weird.

25

If it were your
pantyhose, Akane,

26

you could attack me any time.

340
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:22,948
Hm!

341
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,873
Ranma?

342
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:32,140
You wake up.

343
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,207
Shampoo!

344
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:33,840
Mousse!

345
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,373
Why are you here?

346
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:39,407
With an enemy so strong,
we may as well join forces.

347
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:42,407
Shampoo come help
Akane in hour of need.

348
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,240
I wonder if that's really true.

349
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,140
You're planning
something, aren't you?

350
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,807
Hm!

351
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:54,140
Shows what you know.

352
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,740
Haven't you any
friends of your own?

353
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,107
Friends of my--

354
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,940
We've known each
other longer than that.

355
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,573
It's too, too sad
have no friends.

356
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:08,473
I-- I'm sorry.

357
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,607
Forgive me for being a cynic.

358
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:13,507
There nothing to forgive.

359
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,207
MOUSSE (VOICEOVER):
Once Ranma's weakened

360
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:18,140
by fighting with that
monster, I'll take my chance

361
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,873
and steal Shampoo right
from under his nose!

362
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:22,673
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER):
Once Shampoo forgotten

363
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:25,073
in all the fighting,
she take her chance

364
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,940
and make Akane a goner.

365
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:36,740
AKANE TENDO: It's
such a big bonfire.

366
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,773
Won't it just lead
them right to us?

367
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:40,173
Exactly.

368
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,173
Excuse me.

369
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,007
Have you forgotten
our conversation?

370
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:47,873
I don't think you'd like
Ranma when he's really angry.

371
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:49,207
I'm serious!

372
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:51,373
Ranma is a lot more than strong.

373
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:54,773
He's persistent, which
is actually even better.

374
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:56,807
Is he?

375
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,307
I suppose we'll see, won't we?

376
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,373
He's taunting us.

377
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,007
He wants to make sure we
know right where he is.

378
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:11,307
And he acts like he
beat us no problem.

379
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:12,740
That's where he's wrong.

380
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,673
That confidence will cost him.

381
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,073
RANMA SAOTOME (VOICEOVER):
Hang on, Akane.

382
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:21,707
We're coming for you.

383
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:22,673
Let's do it!

384
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:23,440
Let's do it!

385
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,307
Yeah!

386
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:28,173
[music playing]

387
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:44,107
[theme music]

388
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,994
NARRATOR: Everyone's got
something in their past,

389
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:21,994
but what could this
pantyhose guy be hiding?

390
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:27,028
Next time on "Ranma 1/2," "The
Demon From Jusenkyo, Part Two."

391
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:29,461
We'll see you there!
