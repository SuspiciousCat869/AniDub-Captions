Vo: Ranma!

502
00:19:56,322 --> 00:20:00,188
RANMA (VOICEOVER): The mistake
I made was underestimating him.

Come on!

What's the matter?

506
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:03,655
Am I too much for you?

507
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:08,722
Running away, eh?

508

-Ranma!

-The Chestnut Fist is a lot
more than just speed and power.

511
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:22,122
It's also about the amount
of soul you put into it.

-Uh?

you a taste of the real thing?

By concentrating your focus
on nothing but fighting,

you were able to produce
a technique that even

Copycat Ken couldn't imitate.

526
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:52,888
It just goes to show
that a copy's a copy,

527
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:55,155
but the real thing's authentic.

-Hm.

I'm not sure "incredible"
