AKANE (VOICEOVER):
School is a battlefield.

4
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:42,463
Ranma versus Ryoga.

5
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,529
-It's done.

6
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:02,896
Finished at last.

00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:04,796
[laughter]

8
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,829
-This is a masterpiece
of modern science.

9
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:14,429
This is a work of modern art.

KEN CLUB MEMBER: We did it!

KEN CLUB MEMBER: It's working!

13
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:25,096
KEN CLUB MEMBER: It's perfect!

RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Ranma!

17
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,896
I will have my
revenge against you!

18
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,163
It was you who
destroyed my life.

19
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:06,796
I'm going to crush your
windpipe just like this walnut.

20
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:08,763
Just you wait and see, Ranma.

21
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:13,729
(SHOUTING) Ranma!

-Huh?

25
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:31,129
-You're sure there's
no other reason?

26
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:32,696
-Hmm.

27
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,696
If it's not about the
bread feud, then--

[footsteps]

-Hm?

30
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,463
-Ranma, here's a letter for you.

31
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,429
It's from someone named Hibiki.

32
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:43,929
-From Ryoga?

33
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:52,296
-It's like I said before.

34
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,863
This is no ordinary grudge.

35
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:56,863
You really must have done
something terrible to him.

36
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,163
-Hm, you got me.

37
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:05,496
-Ha!

38
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,296
Got you in check.

00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:14,996
MALE SPEAKER: No way.

41
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:18,529
-Ah, Ranma.

42
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:20,696
It says here the
challenge was yesterday.

43
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:22,263
-Ah, don't worry about it.

44
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:25,129
The guy's totally clueless
when it comes to maps and stuff

45
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:25,963
like that.

46
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:29,196
Who knows where he is by now.

47
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:31,096
-So Tokyo is this way, you say?

48
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,729
-I dun told you it's this way.

49
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:36,763
You don't hear too good, do you boy?

50
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:37,396
-I'm sorry.

51
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:43,863
Sorry!

52
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:44,363
Sorry.

53
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:04,424
-I can't believe it, Akane.

54
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:06,124
Your hair's grown so long!

55
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:08,824
-I know, and it
looks so healthy too!

56
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:11,024
-Hm.

57
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,224
AKANE (VOICEOVER): It's
finally longer than Kasui's.

FEMALE STUDENT: Hey,
isn't that-- you

59
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,490
know, that guy from before?

60
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:24,990
-Huh?

61
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,790
Uh-oh.

62
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:34,690
Ranma!

63
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,190
-What?

64
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:37,057
[gasping]

65
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,324
-At last, I've made it!

66
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:45,490
Ranma Saotome.

67
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:49,557
Today is the day I send you
to hell-- a hell so deep,

68
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,057
it swallows the light.

69
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,457
A hell so lonely, you'll
become a tortured soul,

70
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,790
suffering through all
eternity. [laughter]

71
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:06,757
-Hey!

72
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,790
You OK?

73
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:08,790
-What do you think
you're doing standing

74
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:10,224
in the middle of
the field like that?

75
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:11,557
-Hey, he's not moving.

76
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,390
-You know what they say
about head injuries.

77
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:15,390
-We better take him
to the nurses' office.

78
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:17,057
-What is with that guy?

79
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,790
-W-Wait a minute.

80
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,457
MALE SPECTATOR:
Come here, you guys!

81
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,524
Looks like Saotome's
gonna take that guy on!

82
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:35,890
FEMALE SPECTATOR: Ooh-- a duel!

83
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:37,857
It's so romantic.

84
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,324
NABIKI: Step right up!

85
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,724
Ladies and gentlemen, come on.

86
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:41,690
Place your bets!

87
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:42,957
Place your bets!

88
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,724
Ryoga or Ranma?

89
00:06:43,757 --> 00:06:44,624
Place your bets.

90
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,057
Win a bundle!

91
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:51,290
Gotcha covered!

92
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,224
OK, wait your turn.

93
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:53,890
Get in line.

94
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:55,590
Who's next?

95
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,024
-Welcome, Ranma.

96
00:06:57,057 --> 00:07:00,090
What cunning you showed
in escaping last time.

97
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:01,757
-Who are you talking about?

98
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,524
You're the one who wandered
off and got lost, Ryoga.

99
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,224
-Hey, shut up!

100
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:09,524
What would you know
about it anyway?

101
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,124
That was a month ago.

102
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:14,057
I've travelled
the deep blue sea.

103
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:18,790
Ranma!

104
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,290
It was already
summertime in Okinawa.

105
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:31,124
And then there were those
weeks I was lost in the jungle.

106
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:38,257
Thought I was going
to die for sure.

107
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,057
Now, we're going to
settle this-- for good!

108
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,490
-I dunno what to
tell you, Ryoga.

109
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:46,757
-You're damn right.

110
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,557
You've got no right
to say anything

111
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,857
to me, not after
what you've done.

112
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,090
-That's not what I
meant, you idiot.

113
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,524
-I've heard enough of
your talking already.

114
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:56,024
Fight!

115
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,490
-Can you at least tell
me why we're fighting?

116
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:07,124
-Shut up!

117
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:10,924
-Have it your way.

118
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,790
-Oh, it's so scary.

119
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:21,990
-Ok, the take is 11,473 yen.

120
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,724
Looks like they've all
placed their bets on Ranma.

121
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:27,090
-You sure you know what
you're doing, Nibiki?

122
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:31,424
-If Ranma wins, it's going
to bankrupt us for sure.

123
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:32,790
-Trust me, ladies.

124
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,290
I'm a professional.

125
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:37,224
[grunting]

126
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:43,624
-Hey, I just thought
of something.

127
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:48,990
If that guy kills Saotome,
then Akane's not a-- you know--

128
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:55,657
-Not engaged anymore.

129
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,657
Which means that Akane
would be free to become--

130
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,424
-Become our chemistry
club's-- well, you know.

131
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,257
[laughter]

132
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,224
-Take this, you coward!

133
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,490
-(SURPRISED) What?

134
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:18,724
-These ought to prevent you
from escaping me again, Ranma.

135
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:22,590
-How many times do I have
to tell I didn't run away?

136
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:24,590
Huh?

137
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:26,590
Ha!

138
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:27,090
-Ugh.

139
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,557
MALE SPECTATOR 1:
Hey, check it out!

140
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,524
MALE SPECTATOR 2: He
fights as good as Saotome!

141
00:09:44,024 --> 00:09:46,724
MALE SPECTATOR 1: Hey, get
a load of this umbrella.

142
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:50,057
[groans]

143
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,590
-What's wrong?

144
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,357
MALE SPECTATOR 2: That
thing weighs a ton!

145
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,757
[groans]

146
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,124
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
And he carries

147
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:00,457
this thing around one-handed?

148
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,457
-Fight!

149
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,957
-[gasp] Ranma!

150
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,424
Don't get too close to him!

151
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:07,424
Stay away from him!

152
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:13,324
-That's it.

153
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,124
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

154
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,424
[knocking]

155
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,624
-Excuse me, Captain Kuno.

156
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,890
But Saotome's fighting
with a really strong guy.

157
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:29,090
Don't want to come and watch?

158
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,490
-Silence, wretch!

159
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:33,857
Do not disturb my meditation.

160
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,857
Ah.

161
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,190
Ah.

162
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:40,424
Akane!

163
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:42,157
Pig-tailed girl!

164
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,190
I-I-- no!

165
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:49,190
Whichever shall I choose?
[shouts] I love them both!

166
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:50,657

170
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:07,805
Ranma!

171
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:11,638
Don't get too close to him!

-Oh, now you get serious.

Don't make me laugh.

I do with you now?

-Oh, no!

00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,405
Ranma's gonna win for sure.

according to plan.

Positions, everyone!

195
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:46,171
Ranma, this is the best
mine the Ken club can build.

it to the fullest!

-We've got one last resort.

206

If we can force Saotome to
breathe in the fumes created

by the introduction of calcium

You're sucking up
our secret weapon.

At this point, only the combined
might of the entire Ken club

can hope to bring
down the evil Ranma.

-Akane's been made happy--

Let's go.

They've left the school grounds.

Careful not to lose him, ladies.

-How's about it, Ryoga?

00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,338
Had enough, or
did you want more?

We're on your side.

Have you ever heard of steroids?

233
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,805
Take these tablets and your
strength will increase tenfold.

-W-what?

-Here.

strongest man in the world.

Think how do strong,
you'll have no rival.

You're an Atlas!

You are a tiger!

-I can feel the strength
flowing through me!

244

I can feel the power.

00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:07,805
I'm burning with it!

246
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:08,771
I can win.

247
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:09,571
I can win!

248
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,271
How about it, Saotome?

249
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:18,971
Fight me, fair and square.

250
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,671
-Y-you call that
fair and square?

-Enough talking.

-Uh, Nibiki.

Those are just vitamin
tablets we gave him, right?

-You've got to be kidding.

Don't let those animals escape.

days are over, Ranma.

-Hey!

You just wrecked my
favorite shirt, Ryoga.

-This is a duel, you coward.

Don't you start
talking like a girl.

thing like that?

Since when is having a beautiful
body like yours a curse?

Be a good boy and come to papa.

336
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:03,885
-(SIMULTANEOUSLY) Why you--!

337
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,885
-Forget it.

338
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,252
-Yeah.

339
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:07,719
-Why'd you have to butt in?

340
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,919
Who needs you anyway?

341
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,419
-But you can't beat
him in your girl form!

342
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:13,585
That's why--

343
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,185
-There you go
again-- butting in.

344
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:17,685
Don't poke your nose into
a fight between two guys!

345
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,685
-Where?

346
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,752
I don't see any
guys-- just perverts!

347
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,552
-Of all the nerve--
picking up a girl now.

348
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:21,519
RANMA: Ah-- shut up, Akane!

349
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,185
AKANE: God, you're such a jerk!

350
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:24,619
All I did was worry about you.

351
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:25,385
RANMA: Well, don't!

352
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:26,152
I'm a guy.

353
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,785
I can take care of myself.

354
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:28,585
AKANE: How could
you call yourself

355
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:29,619
a guy with a body like that?

356
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:31,985
I don't even know
why I bothered to--

357
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:32,919
-(BOTH) Huh?

358
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:39,219
-What the-- oh-- watch out!

359
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,419
-Let me go!

360
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:43,619
-I ain't holding you cause
I like you or nothing!

361
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:44,452
Get real.

362
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,019
-If I'm such a
bother to you, then,

363
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:58,119
why don't you just-- [sigh]

364
00:20:58,152 --> 00:20:58,919
-Ah--!

365
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:01,219
-Ignore me, will you?

366
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:02,652
-Butt out.

367
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:03,185
Akane!

368
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:11,752
-I-- uh-- I mean,
I-- I--I'm s-sor-- uh

369
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:12,985
-Don't bother.

370
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:14,785
I really couldn't care less.

371
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:16,685
I want nothing to do with you!

372
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:28,819
[gasp]

373
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:34,219
[gasp]

374
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,552
[music playing]

375
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,060
[music playing]

376
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:40,445
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Ranma, you jerk!

377
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:43,711
How dare you do this to my hair?

378
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:47,645
On top of that, Ryoga is coming
for you at the training hall.

379
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,478
None of you
understand how I feel.

380
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:53,445
Next time on Ranma
1/2, true confessions.

381
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:55,378
A girl's hair is her life.

382
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:57,511
See you there.
