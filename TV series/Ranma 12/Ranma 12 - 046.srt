Sorry.

00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:34,295
Off to work!

4
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:37,461
Some of us have to work
for a living, you know.

5
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:39,661
-Jeez, why's he in such a hurry?

6
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,028
-Why must he be this way?

00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:56,061
-Drink your tea, Father.

11
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:57,528
It's getting cold.

12
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,795
-He's been like this
ever since he got home.

13
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:01,728
-Today was the day
that the town council

14
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,528
met to decide on
the new chairman.

15
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:07,095
I wonder if something
happened to Father there?

16
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:08,261
-Wow.

17
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:10,428
Do you think Dad
volunteered for it?

18
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:13,128
-Why would he want to do
something stupid like that?

19
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:16,428
-But Father would have been
so perfect for the job.

20
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,395
Everyone needs to be
good at something.

21
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:21,595
And Father certainly
has nothing else to do.

00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:25,061
-You've got it wrong!

23
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:27,395
It isn't that simple.

24
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:29,295
You see--

25
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:30,828
-It's like this, gentlemen.

26
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:34,095
We can't have a summer
festival without a budget.

27
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,928
And we can't have
a summer budget

without a special summer,
uh-- budget chairman, eight?

00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,628
Can anyone recommend
someone suitable?

30
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:45,528
-Uh, gee, well, why look any
further when we've already

31
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:47,328
got the perfect man for the job?

32
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,928
-Oh, no.

33
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,095
-A hero for the masses.

34
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:51,761
That's Soun Tendo.

35
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:52,595
-Oh, come now.

36
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:54,095
Surely you needn't go that far.

37
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:57,095
-Oh, but you forget how well
we know you in this town.

38
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,661
Your ability to remain
calm in a crisis

39
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:04,628
is the stuff of local legend.

40
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:09,695
-Yeah, and, uh, don't forget
his, uh, physical prowess.

41
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:10,361
-Thank you.

42
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:11,695
Thank you very much.

43
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:15,928
-You might say this job
was made for you, Tendo.

44
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:19,328
-It happened so quickly.

-Dad, that's great!

00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,528
-Congratulations, Father.

47
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,295
-Sounds more like
you got railroaded.

48
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:25,861
But congrats anyway.

49
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:28,695
-You don't know the
half of it, son.

50
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:32,195
-We're sure you're eager
to assume your new duties.

51
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:33,628
-Just let me at that budget.

52
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,861
-Budget?

53
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,728
No, first you need to catch
us that underwear thief.

54
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,561
-Did you say underwear thief?

55
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,561
-Surely you've
heard of him, Tendo.

56
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:43,595
There's been quite a few
complaints, you know.

57
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:47,295
You won't let us
down, will you, Tendo?

58
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,961
Ha ha!

59
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:52,861
-It's not that I don't
appreciate their faith in me.

60
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:56,195
But how am I to stop
the master's crimes?

61
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:59,095
What if they discover I've
been harboring the underwear

62
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:00,928
thief all along?

63
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:04,195
What if the master were to
take advantage of my position

64
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:05,561
for his own evil ends?

65
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:09,861
What will become of this
poor, defenseless town?

66
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:11,228
-Let me guess.

67

meals, and be nice to a freak

00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:15,495
-Cut it out.

70
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,095
Can't you see he's upset?

71
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:18,628
Dad, don't worry.

72
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,595
They'll never connect
those things to you.

73
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:22,228
And besides, maybe
he'll be good.

74
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:23,495
-Face it.

75
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:25,061
If the master finds
out, I'm a dead man.

76
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:28,028
Ranma, promise me you won't
breathe a word of this

77
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,461
to the master!

78
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,328
You either, Akane.

00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,061
-Dad, don't worry.

-Welcome to politics.

81
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:36,195
Gee, Daddy, do I get a
kick back in my allowance?

82
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,928
-Welcome home, Nabiki.

83
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:39,728
-How did you know that?

84
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,461
-Hey, if you'd
wanted to be modest,

85
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:43,028
why'd you put that
sign up outside?

86
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:48,828
-Ahh!

87
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:52,728
Saotome!

88
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,261
How could you do this to me?

89
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,528
What have I ever
done to deserve this?

90
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:01,161
-Advertise, why don't you?

91
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,095
-It's a bit too much, isn't it?

92
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:04,461
-Tell me something.

93
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:06,528
What if the Master should
happen to see that?

94
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:09,361
-Chairman Soun, eh?

95
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:10,061
Way to go.

97
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:14,361
-Please, Master.

98
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:16,861
This isn't easy for
me to say, but I--

99
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:18,128
-Can the melodrama.

100
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,461
I understand.

101
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,895
You worry you'll be like
to this underwear thief.

102
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:23,328
-You do understand.

103
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,828
-Then you respect my position?

104
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:26,828
-Of course.

105
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,528
What, you think
just because I like

106
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:30,295
to steal women's
underwear that I'm

107
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:32,628
some kind of unfeeling monster?

00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,461
-That's right.

111
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:42,161
Which is why I'm coming
along on your nightly rounds!

112
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:45,928
Hurry up!

113
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,095
You're falling behind!

114
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,595
-Please, Master.

115
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,761
How are we to prevent any
crimes unless we slow down

116
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:55,528
to see them?

117
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:56,828
-Don't be an idiot.

118
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:59,195
We're here to commit
crimes, not prevent 'em.

119
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:02,195
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

120
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:04,095
Fetch, Genma!

121
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:05,561
-Yes, sir.

122
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:06,976
Ahh!

123
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,728
-Have you gone mad, Saotome?

124
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:13,128
-Sorry, Tendo.

125
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,961
I guess I got a little carried
away in the heat of the moment.

126
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:16,095
-Come on, you two.

127
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:16,861
Time's a-wasting.

128
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:21,928
All right.

129
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:22,895
Mm, lacey.

130
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,161
-Please, Master.

131
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,795
Put up the lantern so they
can't make a positive ID.

132
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:29,195
-How the heck else am I
supposed to do my work, huh?

133
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:30,761
-But this isn't work, Master.

134
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:32,961
It's an offense punishable by
state and local authorities.

135
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,461
And if they catch--

136
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,961
-Why you gotta always
be so negative?

137
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:37,795
That's right.

138
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:38,828
Load 'em up, boys.

139
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:41,361
Throw 'em in there.

140
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,961
-Ladies and gentlemen
of the town council,

141
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,795
it's with great sadness
that I, Soun Tendo,

142
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:47,228
tender to you my
official resignation.

143
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:53,228
-Nothing like the satisfaction
of a job well done, huh boys?

144
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:54,461
What do you say?

145
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,028
In thanks for your
help, why don't you

146
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:59,828
just go ahead and hang on to
your share of tonight's haul?

147
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:01,528
It's the least I can do.

148
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:04,628
No underwear thief's gonna
slip by with us on the job,

149
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:05,795
eh, Soun?

150
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:06,295
-They won't?

151
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:07,561
-Course not.

152
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:08,728
Which is why we'll
do it again tomorrow!

153
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:13,461
-Tendo?

154
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,828
-They said you were
looking for me.

155
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:20,761
Hm?

156
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,295
Jeez, what's the
matter with him?

157
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:23,661
-I don't know.

158
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,361
But my guess is that
Happosai has got something

159
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:27,161
to do with it.

160
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:28,061
-Help me.

161
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,095
Please, son.

162
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,995
I've got nowhere else to turn.

163
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:32,195
-Uh--

164
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,428
-Ah, yes.

165
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:36,095
Oh, so lovely.

166
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:40,795
Still, why does it always seem
that there's something missing?

167
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:43,795
For some reason I'm just
not enjoying it as much

168
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,328
as I used to.

169
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,895
Maybe if I started passing
over the smaller sizes.

170
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:51,261
Going for silk, instead
of cotton-- huh?

171
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:51,861
Ranma?

172
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,095
Quit it!

173
00:08:58,128 --> 00:08:59,495
Stop following me!

174
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:01,661
-Hey, it ain't my idea of
a good time, either, OK?

175
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,495
-Then why don't you leave
me alone and-- oh, hacha!

176
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:08,828
Will you get a load
of that/ How sweet!

177
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:09,795
-Oh no you don't.

178
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:15,995
No you don't!

179
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:18,295
I said no!

180
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:21,628
-Why you-- why can't
you leave me to my work?

181
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,661
-I'm sorry, gramps,
but I can't do that.

182
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,295
-Oh, so that's the
way it is, is it?

183
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:26,828
Well, name your price.

184
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:28,195
What's it gonna take?

185
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,661
Will one of these
change your mind?

186
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,528
-No thanks.

187
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:34,861
I can't be bought!

188
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:35,661
-Hurry up, slowpoke!

189
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:36,861
-Get back here, you little--

190
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:37,861
-Catch me if you can!

191
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,661
Woo-hoo!

192
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:40,916
-Come here!

193
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:45,395
-You couldn't catch
a cold at that rate!

194
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:51,995
Oh, Ranma.

195
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:52,961
Come here, cupcake.

196
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:55,295
Try this one on.

197
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,495
-That's it.

198
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:58,895
They'll be coming
for me any minute.

199
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:01,228
[sobbing]

200
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:02,561
-Father?

201
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:04,228
The former chairman's
downstairs to see you.

202
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:07,095
-I'm ruined!

203
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:07,995
Hello there.

204
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:09,395
What brings you here?

205
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:11,361
-Wait up, you little freak!

206
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:14,395
-What was that that just
ran by on the patio?

207
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:15,028
-Nothing.

208
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:16,328
Nothing.

209
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:17,328
-Keep 'em shaking--

210
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,395
-You little pervert!

211
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:22,128
-Excuse me, but you're
kind of hurting my neck.

212
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:23,028
-Here's your tea.

213
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,495
-Why thank you, my dear.

214
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:26,228
I'm sorry to bother you at
this time of night, Tendo,

215
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:28,461
but you know, it's just
the darnedest thing.

216
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,195
When you were elected
into town office

217
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:33,328
we thought for sure that this
underwear thievery would stop.

218
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,328
But it's only gotten
worse, not better.

219
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,728
We're at a real loss here.

220
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,428
-Sir, I don't know what to say.

221
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,261
I know that I've let you down--

222
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:42,361
-Now, now, that's
not why I'm here.

223
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:44,395
The fact is, Soun,
old boy, we're

224
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,228
more worried
something might happen

225
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,528
to one of our local treasures.

226
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,728
-Local treasures?

227
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,261
-You know, it's one of
those historical artifacts.

228
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,328
A lady's brassiere, actually.

229
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:59,095
It's stored in an
antique shop downtown.

230
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,095
-A lady's brassiere, you say?

231
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,161
MASTER (VOICEOVER): A
lady's brassiere, is it?

232
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,631
-But it's more than
a local treasure.

233
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:25,831
Some people even believe
it has magical powers.

234
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:27,964
-Well, them, whose
antique store is it?

235
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:28,997
-Actually, it's mine.

236
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:30,264
-So you're the proprietor, then.

237
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:31,631
-Which is all the
more reason I'm

238
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:33,597
worried the thief will
attempt a break-in.

239
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:36,231
You see, I'll be out
of town for a few days.

240
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:39,831
And I need someone
to look after it.

241
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:40,797
-Very well.

242
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:41,664
I'll do whatever I can.

243
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:43,431
-I knew I could count on you.

244
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:45,164
Well, then, since
you'll be guarding it,

245
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:47,297
there's something
you should know.

246
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,097
-I'm listening.

247
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:48,997
Huh?

248
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:49,897
-I ain't your doormat.

249
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:50,697
How dare you step on me?

250
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:51,331
-Shh.

251
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:52,564
Lower your voice.

252
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:54,331
They're just getting
to the good part!

253
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,297
-Lower this, you little-- ah!

254
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:59,264
-What an amateur.

255
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:00,797
-What's going on out there?

256
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:04,864
-Oh, I'm sure it's nothing
we need to be concerned with.

257
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:07,164
Quickly, before we're
interrupted again.

258
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:08,064
Whisper it to me.

259
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,697
MASTER (VOICEOVER): Who do
they think they're fooling?

260
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,864
If I want that bra
it's as good as gone.

261
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,131
-Be careful out there.

262
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:21,664
-It's obvious why
Ranma has to go,

263
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:23,497
but why do I have to tag along?

264
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,031
-What is that supposed to mean?

265
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,431
-It's a bra, isn't it?

266
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:28,097
Aren't you always showing
yours off to Happosai?

267
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:28,997
-You bet she does.

268
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,831
OK if I tag along, too?

269
00:12:30,864 --> 00:12:34,664
-Actually, Master, you're the
one we'll be guarding it from.

270
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:35,597
-Why, I never!

271
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,364
What are you insinuating?

272
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:38,264
-I'm sorry, Master.

273
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:39,797
But the answer is no.

274
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:43,097
We can't risk letting you near
a bra, much less this one.

275
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:43,731
-No fair!

276
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,564
No fair!

277
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,464
Why are you being so mean to me?

278
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:47,931
-Cry all you like, Master.

279
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,597
I'm afraid it'll do you no good.

280
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:55,497
-Dad, I was so proud of you.

281
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:58,131
You didn't let him
push you around.

282
00:12:58,164 --> 00:12:59,664
-I was really
something, wasn't I?

283
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,797
Ah, well, it won't do much good.

284
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:02,497
He'll come.

285
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,831
He can't help himself.

286
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:06,164
I may have brought us
some time, that's all.

287
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:07,497
-You know, Tendo,
maybe things are

288
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:10,097
starting to turn around for us.

289
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:11,364
-Who knows, Saotome?

290
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:12,597
You may be right.

291
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:13,831
MASTER (VOICEOVER):
Laugh it up, boys.

292
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:15,764
I'll have that bra
before you know it.

293
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,231
-Cursed antique shop, eh?

294
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:22,131
-Whoa.

295
00:13:22,164 --> 00:13:22,964
Just like that TV show.

296
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:31,664
-There it is!

297
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:33,397
The brassiere.

298
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:36,831
-Uh, you'd better let
me have a look see.

299
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:37,897
-Hey!

300
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,664
What do you think
you're doing, Saotome?

301
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:40,931
-Aw, come on.

302
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:42,331
A little peek won't hurt.

303
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,331
-Absolutely not.

304
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,664
-Don't be so stingy, Tendo.

305
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:50,031
-You're acting
like the old freak.

306
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,564
[crash]

307
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:58,031
-Quick, we've gotta catch
the freak before he--

308
00:13:58,064 --> 00:13:59,397
[shouting]

309
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:01,097
We're too late!

310
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,064
-Master, please.

311
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:03,097
You mustn't open that box.

312
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:03,797
-Yeah.

313
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:04,931
Nice try.

314
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:07,264
I heard everything you
said, so me and my bra

315
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:08,731
will be leaving now.

316
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,697
-Wait up, you little freak.

317
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:13,931
-Master, please.

318
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,097
Listen to me!

319
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:16,864
Whatever you do,
don't open that box!

320
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,764
-So when do hear the
rest of the story?

321
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:20,531
-After him!

322
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:30,097
-Why can't they mind
their own business?

323
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:30,931
-OK, gramps.

324
00:14:30,964 --> 00:14:32,031
Hand over the bra.

325
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:32,764
-I don't wanna!

326
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:33,631
-I'm gonna--

327
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,364
-Gonna what?

328
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:36,431
-That's enough, you two.

329
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:38,597
Ranma, that's quite enough.

330
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,097
-What do you mean,
that's enough?

331
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:42,097
-Yeah, what do you mean?

332
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,231
-Just like I said, children.

333
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:45,031
Let's let the
Master have the bra.

334
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:50,397
-You really mean that?

335
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,297
-Of course I do, Master.

336
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:55,364
Why, you're a martial
artist too, aren't you?

337
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:56,831
We'll let you guard it.

338
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:57,897
-What do you know?

339
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,164
I take back those
things I said about you.

340
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,631
I'll take good care of it, boys.

341
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:06,597
Ooh.

342
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:10,931
What a beauty!

343
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:14,231
I was right to pass up
on those smaller sizes.

344
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:15,964
Oh, whoa, what is it doing?

345
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:19,864
I can't-- I've got-- ah-- hey!

346
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:21,664
Who turned out the lights?

347
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,697
I can't--

348
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:24,797
-[mumbling].

349
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:27,497
I mean, that's just what
I was worried about.

350
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:29,864
-Now what are you
babbling about?

351
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,631
-That isn't just an
ordinary bra, Master.

352
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,231
It's a cursed item
said to have belonged

353
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:36,731
to an evil, jealous woman named
Yohkihi who killed any man who

354
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:38,831
dared to look at
any woman but her.

355
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:39,397
Oh, the evil!

356
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,297
Oh, the terror!

357
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,097
-Will he ever be
able to take it off?

358
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:45,864
-It's Yohkihi's curse that you
never look at another woman

359
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:47,197
again.

360
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:48,531
You'll wear that bra for
the rest of your life.

361
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:50,031
Please forgive me, Master.

362
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:52,364
You've left me no choice!

363
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:53,831
-Stop grovelling.

364
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:56,297
Since it's such a cute bra
I'll let you off the hook

365
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,631
and forgive you.

366
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:03,964
It really is a cute
one, too, isn't it?

367
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,831
Whoa, what's-- what's going on?

368
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:08,797
-Who disturbs my slumber?

369
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:09,764
-What's happening?

370
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:10,531
-Look!

371
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,564
It's the ghost of Yohkihi!

372
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,031
-Where?

373
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:13,797
Where?

374
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:14,764
I can't see her.

375
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:15,731
-Ugh!

376
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:17,164
Is he the one who--
how revolting.

377
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:17,997
Forget it.

378
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:19,597
The bra comes off.

379
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:20,131
-Hey!

380
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:20,931
Put it back!

381
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,164
Huh?

382
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:22,931
Wow.

383
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,231
What a looker.

384
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:25,997
Come here, baby!

385
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,397
-Get away from me, you freak!

386
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:34,164
It's been a while, but
it hasn't been that long.

387
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:35,097
Ooh.

388
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:37,197
Now he's more my type.

389
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,897
-You mean me?

390
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,464
-Come to mama, little boy.

391
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:43,931
-Ranma, what's the matter?

392
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:44,531
Ranma?

393
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:51,697
Hey, you leave him alone!

394
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:54,064
-Stay back, girl!

395
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,797
-Akane!

396
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:56,697
Huh?

397
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:57,997
[laughing]

398
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:01,931
-That's right.

399
00:17:01,964 --> 00:17:02,931
Come to mama.

400
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:04,197
-Stop!

401
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,697
You mustn't hurt an
innocent bystander.

402
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:08,497
Allow me to accept whatever
you had planned for him.

403
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:11,864
-I have no interest
in old men or pandas!

404
00:17:14,797 --> 00:17:15,364
-Ahh!

405
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,531
-Come here, sexy.

406
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:23,731
-I'm right here, sugar-lips!

407
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:26,597
So, how'd you like
my instant face-lift?

408
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,664
Whaddaya say me and
you go somewhere-- agh!

409
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:33,064
-I told you, I'm
not that desperate.

410
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:35,264
Let's continue
where we left off.

411
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:37,497
I believe you were
about to kiss me.

412
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:38,431
Ah!

413
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:41,231
-Well, are you
gonna kiss or not?

414
00:17:41,264 --> 00:17:41,931
-You're female!

415
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,831
-Sorry to disappoint ya.

416
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,697
What's the matter, your
tricks only work on boys?

417
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:50,097
-I'm going to silence that
impertinent tongue of yours

418
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:50,997
for good!

419
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:51,997
Take this!

420
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:00,097
-Ranma.

421
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:01,464
-Foolish mortal!

422
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,597
Taste the wrath of Yohkihi!

423
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:13,431
Haha!

424
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:17,831
I'll squeeze the life
out of both of you!

425
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,197
-I can't breathe.

426
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,764
-Akane, hang in there.

427
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:26,597
RANMA (VOICEOVER): There's
gotta be some way that we can--

428
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:27,564
-Ranma!

429
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:28,264
Akane!

430
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:29,231
-Here!

431
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:31,097
Bring the hot water, Pop!

432
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:32,631
-Ranma, don't do it.

433
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:34,997
If you turn into a boy
she'll hypnotize you again.

434
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,597
-What other choice do I got?

435
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:37,097
Hurry up.

436
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:38,631
The water!

437
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:41,331
-Yohkihi, baby!

438
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:42,764
Gimme some sugar, baby!

439
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:51,597
-Oh, well.

440
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,153
Huh?

441
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:57,197
-My love, it's you!

442
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,197
-Hm?

443
00:18:58,231 --> 00:18:59,497
-Oh, my love.

444
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,064
How I've longed for
you through the years.

445
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:04,397
-I'm not who you think I am.

446
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:06,297
I'm just a middle-aged nobody!

447
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:08,164
-Come back, my love.

448
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:09,231
-Oh, phew!

449
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,297
What disgusting taste.

450
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,297
-Careful.

451
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:12,531
She could be your ancestor.

452
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:13,331
-Ugh.

453
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:15,264
-That Saotome's one sly fox.

454
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:16,564
-Unforgivable.

455
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:19,264
How dare he flirt with
his master's woman?

456
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:21,364
[scream]

457
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,797
-You're-- a panda!

458
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:29,097
-Yohkihi, baby--

459
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:30,397
-Get it off of me!

460
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,797
-We're cursed to be
together, remember?

461
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:34,764
Come on.

462
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:36,731
Oh, please, honey.

463
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:38,097
-I can't bear it!

464
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:38,864
Bound!

465
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,064
For eternity!

466
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,631
-Get it off of me!

467
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:49,631
-Look.

468
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:50,464
Dad, she's gone.

469
00:19:54,764 --> 00:19:56,431
-Yohkihi, baby!

470
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:57,964
Please come back!

471
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,497
I'll be good!

472
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:05,031
Oh, at least I have
this to remember her by.

473
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:08,731
-The bra!

474
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:09,897
-It's dissolving!

475
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:14,264
-She-- she won't even
leave me that much.

476
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,864
[sobbing]

477
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:20,964
I can't stay here.

478
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:22,231
Gotta go away.

479
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,331
Gotta get myself together.

480
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:25,331
-Master, no.

481
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:27,297
-Don't try to stop me.

482
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:28,131
I gotta go.

483
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,164
-Say it isn't so.

484
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,431
-Don't expect us to stop you.

485
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,097
-Oh, say it isn't so!

486
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:33,697
-Farewell.

487
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:50,864
-It's a beautiful day in the
neighborhood, eh, Saotome?

488
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:55,464
-For the first time in
years, we're at peace.

489
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:57,564
-Well, the Master is
indeed formidable.

490
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:59,931
But I'd have to say
this round went to us,

491
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:01,231
wouldn't you, Saotome?

492
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:03,231
-And the best thing is
your political career

493
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:05,531
is now back on
track, like before.

494
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,664
-What do you think, Ranma?

495
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:08,364
Will Happosai ever come back?

496
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:09,731
-Oh, sure he will.

497
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:12,164
I bet you he's out
stealing right now.

498
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,331
-You're probably right.

499
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:15,164
-Now, now, remember
what they say.

500
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:18,764
Talk behind his back,
Master comes back.

501
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:19,731
-What a haul!

502
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:22,097
What a haul!

503
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:23,064
Woo-hoo!

504
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:26,397
I'm feeling much better!

505
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:29,297
-Ladies and gentlemen
of the town council,

506
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,231
it's with great sadness
that I, Soun Tendo,

507
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:34,864
tender to you my
official resignation.

508
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:47,479
[theme song playing]

509
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,279
[speaking japanese]

510
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:16,746
-Lost to Shampoo?

511
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:18,779
Oh, I can't bear it!

512
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:20,546
Mm, these noodles
are pretty good.

513
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,179
Hey, what do you mean,
they'll make me super strong?

514
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,846
Next time on Ranma
1/2, Transform-- Akane,

515
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:28,060
the Super-duper Girl.

516
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,942
See you there!
