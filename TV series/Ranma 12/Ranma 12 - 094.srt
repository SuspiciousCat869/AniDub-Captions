166
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,062
Still, if you'd
asked me earlier,

167
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:03,662
I would have told you their
particular school was extinct.

168
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:06,762
Speaking of which, you
did win, didn't you?

169
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:07,728
-Oh, me?

170
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:08,828
Of course I did.

171
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:10,295
Yeah, no prob.

172
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,028
-There, you see, Saotome.

173
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,162
No prob.

174
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:15,628
That's our Tendo dojo
next in line for you.

175
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:18,962
After you avenge Akane, you
can get our dojo sign back.

176
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:19,562
-Our what?

177
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:20,728
-Jeez, Daddy.

178
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,362
Do it yourself, OK?

179
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,195
-Habiki's right, Father.

180
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,162
Even you can beat a little girl.

181
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:28,962
SOUN: But, but, why do
I-- listen, you two.

182
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,428
Ranma is Akane's fiance.

183
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:31,395
Let him do it.

184
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:32,928
It's his job.

185
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,295
-Well that's true.

186
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:35,995
I suppose I gotta--

187
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,195
-Ugh.

188
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,962
Look, just stay out of this, OK?

189
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:40,995
-Akane.

190
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:43,295
-I'm the one who--
who lost, all right?

191
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,295
So I'll be the one who's
going to handle it.

192
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,095
Understand?

193
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,795
-But, Akane, it's too soon.

194
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:49,662
-Yeah, but what about-- Akane?

195
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:57,728
-Hey, don't sweat it.

196
00:10:57,828 --> 00:10:59,628
I said I'd do it, didn't I?

197
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:00,828
-Don't touch me!

198
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:04,795
-Fine.

199
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:05,395
Suit yourself.

200
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:10,728
-Yes, sadly, once
her mind is made up,

201
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:12,528
there's no stopping her.

202
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,462
It's just how she is.

203
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:17,395
Speaking of which,
Saotome, why was it

204
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:20,828
Akane who fought and not you?

205
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:21,528
[panda murmuring]

206
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:24,062
SOUN: Saotome, you!

207
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:26,228
[panda murmuring]

208
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,695
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): If
they picked on Akane,

209
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:47,795
they made their last
mistake, those jerks.

210
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:56,162
It's one thing to do it to me.

211
00:11:56,262 --> 00:12:00,962
But when they hurt her,
they're going to be sorry.

212
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:01,995
-Huh?

213
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:03,728
-And where do you
think you're going?

214
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:06,028
-To get that mystery
gang who hurt Akane

215
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:07,662
at the dojo, of course.

216
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:08,562
Where else?

217
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,128
-So you know about it, huh?

218
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:11,195
How'd you find out?

219
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:12,162
Where are they?

220
00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:17,595
-I have no idea.

221
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,462
How am I going to find them?

222
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:30,495
-You should have told us
Temari was going to help out,

223
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:31,595
that's all.

224
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:34,728
If you don't tell us
these things, who will?

225
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,595
-The important thing's
that she did help.

226
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:40,528
We ought be thankful.

227
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:42,495
-How's your bathwater?

228
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,528
Not too hot?

229
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:44,228
ULTRAMAN: Ha!

230
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,462
You kidding?

231
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:49,195
If I can take this much,
they'd run me out of Tokyo.

232
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:51,562
Bring it on.

233
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:53,295
-That's our leader!

234
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:55,262
-The one and only.

235
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:56,628
Temari, here!

236
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,028
Throw this on.

237
00:12:58,128 --> 00:12:58,577
-OK.

238
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,662
-Huh?

239
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:06,528
RED-FACED GUY: Who's there?

240
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:09,928
-We've come to get the
sign to our dojo back.

241
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:11,495
-I remember you two.

242
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:12,862
You're the strong one.

243
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:14,628
The other's the wimp.

244
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:15,595
-Come on.

245
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,095
Don't tell me those
guys beat you.

246
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:19,962
-I got a little careless, OK?

247
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:21,395
But that was then.

248
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:23,695
Like I said, I want that sign.

249
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,995
You're welcome to
stop me if you can.

250
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:27,028
-We beat you once.

251
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:29,028
-We can beat you again.

252
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:32,428
[growling]

253
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:34,662
-Back up, man.

-Hey!

255
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:36,795
Get out of my way, you jerk!

256
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,428
-Akane wouldn't like it
and you know it, Ryoga.

257
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,462
You know what I'm here for.

258
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,162
-You're here for
that girl's sake.

259
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:49,328
She wants a rematch with Temari,
and you're here to arrange it.

260
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,462
Am I right?

261
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:52,895
-Basically, yeah.

262
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:55,228
So can I take this to mean
you're up for it then?

263
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,528
-But Akane's not
in any shape to--

264
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,462
-Will it be fun
like it was before?

265
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:01,128
-Huh?

266
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:02,295
-Then it's settled.

267
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:04,695
Temari's old style martial
arts versus whatever

268
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:06,762
it is that girl of
yours practices.

269
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,462
Time and place of our choosing.

270
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:11,595
We'll let you know the details.

271
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:12,495
-Where are you going?

272
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,528
-Akane needs time to prepare!

273
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:16,062
-Hey, you hear me?

274
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:19,095
-Don't we get a vote?

-So what makes you think
this time will be different?

278
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:33,962
Akane's still recovering.

279
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,562
We can't expect her to fight.

280

-Where's we come from?

281
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:38,495
You're the one who started it.

-I started it?

283
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,528

asked for the rematch.

I'm not going to win.

287
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,828
Might as well give up.

about this earlier.

Then I would have been

00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:13,195
-Are you ready?

330
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:14,195
Hi-ya!

331
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:17,628
[music playing]

332
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:23,895
-I was expecting that!

333
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,428
So much for your
cat's cradle attack.

334
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:31,895
[groaning]

335
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:33,228
-How brilliant!

336
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,228
Were you watching that, Ranma?

337
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:36,895
-It's not over yet, though!

338
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,728
-Take this!

339
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:47,662
Old Days Martial Arts
special attack-- iron top!

340
00:17:57,562 --> 00:17:58,428
[screaming]

341
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,395
-This time I won't miss.

342
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:03,662
I was expecting this too!

343
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:04,962
-Isn't she the greatest?

344
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:20,903
-Oh, no.

345
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,328
Now what?

346
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:27,195
-London bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down.

347
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:30,528
London bridge is falling
down, my fair lady.

348
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:31,962
-Don't take your eyes off!

349
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:36,328
-Take the key and lock her
up, lock her up, lock her up.

350
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:41,162
Take the key and lock
her up, my fair lady.

351
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:43,828
Tokyo Tower's falling
down, falling down--

352
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:45,228
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Now that I know

353
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:46,828
what I'm looking
for, it's easier.

354
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:48,595
By varying her
speed, she creates

355
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,062
the illusion of a solid wall.

356
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,895
If I could stop staring long
enough for a pattern to emerge,

357
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:56,995
maybe I can--

358
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,162
-Now!

359
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,728
-Old Days School of
Martial Arts final attack.

360
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:06,028
Fire flower bean bag
endless downpour!

361
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,562
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Not
yet, not yet, not yet.

362
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:09,103
Now!

363
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:13,562
I see them!

364
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:20,028
-I did it!

365
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:21,262
I deflected them.

366
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:25,203
-Huh?

367
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:37,662
-Are you all right?

368
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:40,462
[sobbing]

369
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:42,662
-I'm so sorry.

370
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:46,228
All I wanted was--
I never meant to--

371
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:50,195
-Now that's the daughter
I know and love.

372
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:53,195
-Are you mad at me
for losing, Grandpa?

373
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:54,195
-Grandpa?

374
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,462
-You're related?

375
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,362
-We certainly are.

376
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:02,428
I'm Temari's grandfather,
Kumajiro Kaminarimon.

377
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:06,495
Keeping alive our distinctly
old fashioned martial arts style

378
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:08,695
has been my lifelong work.

379
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:10,295
-It's our past.

380
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:12,062
We don't want to forget it.

381
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:15,195
-Because there's so few
of us left as it is.

382
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:18,128
-Now were the masks
really necessary?

383
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:18,862
-We're not mad.

384
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:20,295
We just want to know.

385
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:22,728
-To you, we must
seem like old fools

386
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:25,128
who think time
should stand still.

387
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:26,795
But really, all
we've ever wanted

388
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:31,028
was to share with the kids of
today a part of our own youth

389
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,228
that we feel is worth keeping.

390
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:35,462
Maybe it's time
we let it die out.

391
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:36,162
-That's not true!

392
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:37,295
-Don't say that!

393
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,928
-And as for the masks,
we knew the kids

394
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:42,562
would laugh at us without them.

395
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:45,595
Speaking of kids,
I realize now you

396
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,995
deserve your own life, Temari.

397
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:49,095
-But I don't--

398
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:51,762
-If you think we don't
need you, you're wrong.

399
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,762
We shouldn't ever
forget the past.

400
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:54,862
Right, Saotome?

401
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,228
-Right as usual, Tendo.

402
00:20:57,328 --> 00:20:58,995
-You know, there's
always a place

403
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:00,995
for martial artists
in the world.

404
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,228
Besides you're like
a living treasure.

405
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,395
-Yeah, and if he's a
living treasure, that

406
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:07,528
makes you the next generation.

407
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:08,628
-I am?

408
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:10,428
-You have all been so kind.

409
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:12,295
You give me faith in the future.

410
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:15,828
Not just for Temari, but
for everyone's children.

411
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:19,195
-I'm going to train hard and
be in the Tokyo Olympics.

412
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:20,162
-What?

413
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,295
-Now wait a second.

414
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:23,362
I thought that the next
time was in Australia.

415
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,862
-If there's any justice in this
world, it'll be held in Tokyo.

416
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:29,195
Why hold it anywhere else?

417
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:30,495
-OK, now listen.

418
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:33,295
Local pride is one thing,
but I gotta draw the line.

AKANE (VOICEOVER):
An all expense

423
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,297
paid trip to any hot
springs resort in the world?

424
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:24,564
Ranma, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

425
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:27,997
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Hot Springs Battle Royale.

426
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:30,164
We'll see you there.
