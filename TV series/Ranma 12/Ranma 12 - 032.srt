Oh!

171
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:44,728
Akane!

172
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:56,986
-Ow-- ow!

173
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,053
Huh?

174
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:03,453
How did I-- what am
I doing under here?

175
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:06,353
SHAMPOO: So you only splash
Akane with plain water?

176
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:09,853
-The water from the
Yahzuniichuan is precious.

177
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:12,386
I can't go wasting it on her.

178
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,986
This water's for Ranma.

179
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,853
It mustn't be used
on anyone but him.

180
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:17,520
AKANE: Whoops!

181
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,220
-Gah!

182
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,120
[quacking]

183
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:22,153
-Oh, great.

184
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,853
Now there no more
Yahzuniichuan left.

185
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:28,586
MOUSSE: [quacking]

186
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,053
-Not Akane?

187
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,420
-My sister's a waterfowl.

188
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:33,886
RANMA: I don't understand.

189
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,320
She-- she should've
turned back by now.

190
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:40,886
She's a living bath toy!

191
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,720
It's all my fault.

192
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:43,786
-Don't worry, son.

193
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,186
It's not that bad.

194
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,286
I know you'll take
responsibility for this.

195
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,420
-Responsibility?

196
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:51,153
-This is a happy occasion.

197
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:55,653
We'll hold the ceremony
right here in the dojo.

198
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,486
-Ooh, I just adore weddings!

199
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,953
-I'll be your real
sister at last!

200
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:15,053
-OK, Mousse.

201
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:18,286
Be real man for once and
give up Shampoo forever.

202
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,086
-I won't!

203
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,653
-Mousse, no matter how hard
you try, you won't beat Ranma!

204
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:26,553
Give up and go back home.

205
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,753
(LIGHTLY) Goodbye.

206
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:29,386
-OK, then.

207
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,720
Fine.

208
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:33,653
Who needs an icy-cold
Amazon like you, anyway?

209
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:34,620

MOUSSE: [groaning]

-I hear that, you stupid Mousse!

212
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:44,320
-I-- I was only kidding.

213
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:44,920
-Nyah!

214
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,553
-Sh-- Shampoo!

[sobbing]

216
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:57,286
-Oh, how pathetic.

217
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,086
-What did I do wrong?

218
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,653
[weeping]

219
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:02,653
-Stop crying, Mousse.

220
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:04,686
Come on, I'll help you.

221
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,753
-How would you help me?

222
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:08,786
-Fight Ranma one more time.

223
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,620
This time, you'll be the winner.

224
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:11,486
-I'll what?

225
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:34,306
SOUN: [laughs] Here-- here's
to the soon-to-be happy couple.

226
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:36,939
Look, girls.

227
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:40,206
Isn't your sister a--
a beautiful bride?

228
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:44,539
[sobbing] You'll take
care of my little girl?

229
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,006
-Sure.

230
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,939
-Say, are you sure
that just isn't a duck?

231
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,539
I mean, that's not
really her, is it?

232
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,473
-Well, Father thinks so.

233
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:01,606
-Ahhhh, let's have a
toast now, shall we?

234
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,639
Akane, be a good girl now.

235
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:04,373
Come on.

236
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:05,106
[quacking]

237
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,539
-Hey! Hey!

238
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:07,373
-It doesn't want a drink, Daddy.

239
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:08,606
-Akane!

240
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,139
-Ugh.

241
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:14,606
Akane, I don't like this whole
mess any more than you do.

242
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,106
And even if you
weren't a duck, I still

243
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,906
wouldn't marry an
uncute girl like you.

244
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,239
Grr!

245
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,273
Hey, quit it!

246
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:24,173
I'm the one making
the sacrifice here.

247
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:25,308
-Huh?

248
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:26,039
-Huh?

249
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:27,473
-You might try showing a
little gratitude, you know.

250
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:31,273
Your legs are too thick,
you're built like a brick-- ow!

251
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,606
-I heard that, Ranma!

252
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,439
Besides, why would I
ever be grateful to you?

253
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:37,906
-Oh, you're not
a duck after all!

254
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:40,139
-I just knew it was
to good to be true.

255
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:41,839
Things would have
been very interesting

256
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:43,473
if you'd come 10 minutes later.

257
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,206
-Hm?

258
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,406
Akane?

259
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:49,373
Hm?

260
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:50,206
Huh?

261
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,539
Huh?

RANMA: Mousse is challenging me?

266
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,139
He wants a fight?

267
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,606
-I've got the challenge
letter right here.

268
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,439
-Huh, so now he sends it.

269
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:12,273
-Many time he attack you,
but Ranma always win!

270
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,939
-She's right, son-in-law,
you're a tough one.

271
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:16,239
Here you go, two orders up.

-Two chow mein.

273

Enjoy.

Mousse is the winner?

00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,839
-Oooh!

278
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,239
-If by one in million
chance Mousse win,

279
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:34,606
then Shampoo sacrifice
herself and date with him.

-Shampoo, you're lucky
I was passing by!

283
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:45,306
I'll beat you into a bloody
pulp in front of Shampoo, Ranma.

284
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:46,339
See ya later.

-(QUIETLY) Let him win, Ranma.

-How come?

289
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,206
-Put him out of his misery.

290
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,639
Besides, if you let him win,
Shampoo'll have to give you up.

291
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:02,606
-Hm?

-Do I gotta?

-What?

305
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,106
It's for me?

306
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,073
Are you sure I'm worthy
of this fine weapon?

307

-Mhm.

-(MUTTERING) There's a
first time for everything.

-Gotcha.

-You're supposed to let him win!

-Quit it!

Hey!

331
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,773
You did that on
purpose, didn't you?

332
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:58,706
-Shampoo have no intention
to date with Mousse.

333
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:02,006
So sorry, but I
make sure he no win.
