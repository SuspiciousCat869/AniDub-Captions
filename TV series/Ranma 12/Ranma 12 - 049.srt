00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:10,556
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Am I pretty?

4
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,923
Ranma's Declaration
of Womanhood.

5
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:28,656
-Ready or not, Ranma!

6
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:44,423
-Pop, you've gone
soft in your old age.

7
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:45,389
-Think again, boy.

8
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:46,989
I'm just holding
back for your sake.

9
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:47,589
-Oh, yeah.

10
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:48,130
Right.

11
00:02:57,523 --> 00:03:00,423
Then get ready, 'cause
I ain't holding back.

12
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:01,489
-I'm ready anytime.

13
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,856
-If that's the best
you can do, boy, then

14
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,723
it's obvious I've got
nothing to worry about.

15
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:20,364
-Mm.

16
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,789
Time to wrap it up.

17
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,456
Breakfast is almost ready.

18
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,489
-Why, thank you, Kasumi dear.

19
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:32,189
We'll be along in a moment.

20
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:32,730
An opening!

21
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:39,556
-That hurt.

22
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:41,789
Akane, shouldn't you
go check on Ranma?

23
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,856
-Don't distract me.

24
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:44,523
Oh, don't burn.

25
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:45,856
Don't burn.

26
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:47,756
-Now who's getting soft, boy?

27
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:50,456
The problem with you is,
you're too easily distracted.

28
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,389
One bright, shiny object,
and your mind takes a hike.

29
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,023
-Which I wouldn't
be, if you didn't you

30
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:56,589
use such dirty tricks.

31
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,723
You call yourself
a martial artist!

32
00:03:58,823 --> 00:03:59,789
-Nya, nya!

33
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,923
Foolish boy, come and
get me if you can.

34
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:02,756
-Hey, old man.

35
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:03,556
Come back here.

36
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:08,989
-Akane, wha-- what is this?

37
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:09,889
-Japanese omelette.

38
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,389
It's my own special recipe.

39
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,023
RANMA: Come back here!

40
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:14,089
-Is that so?

41
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,856
-I'm saving the biggest
piece for you, Dad.

42
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,756
-Oh, thank you, Akane.

43
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:20,297
-Have some.

44
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:20,797
-Whoop.

45
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,189
-Sorry.

46
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:25,756
Come here, you.

47
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:32,156
-Ranma.

48
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:33,656
-Now, now, wait a minute, boy.

49
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:35,923
I'm just trying to show you
the holes in your training.

50
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,289
-Why, you!

51
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,823
-If you don't like it, then
why don't you come and get me?

52
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:43,823
-Look, a hundred yen coin!

53
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:44,405
-Huh?

54
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:44,864
What?

55
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:45,364
Where?

56
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:53,989
-It was just like you said, Pop.

57
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:56,056
One bright, shiny object, and--

58
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:57,823
AKANE: Ranma!

59
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,823
Do you know how long it
took me to make that?

60
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:06,589
There.

61
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,323
I guess I taught you a lesson.

62
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:10,289
Huh?

63
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,689
Ranma?

64
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:12,230
-Huh?

65
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:22,789
-Are you awake?

66
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,223
Maybe you'd better
lie back down.

67
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:30,789
I still need to disinfect--

68
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:31,689
-Ow.

69
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,056
-Poor Ranma.

70
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:34,289
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,489
When she's that angry,
Akane can't control herself.

72
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:38,723
Can you forgive her?

73
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:39,556
-Sure.

74
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:41,123
It was an accident, right?

75
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:44,889
-I'm glad you feel that way.

76
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,823
Are you feeling OK?

77
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,556
-I've never felt better.

78
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:51,089
I-- I guess what
I mean to say is

79
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:54,823
that I feel at peace
for the first time ever.

80
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:57,489
It's like-- like waking
up from a very long dream.

81
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:02,989
-Ranma!

82
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,389
-Oh no!

83
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,023
Don't look!

84
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,589
-We're really--

85
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,423
-Sorry.

86
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:08,856
-What if I had been unclothed?

87
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:11,489
Please, remember to knock
next time before entering.

88
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,156
-Yes, of course.

89
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,189
Huh?

90
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,223
-So it's true.

91
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,056
You really acting
weirder than usual.

92
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:18,256
-Am I acting weird?

93
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:19,923
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,856
-Ranma dear, how many fingers?

95
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,189
-Three fingers.

96
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,356
-Do you know who this person is?

97
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,823
-My dear uncle Tendo.

98
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:27,989
-And this is?

99
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:28,956
-Octopus face.

100
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:29,497
-Good.

101
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,689
And him?

102
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,456
-An oompa-loompa.

103
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:33,856
-She seems perfectly normal.

104
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:35,523
TENDO: Yes, nothing
to be worried about.

105
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:37,089
GENMA: Tendo, how
cam you say that?

106
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,323
HAPPOSAI: Yeah, and why do I
have to be the oompa-loompa?

107
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:42,789
-Would you stop talking in
that stupid voice already?

108
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:43,856
It's making me sick.

109
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:45,456
-But I thought all
real girls talk--

110
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:46,456
-I'm warning you, Ranma.

111
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:49,089
Don't you dare start up with me.

112
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:50,623
-Silly Akane.

113
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:51,489
I can't help it.

114
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:52,489
I'm a woman.

115
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:53,256
-You're what?

116
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,823
[humming]

117
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,389
-That must have been some fall.

118
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,023
-Knocked the fight
right out of him.

119
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:11,023
I tell you, I can't bear
to see him like this.

120
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:14,023
He's still my son, and I'll
always love him, but-- but--

121
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:14,656
-Excuse me.

122
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:15,889
May I get through?

123
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:16,856
Thanks.

124
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:19,123
-Big sister Kasumi,
may I help too?

125
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,723
-Why, of course, you may.

126
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:21,556
Here you go, Ranma.

127
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:22,097
-Hurray.

128
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:28,723
Ah!

129
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,523
-What's wrong?

130
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:30,923
-These are boy's underwear.

131
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:32,189
-Well, yes.

132
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:33,189
So?

133
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,689
-So I just can't
bear to look at them.

134
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,656
They're so perverted!

135
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:40,156
-And what's so
perverted about it?

136
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:41,489
Take a good long look, Ranma.

137
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,989
These are your
underwear, not mine!

138
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,123
-No, please don't make me

139
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:45,923
-What's the matter?

140
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:46,923
Don't you recognize 'em?

141
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:49,389
-Akane, that's enough.

142
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:51,789
In this case, I'm afraid
it's you that's perverted.

143
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,523
-Kasumi, how could
you even say that?

144
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,123
How long you gonna cry?

145
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:58,089
Come on.

146
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,389
-Ow!

147
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:00,423
Akane!

148
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:01,856
-Stop crying, I said.

149
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:02,656
Come here.

150
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:03,489
-It hurts!

151
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:04,356
No, please let go of my hair.

152
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,389
-Well come at me.

153
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,523
-But I don't--

154
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,323
-Hurry up.

155
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,256
-But I'm against violence.

156
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:15,656
-Ready or not!

157
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,089
-Please, please, don't do this.

158
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,923
It's not the answer.

159
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:20,423
Akane, please, cut it out.

160
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:20,956
Please, stop!

161
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:27,156
-Why, why wouldn't
you fight back?

162
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:27,697
You coward!

163
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:32,923
-Sorry, I'm just good at this.

164
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,423
-What are you talking about?

165
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:37,023
Aren't you the heir to the
Saotome School of Anything Goes

166
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:38,423
Martial Arts?

167
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,156
-I wish I could quit.

168
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:44,056
Do you think father will
be too disappointed in me?

169
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,656
-Are you serious?

170
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:48,823
-What I'd really like to study
is tea ceremony and flower

171
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:49,956
arranging.

172
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,923
And it wouldn't hurt if
I could learn to cook.

173
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,756
It wouldn't be for my
husband's take either.

174
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,789
I'd be learning for myself too.

175
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:59,289
Huh?

176
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,123
Akane?

177
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:02,889
-Don't worry about me, Ranma.

178
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,023
I'm sure you'll be just fine.

179
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,989
-Oh, Ranma.

180
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:34,923
-Grandfather Happosai.

181
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:37,423
-Oh, this is too rich.

182
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:38,689
-Hm?

183
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,189
[clearing throat]

184
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,556
-You seem unduly
troubled, my dear.

185
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:45,623
-I think I've made Akane
really angry at me.

186
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:46,589
-I see.

187
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:47,623
I see.

188
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:49,289
So that's why you're
moping about, huh?

189
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,089
-That's right.

190
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,256
-Well, these things happen.

191
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:52,523
This to shall pass.

192
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:54,056
It's all a part of being young.

193
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:55,089
The grass is greener.

194
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,556
Et cetera, et cetera.

195
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:59,323
Ranma, how's about I go
and talk to Akane for you?

196
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:00,523
-You'd do that for me?

197
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:02,156
Thank you.

198
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,523
-My pleasure, my dear.

199
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:06,723
I do have one teeny, tiny favor
I'd like to ask you though.

200
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:07,856
-Yes?

201
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,956
-Would you mind slipping
into this little number?

202
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,423
GENMA: Ranma!

203
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:12,389
RANMA: But I tho--

204
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:14,189
-I'll catch you later, cutie.

205
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,156
-Ranma!

206
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:18,523
Ranma, what's this
I hear about--

207
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:19,989
[coughing]

208
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:20,789
-Please, father.

209
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:21,823
I'm worried about you.

210
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,923
You're not as young
as you used to be.

211
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,856
I care.

212
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:28,556
-Ranma, is it true what
I heard about your plans

213
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:29,889
for the future?

214
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:31,623
Is it true you're not interested
in being the official heir

215
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,556
and carrying on the
Saotome School of Anything

216
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:34,356
Goes Martial Arts?

217
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,889
Is it true or isn't it?

218
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:38,489
-I suppose you had to
find out sooner or later.

219
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:39,389
Yes, it's true.

220
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:40,889
I abhor violence.

221
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:41,723
-It's not violence.

222
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:43,056
It's art.

223
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,656
-It's cruel, and it's ugly,
and I won't be a part of it.

224
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,123
-Don't start with me, boy.

225
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:47,923
-But I'm not a boy.

226
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:48,823
I'm a girl!

227
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:55,089
Wow.

228
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:59,323
-Turn back to a boy
and snap out of it!

229
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:00,123
-Father, please.

230
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,856
That water's hot.

231
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:01,656
What are you doing?

232
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:02,856
-Wake up, I said.

233
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:09,489
-Oh, father.

234
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,189
Forgive me.

235
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,989
I didn't mean to-- oh?

236
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,956
-It's you who must
forgive me, son.

237
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,823
But for the sake of the
Anything Goes School,

238
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:17,956
this travesty cannot go on.

239
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:29,623
[crying]

240
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:57,386
-May I be excused?

241
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,619
-Poor Ranma.

242
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:05,252
-That was good.

243
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,586
Say, Ranma.

244
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:08,119
Unless you've got something
better to do this afternoon,

245
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:10,452
how'd you like to
come shopping with me?

246
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,052
-You don't mind having me along?

247
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:12,819
-Not at all.

248
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,586
Ready to go?

249
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:16,686
Oh, honestly.

250
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,819
What was wrong with
the outfit he had on?

251
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,986
[crying]

252
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:20,886
Ranma, what's wrong?

253
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:26,519
-I can't go out in
public like this.

254
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:29,886
Every skirt and dress I
own makes me look fat.

255
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,919
-Hey, they don't look that
good on me either, OK?

256
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,186
You look just fine.

257
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,052
-Well, that's easy
for you to say, Akane.

258
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:38,086
At least your clothes fit you
where they're supposed to.

259
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:39,219
Just look at me.

260
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:40,252
I'm a joke.

261
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:42,586
The whole world will
be laughing at me.

262
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,552
Now, I'll never be a bride.

263
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:46,286
-I'm sure you'll be just fine.

264
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:58,293
-Oh!

265
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:02,619
Ooh.

266
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:04,786
Oh, look at that.

267
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:07,086
Oh, wow.

268
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,219
Oh, look at this one.

269
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,052
Oh, now, this one's cute too.

270
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:12,019
I can't decide.

271
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,452
Hey, Akane, look at this one.

272
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:14,219
Look what I found.

273
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,152
What do you think?

274
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,286
Do you think it'll
look cute on me?

275
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,652
-Are you trying to
embarrass me on purpose?

276
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:26,352
Come here!

277
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,952
-Please, no violence.

278
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:28,534
-Come on.

279
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,486
Well, that was fun.

280
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:36,786
Listen to me, Ranma.

281
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:39,052
You are a guy, not a girl,
not a girl in a guy's body,

282
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:39,886
but a guy!

283
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,119
Are we perfectly clear on this?

284
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,252
And unless you want people
to think that you really

285
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:44,352
are a pervert,
you had better act

286
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:45,886
like a guy starting immediately!

287
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:47,019
-But-- but I--

288
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,652
-No buts!

289
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,186
-I really, really--

290
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:51,486
-Hm?

291
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:54,119
(WHISPERING): I have
to use the bathroom.

292
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:54,952
-I see.

293
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,086
But make it fast, OK?

294
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:57,886
And if you want me to
hold your hand in there,

295
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:58,919
you can just forget it.

296
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:12,552
[crying]

297
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,886
Hey, so what's the
matter with you now?

298
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,119
-I can't do it.

299
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:17,586
I tried, but I can't.

300
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:18,819
-What are you telling me for?

301
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,919
What am I supposed to do?

302
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:21,852
-Akane, please.

303
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:24,052
I can't hold it much longer.

304
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:26,019
-I-- I can't believe this.

305
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:29,952
Ready or not, Ranma.

306
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,952
What am I gonna do with you?

307
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:42,886
-Thank you, Akane.

308
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:44,552
-Oh, it's OK.

309
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,886
Let's do something about
those clothes, huh?

310
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:47,434
-Mhm.

311
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,286
Oh, it's so pretty.

312
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:53,952
Are-- are you sure
it's OK, Akane?

313
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:55,686
It looks so expensive.

314
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,586
-My, what a charming young lady.

315
00:14:57,686 --> 00:14:58,719
-Uh, yeah.

316
00:14:58,819 --> 00:14:59,419
So how much?

317
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,619
-35,600 yen with tax.

318
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,419
-Don't forget to
bring me a receipt.

319
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,052
-Of course.

320
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:05,619
-Oh, Akane.

321
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,486
You're the best.

322
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:11,152
-Ranma, can I ask you?

323
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,352
-Hm?

324
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,219
-Have you really forgotten
all about being a boy?

325
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,086
I mean, you still
remember it, don't you?

326
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:19,652
-Well, I guess I totally
haven't forgotten everything.

327
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,619
But it's more like a
dream than something

328
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,086
that's supposed to be real.

329
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:24,819
I remember things from
the past, but it's

330
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,186
like they happened to
someone else, not me.

331
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,986
For example, when you
knocked me into the pond,

332
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:31,552
I was so confused.

333
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:35,119
But I know now that I could
never really be happy as a man.

334
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:36,719
Akane, thanks.

335
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,552
at last, I can
finally be honest.

336
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:41,086
You helped me get in
touch with the real me and

337
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:42,452
with my real feelings.

338
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:43,919
There's something
I've been wanting

339
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,352
to tell you for a long
time now, something--

340
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:46,919
-No, no, no.

341
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:47,552
Don't say it.

342
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:48,686
Not here, not now.

343
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,352
-I mean, don't take it
the wrong way, Akane,

344
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:51,819
but you are a real tomboy type.

345
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,686
-You don't say.

346
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,886
-Don't work too hard, Ranma.

347
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:03,819
Doing the shopping's
more than enough.

348
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,319
-Cooking Sunday dinner
for my loved ones is fun.

349
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:08,386
-You really are very good.

350
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:09,286
Even better than I am.

351
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:09,986
-Oh, no.

352
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:11,252
You're much too kind.

353
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:13,486
-Now if only Akane were a boy.

354
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,052
You two would balance
out perfectly.

355
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:16,052
-Ow.

356
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:18,886
-Akane, are you OK?

357
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:19,952
-Don't worry.

358
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:21,252
It's nothing a bandage
can't fix, right?

359
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:25,586
Ranma?

360
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:26,286
Ranma?

361
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,252
-Don't worry about me.

362
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,586
I-- it was just
the sight of blood.

363
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:30,519
It-- oh.

364
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:31,452
OK.

365
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:32,719
I'm OK now.

366
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,186
Here.

367
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:34,734
-Huh?

368
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:40,552
TENDO: This time you've
outdone yourself, Kasumi.

369
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:42,652
HAPPOSAI: A feast
fit for a king.

370
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,652
-You can thank Ranma for that.

371
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:46,886
She was a great help
to me in the kitchen.

372
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:48,452
-Hey, I helped too, you know.

373
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:50,452
I washed the lettuce
for the salad, didn't I?

374
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,886
GENMA: You're becoming more
girlish by the moment, boy.

375
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:54,919
It breaks a father's heart.

376
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,519
I gotta admit though--
[chewing] hey, what's in this?

377
00:16:58,619 --> 00:16:59,186
It's delicious.

378
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:10,852
[knocking]

379
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,352
RANMA: Please, Akane.

380
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:13,686
-Ranma?

381
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:14,519
What's wrong?

382
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,186
It's the middle of the night.

383
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:16,819
-I'm scared.

384
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:17,919
-You're what?

385
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,486
-It's so lonely
there without father.

386
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:21,386
And I keep hearing noises,
and, please, Akane,

387
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:23,052
can't I sleep with you?

388
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:25,586
-What?

389
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:26,552
-It's just for tonight.

390
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:27,386
Please?

391
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:28,652
I'm scared to sleep by myself.

392
00:17:28,752 --> 00:17:29,452
-OK.

393
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:30,286
I know you're scared, but--

394
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:31,319
-Please, Akane.

395
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,019
I'm begging you.

396
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,519
-OK, but only for tonight.

397
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:39,252
-Mhm.

398
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:39,793
Let's go!

399
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,019
-Ranma, you really are
a girl now, aren't you?

400
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,152
-So it's not perfect.

401
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:58,986
-So there's still some
kinks to be worked out,

402
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:01,386
but so long as they're not
trying to kill each other--

403
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:03,219
-They can still get
married like we planned.

404
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,986
-And that means our dojos--

405
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,286
AKANE: Hey, who's out there?

406
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,086
And what were you
doing up in that-- Dad?

407
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:10,486
Mr. Saotome?

408
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:13,686
-We were just trying to get a
better look at the full moon.

409
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:15,252
Isn't that right, Saotome?

410
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,486
-Yeah, that's right, Tendo.

411
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:18,486
-Hm.

412
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,552
Doesn't look like
a full moon to me.

413
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:24,519
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
At least, Ranma

414
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,052
won't be giving me any trouble.

415
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:30,152
The new him is too polite
and ladylike for that.

416
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:31,186
Off to sleep.

417
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:40,752
[chuckling]

418
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:44,386
-Grandfather Happosai, what
in the world are you doing?

419
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:46,752
Akane, grandfather
just tried to--

420
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:48,786
-You monster, what are
you doing in my room?

421
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,819
-Who are you calling a monster?

422
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:52,919
I just came to give
a present to Ranma.

423
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:53,586
That's all.

424
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:54,419
-Present?

425
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,119
What present?

426
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,286
-This present.

427
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,386
-Don't tell me you're
still trying to-- get out

428
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:00,619
or I'll get angry.

429
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,252
-I don't wanna.

430
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:01,819
I don't wanna.

431
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,519
I don't wanna.

432
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,719
-Too bad what you want.

433
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:05,386
You're not seeing Ranma in
a bra, and that's final.

434
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:06,086
-Come on.

435
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,019
You won't reconsider?

436
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,319
-No!

437
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:14,752
-Well, since you won't
be reasonable-- Ow.

438
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:15,686
-Did I do?

439
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:17,686
-Huh?

440
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:21,052
-I'm sorry, grandfather, but
I won't let you hurt Akane.

441
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:22,286
-Ranma?

442
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:24,886
-All I wanted was for Ranma
to try our her present.

443
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:27,486
Why did you have
to hit me so hard?

444
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:28,386
You hurt me.

445
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:30,386
You hurt me.

446
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:31,586
I just wanted to look at him.

447
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:35,086
-Grandfather, I'm sorry.

448
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,886
If I put it on, will
youi stop crying?

449
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:37,427
-Ranma!

450
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:42,119
I said you can't see that!

451
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,619
Change back, Ranma.

452
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:57,852
I don't care if you are rude and
insensitive and inconsiderate.

453
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:00,219
I know I complain all the
time, but sweet and innocent

454
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,519
just isn't you.

455
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,586
If you stay a girl, then who
will I-- what am I gonna--

456
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,486
-I understand what
you're saying, Akane.

457
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:11,119
But I am a woman.

458
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:14,219
Your male Ranma no longer
exists as you know him.

459
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:20,252
-You idiot!

460
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,152
You're not Ranma
at all, are you?

461
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:23,419
That's the way you're gonna be.

462
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,686
Stay a girl for the rest of
your life for all I care!

463
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,719
-Why'd you do that
for, you jerk?

464
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,752
What're you trying to do?

465
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:38,186
Give me a cold?

466
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:40,486
-Ranma?

467
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,786
-Hey, whatcha do that for?

468
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:45,219
-Ranma, you're back, aren't you?

469
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,152
Dad, Kasumi, Mr. Saotome!

470
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:47,719
-Ranma!

471
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:48,619
-He's come back!

472
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,652
-What are you all looking at?

473
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:01,586
Cut it out, you stupid old man!

474
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:03,819
-That's my heir to the
Saotome School of Anything

475
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,152
Goes Martial Arts.

476
00:21:05,252 --> 00:21:06,952
-Ranma's back to normal, and
all is right with the world.

477
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:08,519
-Isn't it wonderful, Akane?

478
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:09,486
-Sure is.

479
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:11,119
He just isn't Ranma
any other way.

480
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,352
-Oh, Ranma.

481
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:13,186
Oh, my boy.

482
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,086
I'm so happy!

483
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:19,119
Uh-oh.

484
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:22,019
I didn't mean---
it was an accident.

485
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,686
-Saotome, now what
have you done?

486
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:25,552
-Oh my.

487
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:26,686
Poor Ranma.

488
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,919
-You don't think the--
you don't think he's--

489
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,586
-Say, did anyone catch
the number of that truck?

490
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:35,719
Which way did he go?

491
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:36,260
I'm Ranma.

492
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,767
[ending theme]

493
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:16,275
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Supposedly
my dad and Mr. Saotome

494
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,642
learned this great Chinese
