1
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:53,268
Did I just hear the timer?

2
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:56,468
Oh, my, now don't
those look tasty.

3
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:59,101
-You try some great-grandmother.

4
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,668
-What, and be your guinea pig?

5
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,435
Sorry dear, no thanks.

6
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,768
-Maybe, it's still too good.

7
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,168
-Well, if you're so eager,
why don't you eat it?

8
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:08,735
-What?

9
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:09,835
Is you crazy?

10
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:13,035
-Delivery, I got your order.

11
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,201
You wanted 50 units of
raw ramen noodles, right?

12
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:20,801
-Hmm?

13
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,768
-I'm not supposed
to eat on the job.

14
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,635
-We keep secret if
you keep secret, OK?

15
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:28,035
-You've heard of pork buns?

16
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:30,335
Well, these are like
those but with mushrooms.

17
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:31,868
-Gee lady, I don't know.

18
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,901
It's not one of those
slimy mushrooms is it?

19
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,535
-For pity sake, are you
going to eat it or not?

20
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:46,701
-Sure

21
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:48,835
Gee lady, that was great.

22
00:03:48,868 --> 00:03:50,668
-Did you eat the whole thing?

23
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:54,101
We'll find out soon enough.

24
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:54,835
Now sleep.

25
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:03,535
-Look, it working.

26
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,535
-Let's find out.

27
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,868
Hey, wake up.

28
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:12,601
Now here's the acid test, sleep.

29
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:21,101
-He's such obedient,
delivery man.

30
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,801
-Who would've thought
a mere mushroom

31
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:25,601
would be able to hypnotize
a person like that.

32
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:27,401
-Mushroom?

33
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,968
That this is?

34
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,868
-Don't play dumb
with me child, we

35
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,801
both know one bite makes
whoever eats it completely

36
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,435
open to triggered suggestions.

37
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:37,935
Why else would you have gone
to the trouble of putting it

38
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:40,401
in those buns that you made?

39
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:44,235
-Shampoo know just who
she want eat it too.

40
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:50,168
-Ranma if it's noodle
bread you want, it's gone.

41
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,735
-Ranma you eating lunch already?

42
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:56,968
-Well, actually--

43
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:00,368
-Shampoo, just in time then.

44
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,235
-Hey, it's pork buns.

45
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:07,668
-No, it special
bun only for Ranma.

46
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,501
Shampoo make own hands.

47
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:11,701
-I , uh, no it's OK.

48
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:13,068
I'll just buy a
sandwich or something.

49
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:15,801
-Ranma you no like steamed bun.

50
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:16,935
-Oh I like them, OK.

51
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,401
It's just that,
you know, the bean

52
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:20,168
filled ones taste a lot better.

53
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,368
-What?

54
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,768
A beautiful girl just
makes you a homemade lunch

55
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,401
and you're not going to eat it?

56
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:27,835
Young lady I will gladly
eat those buns for you.

57
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:28,801
-No can hap.

58
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:30,368
It's only for Ranma.

59
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,335
We going.

60
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:45,368
-Hey, do you know
where Ranma is?

61
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,368
-Ranma?

62
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:47,701
How the heck should I know?

63
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:48,935
-Oh, that's weird.

64
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,301
If he's not buying
his lunch here, then

65
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,768
where else would he be?

66
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:52,701
-Hey, Akane?

67
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:53,901
-Hmm?

68
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,435
-Hey, we still on
for that matinee?

69
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,768
-Sure four o'clock, front
of the school, right?

70
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,668
-Bye!

71
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,568
And don't be late, ok?

72
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,368
-I wouldn't miss it.

73
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,301
Have you seen Ranma?

74
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:06,735
-No, why?

75
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,635
-Honestly, the minute I
need him for something

76
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,035
he's now where to be found.

77
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:22,168
-Tea?

78
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:25,268
-Oh, thank you.

79
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,635
Hey, that was pretty
good, you know?

80
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,501
-You eat all up right?

81
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:33,935
-Hey, you're not telling
me I have to pay for them?

82
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:38,735
-Ranma, now you is all mine.

83
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:44,668
(SNAPS) Now, hold in your arms.

84
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:47,201
(SCREAMING)

85
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:50,168
-That was him.

86
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,468
-What you doing?

87
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,368
(SCREAMING)

88
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:54,701
-Get it off me.

89
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:59,301
Somebody get if off
me, come on hurry!

90
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,001
-Ranma, what you doing?

91
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:03,135
Shampoo thought you hate cat?

92
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:07,801
-Huh? (SNAPS)

93
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:10,035
-Sneeze is what
trigger, not snap.

94
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:11,735
-Shampoo, what have you done?

95
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:14,268
-Now how to make
sense on purpose?

96
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,468
-Hey, are you listening?

97
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:18,535
(SNEEZE)

98
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,468
-A sneeze.

99
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,368
Huh?

100
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,268
Hey that's pepper.

101
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:25,001
-Ranma!

102
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:27,535
-Hey get off of me!

103
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:29,868
-Huh?

104
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:34,168
-Akane Come on that's enough.

105
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:36,735
-(SNEEZE)

106
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,701
-Akane it's not what,
come on get off of me.

107
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:41,935
I am not doing it on
purpose, I can't help--

108
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,935
Kasumi and the others
won't be home tonight

109
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:47,001
so she wants both of us to
keep an on the house for her.

110
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:49,068
I just thought you'd
like to know, OK?

111
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,568
Have fun you two. (ANGRILY)

112
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,101
-Let me explain.

113
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:09,901
Akane, do you mind?

114
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:12,168
We're trying to
watch the movie here.

115
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,635
-I love you.

116
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,035
-I don't.

117
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,935
I love you, I need you.

118
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,935
You're my sunshine.

119
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,135
-I don't love you.

120
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,135
But.

121
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:25,870
But.

122
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:45,135
-Wasn't it romantic?

123
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,435
Guys like that don't
exist in real life.

124
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,135
-You bet, what a dream.

125
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:52,035
He really did love
her, didn't he?

126
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:54,001
-You just knew he'd
never betray her.

127
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:56,035
That he'd be faithful forever.

128
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,568
-She'd probably would've
been better off with a dog.

129
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:00,068
-Akane, come on.

130
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:02,368
Don you have any
romance in your soul?

131
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,301
-No.

132
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,268
What good is it?

133
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,768
You mean you didn't
feel anything?

134
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,335
Are you made out of stone?

135
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,601
-Come on, did you
see how he held her?

136
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:12,835
Oh, I could just die.

137
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,668
-How he held her.

138
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:21,168
Held her-- He's the
one who's going to die.

139
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,868
He couldn't help grabbing her.

140
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,401
What kind of fool
does he think I am.

141
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:26,135
If he thinks he's
getting away with this

142
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,401
he's got another thing coming.

143
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,135
-Akane?

144
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,635
-Watch out!

145
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:31,568
-Akane?

146
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:33,868
-Are you alright?

147
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,201
-When I find him.

148
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:40,335
He's a dead man!

149
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:41,035
-Huh?

150
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:42,301
Did you say something?

151
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:44,701
-I say you doing
whatever Shampoo wants so

152
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:45,735
get used to it.

153
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,168
-Come on, a joke's a joke, but--

154
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,968
-You want Shampoo prove again?

155
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,035
-No, give me that hand it over.

156
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:22,435
Akane what happened to you?

157
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:23,401
Are you alright?

158
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:24,168
-Huh?

159
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,568
Oh it's nothing.

160
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,568
Sorry I'm late.

161
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,101
I stopped at the-- (SNEEZE)

162
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:31,601
-Oh no, I think
you've got a cold.

163
00:10:31,635 --> 00:10:33,168
-You better get going.

164
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:35,601
You're going be late
for your appointment.

165
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,135
-Yes, but with Ranma not home,
I don't want to leave you alone.

166
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:43,335
-I'm not a baby Kasumi, I can
stay home by myself you know.

167
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:45,901
-You sure you'll be
alright by yourself?

168
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:47,101
I can call the neighbor.

169
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:49,435
-I told you I'll be fine.

170
00:10:56,868 --> 00:11:02,201
Honestly, Ranma's got a
key, he can let himself in.

171
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:15,935
(SNEEZE) The cold medicine's
cleared up my nose

172
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:25,768
(SNEEZE) The cold medicine's
cleared up my nose

173
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,201
but I'm still running a fever.

174
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:21,101
(DOOR RATTLING) It can't
be Ranma, he's got a key.

175
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,799
(SHRIEKS)

176
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:14,899
-Hmm?

177
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,466
What are you doing here?

178
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:17,799
-What am I doing here?

179
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:20,532
I could ask you
the same question!

180
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,632
-The front door was locked, OK.

181
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,732
I only have the back door key,
what else was I supposed to do?

182
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,899
-You could have rung
the doorbell, you idiot.

183
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:32,199
were you and Sh--
Ugh, never mind.

184
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,932
Not that you deserve it, but
Kasumi left some dinner out

185
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,266
on the table for you.

186
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,032
-Whoa, alright!

187
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,866
Hey, check it out!

188
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:42,866
Hey, what's this?

189
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,366
-It's for my cold.

190
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,066
-You've got a cold?

191
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:48,099
-Uh huh.

192
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,666
But I'm feeling a lot better.

193
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:50,432
-Fever?

194
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:51,332
-A little.

195
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:51,966
-How about a

196
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,799
-Cough?

197
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,966
-Yeah, but I took cold medicine.

198
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,099
-And, have you sneezed?

199
00:13:58,132 --> 00:13:59,432
-Sure.

200
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,532
I think maybe the
sneezing is worst of all.

201
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:04,666
-(SCREAMING) Get away
from me, stay back,

202
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,366
don't come any closer.

203
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,132
-What!

204
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,732
Don't overreact.

205
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,699
Who's fault do you think it is I
have a cold in the first place.

206
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:12,199
-No.

207
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:13,599
Stay back.

208
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,299
-What an idiot, here I
thought you were actually

209
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,399
worried about me for once!

210
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:17,766
-I am!

211
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,566
I'm worried, really
worried, so stay back OK?

212
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:32,732
-(SNEEZE) Molester!

213
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:33,499
Pervert!

214
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:36,066
You fake liar!

215
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,399
Have you gone crazy?

216
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:43,099
-Wait a minute
Akane, I can explain.

217
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,232
-You'd grab just about any girl.

218
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,266
-Huh?

219
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,366
Hey what's that supposed mean?

220
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,566
-You don't have to lie.

221
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,932
-Hey why would I
lie about it huh?

222
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,032
-Ask shampoo!

223
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:54,432
-Why should I, this
mess is all her fault.

224
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:57,099
-How dare you try and
pin this on someone else.

225
00:14:57,132 --> 00:15:03,732
(SNEEZE) You have three
seconds to get off me.

226
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,766
-I can't.

227
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,732
Hey, cut it out, I
said I can't help it.

228
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:13,741
-I'm not like Shampoo you
know, I don't automatically

229
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:15,641
believe everything you say.

230
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,874
-But I didn't do
nothing to lie about.

231
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:21,307
Why do you always got
think the worst of me, huh?

232
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:23,574
You think I like hugging tomboy.

233
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:27,541
-You still did it
though, didn't you?

234
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:31,341
-Hey, are you OK?

235
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:32,541
-I'm going to bed.

236
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:46,941
-Well it's her own fault
for getting so worked up.

237
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:48,274
I didn't do nothing.

238
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,141
Hmm, let me see.

239
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:58,407
Ah, here it is.

240
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,141
Chinese cough and cold remedy.

241
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:09,941
Um, wouldn't it be better if you
got like, beneath the covers?

242
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:15,274
You don't look so good.

243
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,141
Jeez Akane you're burning up.

244
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:22,541
-Yeah, like you care!

245
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,674
-Man, you're un-cute.

246
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,807
I'm cute but I'll go
get you some ice anyway.

247
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:36,841
She should resting
not picking fights.

248
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:46,607
Her wrists, they
were so, so tiny.

249
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,841
OK, take these.

250
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,707
-OK.

251
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,474
What's that weird smell?

252
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:54,174
-Hey don't knock it
until you try it.

253
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,174
It's an old Saotome family cure.

254
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:01,041
So now she listens to me.

255
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,474
-That's really nice of you.

256
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:06,574
-Hmm?

257
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:16,641
-That's--- (SNEEZE)

258
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:28,274
-That's--- (SNEEZE)

259
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:29,307
-Huh?

260
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,941
-I, uh, I wasn't doing nothing.

261
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:34,474
-Hey shampoo, don't you
know what a door is?

262
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:36,207
-Door take too long.

263
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:40,841
Ranma, Shampoo make you
too, too delicious dim sum.

264
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:41,607
-Hmm.

265
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:42,574
-What matter?

266
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,007
You no like?

267
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,941
It's good, it's
special shrimp shumai.

268
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,674
-Yeah, I'm sure it's
special alright.

269
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:51,041
-Oh, what you talking--

270
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:53,207
-I ain't falling for
the same trick twice.

271
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:59,541
-(SNEEZE) Be good and say ah.

272
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:00,574
Make sure--

273
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:01,941
-Uh uh, no way.

274
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:05,507
-Hey, could you take
it outside please?

275
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,307
(SNEEZE) Pervert!

276
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:13,174
-Cut it out, I already
told you I can't help it.

277
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,007
I can't help it.

278
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,541
I don't want to hug you.

279
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,207
(CRYING)

280
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,941
-Good, now that obstacle gone.

281
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:36,407
Ranma, you say ah,
and eat all up.

282
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,474
-No thank you.

283
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,107
I said already, remember?

284
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,941
-You be polite.

285
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:42,874
Ranma?

286
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,341
-Leave me alone!

287
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,207
-But taste so good.

288
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:47,541
-I ain't hungry.

289
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:48,974
-Eat just one Ranma.

290
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:50,941
You no want hurt
Shampoo feelings?

291
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:53,141
It's special shumai
made just for you.

292
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:53,974
-Cut it out.

293
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,441
Cut it out I said.

294
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:56,907
Come on!

295
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:57,674
-Ranma!

296
00:18:57,707 --> 00:19:00,541
-I don't want any!

297
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,507
Hey, Shampoo that's enough.

298
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,274
-You can say that again Ranma!

299
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:05,607
-Right.

300
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:08,374
If Ranma not eat then
Shampoo make Akane eat.

301
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:10,607
-Hey, don't you even
joke about that.

302
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:12,607
-But it's true!

303
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:15,574
It's too, too easy
make Akane hate Ranma.

304
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:17,907
You want any shumai, Akane?

305
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:18,974
-No, Akane don't!

306
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:21,107
-Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

307
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:23,474
-You just eat one, OK?

308
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:25,041
-Put me down I said.

309
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:26,007
-No run.

310
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:30,707
Now Shampoo is
really, really mad.

311
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:32,641
-Akane whatever you
do, don't eat one.

312
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:35,774
-Even if I want to,
stupid, I couldn't.

313
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:45,341
-Ranma, you can run
but you cannot hide.

314
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:46,507
-Why you.

315
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,307
-That hurt you know?

316
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:51,307
-Ranma, give up now, OK?

317
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:53,541
You no beat Shampoo.

318
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:55,441
-I can't believe this.

319
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:58,641
-Akane, you eat up and I
make you hate Ranma, OK?

320
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:00,641
Then he love Shampoo.

321
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:07,641
-Gee, I never realized
how cute you were before.

322
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,607
-Then you love Shampoo?

323
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,507
Oh, so happy!

324
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,774
Now we live happily every after?

325
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:14,251
-Ha!

326
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:14,774
Not!

327
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:19,274
You're cute but you
ain't that cute.

328
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:20,507
-Ranma, no fair.

329
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,574
Give back.

330
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,907
-Now go home Shampoo.

331
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:29,874
-Shampoo go.

332
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:34,274
Bye bye!

333
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:35,074
-See ya.

334
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,074
-So I guess you were
telling the truth after all.

335
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:41,307
-Huh?

336
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,107
Of course, why would
you listen before?

337
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,074
Why are you so darn stupid?

338
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:47,374
-What did say to me?

339
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:52,807
-Hold it in, hold
it in. (SNEEZE)

340
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,141
-Huh?

341
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,241
Aren't you gonna--

342
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:56,541
Huh?

343
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:58,841
Well, whatever it was,
I guess it wore off.

344
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:11,874
-I'm so glad you're
feeling better Akane.

345
00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:13,674
-Good thing Ranma
had that medicine.

346
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,407
-Do you guys mind
if I have some more?

347
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:20,774
-Please do.

348
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:22,307
Oh, what's wrong you two?

349
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:24,174
Why aren't you eating?

350
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:27,574
I thought that you both
liked this kind of food?

351
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:30,474
-I'm, uh, not hungry.

352
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:31,707
-Yeah, me either.

353
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:54,365
(MUSIC PLAYING)

354
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:18,531
-Oh, I just love
Japanese hot springs.

355
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:19,431
What?

356
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:20,698
There's a peeping Tom?

357
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,898
Oh, no you don't mean
to say that it's--

358
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:25,398
-Next time on Ranma
1/2, rub a dub dub,

359
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:27,198
there's a pervert in the tub.

360
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:28,232
We'll see ya there.
