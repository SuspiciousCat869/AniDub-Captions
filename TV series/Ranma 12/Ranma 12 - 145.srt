Eat as many wild

Nothing feels as good

00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:14,149
Akane Tendo, I know this
is but a ploy to find time

10
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:16,149
with me in the mountains.

Sure, whatever.

Akane, you can be my

If it works out that way.

17
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,116
Ranma's going to have
an unfortunate accident

Excuse me, gentlemen.

Not too shabby.

00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:49,383
This plan of Mr.

to be a good idea in the end.

Look at all these mushrooms!

I wonder if they're edible.

MAN: Some of them are
indeed, but others

are extremely poisonous.

00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,583
Welcome to this temple.

00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:14,183
Tomorrow, a mushroom expert
will bless us with his presence.

We are honored, Your Eminence.

And thank you for
allowing us to stay.

While you're here, be sure
to eat only the mushrooms

58
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,683

How come you're
practicing so late?

00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:35,116
Oh.

00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:35,949
Hi, Akane.

81
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,216
What's the problem?

82
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:39,016
Too quiet for you to sleep?

No.

The stars are just so beautiful,
I didn't want to miss them.

Oh, yeah?

86
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,583
I don't know.

87
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,149
It looks like the
same old sky to me.

00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,583
Think so?

00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:54,449
There you are, my
beloved Akane Tendo!

90
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:55,949
Kuno, what are you doing?

91
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:58,416
Your heart's set on seeing
the constellations with me.

Stubborn girl.

00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,183
Where'd you get that idea?

95
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:04,549
It seems a serpent
has crossed your path.

96
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,216
Come.

97
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,083
Let's go elsewhere.

[groan]

99
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,416
We shall view the stars
and create memories

00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,483
that poets can only dream of.

101

Stop it!

102
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:13,783
I never said I wanted
to be with you!

103
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:14,716
Fascinating.

104
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,749
Could you keep it down?

105
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,216
You're interrupting my training.

106
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:19,183
Go check out the Little
Dipper and leave me in peace,

107
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:20,816
would you?

108
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:21,516
Sure.

109
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,816
All right.

MOUSSE: It's impolite to
interfere with other people's

113
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,183
relationships!

114
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,283
Come on, Mousse.

115
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:33,949
There's nothing special
between her and me.

116
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,283
Yeah!

117
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,449
Quit jumping to stupid
conclusions like that.

118
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,783
It seems you've discovered
my secret relationship

119
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,816
with Akane Tendo.

120
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,249
Now what are you talking about?

121
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:44,516
Here's your chance.

122
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:46,616
Run away with Akane now, Ranma.

123
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,883
Then at last, I'll have the
fair Shampoo all to myself.

124
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:50,483
Nutbar.

125
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:57,716
Who's there?

126
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:58,816
Who's siding with Kuno?

127
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,349
Don't make assumptions.

128
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,783
I'm not on anyone's side here.

129
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,116
But Mousse, get it straight.

130
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:08,583
This is one situation
where I can't

131
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,849
afford to let you
have things your way.

132
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:13,849
Is that a threat?

Ryoga.

135
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:21,383
This is getting a
little complicated.

[grunt]

137
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:38,716
What did I do to deserve
the hardest job of all here?

138
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:43,049
Wild mushrooms are best savored
when one is tired and hungry.

139
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,383
Has the mushroom expert
arrived yet or what?

140
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,883
MAN: It's from the spirit.

141
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,249
There's a toadstool to be found.

142
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:55,283
Pick 100 mushrooms, and
leave a hole in the ground.

143
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:56,816
Pick some mushrooms.

144
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,249
Gather mushrooms.

145
00:07:58,283 --> 00:08:00,183
Which ones will be poison?

146
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,949
They're about done.

147
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:17,516
[laughter]

148
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:21,816
Are you sure these
mushrooms aren't poison?

149
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,449
Nothing to worry about.

150
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,816
All right!

151
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:26,749
Your Eminence.

152
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:27,616
Oh.

153
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:28,783
Thank you very much.

154
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:31,316
Thanks for the food.

00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:31,798
Ah.

00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,083
Hey, get your own soup.

Oh, my.

159
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:41,916
He must have eaten
a poisonous one.

160
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,616
Even expert mycologists
occasionally make mistakes.

161
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,249
On a positive note, we
must give thanks that it

162
00:08:48,283 --> 00:08:50,249
wasn't me who was poisoned.

163
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:51,949
Why, you callous--

00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:07,816
No!

172
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:09,349
Even he's poisoned.

173
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,983
How come we're the only ones
that nothing's happened to?

174
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,649
I don't know.

175
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:14,683
This isn't good.

176
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:15,849
She has a fever.

177
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:17,249
Call a doctor!

178
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:18,949
There's no time for
that, I'm afraid.

179
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:22,083
Our only hope at this point
is the large sacred mushroom

180
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:24,649
god found at the shrine
on top of the mountain.

181
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:29,016
If you eat a piece, it will
cure any kind of poisoning.

182
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,149
Gotcha.

183
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:31,416
Let's hurry and
get the antidote.

184
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,549
You must return
before sunset, though.

185
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,849
Otherwise, someone might
be in grave danger.

186
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:37,849
We'll be back by then.

187
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:46,816
[groan]

188
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:50,416
Oh.

189
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:52,416
How do you feel, my good man?

190
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:53,283
[laughter]

191
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:54,549
I'm a mushroom man.

192
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,983
Living on the wild
side's just my nature.

193
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:58,783
Oh, what am I thinking?

194
00:09:58,816 --> 00:09:59,416
The antidote.

195
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:09,316
[sigh]

196
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,449
The remedy never fails us.

197
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:15,183
[groans]

198
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:15,883
[squawking]

199
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,016
Are you saying that Akane
went to the mountaintop

200
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,516
to get the remedy she
needed to cure me?

201
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:23,616
No.

202
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,716
Akane Tendo went for
the remedy to cure me.

203
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,083
Oh, no!

204
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:28,516
Is something the matter?

205
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:31,283
Your two friends accidentally
ate these mushrooms.

206
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,216
You must be mistaken, my man.

207
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,749
They didn't seem to be poisoned.

208
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:35,649
No.

209
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:36,383
I'm sure they ate them.

210
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:39,883
Man.

211
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:40,783
Those are good.

212
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:41,949
Give me one of those.

213
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:42,716
Hey!

214
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:43,649
Give that back.

215
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,216
That is good.

216
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,049
The variety they
ate is commonly

217
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,849
known as the mushroom of love.

218
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:49,783
[gasp]

219
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,016
The mushroom of love?

220
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:53,616
The man and the
woman who accidentally

221
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:55,883
ingest these mushrooms
with fall deep in love,

222
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,183
even though they might
otherwise despise one another.

223
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:01,716
Good news, eh, Saotome?

224
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:04,749
Tendo, our worries are over.

225
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:06,349
Oh, right.

226
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:07,816
Love mushrooms, huh?

227
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:10,049
It sounds so romantic.

228
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,849
What's the cure for
love mushroom poisoning?

229
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,383
Where's the remedy?

230
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,449
You must go to the
large sacred mushroom

231
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,083
at the shrine on
top of the mountain

232
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:19,783
and get them to eat
the mushrooms raw.

233
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:22,716
Otherwise, your two friends
will be deep in love forever.

234
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,716
Then I've got to find that
shrine on the mountain.

235
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:26,816
I must stop this madness.

236
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:30,383
Come back here!

237
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,549
Just leave those two alone!

238
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,483
We could use a
wedding around here!

239
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:34,549
Come back!

240
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,183
What luck.

241
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:36,316
Mushrooms of love.

242
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:38,516
Oh, what joy
befalls our family.

243
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:39,283
And the wedding.

244
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:00,144
Stop!

245
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,344
Come back here!

246
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:02,977
Just leave them alone, and
let love run its course!

247
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,277
Farewell, young interloper.

248
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:13,510
[scream]

249
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,644
Waste of a fine bridge.

250
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:20,210
Let's get going.

251
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:20,692
Mhm.

252
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:23,810
[gasp]

253
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,710
[scream]

254
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,510
Kuno!

255
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:29,010
[gasp]

256
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:30,010
[groan]

257
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:30,710
Ryoga!

258
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:32,144
Help me before I fall.

259
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:34,610
Sorry, Kuno, but the clock's
ticking, and I must go.

260
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,477
KUNO: Ryoga!

261
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,677
Oh, all right.

262
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,110
I'll take you along with me.

263
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:45,877
I don't care what happens.

264
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,510
I'm going to make sure Ranma
and Akane tie the knot.

265
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:57,944
[sigh]

266
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,310
Hey!

267
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:06,077
Hm?

268
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,544
Ranma!

269
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,144
Akane!

270
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:07,677
Wait up!

271
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,744
Akane Tendo!

272
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:09,744
You both ate the
love mushrooms.

273
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,977
You must take the antidote.

274
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,677
What are those
guys going on about?

275
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,444
I don't know, but it
looks like they all

276
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,044
got over that poisoning.

277
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:17,877
Hey!

278
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,544
How's Akane's dad and my pop?

279
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:24,777
Don't you need us to get the
mushroom antidote anymore?

280
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,744
We need it on the double!

281
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:28,010
Akane Tendo!

282
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:30,177
Do whatever it takes
to get the antidote!

283
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,144
You hear that?

284
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,744
They still need us to get it.

285
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:34,144
They must've been
the only ones who

286
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:35,977
recovered from the poisoning.

287
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,377
We'd better hurry.

288
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,344
Come on.

289
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:40,010
Let's go, my pretty baby.

290
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:42,344
Huh?

291
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:43,810
Sure thing, honey.

292
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:44,777
Stay out of my way!

293
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,344
My line exactly!

294
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:48,044
Mousse!

295
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,644
Get out of my-- whoa!

296
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:51,544
[scream]

297
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:53,810
No!

298
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,677
Look!

299
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,910
They're holding hands!

300
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,377
I must stop this.

301
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,177
The love mushrooms are starting
to take effect already.

302
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,477
Fly.

303
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,244
Curse the evil fungus that
hath made Akane Tendo double

304
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,477
cross her true love.

305
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:12,377
Now Akane and Ranma will go
off together and get married.

306
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,977
My wildest dreams
have been realized.

307
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,544
Shampoo will be mine!

308
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:18,477
Shut up!

309
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,210
Go away!

310
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:21,177
Just stop--

311
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,177
So you came up from
the Mushroom Temple,

312
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,577
and you're on the way to
the top of the mountain?

313
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,777
Yes.

314
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,310
My dad and sisters
have accidentally

315
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,577
eaten some poison mushrooms
so we need the mushroom god

316
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,477
antidote.

317
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,110
That's a crying shame.

318
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:35,644
To get to the top
of the mountain,

319
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:38,944
just turn at the big pine
tree and keep going straight.

320
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,010
Now you'd better hurry along.

321
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:41,577
Great.

322
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,444
Thanks a lot.

323
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:45,177
Look at those two lovers.

324
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,377
They seem close.

325
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,244
They certainly do.

326
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:52,810
How about some
peppermint chamomile tea?

327
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:54,244
Good idea, honey.

328
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:01,244
RANMA: Listen, babe.

329
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,110
AKANE: Yeah, honey?

330
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:07,010
RANMA: After we've gone
back down the mountain--

331
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:09,177
Yeah, after we've gone back?

332
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,477
After we've gone back
down, will you marry me?

333
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,244
[gasp]

334
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:15,844
Marry you?

335
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:16,777
Come on, Akane.

336
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,710
Let's go for it.

337
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:18,744
What do you say?

338
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,244
Oh, Ranma!

339
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:21,744
I'm so happy!

340
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:23,277
Come on.

341
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,110
Let's get back to the others
and not waste any more time.

342
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:26,877
OK.

343
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,344
MOUSSE: Stop right there!

344
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:29,210
Huh?

345
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:30,310
Mousse?

346
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:32,510
You'll stay here until
the sun's gone down.

347
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:33,410
What for?

348
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:34,610
You don't have to worry.

349
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:36,210
No one's life's at risk.

350
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:39,444
Now if you'll just throw that
dangerous piece of mushroom--

351
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:41,010
RANMA: Ryoga!

352
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:43,444
Hurry and eat that piece of
mushroom before the poison

353
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:46,310
spreads any further, and
the antidote won't work.

354
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:47,110
[gasp]

355
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,144
What are you talking about?

356
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:50,344
Why should we take the antidote?

357
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:51,144
Yeah, Ryoga.

358
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:52,144
You're not making any sense.

359
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:54,010
I can explain it all later.

360
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:55,910
Enough delay, Ranma Saotome.

361
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:59,344
I'll personally make sure
you take the mushroom remedy.

362
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,577
Hold on, Kuno!

363
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,010
Listen, Ranma!

364
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,010
Come with me, Akane!

365
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:06,577
You don't understand, Ranma!

366
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:10,944
Wait, Akane!

367
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:12,510
Run like the wind!

368
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:15,144
Elope if you have to, Ranma!

369
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:15,944
[groan]

370
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:17,544
How dare you, Ranma Saotome!

371
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,677
She's my girl!

372
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,810
Stop, Akane!

373
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,844
What has gotten
into those three?

374
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:24,377
I don't know.

375
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,677
But I am definitely hanging
onto this mushroom antidote.

376
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,510
At least until I see with my
own eyes that Pop and the others

377
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:30,210
are all right.

378
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:33,177
Good plan.

379
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,510
[scream]

380
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:36,077
[groan]

381
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:44,677
You've got to
listen to me, Ranma.

382
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,577
Hurry and swallow that antidote.

383
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,644
Are you still
going on about that?

384
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,644
This is very serious, Ranma.

385
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,744
I was trying to explain
it to you before.

386
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:54,877
[groan]

387
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,544
That was too close for comfort.

388
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,744
I think it's time one of you
started explaining things.

389
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:03,310
All right.

390
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:05,744
All I've ever wanted was for
you two to be happy together.

391
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,777
And to see you get married
as soon as possible.

392
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,644
Then there's nothing
for you to worry about.

393
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:13,677
We're getting married as soon as
we get back down the mountain.

394
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,510
Isn't that right, baby?

395
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:16,210
Oh, honey.

396
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:20,044
[gasp]

397
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:21,677
Mousse, you tricked us.

398
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,244
I haven't tricked anyone.

399
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,877
I just need you to
stay here until sunset.

400
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,044
That's all.

401
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,677
Mousse!

402
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,610
You won't be
needing this anymore!

403
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:32,577
No!

404
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,277
We still need that.

405
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,751
Babe.

406
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:35,685
Hon.

407
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:36,651
[groan]

408
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:39,785
Come on.

409
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:40,785
Don't!

410
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:42,351
[scream]

411
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:46,918
[groan]

412
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:54,785
Let go of my hand, babe.

413
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:55,985
I can't, honey.

414
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:58,351
If you don't, both
of us will fall.

415
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:02,785
Now take this bag and get Ryoga
to help you back up the cliff.

416
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:03,685
No way.

417
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,185
I can't do that to you.

418
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,018
We're getting married to
each other, aren't we?

419
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:10,485
A married couple should
always be together,

420
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:11,885
even when they die.

421
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:13,918
If we can't be together in
this life, then at least

422
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:17,818
we'll be together in heaven.

423
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:19,285
Baby!

424
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:21,651
Ranma!

425
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,218
[scream]

426
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:28,151
[scream]

427
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:30,218
Oh.

428
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:33,185
Them again.

429
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:33,918
Thank you.

430
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,351
You saved us.

431
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,185
Thanks, mister.

432
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,185
Don't thank me.

433
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:39,485
I just happened
to be passing by.

434
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,918
Glad you're safe and sound.

435
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,951
You were magnificent, honey.

436
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,785
Thanks, babe!

437
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:48,718
I'll be home soon!

438
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:49,985
Huh?

439
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,118
I've made you something
special so you can

440
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:54,151
find your way back home to me.

441
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:02,718
Oh, darling, you're the
sweetest little thing.

442
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:03,885
[sigh]

443
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:16,118
Pop!

444
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:17,118
Dad!

445
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:18,085
Nabiki!

446
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:18,567
Kasumi!

447
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:34,385
It's been a long
time and coming.

448
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:35,685
What a blessing.

449
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:36,785
Come on, you two.

450
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:39,051
It's time for a celebration.

451
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:39,533
[gasp]

452
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:42,485
You mean, you're all OK?

453
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:45,151
Everyone here is doing well.

454
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,518
[laughter]

455
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:54,418
What a joyous occasion.

456
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:57,685
What a stupendous
occasion for celebration.

457
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:58,885
Fill her up.

458
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:00,318
I've got to wash
down those mushrooms.

459
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:02,085
I'm one proud papa.

460
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,818
Akane, are you sure you
want to go through with this?

461
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:05,951
Keep quiet, girl.

462
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,885
We're almost at the finish line.

463
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:10,251
What do you mean, Nabiki?

464
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:13,618
I guess I'll be calling you
sis from now on, huh, Nabiki?

465
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:14,751
Yeah, whatever.

466
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:16,451
How about a little
reality check?

467
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:17,985
They don't need any reality.

468
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:19,718
Go ahead, and tell us then.

469
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,485
1,000 yen first.

470
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:22,451
Hm.

471
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:23,451
Here you go.

472
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:25,218
Thank you.

473
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,318
The reason you two
are so deeply in love

474
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,151
is because you both
ate love mushrooms.

475
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:33,251
You mean, we're in love because
of some poison mushrooms?

476
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:35,085
You can't just explain
away the feelings

477
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,685
we have for each other
like that, right, honey?

478
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:39,951
Of course not, my baby.

479
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:42,118
It's easy to prove that
our love has nothing to do

480
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:43,418
with some poison mushrooms.

481
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,085
So we'll eat some of
that mushroom antidote.

482
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:49,451
You can see for yourselves
that our love won't change.

483
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:53,085
Don't be sure of anything
when it comes to love.

It's all over, baby.

this time, honey.

Take your hands off me!

AKANE: Ditto, buster!

00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:11,385
What do you think you're doing?

493

RANMA: You're the one who's
gotten all touchy feely!

494
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,318
AKANE: Yeah, maybe in a
parallel universe or something!

495
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:16,551
RANMA: I don't think so!

496
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:17,518
Hey, look.

You're right, Nabiki.

00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:25,918
MOUSSE: Akane, hurry!

500
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,885
Run away with Ranma!

501
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:27,851
Don't listen to him!

502
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:29,018
You must take the antidote!

503
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,585
The antidote,
it's our only hope.

504
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:33,585
Why don't you listen to me?
