171
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,604
One more time.

172
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,870
-And when did you become such
a glutton for punishment?

173
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,104
-I am not a glutton!

174
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:47,204
-You know how I
despise cynicism,

175
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:49,004
but I don't think
Ranma's taking this well.

176
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:50,004
RANMA: What's a glutton?

177
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:50,670
-I'll say.

178
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,237
-Would you two stop?

179
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:54,704
-Here's an idea, Akane.

180
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:56,204
I seem to remember
reading something

181
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:58,204
about a tournament
in town today.

182
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,404
-Tournament?

183
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:00,937
-You would you feel about
going out to the park

184
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:03,804
and putting your new strength to
the test in some women's table

185
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:04,770
tennis?

186
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,337
Hm.

187
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,770
That's right.

188
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,737
I think it said this afternoon.

189
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:12,170
-Women's table tennis
tournament, huh?

190
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,637
[panting]

191
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:17,104
RANMA: Akane, wait up!

192
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,437
-Now what?

193
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,037
-Listen, you ain't got no
business entering no strength

194
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:22,537
contest, you got that?

195
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:25,804
-I bet you'd enter if you
weren't afraid you'd lose.

196
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:27,337
-What?

197
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:28,870
Now you've done it.

198
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,704
I've been taking it easy
on you, but come here.

199
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,070
This time for real.

200
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,970
-Oh, please.

201
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,004
Not this again.

202
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,704
-You really are a glutton
for punishment, aren't you?

203
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:39,970
-[screaming]

204
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,604
-What have I got to do for
him to take me seriously?

205
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,870
-You won't get away with this!

206
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:50,170
[crowd cheering]

207
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,904
ANNOUNCER: The winner!

208
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:55,937
Claiming her fifth match today,
they charming Miss Shampoo!

209
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:58,404
-[screaming]

210
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,337
-Ni hao, Ranma!

211
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:07,804
So happy!

212
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:10,104
You come flying to see Shampoo.

213
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:11,304
-Yeah right.

214
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,370
-Excuse me.

215
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,937
Aah!

216
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:14,504
[scoffs]

217
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,037
Out of my way!

218
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:18,870
What are you two doing?

219
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,904
-Akane, why do you
always back him?

220
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,637
-Look who's talking.

221
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,204
-Get down!

222
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,404
[crash]

223
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:27,170
[crowd gasps]

224
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,570
-You stronger now
than last time.

225
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,804
-Ha.

226
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:35,304
I'm a whole different
person that I was yesterday.

227
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,270
-Hmph!

228
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,837
-Want to see for yourself?

229
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,037
I promise I won't
go too hard on you.

230
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:43,137
-You'll be sorry when Shampoo
make you eat those word.

231
00:10:43,237 --> 00:10:44,937
-We'll see, won't we?

232
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:45,704
-Fine.

233
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:46,245
We see.

234
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:50,545
-Ha.

235
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:53,311
Anything-goes martial
arts ping-pong it is then.

236
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,645
-And for prize is Ranma.

237
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,645
Is OK?

238
00:10:57,745 --> 00:10:58,545
-Hey!

239
00:10:58,645 --> 00:10:59,511
-[chuckles]

240
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,011
I don't see any reason why not.

241
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,011
[growls]

242
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,021
[whistle blows]

243
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:27,121
-Maybe you strong
now, but Shampoo still

244
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,788
beat you, just like last time.

245
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:32,954
-Ha-ha.

246
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:36,454
Yeah, well, we'll just see
about that, now, won't we?

247
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:37,354
-Stupid Akane.

248
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:38,754
What does she think she's doing?

249
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:40,288
She still hasn't
let me beat her yet.

250
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:43,254
-Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

251
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:46,188
The next match will
be starting soon.

252
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,154
Although it's not against
the rules for a challenger

253
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:51,588
to appear unannounced,
it is a little unusual.

254
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,688
So we hope you'll
bear with us as we

255
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:57,054
take this chance to briefly
review the rules of the game.

256
00:11:57,154 --> 00:12:00,721
The game of table tennis or
ping-pong is an ancient one.

257
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,954
The word "ping-pong" is actually
descended from ping-pong,

258
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:06,254
an onomatopoeic
Japanese sound effect.

259
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,321
It's the sound of the
ball hitting-- aah!

260
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:10,288
-Get to point, stupid!

261
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:13,888
-Well, suffice it so say,
the rules are, uh, simple.

262
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:14,688
[gasps]

263
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:15,654
-Enough.

264
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:16,954
Now we fight.

265
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:17,821
[crowd cheers]

266
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,021
AKANE (VOICEOVER): [chuckles]

267
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,288
Call me a weakling, will you?

268
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,088
I'm gonna make you
sorry you said that.

269
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,288
-[grunts]

270
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:35,354
-Nice try!

271
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,321
-Maybe you like this one better!

272
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,221
-Now what is it?

273
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,688
-There's super glue in there.

274
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:46,654
-You should've seen them do
anything-goes okonomiyaki.

275
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:48,121
Now that was a fight.

276
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:50,088
-Now I finish you!

277
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:51,054
Hyah!

278
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:52,054
-You wish!

279
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:53,521
[grunts fiercely]

280
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:55,954
Huh?

281
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:57,921
Hiyah!

282
00:12:58,021 --> 00:12:59,054
-Where are you going?

283
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:04,621
Come here!

284
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:05,754
-Hi-yah!

285
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,688
How'd that weakling get
so strong all of sudden?

286
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,654
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I
can really do this.

287
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,621
I can really beat Shampoo.

288
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,688
-Come back here, you chicken!

289
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:15,554
RANMA: Side effects?

290
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:16,888
-That's right.

291
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:20,454
There are the instructions
for that super soba Akane ate.

292
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:22,288
It say that along
with the new muscles

293
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:25,321
comes the development of
some distinctly male traits.

294
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,154
-You mean she'll
turn into a boy?

295
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,954
-Oh, be serious, will you?

296
00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:30,788
No, she'll just grow whiskers.

297
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:32,721
-Meh!

298
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:35,321
You mean as in a mustache?

299
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:36,821
Hm.

300
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:39,054
-Don't go there.

301
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:39,588
[weeps]

302
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,088
-Get off me.

303
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,754
-Ranma, do you want
your wife's mustache

304
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:44,521
to be bigger than your own?

305
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:45,654
-Huh?

306
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:47,888
Uh.

307
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:48,954
-(FALSETTO) Come on, baby.

308
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:50,521
Give us a kiss.

309
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,354
-[screams]

310
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:56,788
-I told you not to go there.

311
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:58,688
Fortunately, I brought this.

312
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,554
-Well, what is it?

313
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:02,188
-An antidote to the super soba.

314
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,454
-Oh yeah?

315
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:06,254
-You'll make certain Akane
swallows some, right?

316
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:08,721
Right?

317
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:10,721
-Hey, consider it done.

318
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:13,688
-[panting]

319
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:18,654
Where could she
have gone off to?

320
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:19,654
RANMA: Yo, Akane!

321
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,121
-Huh?

322
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:22,588
What do you want?

323
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:23,888
-Just, uh, come here a sec.

324
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,988
-You want to wrestle me again?

325
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:27,388
-Ah.

326
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:30,354
-Ah.

327
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,821
And what is that?

328
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,821
-Eh, some kind of
super soba antidote.

329
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:34,454
-Huh?

330
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,421
Oh no, you don't.

331
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:38,288
Not until I beat
shampoo, you don't.

332
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:40,754
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER): Super soba.

333
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:43,221
So that would make
Akane so strong.

334
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,554
HAPPOSAI: Woohoo!

335
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,221
At last I've found
