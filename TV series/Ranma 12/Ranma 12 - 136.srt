00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,333
It's the underwear thief!

00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,800
What a haul!

5
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,800
What a haul!

6
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,766
Ha, ha, I'm set for life.

7
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:55,307
Ha, ha!

8
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:04,866
That's him!

9
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,466
He stole our underwear!

10
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:07,000

[yelling, crashing]

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,533
How do you like getting a
taste of your own medicine,

13
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:21,400
you dirty old freak.

14
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,900
I'm disappointed in you, Ranma.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,933
Is this any way to
respect your elders?

16
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:48,033
It's payback time with
the secret medicine

17
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,000
of the Shujyugan.

18
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,033
The master gets the red
tablet for good luck

19
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,000
while the disciple gets
the white one for bad luck.

20
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,166
And when the disciple wakes
up, he won't know what hit him.

21
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,700
In just a minute, it
should take effect.

I'm stuck to him.

Hey, what are you doing here?

33
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,933
Isn't it enough
that you creep out

34
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,600
half the girls in this town?

35

Hey, that's cold!

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,700
ALL: Shujyugan?

41
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,733
Excuse me, but what
might that be, Master?

42
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:40,400
Do I have to explain
everything to you?

43
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,900
Let's see here.

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,766
"Shujyugan-- a medicine that a
master administers in pill form

to his disciple.

46
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:50,833
And no matter where the master
will go, his pupil will follow.

47
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:56,266
Whether it's out for a simple
walk or even when he eats."

48
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:57,233
Yeah.

49
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,133
But the part I
can't figure out is

50
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:02,133
why do I have to be
stuck to Ranma like this?

51
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:05,033
But it clearly says the
Shujyugan pill is magnetically

52
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,700
charged, and the master and
pupil cannot be separated.

53
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
How could you miss that, Master?

54
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,833
Well, someone obviously
didn't read the instructions.

55
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,866
HAPPOSAI: I'll figure
this out somehow.

56
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:22,366
But for now, maybe
something to eat.

57
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,766
Ranma, would you
stop teasing him?

58
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,433
What do you think you're
doing, you crazy old freak!

59
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:47,900
Get off of me!

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,441
Ah!

61
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Until we figure out a way
to get you two separated,

62
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,633
why don't you try to
be nice to each other?

00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,866
Ranma!

64
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:05,600
Huh?

65
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,866
Hey, Ukyo.

66
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:11,333
You must forgive me for
asking, but what is that thing?

67
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:15,300
Believe it or not, this
thing is actually stuck to me.

68
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:15,866
Huh?

69
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:16,500
Are you serious?

70
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:22,766
Just don't let go of the fence.

Gee, I'm sorry, Ukyo.

00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:35,700
No, Ranma.

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm sorry that I
couldn't help you.

[sigh]

78
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,266
At least now we know
using physical force won't

79
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,066
do the trick.

80
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,900
There's no way in the world
that I'm going into school

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,600
and letting everyone see
this lump stuck to me.

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,900
I never thought about that.

Hey, you don't have to
worry about a thing.

Just leave it all
up to me, Ranma.

Isn't he adorable?

86
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:07,733
So, what do you think, Ranma?

87
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,733
I think you've lost it.

88
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,666
Excuse me?

00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:12,300
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,100
He's adorable.

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,133
OK.

92
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,466
Let's get going or
else we'll be late.

00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,000
I can move, but--

RANMA: You are driving
me completely nuts!

HAPPOSAI: Hang on and
enjoy the ride, kiddo!

101
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:06,733
Let go!

102
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,400
Let go!

103
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:14,066
[yelling, crashing]

104
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,966
I should have you surgically
removed without anesthetic.

105
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,866
You're in so much trouble!

106
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
I've had it with you!

107
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,266
And I've had it with you!

108
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,066
AKANE: What?

109
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,466
Are you absolutely
sure about that, Dad?

110
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,100
We don't have
any time to waste.

111
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,533
We have to get those
two separated at once.

112
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,133
We'll meet you there, Akane.

113
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,833
Oh, my gosh!

114
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,933
Would you quit shoving me.

115
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:24,666
Exactly what I wish you'd do!

116
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:25,733
AKANE: Ranma!

117
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,700
Uh-oh.

118
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,100
Stop it, Ranma!

119
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,641
Akane!

120
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:34,400
Why, you sleaze!

121
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,933
How dare you even
try anything, Ranma!

122
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:37,733
Hey!

123
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,266
It's not me doing anything.

124
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,533
Never mind that.

125
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,533
If we don't separate you
two, you'll be stuck forever!

126
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,800
Seriously?

127
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,566
Say it ain't so.

128

[yelling, crashing]

129
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:53,615
SOUN: Ranma!

130
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:54,500
Akane!

131
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,966
Good news!

132
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:59,233
I've discovered a way we
can get those two detached

133
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,433
from each other.

134
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,666
All right!

135
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:03,400
Well hurry up!

136
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,533
HAPPOSAI: Come on, already.

137
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,800
Tell us, tell us,
tell us please.

138
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,100
Right.

139
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,433
There's only one way, and I
believe it's quite simple.

140
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,866
I'm waiting.

141
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,533
All that needs to happen is for
the master-student relationship

142
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:15,900
to end.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,466
So if Ranma beats the master
in battle, they can separate.

144
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:19,966
It's the only way.

145
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,933
Hm.

146
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:23,233
Fair enough.

147
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,033
If you say that is our only
hope, then so it shall be.

148
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,533
Ranma, do your worst.

149
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:32,433
Oh, I'm going to enjoy this.

150
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,366
Let's get started.

151
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,466
Get ready!

152
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,666
[yelling]

153
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:52,727
RANMA: Get ready!

154
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:58,194
Hm?

155
00:10:58,294 --> 00:10:58,735
What?

156
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:05,627
So what'd you have to go
and move for, you nimrod?

157
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:09,094
Hey, you can beat me up,
but I don't want to get hurt.

158
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:11,494
Why, you little fake!

159
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:14,127
How are we supposed
to come apart then?

160
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:16,594
HAPPOSAI: Any way you
want but without pain!

161
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:18,794
RANMA: Why don't you be a
man for once in your life,

162
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,661
or is that too much to ask?

163
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:23,227
HAPPOSAI: Because
I don't want to.

164
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,794
Unhand Ranma, Master!

165
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,861
Why don't you two grow up?

166
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:34,361
[crashing, muttering]

167
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:43,194
Would you please hold still.

168
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,327
HAPPOSAI: I don't think so.

169
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:55,827
How are we supposed to help
you if you won't help yourself!

170
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,961
Maybe we should give
this whole thing up.

171
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:05,494
I mean, I could be
stuck to someone worse.

172
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:08,894
Besides, I'm so old, I
don't have much time left.

173
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,127
But I don't think
that works for Ranma.

174
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:15,327
All right, I give up.

175
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:17,961
We'll stay stuck together.

176
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:19,527
What are you saying?

177
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:20,994
Are you nuts?

178
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:22,261
[muttering]

179
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:26,061
From now on, we'll live
together like conjoined twins.

180
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:29,061
Do you mean that, Ranma?

181
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:30,494
You must be joking.

182
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:37,294
[ringing]

183
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:44,127
Isn't this peaceful, Master?

184
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:44,761
Yeah, sure.

185
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,094
Whatever.

186
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:49,194
What does that Ranma
think he's doing anyway?

187
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:52,127
Maybe I'm wrong, but am I
sensing a hint of jealousy

188
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:53,627
here?

189
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:55,794
First of all, I'm
not jealous, OK?

190
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:58,561
I'm just trying to figure out
Ranma's little plan, that's

191
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,861
all.

192
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:03,594
You don't think they'll stay
like that forever, do you?

193
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:07,061
[bridal chorus playing]

194
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:10,494
Ranma, darling.

195
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,927
Yes, my love?

196
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,061
[laughs]

197
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,661
This just can't be.

198
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,794
It might be OK now,
but I could never

199
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,294
live with the two of them.

200
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:29,394
RANMA: Ukyo, you want
me to wash your back?

201
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,761
UKYO (VOICEOVER): How romantic.

202
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:35,727
I'd love it.

203
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,427
And I'll do your front.

204
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,827
[exclaiming]

205
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,594
Akane, we don't have
any time to lose!

206
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:53,827
We've got to get
those two apart!

207
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:55,327
Yeah, sure.

208
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:59,127
RANMA: So, Master, are
you enjoying the massage?

209
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:01,994
Oh, I've gotta tell you, Ranma.

210
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:04,294
You've got magic fingers.

211
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,094
Oh, please.

212
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:06,294
You are too kind.

213
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:08,094
I'm just honored to
be around you so I can

214
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:09,627
absorb your great knowledge.

215
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:13,361
You know, I think I
underestimated you, my son.

216
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:14,527
I don't get it.

217
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:17,627
How come Ranma's being
so nice to the old loon?

218
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,961
I think he's just biding
his time until he can

219
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:22,227
catch that pervert off guard.

220
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:23,227
Do you think so?

221
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:26,861
Huh?

222
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:30,727
Oh, man, what am I doing?

223
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,594
Hey, quit messing with my head.

224
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:33,827
That really hurt me.

225
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:35,861
Well, if you think that
hurt, then just keep it up,

226
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,794
you freaky old nut case.

227
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,627
You're asking for
trouble, and trust me,

228
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:41,094
you don't want to
get me too angry.

229
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:46,027
Because if you push me too far,
I'll-- have to say I'm sorry,

230
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:48,094
and hope that someday
you'll forgive me for being

231
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:49,127
so unbearable.

232
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:51,127
Now is there something
I can get for you,

233
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:53,627
like a nice cup of tea?

234
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,994
Oh, Ranma, you sure
have a way to make

235
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:58,427
an old man feel warm and fuzzy.

236
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,927
I think there's something
wrong with Ranma.

237
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:01,961
You're right.

238
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,094
I know he's not that
good of an actor.

239
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,761
He could never pull it off.

240
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:19,161
Ranma, the answer to
question four is "carbon."

241
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:22,694
Oh, Master, I bet I'd be a
complete failure without you

242
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:23,494
around.

243
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:25,094
[laughing]

244
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:26,594
Yeah, you got
that right, kiddo.

245
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,594
[snoring]

246
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:44,094
AKANE (WHISPERING): Ranma!

247
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,094
Ranma!

248
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,194
Huh?

249
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:47,494
(WHISPERING) Do it now!

250
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:48,694
Do what now?

251
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:52,327
Now is your chance to get
rid of that old weirdo.

252
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:53,761
Oh, really, Akane?

253
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:57,061
I would never do anything
to harm my master.

254
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,794
Prepare to die, you leech!

255
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:01,261
I've had it with you.

256
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:04,409
Ugh!

257
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:11,161
Saotome, not in my class.

258
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:11,994
Huh?

259
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:13,061
Did-- Did I miss anything?

260
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,994
[giggling]

261
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:17,361
[growling]

262
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:24,194
So what are we
going to do now, Dad?

263
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,827
I don't know, Akane.

264
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,961
The problem seems to
be Ranma succumbing

265
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,661
to the effects of
the Shujyugan pill

266
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:31,827
that the master has given him.

267
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:34,527
You mean he's--
he's been drugged?

268
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,161
Ranma is changing into
exactly what the master wants

269
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:40,827
him to become, and there's only
one way I know how to stop it.

270
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:42,594
If we don't get them
separated, there

271
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:44,561
won't be any hope left for him.

272
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:47,561
The power of the
Shujyugan is to be feared.

273
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:52,094
Oh, I only hope we're
not too late to save him.

274
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,227
RANMA: This is so sweet.

275
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:55,761
HAPPOSAI: Well done, Ranma.

276
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:59,127
[screaming]

277
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:03,194
RANMA: I love stealing
women's underwear!

278
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:05,961
HAPPOSAI: That a boy, Ranma!

279
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:07,061
Ugh, this is bad.

280
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:12,594
Set!

281
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:14,794
Spike!

282
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:15,761
Ow!

283
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:17,761
That really hurt.

284
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:20,094
You didn't have
to hit it so hard.

285
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:23,594
If I were your age,
that is the kind of girl

286
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,994
I'd fall for, Ranma.

287
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:29,461
I think I know what
you mean, Master.

288
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:30,427
OK, good.

289
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:31,994
We practiced enough for one day.

290
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:32,994
OK, sweet.

291
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:39,527
Excuse me, Ranma.

292
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:40,361
What?

293
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:42,627
I'd like to ask you something?

294
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:43,394
Sure.

295
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:44,361
Anything you want, Master.

296
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,894
(FEMALE VOICE) I never would
have thought of that, Master.

297
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:53,794
Now we can get into
the girl's locker room

298
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,394
without freaking everybody out.

299
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:58,494
You are quickly becoming
my star pupil, Ranma.

300
00:17:58,594 --> 00:17:59,561
Come on, let's go.

301
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:04,194
Hey, Ukyo.

302
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,694
I can't bear to see
you like this, Ranma.

303
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,527
And I'm going to do
something about it.

304
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:14,627
Ah!

305
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,361
My favorite spatula
is bent again

306
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,161
and I just had it fixed too.

307
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:19,194
I give up.

308
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:26,794
There you are.

309
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:27,327
Huh?

310
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:28,161
Akane?

311
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:29,927
Ranma, you've got to wake up.

312
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,894
Just look at yourself.

313
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:35,961
I know you don't realize it, but
he's got you under his spell.

314
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:38,327
You've got to
listen to me, Ranma.

315
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:39,461
Ah, come on.

316
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:41,294
I think you're the one
who's got to wake up.

317
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:43,427
I feel fine.

318
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:46,561
Well, OK, but you're
sure acting strange.

319
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:47,361
Never mind.

320
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,361
I'll just go.

321
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,961
If you ask me, she's losing it.

322
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:56,494
Come on, we can't leave all
those young girl's waiting now,

323
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,261
can we?

324
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:58,161
Oh, yeah.

325
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:01,027
I almost forgot.

326
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:04,161
It's just me.

327
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:04,702
Huh?

328
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:11,094
(IMITATING FEMALE) I'm so
glad you could make it, Ranma.

329
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:13,627
(IMITATING FEMALE) Why don't
you come on in and introduce us

330
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:14,894
to your little friend.

331
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:16,761
What in the world's
going on here?

332
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:17,302
Ah.

333
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,894
Ranma, now's your chance!

334
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,894
Hurry up and make your move.

335
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:25,427
Oh, yeah.

336
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:25,994
They're right.

337
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:34,827
That's what you get
for being a freak.

338
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,294
Hey, Dad.

339
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:39,194
How'd it go--

340
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,394
[barfing]

341
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,127
(IMITATING FEMALE)
Did you just see that?

342
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:44,761
I can't believe my eyes.

343
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:47,094
(IMITATING FEMALE) Honestly,
brute force always gets me

344
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:49,527
in a tizzy.

345
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:50,627
[barfing]

346
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:53,127
BOTH: How could we do this?

347
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,527
So, uh, what's the deal?

348
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,027
They were trying to
help you, that's all.

349
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,627
Well, I guess I
owe you one, Akane.

350
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:03,394
No, I think you owe everyone.

351
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,194
She is right, you know.

352
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:07,194
Yeah, you owe us big time.

353
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:08,961
[barfing]

354
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:09,494
RANMA: Gross!

355
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,061
Now I know how much
trouble you can get

356
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:17,261
into having a useless master.

357
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:19,694
How do you know the
mater was useless.

358
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:21,827
Hey, don't even go there, girl.

359
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:23,494
At least you're helping him.

360
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:25,494
Told you I was a nice guy.

361
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:26,994
[giggling]

362
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,661
RANMA: Time for
dinner, you old freak.

363
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:38,961
You have to eat something
to get back your strength.

364
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:39,761
Hey, Akane.

365
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:40,827
I've got an idea.

366
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:42,461
Why don't you bring
his dinner in here,

367
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:43,827
and I'll feed the
pervert myself?

368
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,361
Here you go.

369
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:51,361
OK, old man.

370
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:52,594
Let's see what's on the menu.

371
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:55,194
How about we start with
Akane's homemade soup.

372
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:56,861
Isn't this like the old days?

373
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:58,894
Just you and me together?

374
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:01,261
This is gonna be so much fun.

375
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:04,427
You know, I'm not
very hungry, I--

376
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:05,227
How is it?

377
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:05,768
RANMA: Well?

378
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:10,494
Wait a sec, don't
tell me you're saying

379
00:21:10,594 --> 00:21:12,827
you don't like Akane's cooking?

380
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,294
No, I'm not saying that at all.

381
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:15,627
I'm just not hungry, that's all.

382
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,994
I just--

383
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:20,561
RANMA: Keep eating.

384
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:22,994
Please, how about a
little compassion here?

385
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:25,927
I love her cooking!

386
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:27,794
RANMA: Good boy.

387
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:29,494
Have another.

388
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:31,461
Nice work.

389
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:32,461
Almost done.

390
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:47,861
[music playing]

391
00:23:16,383 --> 00:23:17,783
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
What in the world

392
00:23:17,883 --> 00:23:21,149
was the principal thinking when
he put Kuno, of all people,

393
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:22,916
in charge of the school.

394
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:26,149
Next time on "Ranma
1/2"-- "Tatewaki Kuno,

395
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:27,683
Substitute Principal."

396
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,616
We'll see you there!
