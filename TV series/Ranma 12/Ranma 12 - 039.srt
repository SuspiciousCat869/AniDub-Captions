mean that nothing

finest role will do.

00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:07,640
Me, at the basis of toads
enjoy their moment in the sun.

169
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:10,340
You see, I disguised
myself as the balcony.

170
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,773
Come here!

171
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:14,340
-You cut that out!

172
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,706
Yo, Juliet.

173
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,773
-Ah, Romeo!

174
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:29,506
-Seven, eight, nine, 10!

175
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,440
That's it, you're out of here!

176
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:33,373
-Fine.

177
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:34,006
-I lose.

178
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,741
-I lose.

179
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,173
-Oh, Juliet.

180
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:44,773
-Oh, my Romeo.

181
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:11,973
-Well, shouldn't they
be saying something?

182
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:14,940
-Nah, it's a dramatic pause.

183
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:18,006
-Oh, can't you just feel
their love for each other?

184
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,473
-Oh, my Romeo.

185
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:30,073
Say your line, stupid.

186
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,840
-I got lines?

187
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,040
SOUN: Take her in
your arms, son.

188
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:35,640
Like that.

189
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:36,906
AKANE: Huh?

190
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,473
-I knew you'd need
your old dad tonight.

191
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:40,940
-Dad, what are you--

192
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:41,973
-Leave it to me, son.

193
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:45,406
Do what I do and say what I say.

194
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,506
-Uh, OK.

195
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,073
-Juliet.

196
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,073
-Juliet.

197
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,406
-Oh, Romeo.

198
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,840
-I pledge to marry thee and
take over thy father's dojo.

199
00:09:55,873 --> 00:10:02,206
-I pledge to marry thee and
take over they fath-- Dojo?

200
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,040
DINOSAUR: Hey, I
don't remember any--

201
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,606
SOUN: Sh!

202
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,540
Right.

203
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:07,506
In you go.

204
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,873
AUDIENCE: This is it.

205
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:12,806
The moment we've all
been waiting for.

206
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,373
-Not for real, it's just a play.

207
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,973
-Will you cut that out already?

208
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:22,706
-But son, we'd give you
our parental consent.

209
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,840
Now do it.

210
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,573
It's time to kiss.

211
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:32,006
-I ain't kissing nobody.

212
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,158
Nobody!

213
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,940
No way, I don't care
if it is a play.

214
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:43,906
I ain't kissing nobody.

215
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:00,764
-I ain't kissing her.

216
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:01,698
Do you hear me?

217
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:02,864
I ain't doing it.

218
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:06,631
But I'm still Romeo.

219
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,064
-What do you mean you
ain't gonna kiss her?

220
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:10,031
-Stupid!

221
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:11,398
Not fair!

222
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:12,098
-Honestly.

223
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:12,964
Fine then.

224
00:11:15,764 --> 00:11:18,764
-Surely, the inability
to play a love scene

225
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,264
is grounds for impeachment.

226
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:23,431
You're no Romeo, pigtail boy.

227
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:24,931
Hit the showers!

228
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:29,298
-You're morons as
far as I'm concerned.

229
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:32,198
-Well, would you rather I was
kissed by those two perverts,

230
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:33,131
then?

231
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:33,731
-Hm?

232
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:44,964
Like I said, there ain't nothing
I won't do to get to China.

233
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:47,564
I'll give them a love
scene they'll never forget.

234
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:51,264
-And now, my dear, as
for the love scene--

235
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:56,398
-It's not fair.

236
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:57,698
They're ruining everything.

237
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,398
KASUMI (VOICEOVER):
You can do it, Akane.

238
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:06,931
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Kasumi?

239
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:09,364
KASUMI (VOICEOVER): You were
so excited about this role.

240
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,764
Don't give up on it now.

241
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,164
AKANE (VOICEOVER): She's right.

242
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,964
Playing Juliet was
my childhood dream,

243
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:16,831
no matter who my Romeo is.

244
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:19,898
-Juliet.

245
00:12:23,664 --> 00:12:24,931
-Oh, Romeo.

246
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:27,964
-Oh, Juliet, how I've
waited for this day.

247
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:28,937
-I can't!

248
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,064
-Woo-hoo!

249
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:33,264
The wedding scene!

250
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:34,864
The wedding scene!

251
00:12:34,898 --> 00:12:37,464
-Alas, poor Juliet is captured
by an evil beast, intensified--

252
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:39,731
-And who are you
calling a beast, huh?

253
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:41,031
Who do you think you are?

254
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:44,598
Do you know who you're
talking to, you rat?

255
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,631
Ah, my Juliet.

256
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,331
And now for the honeymoon.

257
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:48,864
-Suck on this.

258
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:52,664
Oh, Romeo, let's have a wedding
toast together, shall we?

259
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:54,364
-Hey, there's a new Juliet!

260
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,231
-Go, Romeo.

261
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:04,531
Go chug-a-lug!

262
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:09,731
Allow me to give you
a token for my love.

263
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:12,298
-Oh, a bra!

264
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:14,864
Ha, how sweet.

265
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:15,557
-Get it!

266
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,364
That's one down.

267
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:24,031
-Ah, my pigtailed Juliet!

268
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:27,964
-Oh, wherefore art thou, Romeo?

269
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:29,464
-Right here, dear Juliet.

270
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:33,064
-Hey!

271
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:33,717
Hey!

272
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:34,431
You!

273
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:35,431
You there!

274
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:36,431
Yes, you!

275
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:37,564
Stop!

276
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:38,931
The consumption of
alcohol is str--

277
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,231
-It's not Saki.

278
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,698
It is the dew of our love.

279
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:49,298
-Why-- why didn't you say so.

280
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:54,098
-Juliet, into my embrace, dear
Juliet, if life you value.

281
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,264
-Ah, Juliet is--

282
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,264
-Give me that.

283
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,764
Only pretending to be drunk.

284
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:05,431
Behold, the dreaded drunk food.

285
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:06,364
-Ya!

286
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:07,831
Feel my love's kiss.

287
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:20,364
KUNO (VOICEOVER): I
can't read her moves.

288
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:24,831
-That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

289
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,131
It's the legendary
drunk fu, an anything

290
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:29,031
goes school of martial
arts special attack.

291
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,964
So secret, it's never been
performed in public until now.

292
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,898
Practiced secretly
in bars for years.

293
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,131
For the first time ever,
it's live on stage.

294
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,764
-Would you believe-- snooze fu?

295
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:51,298
-Ah, why art thou, yet so fair?

296
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:53,131
Thus with a kiss.

297
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:55,664
AKANE: I think you've
got the wrong Juliet.

298
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:57,964
Fight me, not her.

299
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:02,164
-Ah, it is the East, and
fair Juliet is the sun.

300
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:02,898
Very well.

301
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,031
I accept your challenge!

302
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:10,798
-Go sober up, you lush.

303
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,037
-Surrender, Juliet.

304
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,670
You're mine.

305
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:20,437
Oh!

306
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,603
-Romeo, you two-timer!

307
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:24,003
-Hey, no fair!

308
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:25,403
I'm Juliet, not you!

309
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:28,237
-Oh, so you want a
love scene with Kuno.

310
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,603
-That's not what I said.

311
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:31,737
-Then but out!

312
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,570
I'm going to China no
matter what it takes.

313
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,470
-Even with tape,
this is disgusting.

314
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,237
-Oh thank you, cute girl.

315
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,870
I'm so happy.

316
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,203
-That's it, I'm going home!

317
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:01,103
Good luck with the
rest of the play.

318
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:01,970
-Wait, Akane!

319
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,703
Don't go!

320
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:06,770
[mumbles]

321
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:11,837
-Alas, what will become
of Romeo and Juliet?

322
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,003
Now what?

323
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:14,370
Maybe we should have
an intermission.

324
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:17,703
-Akane, wait up.

325
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:19,503
C'mon, it's almost over.

326
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:23,503
-Why don't you go back and
kiss Kuno again, Ranma.

327
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:24,459
Pervert.

328
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,537
-Hey, I used tape, OK?

329
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,937
-So you say.

330
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,537
-Hey!

331
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:40,870
She is so uncute!

332
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,670
-No, you dummy.

[collapsing sound]

334
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,037
-Enter Sasuke, stage right.

335
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,637
Mua-ha-ha!

336
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:07,937
I'll show them all what
it means to be a star.

337
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,970
-What do you think you're
doing, you little--

338
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:13,870
-Wait, Juliet!

339
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,837
-Juno.

340
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,170
-Having shared a kiss with the
pigtailed girl, is it not me

341
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:26,503
I should kiss you as well.

342
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:28,170
-You liar!

343
00:17:28,203 --> 00:17:30,837
It don't count if you use tape.

344
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,670
-Hurry, hurry.

345
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:32,737
It's scene three.

346
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,637
-Hey stupid, we've
got to play to finish.

347
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,203
MAN: Fair Juliet sleeps the
sleep of death, but wait!

348
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:48,337
There is one way to awaken her.

349
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,170
A kiss from her beloved Romeo.

350
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,703
RANMA: What is the
matter with you?

351
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,103
Why does everything keep coming
back to that stupid kiss?

352
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,937
-Please, don't you
want to see China?

353
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,803
-Oh, yeah.

354
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:04,970
It's-- it's-- it's a special
request from our guest judge.

355
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,037
-No, it's hard.

356
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,403
Kiss girl and win contest.

357
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,237
Win contest, go see China.

358
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,503
-C'mon, no more stalling.

359
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:16,537
Kiss her.

360
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,103
Well, c'mon, are you
her fiance or not?

361
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:20,670
-There are people watching, OK?

362
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:22,737
SOUN: Sounds like you've changed
your mind about seeing China

363
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,270
then?

364
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,003
RANMA: Yes!

365
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,170
I mean, no.

366
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:25,837
SOUN: Then, what
are you waiting for?

367
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:40,337
RANMA (VOICEOVER): If-- If I--
If I can just go through this,

368
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,070
I-- If I can just
get to see China,

369
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:56,670
I-- I can be a normal guy again.

370
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,537
Here goes nothing.

371
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:08,837
I can't do it.

372
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,537
-Ranma, come on.

373
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,237
Do it.

374
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,903
-You hurry.

375
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,637
Kiss girl.

376
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,903
-Oh, Romeo.

377
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,937
Do you really hate me that much?

378
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,037
-No, of course I don't.

379
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,770
If I did, this would be easy.

380
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,170
-Then do it.

381
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,303
Kiss me.

382
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,303
-Really?

383
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:40,203
-Can you just make believe?

384
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:41,437
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Akane.

385
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,937
-The winner!

386
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,603
Please give big hand!

387
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,370
-Now that's quite a
performance, don't you think?

388
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,037
AKANE: What are
you so mad about?

389
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,903
RANMA: Oh, shut up.

390
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:26,403
RANMA (VOICEOVER): She didn't
have to trick me like that.

391
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:31,770
-Still, don't you wish we could
have done it without the tape?

392
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,303
You fell for it.

393
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:34,437
You're such a dope.

394
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,537
-You are so un-- cute.

395
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,303
AKANE: We're home!

396
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:52,270
-You're home so late.

397
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:54,103
Is everything OK?

398
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:57,903
-Yeah, everybody else
is already seeing China.

399
00:20:57,937 --> 00:20:58,503
-Huh?

400
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,237
SOUN: Rawra-- er, Ranma, pleased
to meet my favorite Hong Kong

401
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,403
movie star.

402
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:09,337
CHINA: Please,
just call me China.

403
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,903
It's my stage name.

404
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,770
-I hope you didn't get the wrong
idea when we said the China.

405
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:17,337
-Well, son, now you can
see China all you want.

406
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,737
-Poor Ranma.

407
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,103
He must be so tired.

408
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,637
-Well, maybe he'll wake up if
you give him a kiss, Akane.

409
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,703
AKANE: I think it's
kinder to let him sleep.

410
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:42,404
[music playing]

411
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:10,804
NARRATOR: So the bathtub
is broken again, huh?

412
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:12,904
Oh, well I get
these things happen.

413
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,304
Good thing there's a
public bathhouse near by.

414
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:17,338
Excuse me, with [inaudible]?

415
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:18,604
Are you crazy?

416
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:21,271
Next time on Ranma
1/2, "Bathouse battle!

417

We're in some hot water now."

00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:23,759
See you there.
