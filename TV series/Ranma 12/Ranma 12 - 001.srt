You better cut that out.

Well I still say the
whole things sucks.

00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,275
Taking my fiance from
me without even asking.

14
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:05,842
I'm going back to China now.

How I've waited for this day.

Kasumi.

-Yes, what is it father?

That felt pretty
good. [click] Huh?

-There you go again Akane.

34
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,142
This is exactly
the type of thing

35
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:50,408
that makes the boys
think you're so weird.

36
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:52,275
-So why should I care, Nabiki?

37
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:55,442
Not everybody thinks the whole
world revolves around boys!

00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,108
-No?

39
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:00,875
Then I guess this
wouldn't interest you.

SOUN: Yes.

42
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,742
The son of a very
good friend of mine.

43
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:13,342
His name is Ranma Saotome.

44
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,442
If one of you three girls
were to marry him and carry

45
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:19,642
on this training hall, then
the Tendo family legacy

46
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,508
would be secure.

47
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:23,508
-Hey, wait a minute
here, don't we

48
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:26,375
get to have some say in
who were going to marry?

49
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:28,375
-Maybe you should wait
until you meet him.

50
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:31,842
You never know, he
might be really cute.

51
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,842
Right Daddy?

52
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:39,875
--[laughs] He'll be
here any minute.

53

Ranma and his father have
been on a training mission.

54
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,608
Recently they
crossed into China.

-Ooh, China.

56
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,242
-So he hiked all
the way to China.

57
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:51,308
Wow, big deal.

58
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:53,375
-Father, how old is this Ranma?

59
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:54,842
-Is he cute?

00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,275

-[laughs] I don't know.

00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:06,075
-You don't know?

64
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:06,908
-I've never met him.

00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,875
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Oh
please, I don't believe this.

66
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:26,608
RANMA: Let go, you old fool.

67
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:29,075
I told you, I don't
want any part of this.

68
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:32,008
Now put me down.

-Saotome, my friend.

We've been waiting.

73
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:43,342
-I hope that he's older than me.

00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,808
-Ah

-Come on, Pop.

scaring them spitless.

decided to drop in.

Is that it, Pop?

-I'm Ranma Saotome.

00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,908
Sorry about this.

He's not the only one.

Father's coming to.

-This is all your fault, Daddy.

107
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:49,475
Don't you know the difference
between a boy and a girl?

108
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:52,808
-I assumed my friend
Genma's son was a boy.

like a boy do you, huh Daddy?

she said, Nabiki.

Now why don't you
leave her alone.

KASUMI: Ranma, you
can use this room.

143
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:21,308
Would you like to freshen
up and have a bath now?

144

-Uh, no thanks.

was that strange man

00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:36,442
sitting in our living room?

-Huh?

-Go tell Akane she
can take her bath now.

00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:48,708
-OK

153

-Uh, that's cold.

154
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:57,275
AKANE: I guess we can
both take our baths.

-Hm, what to do?

156

They're bound to find
out sooner or later.

Well, may as well
just go out like I am.

What are you doing with that?

-There's a pervert
in the bathroom.

166

-Well, gee Akane, why didn't
you just clobber him then?

-Because I got scared.

00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:16,545
Is that all right?

169
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,545
-Oh, I do hope Ranma's alright.

170
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:21,278
I thought she was in there
taking a bath right now.

171
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,978
RANMA: Excuse me.

172
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,845
-Who is that?

173
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:29,511
NABIKI: Who are you?

174
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:32,145
-I'm, uh, Ranma Saotome.

175
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,411
Sorry about this.

176
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,711
-I can explain everything.

177
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:55,945
This is my dear old friend.

178
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:57,745
-Genma Saotome.

179
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,478
And this is my son.

180
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,445
-Ranma.

181
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:03,945
-[grunt]

182
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,511
-This gets more
interesting by the minute.

183
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:10,478
-Are you really her?

184
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:13,511
The same girl who we saw before?

185
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:14,011
-I am.

186
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:23,811
-It's such a long story, I
don't know where to begin.

187
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:27,878
Well then, let's
start with this.

188
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:28,378
-Whaa!

189
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:36,911
What'd do that for?

190
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:39,078
-Oh my.

191
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,345
-Ranma's a girl now.

192
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:46,378
-I am so ashamed, I cannot
bear to see my son like this.

193
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:47,545
-[grunt]

194
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:50,911
-Ranma Saotome, you break
your father's heart.

195
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:00,245
-Who are you talk?

196
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,445
My old man's a panda.

197
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:05,945
-Father, you certainly
have some unusual friends.

198
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:07,345
-They didn't used
to be like this.

199
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:10,045
It was training in China
that did this to them.

200
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:12,478
Something terrible happened
during a dangerous training

201
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,478
exercise.

202
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:14,545
Maybe we should give
them a few moments

203
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,678
to come back to themselves.

204
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:27,911
-Ah yes, it all started
one fateful month ago.

205
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:33,945
Ranma and I were voyaging
across the ocean to China.

206
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:37,078
We journeyed for many
days and many nights.

207
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:42,178
It was in China's
Mount Kwanjeng region

208
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,978
in the Bayankala range,
Qinghai Provence,

209
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:49,878
that we finally found
what we were looking for.

210
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,445
-Here sirs, we come to
famous training ground

211
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:55,411
of cursed springs, Jusenkyo.

212
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:57,111
-Are you prepared, Rama?

213
00:15:57,145 --> 00:16:00,811
-Ah, man this place ain't near
as bad as I thought it'd be.

214
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:04,211
GUIDE: Ooh sirs, you are
very strange ones, no?

215
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,445
This place is a very dangerous.

216
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:10,078
Nobody use it now, 'cuz
more than 100 spring here,

217
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:14,178
and each one have own
tragedy happen there.

218
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:16,378
-Ranma, follow me!

219
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:17,345
-Right behind ya'.

220
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,445
-Hey, sirs, what are you doing?

221
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,545
I have not finished
my tragic story.

222
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:22,578
You can't go there.

223
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:25,445
GENMA: I won't go
easy on you, Ranma.

224
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:26,978
RANMA: That's just
the way I like it.

225
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,978
GUIDE: Please sirs, very
bad you fall in spring.

226
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:38,678
-Hey Pop, what's up?

227
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:39,378
We done already?

228
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,045
-[growl]

229
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:45,545
-Ah!

230
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:50,945
What-- what the hell is that?

231
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:54,111
-That one, Shonmaoniichuan,
Spring of Drowned Panda.

232
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:58,011
Very tragic story of panda
who drowned 2,000 year ago.

233
00:16:58,045 --> 00:17:02,278
The legend say, whoever fall
in spring take body of panda.

234
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:05,511
-Hey buddy, you never said
anything about that to us.

235
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:07,978
[gasp] Ah!

236
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:12,611
-Oh, too bad.

237
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:16,311
You fall in Nyannichuan,
Spring of Drowned Girl.

238
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:18,811
There very tragic
legend of young girl who

239
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:22,078
drowned in spring
1,500 year ago.

240
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:25,478
Now whoever fall in the spring
take a body of a young girl.

241
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:25,978
Haha.

242
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:31,345
-Ah!

243
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:35,478
GUIDE: You see,
now you young girl.

244
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:36,911
-[groan]

245
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:46,378
SOUN: The legendary ground
of accursed springs.

246
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:50,345
It's true horror has been
shrouded in mystery, until now.

247
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:52,078
-What do you mean, true horror?

248
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:54,345
This is all your fault, old man.

249
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:56,811
What's the idea of dragging me
to a place like that anyway,

250
00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:57,811
huh?

251
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,378
GENMA: Ranma, you
sound like a girl.

252
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:07,345
Were you not prepared
to lay down your life

253
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,345
for the sake of the art?

254
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:10,811
RANMA: My life, yes.

255
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:12,745
My manhood is another story.

256
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:18,645
-Ah.

257
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:21,678
RANMA: Oh, you just had to go
find that training ground, even

258
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:24,111
though you didn't speak
a word of Chinese.

259
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:28,911
-How I suffer for you.

260
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:29,378
Here.

261
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,678
When doused with hot water,
you return to human form.

262
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:41,711
-It needn't be quite
that hot, thank you.

263
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,845
-When doused with cold
water, you become a girl.

264
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:46,778
But hot water turns
you back into a boy.

265
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:48,645
-Hot water, not boiling.

266
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:55,645
-Well now, your problem
isn't so terrible after all.

267
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:56,645
Look.

268
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,011
My oldest daughter
Kasumi, she's 19.

269
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:02,078
My middle daughter
Nabiki, she's 17.

270
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:04,845
And my youngest
daughter Akane, she 16.

271
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:08,211
Pick anyone you want,
she'll be your new fiance.

272
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,178
-Akane would seem
the wisest choice.

273
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:11,311
-Couldn't agree more.

274
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:11,978
-What?

275
00:19:12,011 --> 00:19:13,178
You must be joking.

276
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:14,478
Why would I be?

277
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:16,011
-Because you hate
boys, don't you?

278
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:18,078
-Well I guess you're
in luck, Akane.

279
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:19,078
Ranma's half girl.

280
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,245
-Me marry that pervert?

281
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:22,411
Never!

282
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:23,911
-Hey, wait a minute,
what do you mean pervert?

283
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,245
-You saw me in the
nude, you lech.

284
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:29,645
-Hold it, just a second,
you walked in on me.

285
00:19:29,678 --> 00:19:32,478
-Oh yeah, well it's different
when a girl looks at a boy.

286
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:33,045
-[laughter]

287
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:33,578
AKANE: Pervert.

288
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:34,011
Peeping tom.

289
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:34,978
-See?

290
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:36,445
They're already
the perfect couple.

291
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:37,611
-We are not a couple.

292
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:38,878
We're fighting.

293
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,078
There's no way in the world
I could ever marry someone

294
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:43,078
like that.

295
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:43,711
-Oh yeah?

296
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:44,911
My sentiments exactly.

297
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:45,911
Goodbye.

298
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,478
-Ranma, where are you going?

299
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:49,911
-I'm going back to China.

300
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:53,445
I have to find a way to
change back for good.

301
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:56,878
This is no time for fiances.

302
00:19:56,911 --> 00:20:00,878
By the way, I noticed that you
took a pretty good look at me,

303
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:02,845
too.

304
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:06,778
Besides, it's no big deal
for me to see a naked girl.

305
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:10,445
I mean, I've seen myself
plenty of times right?

306
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:12,311
And I'm better built to boot.

307
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,778
-[growl]

308
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:22,545
-Now that he had coming.

309
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:25,511
[dog barking]

310
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,745
-Oh, she's awake.

311
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,145
Are you OK?

312
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:37,111
Don't think too badly of Akane.

313
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,045
She's really a very sweet girl.

314
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:41,111
She's just a little
high spirited.

315
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,311
-Oh good, Kasumi.

316
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:43,711
Like that explains everything.

317
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:46,611
[bath sounds]

318
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,578
AKANE (VOICEOVER): That
nasty-- make a fool of me.

319
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:52,045
-And I'm better built to boot.

320
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:54,245
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
That-- that boy!

321
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:56,045
Hmph.

322
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,911
-Ah, ouch.

323
00:20:57,945 --> 00:20:59,478
It still smarts.

324
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:02,311
What kind of girl
is she, anyway?

325
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,711
-You wanna be friends?

326
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:05,545
-Friends she says.

327
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:10,911
So much for friends when
she found out I'm a boy.

00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:11,411
Huh?

329
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:17,611
Uh, um, oh.

330
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,645
-Why you-- you-- ugh.

331
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:24,111

332
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,511
-But you were both girls
at the time, right?

333
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,645
So that makes it OK
then, doesn't it?

334
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:38,811
-OK?

335
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:40,345
OK is not the word.

336
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:41,645
-So she's got spunk.

337
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:43,711
That makes a fiance
even more cute.

338
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:45,011
-Cute is not the word.

339
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:53,345
-Hmph

340
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,845
-She's definitely not cute.

341
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:58,678
Ow!

342
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:12,126
