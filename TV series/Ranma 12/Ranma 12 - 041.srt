7
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,708
-What are you doing?

8
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:17,141
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

9
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,975
to marry by their
loving parents.

10
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:20,208
-I didn't ask for this.

11
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,708
-Who asked you?

12
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,908
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

13
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,441

he becomes a she.

-Genma Saotome.

Well, what do you know.

-Hello.

19
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:10,607
Have we met somewhere before?

-You got some nerve.

22
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:16,207
I'm the child you
left behind, remember?

23
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:16,874
Ukyo!

24
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:17,641
-Uh.

25
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:19,074
Oh, yeah.

KASUMI: At least I think
that's what this is.

36
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:42,041
-Hmm, let me see.

00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:42,807
It's okonomiyaki.

AKANE: Mr. Saotome!

39
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:55,307
Mr. Saotome, snap out of it.

40
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,207
Please wake up.

41
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,807
You're scaring me!

42
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,507
-Huh?

43
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,807
Yo, Akane!

44
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:01,774
Wow.

45
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,607
-Ranma, thank goodness.

46
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:07,307
Ranma he's-- I--

47
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:08,941
-There's something wrong.

48
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:09,741
Yo, Pop!

49
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:10,507
What's the matter with you?

50
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,241
Snap out of it!

51
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:12,074
-Ranma!

52
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:12,641
He can't hear you.

53
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,274
He's fainted.

54
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,174
Quit it!

55
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:14,807
-Oh yeah.

56
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:15,507
Wake up!

57
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,374
Come on, snap out of it!

58
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:17,241
Who did this to you?

59
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:18,307
Did you want me to--

60
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:20,407
-Hey, I'm in shock here!

61
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,207
-Huh?

62
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:21,974
Out of the way!

65
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:23,874
Aah.

66
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,541
Ugh.

67
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:27,974
Argh.

68
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:31,374
You didn't have to knock
me down so hard, you know.

69
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:32,774
-That's fine with me.

70
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,541
Next time how about I just
let it cut you in half?

71
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:35,174
UKYO: Ranma Saotome.

72
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:36,207
-Huh?

73
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,641
-I'll be coming for you next.

74
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,974
I'd say my goodbyes
if I were you.

75
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:40,774
-Why you!

76
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:43,307
You come back here-- ooh uh.

77
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:44,507
-Not so fast.

78
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,407
-Argh.

79
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:46,841
What'd you do that for?

80
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:49,774
-You'd best keep your
distance, for your own good.

81
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:59,041
-Where have I seen him, this
okonomi-what's-his-face guy,

82
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:01,074
huh?

83
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,407
Why do I get the feeling
you're not letting me

84
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:05,007
in on the whole
story here, Pops?

85
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,274
What exactly did you do to this
guy to make him so mad anyway?

86
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:09,741
-Promise me, boy.

87
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,774
Promise me that you won't
be shocked if I tell you.

88
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,541
-Me shocked at
something you did?

89
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:16,607
Yeah, right.

90
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,407
-I'm very serious here, boy.

91
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:19,341
-And?

92
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:20,374
-Argh.

93
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:21,341
And so--

94
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:22,474
-And so what?

95
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:24,307
-And so I have to
tell you that--

96

-Uh huh, yeah?

-Ugh, uh, ugh.

-No.

100
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,341
No, I must not burden you.

101
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:32,474
I must not.

102
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:33,374
I mustn't.

103
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,174
I mustn't!

[groans]

107
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,107

00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:48,641
No, too late.

110
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:49,641
I don't want to hear it!

-Oh, well.

I didn't want to be the
one to tell him, but--

RANMA: Well, what is it?

119
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:08,041
What'd you want to
talk to me about?

120
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:11,207
-Oh, well, before I tell you,
you gotta promise me something.

121
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:11,974
OK, Ranma?

122
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:12,974
-Again?

123
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:13,941
-But I didn't.

124
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:16,074
-All right, just
spit it out already.

125
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:18,074
-OK, here goes.

126
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:19,874
Ranma, you're an
only child, right?

127
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:21,341
-Yeah, so what's your point?

128
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:23,341
-What if your
dad-- I mean-- what

129
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:24,774
if you weren't an only child?

130
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,707
-Enough with the dramatic
buildup, already.

131
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:29,841
-What I heard was an accident.

132
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:30,641
I swear.

133
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:33,607
UKYO: Your numbers up, Pops.

134
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,174
Don't you know how hard
it is on a child's psyche

135
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:37,574
to be abandoned like that?

136
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,041
-You've got to forgive me!

137
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:41,474
It was hard enough just feeding
the child I already had!

138
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:43,741
Aah!

139
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:47,474
-Wha-- What am I
going to tell Ranma?

140
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:49,374
-Uh, huh, ugh, ah.

141
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:50,274
Doh.

00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:51,507
-(MOCKINGLY) Uh, huh.

143
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,907
Is that all you've
got to say about it?

144
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:55,274
I could have sworn you'd
be more shocked than this.

145
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:55,907
-Shocked?

146
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:56,607
Who me?

147
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,841
-Aren't you listening?

148
00:04:57,874 --> 00:04:59,407
Your father has an
illegitimate child.

149
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,574
-Hehe, who would've thunk the
old man still had it in him, huh?

150
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:03,541
Hehe.

-Where do you think
you're going, Pops?

155
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,574
Got any other kids you
ain't told me about?

156
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,974
Well, do you?

157
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:19,807
-It's not?

158
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,207
Then what's this all about?

159
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,541
-Ah, get up, Pop.

160
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,074
I ain't buying it!

161
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,107
Do you hear me?

[groans]

163
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:31,474
-Huh?

00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:32,974
-Mmh, oh Pop.

165
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,974
Maybe you'd better start
from the beginning.

AKANE: Well, and then?

168
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,241
Did he say anything else?

169
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:45,107
-Who, Pop?

170
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:46,341
Nah.

171
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:48,041
He just rolled over and
faked like he was sleeping.

172
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,074
He'll have to tell
me sooner or later.

173
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:51,141
-I don't know.

174
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:52,607
How can you be so calm
about this, Ranma?

175
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:53,974
Doesn't it bother
you that you might

176
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,607
have a brother you
never knew about?

177
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,274
-You know, it's
like I said already,

178
00:05:57,307 --> 00:06:00,107
Akane, nothing he does
surprises me anymore.

179
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:01,841
STUDENT: Akane, wait up.

180
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:02,607
-Oh, hi.

181
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:04,207
-Did you hear the latest?

182
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:06,274
Starting today, there's a new
transfer student in our class.

183
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:07,307
-Huh?

184
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,541
What kind of transfer student?

185
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:09,874
TEACHER: And, ah,
now class, I'd like

186
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:11,407
to introduce a new student.

187
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,507
Ukyo Kuonji.

188
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,074
ALL: Wow!

189
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,841
That's great!

190
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,007
I'd love to try that one.

191
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,507
Good.

192
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,374
Excellent.

193
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,374
Wow!

194
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:21,941
Mmm.

195
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:22,941
Wow!

196
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,907
Yeah!

197
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,074
Nice one.

198
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:30,141
-Ukyo's the name,
okonomiyaki's the game.

199
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:31,107
Charmed, I'm sure.

200
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:31,782
-Hey!

201
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,074
That's--

202
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:34,807
-That's Ukyo Kuonji.

203
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:39,407
-And now behold the ancient
art of Japanese pizza making.

204
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,607
Ah, uh, ah, ah.

205
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:45,607
-I've heard of unorthodox
training before but--

206
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:46,907
-Wow, that's great.

207
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,207
-Wow, it's crispy on
the edges yet cooked

208
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,341
to perfection in the center.

209
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:51,474
-But what about this sauce?

210
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,474
It's too good to
come out of a jar.

211
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:55,341
It's gotta be custom blended.

212
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,474
-Ah, this is the
best okonomiyaki

213
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,141
I've had in my life!

214
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,907
-And why wouldn't it be?

215
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,041
What you're eating
is the best in Japan,

216
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:06,707
perhaps-- perhaps
even the world!

217
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,074
-Ranma, I'm sure of it.

218
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:10,974
That's definitely the
one who beat up your dad.

219
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:11,841
-Ukyo.

220
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:14,307
-Snap out of it, Ranma.

221
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:15,374
-Ranma?

222
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:16,641
Well, what do you know?

223
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:18,174
If it isn't Ranma himself.

224
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:26,241
-Hey, I recognize this recipe.

225
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:28,441
-Humph.

226
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,274
-Hey, it's you.

227
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:32,541
-Huh, so now you remember me?

228
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:34,341
At long last.

229
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:35,441
This is for you!

230
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:38,707
-Ugh, uh.

231
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,974
How's it going?

232
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,674
Say, you're okonomiyaki
Ucchan, aren't you?

233
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:44,341
-Yes, that's me.

234
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:45,341
-Do you know each other?

235
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:46,374
-Sure.

236
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,674
Why, we were friends as kids.

237
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:49,041
Right, Ucchan?

238
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:49,974
[laughs]

239
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:51,441
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
It was back when

240
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,341
me and Pop were on
our training journey.

241
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:55,307
-Hey, Ucchan, it's me.

242
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,207
Do you want to play?

243
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,174
Hey, Ucchan!

244
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,941
Let's play, OK?

245
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:01,774
Come on, let's play, let's play.

246
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,607
-I won't let that
jackass beat me.

247
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:06,207
-This game was your idea?

248
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:07,841
And watch your mouth.

249
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,807
-You better get ready
because here I come.

250
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,174
-You get ready, to lose.

251
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,341
Ah, ugh.

252
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,041
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Good old Ucchan.

253
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,474
I never went hungry thanks
to their family business.

254
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:20,974
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
I don't know, Ranma.

255
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,874
Is that really how it happened?

256
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:26,074
RANMA (VOICEOVER): And oh how
sad it was when I had to leave.

257
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:27,407
-Bye bye, Ucchan.

258
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,607
See ya!

259
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,907
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Remember, Ucchan?

260
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:31,974
Remember how you
cried when I left?

261
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:33,607
UKYO (VOICEOVER):
Gee, I wonder why.

262
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,607
-You said you'd
take me with you.

263
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,207
Come back here,
you stupid jackass!

264
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,207
Come back here!

265
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,207
-Bye bye, Ucchan.

266
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:41,341
Bye bye.

267
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:42,374
UKYO (VOICEOVER):
See if you can't

268
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:44,374
try a little harder to remember.

269
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,707
Like that.

270
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:49,007
A little more to the right.

271
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:49,674
There.

272
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:50,641
Now do you remember?

273
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:52,774
-Wha-- uh, Hey.

274
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:55,774
Uh, what was my pop
doing with your cart?

275
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,307
-Sounds like he was
stealing it to me, Ranma.

276
00:08:58,341 --> 00:08:59,374
-Wrong!

277
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:01,707
He gave it to me
fair and square.

278
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,474
-Mr. Saotome.

279
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:05,474
-I earned it for taking
Ukyo off his hands,

280
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:07,874
and that's the truth.

281
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:09,474
-What do you mean by that?

282
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,507
What is he to you,
a litter of kittens?

283
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,407
-He left me by the
side of the road

284
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,507
and took off with
my father's cart.

285
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,241
-Ukyo, that doesn't
make sense at all.

286
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,341
-Yeah, I know we were friends
and all, but why on earth would

287
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:22,407
you want to come with us?

288
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,641
-No way.

289
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:26,707
You mean-- you mean,
you don't know?

290
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:29,407
-Ah, don't make such
a big deal out of it.

291
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,241
Let's let bygones be bygones.

292
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:32,474
What do you say?

293
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,941
-Hm.

294
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:34,712
-Huh?

295
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,441
-Humph.

296
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:43,441
-Did I, ah, say something wrong?

297
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:44,974
-Don't worry, Ranma.

298
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:47,274
Now I understand
it all perfectly.

299
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:48,207
-Oop.

300
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,441
Hey, that--

301
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:54,007
-I was a fool for
believing in you.

302
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,074
Ranma, I want you to know
that I'm not through with you.

303
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,407
Do you got that?

304
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,874
And mark my words, you're
going to wish you never met me.

305
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:07,274
AKANE: Meet me at the
gym after class, or else.

306
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,074
So it's a little weird,
but it's still a challenge.

307
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:12,807
-Gee, ain't it just
peachy how I keep

308
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,041
getting involved in all
the crimes he commits.

[theme music]

311
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:32,528
CROWD: Did you hear?

312
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:35,528
Ranma's being
challenged to a duel.

313
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:36,194
All right!

314
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,394
Who is it this time?

315
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,328
Isn't that the new
transfer student?

316
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,161
Hey, what the heck
kind of ring is that?

317
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:45,328
I don't remember no
ring behind the gym.

318
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,661
-See, look at that.

319
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:48,461
-What is that stuff?

320
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:48,994
Batter?

321
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,094
-Watch it!

322
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:52,594
Stay back and you
won't get hurt.

323
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:55,661
Ranma, I've got a
special menu for you.

324
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:58,161
-Hey, Ucchan, over here.

325
00:10:58,194 --> 00:10:59,428
Hiya.

326
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,561
-How dare you joke
around during a duel.

327
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,328
I didn't call you out here
to play patty-cake, you know.

328
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:07,594
-Hey, is this any way
for friends to act?

329
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,294
Whatever happened to
the good old days?

330
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:10,861
-Good old days?

331
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:11,894
For who?

332
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:12,861
-Hey, what're you so mad for?

333
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:13,494
Cut it out!

00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:13,961
-Shut--

335
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:14,528
-Woah!

336
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:15,728
-Up!

337
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:16,861
-Hey, I ain't the one who
ran off with your cart,

338
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:17,994
the old man is.

339
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,261
Look, I ain't the
one who promised

340
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:21,594
to take you along so
don't blame me, OK?

341
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:22,928
-Stay still.

342
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:23,928
Ugh!

343
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:25,061
[gasps]

344
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:26,094
-You know, I'm
beginning to think

345
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:27,228
you're mad at me or something.

346
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,228
-How dare you.

347
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:31,528
How much more am I
supposed to take?

348
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:32,161
That's it.

349
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:33,128
You're dead!

350
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:36,594
-Uh, ugh, uh.

351
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:38,328
Aah!

352
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:41,194
-Hot enough to fry
an egg, literally.

353
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:42,794
-Hey, that's not a ring.

354
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:45,928
It's a nonstick,
ring-shaped cooking surface.

355
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:46,694
CROWD: Wow!

356
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:47,928
This is crazy.

357
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,528
Wow!

358
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,328
[blowing]

359
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:55,528
-And now for the next
item on the menu.

360
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,194
-Huh?

361
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:57,528
-Take a look.

362
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:59,394
I've added a few of my
own special ingredients

363
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,628
to the recipe guaranteed
to send you out

364
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,161
of the frying pan and
right into the fire.

365
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:06,294
-Ugh, uh.

366
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,928
Ugh, what is this junk?

367
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,061
Ugh, what'd you put in here?

368
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:11,994
Glue?

369
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:13,028
[akane gasps]

370
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,661
-It's just your ordinary batter.

371
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:20,228
Plus a little rubber
cement mixed in.

372
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,494
-Let me go.

373
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:22,861
Uh, ugh.

374
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:23,861
-I'll let you go.

375
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:24,828
No problem.

376
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,794
-Huh, aah.

377
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,394
-Now for dessert.

378
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:29,761
-Aah!

379
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:31,728
Ugh, uh.

380
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,528
Aah, hot, hot, hot!

381
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:35,628
-Personally, I
prefer my okonomiyaki

382
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:37,394
without the noodles,
but then again I've

383
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:39,828
always been more of a
traditionalist at heart,

384
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:41,094
anyway.

385
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,594
Could you pass me
that plate over there?

386
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,161
-Would you stop thinking of
your stomach for a minute,

387
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:46,294
and come help me!

388
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:47,894
-I forgot to oil the grill.

389
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:49,461
Silly me.

390
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:49,935
-Huh?

391
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,261
Ugh.

392
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:54,261
uh, ah, oh.

393
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:56,228
-This part's my own invention.

394
00:12:56,261 --> 00:13:00,828
Tempura flakes mixed
with gun powder.

-Ranma!

401
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:08,361
-Mm.

402
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,194
-Hm.

403
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,528
Nothing left but the cleanup.

404
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:20,194
Hey!

405
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:22,561
What's the big idea?

406
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,128
-I've gone easy on you
because we were friends once,

407
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:27,161
but I'm tired of your
games, and the time

408
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:29,728
has come that we finish
this once and for all!

it out of the ring.

-Ranma!

-Friends from early childhood
at each other's throats.

413
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:43,294
Oh, the humanity!

414
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:44,961
Oh, why do they
fight each other so?

415
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,094
Tell me why!

416
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:47,394
Why?

417
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,494
-Yeah, why is that?

[groans]

419
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,861
-I said, why is that?

-Wait up, you chicken!

421
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:01,628
Running away from
a man to man fight,

422
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:05,028
and here you call
yourself a guy.

423
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,961
-And when did I do that, huh?

424
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:07,928
-Ugh.

425
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,494
-Uh.

-Here's how a real
guy gets even.

-Uh.

00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:21,061
-You got to have your fun on
that little hot plate of yours.

431
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:25,961
I try to be nice to you and this
is how you return the favor.

00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:28,028
Now it's my turn
to have some fun.

-Ran-chan, wait.

00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:32,361
-You started it.

435
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:33,794
And don't call me that.

-You jackass!

-Ah, stop running away!

fight like a man!

-Ugh.

Come here!

-Why don't you eat some
flour, you half-baked idiot!

Oh, my head is killing me.

-A girl.

Yes, you heard me right.

-So that's why she
came after Ranma.

There's more to this than
you're letting on, isn't there?

maybe we should just

sell him to the circus
and get it over with.

have you been a--

-A girl?

00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:49,358
All my life, stupid.

-Excuse me.

-Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

What'd you do that
for, you jackass?

472
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:57,025
-Hey, you didn't
turn back into a guy.

473
00:15:57,058 --> 00:15:59,391
-What's that supposed to mean?

00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,325
You listen to me
and you listen good.

I am 100% woman.

-Ranma, my boy.

Allow me to introduce you.

Say hello to Ukyo,
your betrothed.

-Pop, this had better be
some kind of fairy tale.

480
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:21,058
-How's about this, a long
time ago in a prefecture far,

00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:22,725
far away.

-I'm warning you!

-Take your Ukyo for
my Ranma's bride, eh?

484
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:35,091
I hate to tell you
this, but the boy's

already got himself a fiancee.

486
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:39,391
-Now that's a darn
shame I tell you,

487
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:42,258
because here's me ready to
throw in my okonomiyaki cart

488
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,925
as her dowry, too.

00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:45,725
-Sold!

00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:46,925
I mean, I accept.

UKYO (VOICEOVER): You
took the cart, all right,

but you left one thing behind.

Come back!

my life as a woman was over.

-Did you here?

498
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:03,591
Ukyo got dumped by her fiance.

the family business.

00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,925
-Now she'll never catch
herself a husband.

501
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:11,291
UKYO (VOICEOVER):
And that's when

502
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:13,458
I realized what I had to do.

503
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,491
I made a vow that I'd become the
best okonomiyaki cook in Japan.

504
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,091
And what better way
than to practice

505
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,558
against the raging seas.

506
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,658
MALE STUDENT: Raging seas?

507
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:25,425
Isn't that kind of pointless?

508
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,125
MALE STUDENT: That's
the point, stupid.

509
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,258
Don't you watch samurai movies?

510
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,725
-How cruel is the hand of fate!

511
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:33,791
Go on.

512
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:36,158
Here's your chance
to get even with him.

513
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:37,658
-Get even with who, Pop?

514
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:40,158
You're the one who made that
stupid bargain, remember?

515
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,225
Not me.

516
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:42,291
-Oh, really?

517
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:43,225
I admit it.

518
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:44,525
I had no choice.

519
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:46,391
It was one of the most
difficult decisions

520
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,325
I've ever made in my life.

521
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,791
OK, so maybe you already
did have a fiancee,

522
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:55,458
but the final decision had
to be yours and yours alone.

523
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,158
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
What final decision?

524
00:17:57,191 --> 00:17:58,191
I don't remember.

525
00:17:58,225 --> 00:17:59,791
GENMA (VOICEOVER): Trust me.

526
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:01,958
Ranma, I said to you, this is
important so think carefully,

527
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:02,591
OK?

528
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,658
-OK.

529
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,025
GENMA (VOICEOVER):
What do you love best,

530
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:06,225
I said to you, Ukyo
or okonomiyaki?

531
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:07,691
-Uh, okonomiyaki.

532
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:09,225
GENMA (VOICEOVER):
In other words,

533
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:11,225
the one who really made
the bargain was you.

534
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:11,958
[crash]

535
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:12,425
UKYO: Argh.

536
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:16,825
-Go on, dear.

537
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:17,958
Let it all out.

538
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,158
-Wa-- wa-- wait a minute.

539
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:20,491
What are you mad at me for?

540
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,591
I mean, he's the one who
abandoned you, not me.

541
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,091
Besides, I was just a
little kid at the time.

542
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,891
-Enough with the excuses, Ranma.

543
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:30,325
Just own up to what you
did and be a man about it.

544
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,291
-And who are you to talk, huh?

545
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:33,858
FEMALE STUDENT: Ugh, you pigs!

546
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:35,458
-Huh?

547
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,258
-What's the matter with you two,
using that poor girl like that?

548
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,491
-You enemies of women.

549
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:39,525
-Wa-- wait, take it easy.

550
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:40,758
It's not what you think.

551
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,925
I mean, I didn't
know she was a girl.

552
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,025
Not at first, anyway.

553
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:45,158
-Shut up, you!

554
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,125
-Get him, girls!

555
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,991
ALL: Get him!

556
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:48,958
Get him!

557
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:52,091
RANMA: Ow, ow, ouch, ooh!

558
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,225
-Yeah, oh well.

559
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,958
There's not a whole lot to say.

560
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,925
Probably deserves it anyway.

561
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,925
FEMALE STUDENT: Hey!

562
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,125
Where'd the little creep go?

563
00:18:59,158 --> 00:18:59,958
-Huh?

564
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:00,858
MALE STUDENT: Huh?

565
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,425
Yeah, Ukyo's gone, too.

566
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,825
RANMA: Oh look, here it is.

567
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,291
Here.

568
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:12,058
-Hey, what's going on here.

569
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,025
Why are you being so nice?

570
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,358
-I'm doing what Pop said.

571
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:17,058
Taking my punishment like a man.

572
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:17,991
-Ha!

573
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,025
What's that mean?

574
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,825
You'll take whatever I dish out?

575
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:21,925
Fine, then.

576
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,625
Now's my chance to pay
you back for turning

577
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:25,958
every day of my life
into a living hell.

578
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:28,425
-Hey, hey, hey, don't you
think you're overreacting?

579
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,658
-I'll give you overreacting!

580
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:31,491
-Huh?

581
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,058
Ranma?

582
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:33,191
-Ugh, come on.

583
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:34,425
Be reasonable.

584
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,891
-You said you were
going to stay still!

585
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:36,658
-Well, yeah.

586
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:37,891
I mean, no but--

587
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:40,391
-Then shut up and
take your punishment!

588
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:41,791
You've ruined me for marriage.

589
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:45,025
Because of you I'm doomed
to spend my life alone!

590
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,291
-What a waste.

591
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:48,225
And here you were so cute, too.

592
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,491
-Ugh.

593
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:50,491
-I mean, who would've
thought that you'd

594
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:51,758
turn out so good looking.

595
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,058
-Cu-- cute?

596
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,358
-You'll make someone
a great wife.

597
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:57,891
-Go on, stop lying,
I'm not cute.

598
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,191
-Sure you are, Ukyo.

599
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:00,125
Why would I lie?

600
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,025
-Am not.

601
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:01,658
Am not.

602
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,191
Am not.

603
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:05,091
-You're cute, I tell you.

604
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,025
-Go on, get out of here.

605
00:20:07,058 --> 00:20:08,758
-Real cute.

606
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,325
-Argh.

607
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:11,825
-Uh, how much did you hear?

608
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:15,225
-Lucky you, having
such a cute fiancee.

609
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,725
-Akane, you mean--

610
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,658
-Yep.

611
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,958
Cute fiancee meet
uncute fiancee.

612
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:24,058
-As you recall, it's not like
I asked to be engaged to you,

613
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,358
you know.

614
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,191
It was all our dumb
parents' idea, remember?

615
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,025
-Ha!

616
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,225
You're telling me.

617
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:30,958
I never asked for
no fiancee, and I

618
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:34,091
sure as shooting never asked
for no uncute girl like you.

619
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,025
-Well, excuse me
for being uncute!

620
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:38,191
-Hey, you guys.

621
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,325
You don't get along
too well, do ya?

622
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:41,625
-Where'd you get that idea?

623
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,191
-You see?

624
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:43,425
Uncute or what?

625
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,725
Hey, Ucchan.

626
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:52,125
-Ugh.

627
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:52,725
-Uh.

628
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,091
Huh?

629
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,491
-Let's let bygones be bygones.

630
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:04,025
Hey, that's what a cute
girl would say, isn't it?

631
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:04,958
Bye.

632
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:08,225
[giggles]

633
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:11,691
-Gee, guess you're now
on her good side again.

634
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:13,958
[laughs awkwardly]

635
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,025
-Want some?

636
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:19,025
-No!

637
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:22,025
Humph.

638
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:24,025

640

AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Ranma, I'm warning you.

641
00:23:12,617 --> 00:23:15,251
Don't you dare interfere
with my date with Ryoga.

642
00:23:15,284 --> 00:23:18,584
You want to date so bad,
why don't you ask Ukyo?

643
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:23,015
Next time on Ranma 1/2, "Ryoga
and Akane, 2-Gether, 4-Ever."

644
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:23,894
See you there.
