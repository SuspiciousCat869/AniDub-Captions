00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,233
-4,000 years ago
there was a warlord

31
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,133
whose ever worsening
condition caused

32
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,700
him to lose his confidence
and self-esteem.

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,833
On the verge of losing
hope, he encountered

34
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,100
an itinerant Buddhist
priest, from whom

35
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,133
he learned the legend
of a dragon that

36
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:32,400
appears only once
every thousand years.

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,933
So the warlord traveled
deep into the mountains

38
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:38,033
in search of it, finding
it at last after 14 years.

39
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,466
After much hardship,
finally the warlord

40
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,933
gained his prize--
the Dragon's Whisker.

41
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,300
But others sought
the treasure as well,

42
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,466
causing many wars to be fought.

43
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:55,400
For many years, the whisker was
lost, surfacing only recently

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,633
when it was discovered being
used as a decorative bow.

45
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,766
More recently,
however, it was said

46
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,833
to have been taken to
the land of the rising

47
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:05,300
sun by a man of that country.

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,500
This is the only clue
we have to his identity.

49
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,300
-We've got to get it back from
him, no matter what it takes.

00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:21,500
when he was fortunate enough
to meet a wandering priest who

170
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,433
leaked an incredible secret.

171
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,400
Every 1,000 years, the
priest said, a magical dragon

172
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,100
would appear.

173
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,766
After much fumbling-- what
seemed like 14 years, in fact--

174
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,700
he found what he
was looking for.

175
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,866
[thunder and lightning]

176
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:49,700
-As for what happened
next, well, that

177
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,933
is a story for another day.

178
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,188
-Hiya!

179
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:07,655
Hya!

180
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:08,196
Hya!

181
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:11,122
[grunting]

182
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:12,088
Hya!

183
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:12,629
Hya!

184
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,022
-Stop that, boy!

185
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:18,188
What are you doing?

186
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:18,729
Cut it out!

187
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,488
It's just a morning workout.

188
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:26,055
-Ranma, Mr. Saotome, breakfast.

189
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:29,929
Huh?

190
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,188
[hums]

191
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:35,922
-S-s-something must have--
must have got into you boy.

192
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:36,988
T-take it easy.

193
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,122
MR. SAOTOME (VOICEOVER):
Why is the boy so worked up

194
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:47,555
over some dumb whisker anyway?

195
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:48,455
Huh?

196
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:49,555
-Top of the morning to ya!

197
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:50,455
-Don't worry about us.

198
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,222
-We're just here to paint ya.

199
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:00,922
-He blocked our paint buckets.

200
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:01,955
-That's not fair.

201
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,088
-Somebody go get the shampoo.

202
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,288
-You better wash it
out of your hair.

203
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,322
-We're not kidding around.

204
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:15,788
-You gonna let
that dry, or what?

205
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:16,622
ALL: Hurry up!

206
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:19,688
-Thanks, I'll get right on it!

207
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:22,555
-Make sure you don't
forget the conditioner.

208
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:25,922
-Ranma, you OK?

209
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:31,055
-There is paint tracked
all over the hall.

210
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:33,222
-Akane, would you get a towel?

211
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:34,722
-Oh, OK.

212
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:38,022
-[muttering angrily]

213
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:40,588
-Wouldn't your hair be
a lot easier to wash

214
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:42,955
if you just undid your pigtail?

215
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:43,855
-Don't wanna.

216
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,122
-Why are you being so--

217
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,488
-She's only worried you
won't get all the paint out

218
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,222
of the pigtail, that's all.

219
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:50,022
-Butt out, OK?

220
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:51,255
-Well, excuse us.

221
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,455
-Come here.

222
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,355
No need to yell, boy.

223
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,422
Your old dad'll take care of it.

224
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:02,788
-Keep your stinking paws off
of the hair, you got that?

225
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:03,622
-[grunts]

226
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:04,622
-Oh, my.

227
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:06,355
[sighs]

228
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,688
-Look, Ranma.

229
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,922
There's two ways we can handle
this-- my way, or my way.

230
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:11,463
-Yep.

231
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,588
-You won't get away.

232
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,922
-Nope.

233
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:20,722
-(VOICEOVER) For him to be
this stubborn, it must be bad.

234
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:24,188
-Somebody stop him!

235
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:27,196
-Ah!

236
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,788
-Ungrateful pup.

237
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:37,555
-Don't let him get away, OK?

238
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:38,355
-No prob.

239
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:40,822
-Dear, oh dear!

240
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:46,888
-Ah-hah!

241
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:49,055
It's him all right!

242
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:50,588
-This pigtail holder, it's--

243
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,788
-The famous Chinese
treasure, the--

244
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:53,522
-Dragon's Whisker.

245
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:16,222
-Maybe you know it,
but you can't have it!

246
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:22,088
-Time to start talking boy.

247
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:24,922
-And what's a Dragon's
Whisker, anyway?

248
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:25,463
-Ranma?

249
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:33,888
-Look, it's just something
that-- that keeps me sealed.

250
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:34,555
-Sealed?

251
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:35,096
-Sealed?

252
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:37,588
-[cries]

253
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:40,929
-Sealed.

254
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:44,122
-Hmm, sealed.

255
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,922
-If this seal were
ever to come off of me,

256
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,088
something real
messy would happen.

257
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,688
Aw, man, I had to skip
breakfast because you

258
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:00,988
made me wash my hair.

259
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:01,788
-Hey!

260
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:03,088
Hey-- I said hey!

261
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,155
Ranma, what are you hiding?

262
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:09,555
Why can't you trust me
enough to just tell me.

263
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:10,522
-Tell what?

264
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:11,988
-About your pigtail.

265
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:13,622
-Look, I told you already.

266
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:14,822
It's nothing.

267
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,922
-Well, how come they're
after you if it's nothing.

268
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:18,522
-I don't know.

269
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:20,588
Besides, what does
it matter anyways?

270
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:23,088
It's not like they're strong
enough to do anything about it.

271
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:27,322
-Um, we know where the
Dragon's Whisker is--

272
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:30,455
-But he's stronger
than we thought.

273
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,688
-It's not just a
matter of strength.

274
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:34,255
-Does that mean
you've got a plan?

275
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:36,655
-Leave it to me, I
know what I'm doing.

276
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,655
We've done OK so
far, haven't we?

277
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:42,055
-Sure, if you don't count
the time he beat us up,

278
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:45,588
or your great idea to pretend
we were painters, or--

279
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:48,988
-The painter thing was your
idea, if I'm not mistaken.

280
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:52,188
-Gee, and here I
was, just starting

281
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:56,355
to like it when pigtail boy
kicked us through the air, too.

282
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,988
-Funny how everyone's a critic
once the bun's hit the fan.

283
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:15,955
By leaving a trail of
sleeping pork buns--

284
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:16,496
-Mm-hmm?

285
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:20,255
-Pigtail boy does himself in.

286
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,322
-And then, once he's
asleep, we sneak up

287
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:26,288
on him and chop off his pigtail.

288
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:27,855
ALL: It's 100% fool-proof.

289
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:35,222
[cheering]

290
00:16:35,322 --> 00:16:36,722
ALL: Look, there he is.

291
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:37,755
-Hey, cool.

292
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:39,488
At least we're not
the only ones late.

293
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:41,288
-Not that it makes
any difference.

294
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,455
ALL: Ah!

295
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:57,255
-Now that was a
surprise development.

296
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:00,488
-No plan's completely
fool-proof.

297
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:03,588
-True, how were we supposed to
know that they'd eat our bait?

298
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:05,188
-We fail again.

299
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:07,822
-As of now, the gloves come off.

300
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:09,988
No more Mr. Nice Bun.

301
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,555
-That's three, now.

302
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,522
-Look, we'll catch him
when he's alone, OK?

303
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:22,322
-Just do it!

304
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:23,755
-I'm not sure I can.

305
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,822
-(VOICEOVER) What's
his problem anyway?

306
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:41,055
If he'd just tell
me, maybe I could--

307
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:44,155
So he can't undo his
pigtail, or it'll be bad.

308
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:46,188
But what kind of bad?

309
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:55,655

00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:56,196

-Man, I'm so hungry
I could pass out.

[sighs] Oh, man.

313
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,622
I wish I had some pork buns.

314
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,022
-Did somebody call
for pork buns?

315
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,088
-Hmm?

316
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:16,688
-We made you skip
breakfast on purpose.

Now your strength
is only half-power.

At last we've got
you all to ourselves!

319
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:23,522
-Take this you--

320
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:24,488
-Ah!

321
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,488
-Not this again.

-(LAUGHING) He fell for it.

-How do you like the nerve gas?

328
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:50,155
-If you don't mind, we'll
take your pigtail now.

-Go on and try it.

00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:58,655
We're still in the
middle of class.

332
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:00,663
Huh?

333
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:05,588
[screaming]

334
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:09,555
[grunting]

335
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:11,022
-Back off!

336
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:12,522
-(VOICEOVER) Oh, man.

337
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:14,488
I can't move.

338
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:20,788
[grunts]

339
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:21,555
-We win!

340
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:22,388
Somebody get the scissors!

341
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:24,988
-(VOICEOVER) Oh, no you don't.

342
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,022
-Not yet, anyway.

343
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,688
[panting]

344
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:37,488
-Hooray!

345
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:38,788
The Dragon Whisker is ours!

346
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:41,296
-Huh?

347
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:52,688
[screaming]

348
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:53,229
-Ha-ha!

349
00:19:56,188 --> 00:20:00,055
-Wow, so this is it, huh?

350
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:01,622
Looks like a string.

351
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:02,255
Ranma, what's--

352
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,288
-Don't look at me!

353
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:07,296
-Ranma?

354
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:09,755
Ranma, come back!

355
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:12,322
-You OK?

356
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:14,022
-We almost had him.

357
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,788
-Yeah, and we had such a
good plan this time, too.

358
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:22,188
-If only you'd been a
little bit more strong.

359
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,688
-Yeah, why did you
let go, anyway?

360
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:26,555
-He sent us flying, yet again.

361
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:29,222
-What is it, four
times now, right?

362
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:31,555
-It's starting to hurt
where he kicked me.

363
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:32,096
-Me, too.

364
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:48,555
-Ranma-- you in there?

365
00:20:58,855 --> 00:20:59,788
I'm coming in, OK?

366
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:03,163
Huh?

367
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:10,455
Is that you, Ranma?

368
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:12,822
Look, stop playing games, OK?

369
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:22,055
[gasps] Ranma, hey, it is
you over there, isn't it?

370
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,755
-It's me, all right.

371
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,922
-Ranma, what's happening to you?

372
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:46,488
[theme music]

373
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:49,888
[singing in japanese]

374
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:19,511
-You mean that's his secret?

375
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,711
For a guy, that's extra rough.

376
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:26,511
Next time, on "Ranma 1/2," when
a guy's pride and joy is gone.

377
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:28,978
We'll see you there.
