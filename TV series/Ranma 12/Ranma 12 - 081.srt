00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,333
I'm so sorry about that, son.

172
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:27,100
-Why don't I believe you?

173
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
-Say, boy.

174
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,866
Didn't Kasume say it
was a chance encounter?

175
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,166
-He's not from
around here, I guess.

176
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:36,600
-Then I suppose we're worrying
for nothing, aren't we?

177
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,900
After all there's a good chance
she'll never see him again.

178
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
-Maybe she will.

179
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,066
Maybe she won't.

180
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:58,600
-Akane?

181
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,266
Do you remember
the hatchery that

182
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,033
used to be right over here?

183
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,033
-Huh?

184
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,733
-Their eggs were always fresh.

185
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,933
-Kasume.

186
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,233
-Hm?

187
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,066
-Tell me what kind
of guy do you like?

188
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:15,607
-Me?

189
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,933
Well, weird ones, I guess.

190
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:21,474
-Hm?

191
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,200
-It's snowing again.

192
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,233
Let's hurry home.

193
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:28,433
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Weird ones, huh?

194
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,133
Dr. Tofu is pretty
weird, but again,

195
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,500
compared to that
egg-catcher guy.

196
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,933
-You coming or what?

197
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,433
-Oh, uh-- uh-huh!

198
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:01,776
-Look, I figure two
or three days from now

199
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:02,776
and you'll be fine.

200
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:03,643
-Thanks, doc.

201
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:05,076
I guess I owe you my life.

202
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:06,909
-Actually, it was just
a slight dislocation.

203
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:09,943
-You mean that was all?

204
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:12,843
-Now exactly who was it you
said did this to you again?

205
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:14,076
Do you remember?

206
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:17,043
[stuttering]

207
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,576
-I guess I'll be off then.

208
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:23,643
-Say, unless I missed my guess,
you're from out of town, right?

209
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,776
So why not stay here
tonight and leave tomorrow?

210
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:30,009
Some hot-egg brandy
will warm you right up.

211
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:38,443
-I-- I'm sure I don't
deserve such kindness.

212
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:39,943
-Now, now.

213
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:41,909
AKANE: Can we come in?

214
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,409
-Hm?

215
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,276
-Uh, company, Doc.

216
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:47,743
-Well, hello there.

217
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:48,676
-Akane!

218
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,376
What a pleasure
to see you again.

219
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,376
Have a seat.

220
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,309
KASUME: May I come in?

221
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:57,309
-Huh?

222
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:57,850
-K-K-Kasume?

223
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:00,743
-Here, Dr. tofu.

224
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:02,309
And thank you so much.

225
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,276
I must say, I really
enjoyed it quite a bit.

226
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:06,643
-No problem.

227
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:07,643
How are you?

228
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:08,709
I'm fine, thanks.

229
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:13,550
-Hello.

230
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,976
-So then, I guess we meet again.

231
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,476
-Oh, so you're the--

232
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,376
-My name is Yasukichi.

233
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,176
Samurai egg-catcher at large.

234
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:27,476
At your service.

235
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:28,409
-For real?

236
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,776
-So have you known
Dr. Tofu long?

237
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,809
-Just met him tonight actually
in his medical capacity.

238
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,443
Looks like I'll be
spending the night here.

239
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:37,943
-I see.

240
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:39,409
-He's quite a guy.

241
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:44,076
-Thank you again.

242
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:44,609
See you soon.

243
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:47,009
Goodnight!

244
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:47,543
-Don't go!

245
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:48,309
-Excuse me?

246
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,876
-Should he, uh,
be left like this?

247
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,943
Maybe we should stay
with him for awhile.

248
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:55,109
-Buh-bye!

249
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,243
See you later.

250
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,043
-Oh, well he's always
like that with Kasume.

251
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:00,309
Don't you worry.

252
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:01,043
-Oh, yeah?

253
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:01,809
-Well, I'm off.

254
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:04,909
-Wait, wait, wait.

255
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,143
There's just one more thing.

256
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,943
Please take this, OK?

257
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:17,076
-Thank you.

258
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:17,617
We will.

259
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:19,876
Shall we?

260
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,276
-OK.

261
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:22,243
-Be careful.

262
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:22,784
-We will.

263
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,443
[grunts]

264
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,843
-Tell me.

265
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:33,476
Are you a man or aren't you?

266
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,309
Hey, if you like her,
you better tell her.

267
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:36,509
It's a crime to do otherwise.

268
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:42,909
I know, pal.

269
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,143
I know.

270
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:46,043
It's hard being a guy.

271
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,109
-Good morning.

272
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,876
I made some-- where'd he go?

273
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:09,143
Hm-- dear Dr. Tofu, sometimes
it's what a man doesn't say.

274
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:12,443
Leave everything to me.

275
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,043
You won't regret it.

276
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:16,076
Signed, your friend.

277
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:17,143
What the--

278
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:18,176
SAOTOME: Ready, boy?

279
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:19,676
And a one, and a two.

280
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:23,484
Oh.

281
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:28,343
-Ha, see?

282
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,076
I told you I could
do it, didn't I?

283
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,809
-Frankly, boy,
it's the least I'd

284
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,209
expect from a practitioner of
anything goes martial arts.

285
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:35,750
-Catch!

286
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:42,543
-All right now, son.

287
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:44,409
If anything should
happen to me, will you

288
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,176
promise to look after things?

289
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,676
-You going somewhere?

290
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:49,309
[chuckling]

291
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:51,009
YASUKICHI: Anyone home?

292
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:52,309
-What-- what are you--

293
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:54,876
-I'm really sorry.

294
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:56,909
But I just had to come.

295
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:57,976
Is Kasume here?

296
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,009
-Well, yeah.

297
00:14:59,109 --> 00:14:59,976
But she, uh--

298
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,309
-Now he won't get
her without a fight.

299
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:07,876
-Now, now, Tendo.

300
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:09,476
Let's calm down, shall we?

301
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,709
We don't even know what he's--

302
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,876
-And who's going
to pay the piper

303
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:14,709
if he is here to take her?

304
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:15,409
Eh, Saotome?

305
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:20,643
-Hey, boy.

306
00:15:20,743 --> 00:15:22,809
Think you could
take him in a fight?

307
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:24,176
-Not a chance.

308
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:26,509
-First off, I must
sincerely apologize

309
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,409
for showing up
without prior notice.

310
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:33,976
-Dad, at least hear him out.

311
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,276
-Yeah, yeah.

312
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:36,143
Get to the point.

313
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:37,509
What do you want.

314
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:38,076
-Yes, sir.

315
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:39,343
[clears throat]

316
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:41,743
-As you may know, I'm only
a wandering egg-catcher--

317
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:44,476
-You can't have Kasume,
and that's that.

318
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,017
-Huh?

319
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:53,309
-Per-- perhaps we could
discuss this first.

320
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:56,050
-Hm.

321
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:57,776
House fly.

322
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,743
Strange.

323
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:02,643
One doesn't normally see
them this time of year.

324
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:04,976
-Would you like some?

325
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:14,843
YASUKICHI (VOICEOVER): Ah, nuts.

326
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:17,876
I had a big speech prepared,
but now I forgot it.

327
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:19,217
-K-K-Kasume?

328
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:21,709
I, uh--

329
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,743
-Son, let me tell you
something about my Kasume here.

330
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:28,009
She's touched in the head,
plus she's selfish to boot.

331
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:29,609
It's practically
guaranteed she'll

332
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:32,309
make any man foolish enough
to marry her miserable.

333
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,876
-Why, Father!

334
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:36,043
-Sir, I'm sorry, but I
must say you're wrong.

335
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,576
She'd make a fine bride.

336
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:39,809
She certainly knows
her eggs for one thing.

337
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:42,676
-That's it!

338
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:43,217
-Huh?

339
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:48,609
-Again?

340
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,109
-Yeah, so what about it, Kasume?

341
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,776
-Yesterday when I went
out to do some shopping,

342
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:56,709
I thought to myself that
I'd make an omelette.

343
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,209
But then--

344
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,943
-B-- but that's when you
ran into him, isn't it?

345
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,076
-That's right.

346
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:04,143
Here knew somehow
just by looking

347
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:07,476
at the egg I bought which
dish would suit it best.

348
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:08,309
And it did.

349
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,509
-And that's why you made oden.

350
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,476
-Exactly.

351
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:13,143
I'd have made it
yesterday, but I

352
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:15,543
didn't have all the
ingredients I needed.

353
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:18,343
-I thought we were
short on groceries.

354
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:21,876
-And that's why I decided
to make this dish in order

355
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:24,343
that things be at their
most fresh and tasty.

356
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,743
AKANE: But why?

357
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:28,909
-Oh, and you know, it's always
easier to make a day's dinner

358
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,543
when you have a
clear menu in mind.

359
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,343
-I don't suppose that's
why you were so happy?

360
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:44,343
-Oh, dear.

361
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:45,276
Was it that obvious?

362
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:47,425
-Honestly.

363
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,709
YASUKICHI (VOICEOVER):
I missed something.

364
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,509
-Well, since you're
here, you might as well

365
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,909
tell Kasume what
you came to say.

366
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,909
-Oh, well-- that is--
I-- uh-- oh, yeah!

367
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:00,943
Oden!

368
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:03,109
Kasume, if it's not
too much trouble,

369
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,909
do you think you could
bring out some of that oden

370
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,876
over to Dr. Tofu?

371
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:09,509
-You came all the
way here for that?

372
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,709
-Well, you know,
I kind of thought

373
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:16,509
that being a single guy and
all, Dr. Tofu would, you know,

374
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,509
appreciate some home cooking.

375
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:19,943
I know I would.

376
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:24,009
I mean it's kind of hard not
having a wife and-- well--

377
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:25,543
-Don't I know it.

378
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:27,443
My sentiments exactly.

379
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:29,109
-You know what I mean?

380
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,009
-I know exactly what you mean.

381
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,909
Which is why you
should spend the night.

382
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,376
So we can talk it over.

383
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,776
-Thanks a lot for the new book.

384
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,443
Careful with the hot dish.

385
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,209
-I-- I will.

386
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:57,709
-Way to go, Doc.

387
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:02,509
-Excuse me, but I've got to ask.

388
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,409
You didn't really
come over for--

389
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:05,476
-Really?

390
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,909
I don't think that
hardly matters, does it?

391
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:10,043
Good deeds speak for
themselves, don't they?

392
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:13,243
If Kasume and the Doc needed
a little push, what of it?

393
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:14,243
Am I taking credit?

394
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:14,809
No.

395
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,143
Of course not.

396
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:17,809
In fact--

397
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:19,776
-Gee, you could've fooled me.

398
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:24,609
[humming]

399
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:34,576
-Thank you for all
your hospitality.

400
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,543
-Listen, next time
you're in the area,

401
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,943
we'll expect you to come back.

402
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:40,476
-Just a moment.

403
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:41,017
-What?

404
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:45,376
-Before you go, you
mustn't forget this.

405
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:51,676
-Oh, I-- Kasume,
take care of the doc.

406
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:53,343
-Of course.

407
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:56,743
-Goodbye.

408
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:57,909
RANMA: Not so fast.

409
00:19:58,009 --> 00:19:58,450
Souvenir!

410
00:20:00,776 --> 00:20:01,643
One to grow on.

411
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,376
-Well, if that's
it, I'll be off.

412
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,276
-Oof, caught a
whole baker's dozen.

413
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:20,776
-I didn't spend my entire
life around eggs for nothing.

414
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,576
-What a freak.

415
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:25,876
-Hey, Kasume.

416
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,709
Is something wrong?

417
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,343
-It's him.

418
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,576
It's got to be.

419
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:31,409
From back then.

420
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,043
[chickens crowing]

421
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,776
-You see, now this here
is a very good egg.

422
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,676
Hey, back off, mutt!

423
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,109
I ain't afraid of you!

424
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:49,976
YASUKICHI'S MOTHER: Come
on, we've got to go.

425
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:51,709
-I really wish you
didn't have to go,

426
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,043
but here's a present you
can have from my grandma.

427
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:01,343
-Hey, that's really nice.

428
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:02,476
You see, I really like--

429
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:03,876
YASUKICHI'S MOTHER:
We're leaving!

430
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,809
-I, uh-- Goodbye!

431
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:20,643
-So, is it him?

432
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:22,376
The one you remember?

433
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:23,276
-He's, um--

434
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:28,443
AKANE: Well, is he?

435
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:28,984
Well?

NARRATOR: Can Kuno
really grant wishes?

438
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:20,011
I can see why he'd want
one, but isn't a kiss

439
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:22,511
too high of price even for you?

440
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:26,178
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
"Ranma and Kuno's First Kiss."

441
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:28,611
We'll see you there!
