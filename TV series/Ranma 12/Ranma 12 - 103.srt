1
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,500
-Clarabelle.

2
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,900
SHOGI STUDENT: Checkmate.

3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,866
-You took your pawn too lightly.

4
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:01,866
In shogi, all pieces have value.

5
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,466
SHOGI STUDENT: Checkmate.

6
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:04,200
-Do over.

7
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,100
-Look, pal.

8
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,466
No more do overs.

9
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,266
That's the third
time you've done it.

10
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,366
-Aw, come on.

11
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:10,466
Why not?

12
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:11,966
It's not like it's life
or death, you know.

13
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,500
-I know, but it's not the point.

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,800
-So there's to be
no do overs, then?

15
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,566
-No.

16
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,800
-Then you, my friend, have
angered the wrong man.

17
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,233
I challenge you to battle shogi.

18
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,266
-At last, a true master of the
most mysterious martial arts.

19
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,633
To think that here, in
my own shogi parlor,

20
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,433
the great master of whom
we've seen so little of late

21
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,633
should choose to reveal himself.

22
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,433
More challenging
than martial art

23
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,200
checkers, more deadly
than death match Othello,

24
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,666
behold the art of battle shogi.

25
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,966
-Master my butt.

26
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,066
As a player, this guy sucks.

27
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,433
[chuckling]

28
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:54,066
SHOGI MASTER: Battle
shogi, final attack.

29
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,366
Grand master blast!

30
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,300
[yelling]

31
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,633
-I warned him,
but did he listen?

32
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,833
NARRATOR: Shogi showdown.

33
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:09,333
TENDO: Come on, Saotome.

34
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,300
What have you got?

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,966
GENMA SAOTOME: Only
this, checkmate.

36
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,633
TENDO: Like you
could win with that.

37
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,033
GENMA SAOTOME: It
still beats you.

38
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:16,733
[laughing]

39
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,100
TENDO: You thief.

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,566
GENMA SAOTOME: Once again,
you underestimate me.

41
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,400
[laughing]

42
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,400
But can-- this!

43
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,533
[sneezes]

44
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,600
-I was just a step
away from winning.

45
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,000
Saotome, was that
really fair of you?

46
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,766
-Hey.

47
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,333
I didn't do it on purpose.

48
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,366
Come on, I'll play you again.

49
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,300
-Fine.

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,733
But I'm warning
you, do that again

51
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,366
and you'll need a new partner.

52
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,633
-Whatever you say, Tendo.

53
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,533
You know I'll only
beat you again anyway.

54
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,566
I was only playing before.

55
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,300
This time, it's for real.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,333
SHOGI MASTER: Shogi master
Genma Saotome, I presume.

57
00:03:58,433 --> 00:03:59,100
-Hey.

58
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,500
You look kind of familiar.

59
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,333
-It's me.

60
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:03,933
So now do you remember my name?

61
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,600
-I'm thinking Western
part of the country.

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,966
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

63
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,100
-We wouldn't have skipped out
on that restaurant together,

64
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
would we?

65
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,800
-Um, think again.

66
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,633
-Um, you must be that
guy from that time--

67
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:16,233
-Mm-hm, mm-hm.

68
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:16,766
-Nope.

69
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:19,466
Not a clue.

70
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:22,400
-It began a year
ago from this day.

71
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:30,366
Checkmate.

72
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:32,033
-Do over.

73
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:36,366
-I'm sorry, but no serious shogi
player could ask such a thing.

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,600
If you didn't want
to lose, then you

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,466
shouldn't have asked to play.

76
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,266
Come on.

77
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:46,766
I beat you fair and square.

78
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,307
-Hey!

79
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:47,833
Look!

80
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:48,766
Up in the sky!

81
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,166
-I-- I don't-- where?

82
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,066
[laughing]

83
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,166
Where?

84
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,933
-How's this?

85
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,533
-I-- I don't believe it.

86
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,074
I lost.

87
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,166
[laughing]

88
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,100
-Sorry.

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,966
-You win.

90
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,266
Tell me your name at least.

91
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,733
-They call me the shogi master.

92
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,600
Come look me up once
you learn to play.

93
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
[laughing]

94
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,800
SHOGI MASTER: I'd been defeated.

95
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,633
That had never happened before.

96
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,533
I'd hit rock bottom and
there was no way up,

97
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:22,266
and then my wife, Clarabelle,
kicked me out of the house.

98
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,133
Clarabelle, I need a drink.

99
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,633
CLARABELLE: And
whose fault is that?

100
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,533
You've shamed our name.

101
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,333
I can't live with you anymore.

102
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,700
SHOGI MASTER:
Clarabelle, please.

103
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,700
-Farewell forever.

104
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
-Clarabelle, please,
don't leave me.

105
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:43,000
Shogi was my life,
and then it was gone.

106
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,300
I never saw Clarabelle again.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,933
After that, I did the only
thing that I could do.

108
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,900
I trained for a year.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Then I came to find you.

110
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,000
GENMA SAOTOME: Gotcha.

111
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,866
TENDO: On the
contrary, I've got you.

112
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,666
-I bare my soul and
you're playing games?

113
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:01,207
-Yeah.

114
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:01,766
So?

115
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,233
-So fight me.

116
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,533
-OK.

117
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,300
Like a moth to a flame.

118
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,233
SHOGI MASTER: Checkmate.

119
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,400
[screaming]

120
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,933
-Now be reasonable, Saotome.

121
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,466
You got lucky last time.

122
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:22,933
That's all.

123
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,500
-I'm almost sure I
can win this time.

124
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,033
-Hey!

125
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,600
What's that?

126
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,133
-Nothing.

127
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,433
That's what.

128
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:30,866
-There's a pig!

129
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,666
-No, there isn't.

130
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:33,633
[gasps]

131
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,600
Well, I'll be.

132
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,833
You really do have
a pig in your yard.

133
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,133
It looks good, too.

134
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,166
GENMA SAOTOME: Checkmate.

135
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,100
[gasps]

136
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,366
-You-- you beat me again?

137
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:47,633
-Now really, Saotome.

138
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:51,466
-If you don't want to get
beat, then don't play the game.

139
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,700
-Can I have another?

140
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,366
[gasps]

141
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,766
What's that?

142
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,566
It's not enough that
you've taken my pride.

143
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,266
You take my dignity, too.

144
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:05,933
-Now, now.

145
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:06,866
It's just a game.

146
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,533
-To you maybe,
but I'm different.

147
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,366
To me, it's a way of life.

148
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:15,200
If it's battle shogi you want,
it's battle shogi you'll get.

149
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:29,733
-I can hardly wait.

150
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,766
-You beat me once,
you beat me twice,

151
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,400
but now, I start to fight back.

152
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,366
Genma Saotome, get ready for
the toughest shogi of your life.

153
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,466
GIRL: I'm home.

154
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,900
RANMA: I'm starving.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,900
AKANE: Me, too.

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,666
-Clarabelle.

157
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:44,733
AKANE: Huh?

158
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,600
-So here's where you been.

159
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,466
-And who are you?

160
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:50,733
-Checkmate.

161
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,133
-What's that for?

162
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,633
-That's for stealing
my wife, Clarabelle.

163
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:55,366
RANMA: Your what?

164
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,866
-Just like her picture.

165
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,666
-That looks nothing like me.

166
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:01,333
-You act all bossy
like she does.

167
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:04,100
-I do not, and who
are you, anyway?

168
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,633
Dad, is this guy
a friend of yours?

169
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,500
-Well actually, he's
more like my disciple.

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,400
-Now you're insulting me.

171
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,000
-I'm done with
shogi, so let's go.

172
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,933
-Saotome, please.

173
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,900
-Make all the jokes you want
because your doom is at hand.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,966
[yelling]

175
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,700
-Somebody call for a hand?

176
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,600
-You're awful.

177
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,933
-Clarabelle, you've come back.

178
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,633
-Don't touch me.

179
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,066
-Clarabelle!

180
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,500
[chewing noisily]

181
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,366
-I have to say you've really
done it this time, Saotome.

182
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:52,166
Now you'll have to
reap what you've sown.

183
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,433
I hope you're happy.

184
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,000
-I love chewing ice.

185
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,566
-Nice try, pops.

186
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,266
-So what is martial
arts shogi anyways?

187
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:04,233
-Gee, how is it I know
what you're going to say?

188
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:08,733
-Martial arts shogi, AKA battle
chess, the most dangerous

189
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,166
of all Japanese board games.

190
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,700
In this real life version
of the traditional favorite,

191
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,666
real people are used
for game pieces.

192
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,833
-Promise me, boy, that
you'll be extra careful when

193
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:21,866
you're out there.

194
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:24,000
-And this relates to me how?

195
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
-Now see here, boy.

196
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
My battles are yours.

197
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,533
Yours are yours, too.

198
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,500
That's what family means.

199
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,866
-Fine.

200
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:34,633
I'm going to go take a nap.

201
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:35,174
[gasps]

202
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:55,933
[chuckling]

203
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,233
-So let's see how
you do on this board.

204
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,400
-So someone tell me again
why we're all in this corner.

205
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,000
-Because if we enter the
board, we'll get attacked.

206
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,666
-I'm home.

207
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,566
What's going on?

208
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,466
-Attack!

209
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:16,400
-Nabiki, quick!

210
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,766
Get off the board!

211
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:18,307
-Hm?

212
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:19,200
Hey, hey.

213
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,166
What is this?

214
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:24,200
Did I miss something?

215
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,033
-Clarabelle, you've
come back to me.

216
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,866
-What kind of name is
Clarabelle, anyway?

217
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:29,700
-Hey, everybody.

218
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,900
I'll have dinner ready soon, OK?

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,566
-Clarabelle, thank
goodness you're back.

220
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,500
-Huh?

221
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,900
-You look just the
way you used to.

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,900
Did you remember
the tonic water?

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,400
-Every woman that he meets
is Clarabelle, isn't she?

224
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,166
-Kasumi, be careful!

225
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,133
-Attack!

226
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,566
-OK, you jerks.

227
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,000
That's enough!

228
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,866
-Oh.

229
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,133
-Clarabelle, don't
leave me again.

230
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,600
-I'm sorry, but
my name is Kasumi.

231
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,833
-Oh, what a shame.

232
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,233
-I think you should
be safe up here.

233
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,333
-Oh no.

234
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,966
What about my shopping basket?

235
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:07,500
-Hey!

236
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Our dinner!

237
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,133
-Gotcha!

238
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,566
-You come back here!

239
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,500
-Somebody stop him!

240
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,133
-Give me back my
filet mignon now!

241
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,333
-Give me back my lobster!

242
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,200
-Like you really live that well.

243
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:25,100
-Oh, we've got to
get a piece of this.

244
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,066
[yelling]

245
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,966
-Take him!

246
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,366
-He's mine!

247
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,333
-I got the onions!

248
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,733
-Cabbage!

249
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,274
-Potato!

250
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,433
-The eggs!

251
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:39,974
-Sardines!

252
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:40,933
-Tofu!

253
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,400
-My filet!

254
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,100
-Oh.

255
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,366
What a beautiful sunset.

256
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:01,014
-Hey!

257
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:02,081
Ladies first!

258
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,481
-Not when it's life
or death, it's not.

259
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:05,714
-Look over there.

260
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:06,747
There's a pig.

261
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,781
-You already tried that, pops.

262
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:10,781
-This is beyond pathetic.

263
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:12,114
-I'm an old man.

264
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:13,147
I need my nutrition.

265
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:14,314
Come on.

266
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:17,014
-Well, I think food's
wasted on the old.

267
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:20,847
-Tea, anyone?

268
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:21,681
Here.

269
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:25,214
I've got the hot water for it.

270
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:26,181
-Back off, sis.

271
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:28,014
I was here first.

272
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:28,555
-Hey.

273
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:34,581
-Waste not, want not, I suppose.

274
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:39,614
[whimpering]

275
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,581
That was good.

276
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,614
I'll get tea leaves, OK?

277
00:12:46,714 --> 00:12:47,414
[sobbing]

278
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:48,181
Oh hey.

279
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,647
What's the matter, Father?

280
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,081
-I can't stand it.

281
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:55,247
This is his fault.

282
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:58,514
If not for him, we'd
be eating right now.

283
00:12:58,614 --> 00:12:59,381
[laughing]

284
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,047
-He's out in the garden.

285
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:06,881
-Hasn't he done enough
damage for one night?

286
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:08,247
[laughing]

287
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:11,847
-Thanks to our game, as you can
see, I've gone up a ranking.

288
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:12,647
What do you think?

289
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:14,281
-I think it's stupid.

290
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,714
You look ridiculous.

291
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:17,981
Stop messing around
and play for real.

292
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:19,981
You could take him,
can't you, Saotome?

293
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,281
[grunting]

294
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:22,881
What do you mean, what?

295
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:25,214
-If that's what you
want, you've got it.

296
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:28,014
Meet me at noon tomorrow
at the nearby temple.

297
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:30,114
-Dad, are you sure about this?

298
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:30,881
-Cut that out.

299
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:50,281
-Why exactly are you here again?

300
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:52,847
-Because you need all
the help you can get.

301
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:55,014
We're using
tournament rules here.

302
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:56,481
You'll have to use your head.

303
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:58,481
-I told you I can handle it.

304
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:02,281
-You don't even know the
rules, do you, Ranma?

305
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:02,947
-That's it.

306
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,447
I'm out of here.

307
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:06,381
-Oh no you don't, Saotome.

308
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,981
We wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you.

309
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,247
-He's right, pops.

310
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,381
You owe it to him.

311
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:15,014
-Oh, why did I have to
win that stupid game?

312
00:14:15,114 --> 00:14:17,081
It's a sad day when
a man must hide

313
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:19,014
his light beneath a bushel.

314
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:21,647
-Like he even knows
what that phrase means.

315
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:24,114
Speaking of sad,
where's the freak?

316
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:25,914
-With Nabiki.

317
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:29,347
-And what's your
role in this again?

318
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:31,647
-You watch sports, don't you?

319
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,147
Baseball, sumo?

320
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,814
And what do these
sports have in common?

321
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:37,081
A commentator, that's what.

322
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:38,914
That's why I'm here, sweetie.

323
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:40,381
-Good for you.

324
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:41,814
-Enough with the pregame.

325
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,914
Let's begin.

326
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:47,781
Since you're so few,
your team moves first.

327
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:48,681
-Fine with me.

328
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:55,114
What's the matter with you?

329
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:56,014
Why so slow?

330
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:01,214
-So why do they move so slow?

331
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:04,681
-Those pieces can only
move one square at a time.

332
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,214
-Well, wake me

00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:08,714
Attack!

Pop!

341
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:20,781
Look out!

343
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,014
-So what happens
now to Mr. Saotome?

344
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,314
-Well you see, now
that he's captured,

345
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:30,347
he goes to the other
side of the board

346
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:32,381
where he waits to be
used by their team.

347
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:33,714
-Cool.

348
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:38,514
-You belong to me now, so stay
there 'til I call for you.

349
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:39,447
-OK.

350
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,281
Now it's starting
to tick me off.

351
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:46,747
-Corner!

352
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,181
-Corner, corner, corner, corner!

353
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,314
-Hey!

354
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:54,914
I thought you were only
supposed to go straight.

No fair!

357
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,614
I thought you were
going diagonal!

358
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:01,214
-Wait a minute.

359
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:02,314
That's not right.

360
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:04,147
How is he chasing him like that?

361
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:07,647
-Corners go diagonal and
flyers go at right angles.

362
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:10,614
If somebody on our side
doesn't figure that out soon,

363
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:13,714
we're going to lose big time.

AKANE: Ranma, that's a gold!

00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:36,247
Get behind him!

-Get ready, 'cause now I
know what your weakness is.

So now what's going on?

-This one's the gold.

378
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:57,281
It can't move there, and
silvers can't move here.

-That's amazing.

side of the silver!

Can't touch me now, can you?

-You're next, so
get ready, buddy.

00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:26,181
so many different moves.

-True, but there's
no rule saying

391
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,514
we've got to move a certain way.

00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:47,781
We cleared the board.

they're gone we can go home.

be able to manage.

fight us, Dad. are you?

you'll forgive me.

want to do it, do you?

That's really low.

You've come back to me.

this sort of thing.

-I can't help it.

-You're too into this hobby.

451

-It's not a hobby.

452
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:32,947
It's a lifestyle.

-Whatever it is, so long
as it pays the bills,

I won't complain.

name's old fashioned?

OLD MAN: I see what I
eat and I eat what I see.

Step it up, boy.

You're falling behind.

Don't start with me, you,
