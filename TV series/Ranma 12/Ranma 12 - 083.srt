Even Chinese medicine
can't work miracles.

00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,484
Be that as it may, what
miracles can I sell you today?

6
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:55,850
-Your last so-called
miracle gave me

7
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,684
arthritis for nearly a week.

8
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,784
You'll forgive me
if I'm suspicious.

00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:01,284
-True, true.

10
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:04,884
It wasn't what you wanted, but
you asked for canned arthritis,

11
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,184
so I sold it to you.

12
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:08,950
What you needed was
canned arthritis cure.

13
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,784
Well, I'd like to buy
some of that then, please.

00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:14,617
-Oh, well, why
didn't you say so?

-I just love a curious consumer.

That's the Red Thread of Fate.

-Red Thread of Fate?

Tie one end to

-No, only at you.

Runma, you play cat's

-Uh, ain't you a little
old for that stuff?

46

-Shampoo let's you
have all you can

for entire week, Runma.

-Cat's cradle?

49
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:25,450
Why didn't you say so?

50
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,250
-Oh, I see.

51
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,517
So that's what you're into.

-Uh, look, Akane, it's
not what you think.

-It's not, huh?

54
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,984
Then you won't mind this.

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,184
Girls are less trouble anyway.

56
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:41,917
-What'd you do that for, huh?

57
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:44,250
-Because you're making
a big scene, that's why.

-I'm making a big scene, am I?

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,317
Hey, Shampoo, why are you
tying that thread to my finger?

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,091
-Hmm?

Now we make wedding plan.

-Wedding plans?

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,684
-Well, that's true.

65
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:11,917
The sooner I'm married to you,
the sooner I'm rid of her.

00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:12,458
-Excuse me?

At last, Ranma know what
Shampoo feel all this time.

-I'll be.

Will you finally be my
son-in-law for real?

-Yes.

71
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:26,117
And I must insist that
you move in with us

72
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:28,217
once Shampoo and I
are happily married.

73
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,484
-You're not so bad after all.

74
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,884
-Well, then, let's decide
on a day then, shall we?

75
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,417
-I'm for a chapel
wedding myself.

76
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:41,350
-Shampoo agree.

77
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,784
-Have it your way.

78
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:45,750
-He what?

79
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,717
Ranma engaged to marry Shampoo?

80
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:51,150
Saotome, what is
the meaning of this?

81
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,250
You didn't go and make
a deal for free food

82
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,584
the Cat Cafe again, did you?

83
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:56,784
Did you?

84
00:05:56,884 --> 00:06:00,450
-Do I look like that kind
of man to you, Tendo?

85
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,017
-You do.

86
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,217
-Say it isn't so.

87
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:05,150
-It's so.

88
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,391
Ranma.

89
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:12,017
What is the meaning of this?

90
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,584
-Aho, you mean this?

91
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:17,184
It's the sign of affection.

92
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:21,450
-Sign of-- and what's your
answer to that, Saotome?

93
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:23,858
Aah.

94
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,817
Thanks a ton.

95
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,484
-Oh, and Mr. Tendo,
may I ask you a favor?

96
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:30,417
-Sure, why not?

97
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:33,517
-Please help cancel my
engagement to Akane.

98
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:41,117
-Now the last obstacle
to wedding is gone,

99
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:42,817
Shampoo's so happy.

100
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,617
-Well, no one asked me
if I wanted to marry her.

101
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:47,284
Besides, she's not
the one I love.

102
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:47,825
You are.

103
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:51,991
-Akane.

104
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,650
-But it's got nothing
to do with me, Dad.

105
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,384
-That's here you'd
be wrong, young lady.

106
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,850
Ranma is serious about this.

107
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,017
-Serious or not,
Dad, I'm not the one

108
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:05,417
who got him into this mess.

109
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,750
He is.

110
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,717
-I won't pressure you
if that's how you feel.

111
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,284
But you are still his fiancee.

112
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:14,317
-Dad, I don't want to
hurt your feelings,

113
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,884
but you're just not getting it.

114
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:19,050
We never asked for an
arranged marriage, OK?

115
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,550
That was all our
father's dumb idea.

116
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,550
-I want you to
talk him out of it.

117
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,984
Even if you have to get
on your knees and beg.

118
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:28,450
-Knees and beg?

119
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,050
-Strike that.

120
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,184
I take it back.

121
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,884
Use any approach
you like, so long

122
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,417
as you get him to break
up with that Shampoo.

123
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:36,650
One way or the
other, Daddy swears

124
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,817
that he will come back to you.

125
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,384
-I'm leaving.

126
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,391
-Akane.

127
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:46,758
Akane.

128

-You're such a cutie.

129
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:59,284
-Shampoo happiness complete.

130
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:04,117
-It's not really like
I care or anything,

131
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,884
but isn't he over doing it?

132
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,217
-Perhaps, it's inevitable.

133
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,984
-I can't believe you said that.

134
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:14,817
-They are bound by the Red
Thread of Fate, aren't they?

135
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,284
-Good grief.

136
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:18,817
You don't believe that
corny story, do you?

137
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:20,384
-Isn't there, though?

138
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:20,925
-What?

139
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:24,784
-This one nothing, OK?

140
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:28,884
-Very interesting.

141
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,050
So it's nothing, huh?

142
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:36,650
-It's got nothing to do with me.

143
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,650
Hiya!

144
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,150
Hiya!

145
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,691
Hiya!

146
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,784
Let's go, P-chan.

147
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:56,384
-They're what?

148
00:08:56,484 --> 00:09:00,950
Since when are Ranma and Shampoo
suddenly engaged to each other?

149
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,917
-Make me a shrimp
one next, will you?

150
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:05,650
-I'll make you shrimp,
squid, and octopus

151
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,184
if you tell me how she
got her hooks into him.

152
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:09,584
-OK.

153
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:12,650
Don't quote me on it, but she
used some kind of red thread.

154
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,284
-The Red Thread of Fate?

155
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:18,517
Starts here and
ends on this finger?

156
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:20,450
They're supposed
to be invisible.

157
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,717
-Hey, I saw it with
my own eyes, OK?

158
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,450
Shampoo's got him under
some kind of spell,

159
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,017
and that's all I
have to say about it.

160
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:31,150
-Oh, that is so like
the little witch.

161
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,650
-When did you get here?

162
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,584
-I've lived on table
scraps for a year now.

163
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:41,250
Who knows how far this
information might take me.

164
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,791
Farewell.

165
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,484
-Ha!

166
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:48,184
Let's see how that red
thread holds up to this.

167
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:52,084
Ranma Saotome.

168
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:54,484
-What the--

169
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,617
-Ranma, darling,
surely you jest.

170
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:01,950
You should know by now
how jealous I can be.

171
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,617
-Better dead than wed.

172
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,750
That's our motto.

173
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,684
-Molest not the union
of Ranma and Shampoo.

174
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:10,617
-Cry baby.

175
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:11,250
-I'm not.

176
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:17,084
Oh, brother, dear, it's
so pathetically obvious.

177
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,217
-What is?

178
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,617
-By protecting their
illicit liaison,

179
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:23,850
you hope to win Akane
Tendo for yourself.

180
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,317
Isn't that right, brother, dear?

181
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,417
-Woman, enough!

182
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,484
-You dang, stubborn mule.

183
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:33,517
-I intend to keep you
from severing this Red

184
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,584
Thread of Fate, and
you can't stop me.

185
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:37,517
-Oh, you are, are you?

186
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:44,517
No.

187
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:45,117
-Child's play.

188
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,084
No fair, that's cheating.

189
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,217
-There's no time to waste.

190
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,350
-Come back.

191
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,050
-Only three more hours till
red thread lasts forever.

192
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:16,617
-Hey, can we keep
running, honey-bunny?

193
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,584
-As long as we stay
together, Shampoo

194
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:20,050
run with Ranma anywhere.

195
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,591
-Huh?

196
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,517
-You said it.

197
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,217
-Ready or not, the
thread's coming off!

198
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,717
-Now they're all involved.

199
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,984
-Akane Tendo.

200
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,717
What say you to a
double wedding ceremony

201
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,117
with your former fiance?

202
00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:40,317
-What do you say to this?

203
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,317
Ranma will do just
fine without me.

204
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,750
Let him have his own wedding.

205
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:09,346
(SIGH)

206
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,817
It's like a bad
dream I can't wake up from.

207
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:19,650
-It's no dream.

208
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,517
-Dad, the next time
you want to come in,

209
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,917
would you please knock?

210
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:25,084
-This is an emergency, Akane.

211
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:27,684
Look at the invitation that
arrived in the mail for you

212
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:28,517
today.

213
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:29,058
-What?

214
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,250
In celebration of their
love, Ranma and Shampoo

215
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,284
invite you to their--
Ah, what a pity.

216
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,750
Send them my regrets.

217
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,017
-You do realize that
once they're married,

218
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:43,950
there's no going
back, don't you?

219
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:47,617
You're sure that's
what you want?

220
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:51,350
-Look, what I want
doesn't matter, does it?

221
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,950
Nobody's forcing
Ranma into marriage.

222
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,350
-Maybe, maybe not.

223
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,484
-Huh?

224
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:58,850
It looks as though
Kasumi's theory might not

225
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,050
be that far off after all.

226
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,617
-What theory?

227
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:06,150
-That Shampoo's using some
hokey red thread trick

228
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,717
to tie him to her.

229
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:08,850
-I knew it.

230
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,784
-Yeah, right.

231
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:11,684
-Fine, don't believe me.

232
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:15,050
But don't come crying to me
once it's too late to stop it.

233
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,517
-It is her usual kind of
trick come to think of it.

234
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:19,584
-A red thread?

235
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,317
Huh?

236
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,650
Right, that's it!

237
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,750
That's when she--

238
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:31,158
-Akane?

239
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:32,250
-Huh?

240
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,784
-That thread should be
cut by your own hand.

241
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,650
-Since when am I his babysitter?

242
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,350
-So you don't mind if
he marries her then?

243
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,850
-Oh, come on Akane,
give the dope a break.

244
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,684
Besides, it's not his fault.

245
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,950
It's the thread.

246
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,417
-Go away, will you?

247
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:53,384
I've still got my
homework to do.

248
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:56,858
P-chan?

249
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:03,284
-No one hurts Akane
when I'm around.

250
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,917
When I'm around, that
is, which isn't often.

251
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,450
-My, aren't you beautiful?

252
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,450
-Did you make whole new dress
for Shampoo, great Grandmother?

253
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:26,117
-Actually, I was planning
to wear it at my own,

254
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:36,617
uh, uh-- I'm glad
someone gets to use it.

255
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,550
-Is you happy, Ranma?

256
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,984
-More than I can say, Shampoo.

257
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,284
-Shampoo's so glad.

258
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:48,884
-Ranma, she's tricking you.

259
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:52,050
-Don't believe
his lies, Shampoo.

260
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,550
-You back off, Mousse.

261
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,150
-Why won't you two accept
that we're in love?

262
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:09,084
-Ranma, honey-- and there it is.

263
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:12,950
Then I guess there's nothing
we can say to stop you.

264
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:18,317
d can come wedding if you like.

265
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,750
-Thanks, I will.

266
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:26,150
-Ah, stupid witch.

267
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,350
-Huh?

268
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,050
How did you and I-- hey,
is this some kind of joke?

269
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:33,350
-Ranma, honey, you're back.

270
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:38,317
-Red thread bow, Kudo style.

271
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,391
-Huh?

272
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,350
Come on.

273
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,750
Let's go be alone, Shampoo.

274
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,784
-Brother, dear, how could you?

275
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:50,350
-I tell you this
wedding will go on.

276
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,184
-That's what you think.

277
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:02,717
-Go, with my blessing.

278
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:05,258
-Ranma.

279
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:05,766
-Huh?

280
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:08,250
Ryouga?

281
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,150
-What you doing here?

282
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,650
-If you think I'm going
to let you hurt Akane,

283
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,617
think again, jerk.

284
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,450
-Put it back.

285
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,284
-No can do.

286
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:35,950
So this is the red thread?

287
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:39,150
-Am I missing something here?

288
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,884
-Ryouga, give
thread and go home.

289
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,717
-Like I said, no can do.

290
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:47,184
-But Ryouga, if
Ranma marry Shampoo,

291
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:50,817
then you get Akane
all to ownself.

292
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:51,784
-What?

293
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:53,750
I'm so happy.

294
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,717
-Me, too.

295
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:56,750
-That's right.

296
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,017
Wait.

297
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:02,550
If I let her marry him,
Akane will never forgive me.

298
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:07,350
But if I don't, Akane and Ranma
will-- oh, what should I do?

299
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,350
-Hand over.

300
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:15,917
-50 more minutes.

301
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:18,150
Not that I'm watching
the clock or anything.

302
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:28,858
Hmm?

303
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,791
Hmph.

304
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,184
VOICEOVERS: Oh, yeah.

305
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:40,650
-Huh?

306
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,417
What do I care who he--

307
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:43,584
VOICEOVERS: Congratulations.

308
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:46,384
Congratulations.

309
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,850
VOICEOVERS: I wish you the best.

310
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:50,850
My son in law at last.

311
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:56,884
-Oh, that's just what you'd
like me to do, isn't it Ranma?

312
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,050
Just sit back and take it.

313
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,817
-So what do we do now, Saotome?

314
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,984
-We take charge of the
situation, that's what.

315
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:06,784
-You said it.

316
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:08,550
-I sure did.

317
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,384
-Are you sure you want to
risk ticking him off, though?

318
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:15,584
I mean, what if he decides to
abandon you in your old age?

319
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:16,284
-True.

320
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:17,950
The girl has a point.

321
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,317
-Saotome, help, how could you?

322
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,150
-Let us through.

323
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,084
-Don't be such a poor loser.

324
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:33,850
Why not be happy for
your former fiance?

325
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,117
-Because it's not me he's
marrying, that's why?

326
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,917
Besides, it's not
even real love.

327
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:39,717
It's fake.

328
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,717
-For now, maybe.

329
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:45,217
But come 5 o'clock,
it'll be a moot point.

330
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:49,850
-So what happens at 5 o'clock?

331
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:53,950
-The thread falls off, and
their love becomes real.

332
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,884
-Excuse me?

333
00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:57,325
-Upsy daisy.

334
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:00,284
-Oh, why you.

335
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,350
-Have you no witness?

336
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:10,225
-Huh?

337
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,184
Shampoo thought she
send invitation.

338
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,684
Is OK, no witness, Ranma?

339
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:19,084
-You're the only one
I'll ever need, honey.

340
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:22,050
-Ranma, you Shampoo
dream come true.

341
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,632
-Uh-hem.

342
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:25,584
May we?

343
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,650
-Soon, Ranma belong
only Shampoo.

344
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:33,684
-Just a sec.

345
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,450
-Hmm, Akane.

346
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,850
Why you try stop us?

347
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,584
-I'm here to help
you, not stop you.

348
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,450
-And Akane no mind that
witness to wedding.

349
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,950
-Just try and stop me.

350
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,317
-How kind.

351
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,850
I insist that you come and visit
with us once we're married,

352
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,391
Akane.

353
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:55,617
-You bet I will.

354
00:19:58,617 --> 00:19:59,750
-Just minute more.

355
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:02,517
-Your bouquet.

356
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,684
-You tricked me.

357
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:42,817
-Did you really think
that I wouldn't?

358
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:43,717
-Huh?

359
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,317
Where am I?

360
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:45,858
-Hmm.

361
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:50,050
-Ranma.

362
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,384
-Huh, what did I do now?

363
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,717
-Prepare to die.

364
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:57,484
-Come on you guys, cut it out.

365
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:59,150
Show a little respect.

366
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,217
Church.

367
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:04,317
So then you understand?

368
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,484
-Sure, Ranma, we understand.

369
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:10,384
-Well, OK then.

370
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:12,717
Come on, Akane, let's
get out of here.

371
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:13,617
-Good idea.

372
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:15,250
-Fine, then, run away.

373
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:22,417
-So tell me, what reason do
we got to run away for, huh?

374

-Good point.

375
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,717
-I don't get it.

376
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,717
Now what'd I do?

377
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:28,617
-Think about it.

378
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:32,584
-But-- but I--

00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:17,984
-You're not really going back
to China, are you, Mousse?

381
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,250
You're what?

382
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,750
Giving up Shampoo to Ranma?

383
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:25,084
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Mousse goes home to the country.
