00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,066
-Hey, let go!

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,566
-Hai-yah!

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,133
NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

7
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,700
-What are you doing?

8
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,133
The two have been engaged to
marry by their loving parents.

9
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,800
-I didn't ask for this.

10
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,300
-Who asked you?

11
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,600
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

12
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:26,066
-What'd you do that for?

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,100
NARRATOR: When Ranma is
splashed with cold water,

COLOGNE (VOICEOVER): [cackles]
I didn't even hear you.

17
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:00,194
You came up behind me
without making a sound.

18
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:06,294
No wonder my great-granddaughter
chose you for her husband.

19
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:09,027

future son-in-law.

21
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:16,827
The pressure point I touched
makes your whole body

22
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,661
as sensitive as a cat's tongue.

23
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:22,094
Even the most tepid water
will seem boiling to you.

24
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,994
In other words, the next
time you turn into a girl,

25
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:27,427
you won't be able to
endure the hot water you

26
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,727
need to change back.

27
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:31,561
Unless you want to spend the
rest of your life as a girl,

28
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:32,961
you'll agree to marry Shampoo.

29
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:39,527
You won't be able
to change back.

30
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:40,394
-No!

31
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:43,527
That can't be right!

32
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,527
[splash]

33
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:47,027

[murmuring softly]

35
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:54,227
Hm?

36
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,761
[gasp] Uh?

37
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:57,561
-How do you feel, Ranma?

38
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:59,961
-What the heck am I wearing?

39
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,094
-That old thing?

40
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,661
Just something I
had lying around.

41
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:04,461
You can have it if you want.

42
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:05,994
-But I'm a guy.

43
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:09,027
Right now you're a
girl, so lighten up, OK?

44
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,994
That color is so you.

45
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:12,561
-It is cute.

46
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:15,327
And you have been spending a
lot of time as a girl lately,

47
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:17,627
Ranma.

48
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:19,361
-It's not like I can help it.

49
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:21,361
But I'm a guy!

50
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,061
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
They're all acting

51
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:27,094
like it's some kind of joke.

52
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:29,561
Oh, man, I don't
care what it takes.

53
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:32,861
I'm gonna change back
into a guy or else!

54
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,161
[gasp]

55
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:37,861
-Ranma Saotome, prepare
to defend yourself.

56
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:39,761
Pusillanimous fiend!

57
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,727
-Great, this is all I need.

58

[gasp]

59
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:44,694
-Forgive me.

60
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:46,727
I mistook you for someone else.

61
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:49,927
And you are so unlike him.

62
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,594
Come to me, my love!

63
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:56,861
-Jerk.

64
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:57,827
SHAMPOO: Ranma!

65
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:59,127
-Huh?

66
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:01,361
-You change mind about
wedding yet, Ranma?

67
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:02,461
-No way!

68
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:05,294
That ghoul ain't gonna
get away with this!

69
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:05,961
Huh?

70
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:07,261
-Oh, pigtailed girl!

-Ranma, are you OK?

73
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,994
Oh, it's Kuno.

74
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:17,394
I wouldn't have hit
him if I'd have known.

75
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:18,594
Thing for caring.

76
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:21,194
-Well, next time I'll
just leave you two alone.

00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:04,861
-Come on, they're not
getting any hotter, you know.

169
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:05,827
Get a move on.

170
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:07,261
-Shut up, you old ghoul.

171
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:15,761
I'm off to work again.

172
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,794
Have a nice day.

173
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:19,427
Do you think he's overdoing it?

174
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,427
-I hear the place
is standing room

175
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,961
only since the boy
started working there.

176
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:30,061
-I can't help feeling
sorry for the poor sap.

177
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:32,461
That old lady's really
running him into the ground.

178
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,494
-With her as his boss, the boy
must be working for every yen.

179
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:37,627
However, this too
is part of training.

180
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,461
KASUMI: Akane, aren't you
worried just a little bit?

181
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:45,994
Ranma being forced to work
in that restaurant and all?

182
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:48,094
-What he does has
nothing to do with me.

183
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:50,027
Let him move in
there, for all I care.

184
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:04,527
-Thank you.

185
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:05,161
Come again.

186
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,527
Bye-bye.

187
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:07,727
[gasp]

188
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,527
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
The Phoenix Pill.

189
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,894
It's mine!

190
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:13,361
-Catch!

191
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:17,027
A side of spring rolls and
two orders of potstickers.

00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,994
-Uh, hello.

197
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:40,527
COLOGNE: Order up.

198
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:44,827
Roast pork ramen, wonton soup,
seven bowls total-- catch!

199
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:45,961
-What's she doing?

200
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:46,894
[cheering and hooting]

201

-Please, no applause!

202
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:51,094
AKANE: What are you do--

203
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:52,461
-That's my future son-in-law.

204
00:08:52,494 --> 00:08:54,461
He's made great progress.

205
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:55,461
-Haven't you had enough?

206
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,927
Look what she's got
you doing, Ranma.

207
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:04,494
--[laughs] You ain't
seen nothing-- [laughs]

208
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,861
[moans]

209
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,861
-Ranma!

210
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:14,394
Uh, Ranma, could you-- aaah!

211
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:15,394
-Ranma!

212
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:16,794
Snap out of it!

213
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:17,394
-Aaahh!

214
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:22,727
[cheering and hooting]

215
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,727
-Why are you here?

216
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:26,494
-Call it research, if you like.

217
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:31,494
-Come on, you guys,
take it outside.

218
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:32,761
Let me work.

219
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:35,494
COLOGNE: Son-in-law,
come over here.

220
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:36,094
-Huh?

221
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:40,461
Let me guess.

222
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:42,027
We're gonna roast
marshmallows, right?

223
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:43,194
-Something else.

224
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:45,927
Shampoo, give that to me.

225
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,594
Here I have a bag
of sweet chestnuts.

226
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,061
Watch very carefully.

227
00:10:00,194 --> 00:10:01,127
[gasp]

228
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:03,661
-Hm.

229
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:04,927
-Your turn.

230
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:06,794
-Legendary technique.

231
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:09,094
Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken.

232
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:11,261
-Mm, what you just
witnessed was a technique

233
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:15,027
developed over 3,000 years
of Chinese Amazon history.

234
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:18,427
Even the last emperor of
China lived in terror of it.

235
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:21,261
-To pluck the chestnuts from
the flames without being burned.

236
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:24,227
That must take some
really incredible speed.

237
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:27,727
-If you can master this,
taking the Phoenix Pill from me

238
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,261
will be child's play.

239
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,594
[laughs]

240
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:41,494
--[giggle] To be told
secret is good honor.

241
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:46,227
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Chestnuts
Roasting on an Open Fire, eh?

242
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,427
-OK!

243
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,561
I'll master that technique,
even if it kills me.

244
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:11,303
[fire crackling]

245
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:17,169
[groans weakly]

246
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:20,069
-Come on, Ramna, be a man.

247
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:22,369
If you can't pluck a few
chestnuts from a fire,

248
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:24,903
how will you carry on
the Saotome School?

249
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,136
All right then, fine.

250
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:31,403
I'll show you how it's done.

251
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:38,366
Hyaaaa-aah!

252
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:39,503
Hah!

253
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:40,136
Haah!

254
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,069
Huah!

255
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,803
Yah!

256
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,403
Haah!

257
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:51,636
[shouting with pain]

258
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,469
[splash]

259
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:57,969
-He still hasn't got it, has he?

260
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:00,803
So where'd he learn
that dumb trick, anyway?

261
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,603
I don't suppose you know.

262
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:03,736
-Well, I, uh--

263
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:04,869
NABIKI: Oh, yeah,
I almost forgot.

264
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:06,603
There's a fair in
the park today.

265
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:08,003
You want to come
with me, Kasumi?

266
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:10,503
-I'll show you how
it's done, he says.

267
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,069
Good one, Pop.

268
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:15,336
If he couldn't do it, he shoulda
said so in the first place.

269
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:16,303
COLOGNE: Son-in-law.

270
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,636
-[gasp] Oh!

271
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:20,936
Now what do you want?

272
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:24,769
-Have you learned
the technique yet?

273
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:26,169
Lookie, Ranma.

274
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,403
Here's the Phoenix Pill
that can change you back.

275
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:32,269
-Don't To patronize me,
you old-- gimme that!

276
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:36,903
Ooh!

277
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:40,203
What-- what'd you do?

278
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:44,336
-[laughs] You're still too slow.

279
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:47,569
Don't ask again, because
this is the last time.

280
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:49,503
-I didn't ask you
the first time.

281
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,303
[gasp]

282
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:04,636
-Wow, that was incredible.

283
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:08,036
-Not bad, eh?

284
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:11,003
Excuse me, I left
some noodles boiling.

285
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:13,703
I'll a back again
later, son-in-law.

286
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:15,469
[laughs]

287
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,136
-Aw, you old ghoul!

288
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:19,469
SOUN: Hm, I've been
thinking, Ranma.

289
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:22,403
I think you may have bitten
off more than you can chew.

290
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,569
RANMA: I've come too
far to turn back now.

291
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,269
If I can't figure out this
Roasting Chestnuts thing,

292
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:30,536
I'll never get my hands
on that Phoenix Pill.

293
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:31,969
-Stop!

294
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,836
You've still got that
full-body cat tongue thing.

295
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,469
You'll hurt yourself.

296
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:36,636
(WHINING) It's hot.

297
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:37,536
It's hot!

298
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:39,503
It's so hot!

299
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:43,836
[sobs] I can't spend my
whole life as a girl.

300
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:46,103
But the other thing
is even worse!

301
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:48,103
Oh, what am I gonna do?

302
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:51,603
-There, there, son.

303
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:52,503
No need for that.

304
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:54,369
-There isn't?

305
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:55,136
-The fair, son.

306
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,669
The fair's just the thing.

307
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,403
The answer to all your problems.

308
00:13:58,436 --> 00:13:59,569
-Huh?

309
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:02,003
-Have some squid-on-a-stick,
win a few prizes.

310
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:04,369
What better way to
forget your sorrows?

311
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,969
It always works for
me when I'm blue.

312
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:09,736
-You really believe that?

313
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,003
-Ranma, why why
not go with Akane?

314
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:14,469
You two will have some fun.

315
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:15,869
And then who knows?

316
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:18,303
Maybe you'll find some
inspiration or something.

317
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:19,869
AKANE: I don't want
to babysit him.

318
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,003
RANMA: Hold your horses.

319
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:22,669
I didn't say I'd go yet.

320
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:23,636
SOUN: Calm down, son.

321
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:25,036
You know what they say.

322
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,369
All's fair at the fair.

really glad we came.

332
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:09,636
-Hm?

[weeping]

334
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:16,469
-Hey, don't cry, little boy.

335
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:19,636
I'll help you catch one of
those little fishies, OK?

336
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,903
-You-- you will?

337
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,803
-300 yen a pop, babe.

338
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:23,669
-You nuts?

339
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,069
I'm not paying that.

340
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:27,569
-Catch 'em alls, and you
get 'em all for free.

341
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:28,669
AKANE: Oh, really?

342
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:29,936
300, was it?

343
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,603
BYSTANDER: Make room
for the little lady.

344
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:34,369
-OK, here I go.

345
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:35,736
Oh, great.

346
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,736
How did that happen?

347
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,769
Hey, I want a new one.

348
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:41,703
-Oh, here you go.

349
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:44,636
-OK, this time for sure.

350
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:45,803
Give me another.

351
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:46,569
BOOTH WORKER: You got it.

352
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:47,569
AKANE: Another.

353
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:48,336
BOOTH WORKER: There you go.

354
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:49,003
AKANE: Another!

355
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:49,736
BOOTH WORKER: Uh-oh.

356
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:50,503
Do it again.

357
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:51,503
AKANE: Another!

358
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:52,269
BOOTH WORKER: Try one more.

359
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:52,903
AKANE: Another!

360
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:53,669
BOOTH WORKER: Yep.

00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,636
AKANE: Another!

AKANE: Another.

364
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:57,203
BOOTH WORKER: Have another shot.

365
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,003
AKANE: Another.

366
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:58,769
BOOTH WORKER: There you go.

367
00:15:58,803 --> 00:15:59,669
AKANE: Another.

368
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:00,436
BOOTH WORKER: Got it.

369
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:01,303
AKANE: Another.

370
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:01,769
BOOTH WORKER: Awww--

371
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:02,503
-Hey!

372
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:03,703
Wait a minute.

373
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:04,469
Are you sure these
aren't defective?

374
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:05,069
-You think so?

375
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:05,536
Gee.

376
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:06,969
[wails]

377
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:08,603
-Don't cry, kid.

378
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,869
Let me handle this.

379
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,769
You couldn't strain
tea leaves with these.

380
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:14,536
BOOTH WORKER: Ain't
that the truth?

381
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:15,136
-Hmph.

382
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:19,103
-OK.

383
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,669
-Wow, lady, you're great!

384
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,003
-Call me mister.

385
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:40,369
AKANE: Ranma, catch 'em
all, and they're free.

386
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:41,569
-That's easy!

387
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,436
Ta-dah!

388
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,369
[plop]

389
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,436
-You did it!

390
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:46,936
BOOTH WORKER (VOICEOVER):
At this rate,

391
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:48,636
the broad's gonna put
me out of business!

392
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:52,536
Gotta think of something.

393
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,503
-Yah!

394
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:57,636
Not so fast there, sister.

395
00:16:57,669 --> 00:16:59,736
I got another game.

396
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,103
From the depths of
the Amazon comes

397
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,569
the piranha, the world's
most dangerous fish.

398
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:06,236
Old Bossy the cow wouldn't have
a chance against these babies.

399
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:09,869
Catch 'em with your bare hands
or give me the goldfish back.

400
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,536
-Hey, that's not fair!

401
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,269
-That's life.

402
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:12,736
Aah!

403
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:14,403
[crunch]

404
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,736
-I'll take that challenge.

405
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,669
-Lady, I really want one.

406
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,503
-Hey, I'm a Mister!

407
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:21,736
-But they'll eat you alive!

408
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,103
-No they won't, not
if I catch them first.

409
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:26,269
It's no different
than the goldfish.

410
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:27,169
I'm fast!

411
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,436
That's it.

412
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,503
It's the same idea as the
Roasting Chestnuts thingamajig.

413
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:36,703
-Ranma?

414
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:38,236
RANMA: I can get
enough speed to catch

415
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,836
those piranhas before they bite.

416
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:43,403
OK, just watch!

417
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,003
-She's gone nuts.

418
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:48,403
-Aaaaaah!

-OK, you old ghoul,
hand it over!

422
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:12,869
Gimme that Phoenix Pill!

[customers murmur]

424
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:19,736
-Ghoul, where are you hiding?

425
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:20,736
Whoa!

why I love this place?

Ow, ah.

431
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,503
COLOGNE: I've been waiting
for you, son-in-law.

432
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:30,369
-Where are you?

433
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,369
Come out!

434
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,369
Fight me.

[gong]

436
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,303
What the heck is this?

437
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:53,603
Hey!

438
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:57,203
These flames aren't real.

439
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,569
A-ha!

440
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:01,369
I knew it!

441
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:04,969
It's just another one of
your tricks, isn't it?

442
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:07,769
-Well, you've managed to
see through yet another

443
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:09,469
of my illusions, eh, sonny boy?

444
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:12,703
I'll have you know even the
emperor of the So Dynasty

445
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,469
was afraid of that one.

446
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:15,069
-Hai-yah!

447
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:24,303

-Oh, now I get it.

451
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,503
You really are a
monkey, ain'tcha?

452
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:32,736
Take that!

453
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:36,303
Don't you run away
from me, you old ghoul!

454
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:37,303
COLOGNE: Here I am.

00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,169
RANMA: Ah.

456
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:43,803
-If you want the Phoenix
Pill, son-in-law,

457
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:45,769
cross this boiling lake.

-You want it that way,
that's fine with me.

00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,836
OK!

You old ghoul!

would build a bath this big?

00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:16,103
Whoa!

00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,736
-Lost at sea.

471
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,669
What a sad way to lose
a future son-in-law.

472
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:26,069
RANMA: I'm not lost yet!

473
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:28,636
I'm gonna change
back into a guy.

Well I am impressed.

Not bad.

-Well, well.

482
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:55,236
Looks like you managed to get
through my defenses after all.

483
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:58,603
-And now I can touch
hot water, no problem.

484
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:00,869
It looks like candy.

485

Well, you've mastered
the Chestnuts Roasting

these fishes, Ranma?

You clever.
