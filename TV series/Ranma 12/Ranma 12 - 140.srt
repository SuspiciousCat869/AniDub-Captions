3
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,756
Maybe this location's no good.

4
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:07,023
We haven't sold a single thing.

5
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:09,289
Which reminds me, are
you nuts or something,

6
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:12,589
trying to sell your dad
at the school bazaar?

7
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:14,056
What can it hurt?

8
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,723
At least this way we might
end up selling something.

9
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:19,423
Anyway, who are
you to criticize?

10
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:20,556
Huh?

11
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:22,189
You've lost it if you
think anyone'll buy one

12
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:23,589
of those fright night beasts.

13
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:25,789
They make Frankenstein
look cute.

14
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:28,056
I think my stuffies
are pretty cute.

15
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:32,189
I put a lot of love
into making them.

16
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:33,656
[laughing]

17
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,623
Ranma?

18
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:41,623
Here, you can have these.

19
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:43,056
[laughing]

20
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,589
What are you in on the
panty raid with the old man?

21
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,589
Honestly, he's always
getting into trouble.

22
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:56,589
Pick a peck of happosai.

23
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:04,423
Thanks for taking care of him.

24
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:05,656
Just wait.

25
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,823
I'm going to do some serious
damage to that old freak

26
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:10,123
next time I see him.

27
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,223
Give it a rest Ranma.

28
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:12,723
You can try all you want to.

29
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:15,756
But nothing you do is ever
going to change the old guy.

30
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:16,656
Huh?

31
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:17,789
Kasumi!

32
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,789
Oh my, if it isn't
Akane and Ranma.

33
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,356
Have you found anything
good here at the bazaar?

34
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:25,289
Nah, it's a total
waste of time.

35
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:26,323
Really?

36
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,023
Well, this buy sell
and trade pamphlet

37
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:30,556
says there's an interesting
antique stall around here.

38
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,589
Man, this is really something.

39
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,189
I don't know.

40
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:40,889
Is it right to sell something
like this at a school bazaar?

41
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:43,056
These things are
valuable you know?

42
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,823
Wonder whose stall it is.

43
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,756
Very knowledgeable Akane Tendo.

44
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:47,923
Ah!

45
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:50,023
So this is your
stall, is it Kuno?

46
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:51,856
Look at this stuff.

47
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:54,356
You sure it's not stolen?

48
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:55,723
I am not a common thief.

49
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:56,956
I assure you.

50
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,856
I was rearranging
our storeroom and I

51
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,489
thought it prudent to
clear out the clutter.

52
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:03,023
But some of this seems
worth hanging onto.

53
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:06,089
The only thing I will hang
onto is a fierce loyalty

54
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:08,923
to my fellow man and an
uncommonly generous desire

55
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:12,356
to help those in need
of my assistance.

56
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,223
Come on dad, dig in!

57
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:20,356
Halt!

58
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,356
You take advantage
of my goodwill!

59
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,323
Suffer!

60
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:25,623
Then perhaps I
will bestow my pit.

61
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:26,989
Oh, you don't say?

62
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,956
We'll see who's going to suffer.

63
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,089
Honestly Ranma.

64
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:34,923
Really.

65
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:36,223
Get off of each other you two.

66
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:40,423
Hmm, I wonder
what this could be.

67
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:44,923
Oh Kuno, how much are
you asking for this box?

68
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:46,256
Oh, that?

69
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,956
Well, seeing as you're
Akane Tendo's sister,

70
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:50,823
someday you will likely
be my sister-in-law.

71
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:54,123
So I would be honored if
you'd take it free of--

72
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,256
Like that's ever
going to happen.

73
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,023
Thanks.

74
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:58,823
That was very kind of you.

75
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:00,589
It'll need a good
cleaning though.

76
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:04,089
Huh?

77
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:11,223
What mysterious drawings.

78
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:13,123
They're definitely
not playing cards.

79
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:15,489
And they don't look like
any tarot cards I've seen.

80
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,956
If Kuno was selling a bunch
of valuable stuff maybe

81
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:19,656
you could have done
better for yourself

82
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:20,723
than those moldy cards.

83
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:21,723
Hmm?

84
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,223
How could you do that to me?

85
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,456
I'll forgive you
if you put this on.

86
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,856
You're the one who should
be begging for forgiveness.

87
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:30,823
What's the matter? having
trouble with your aim?

88
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:33,756
I'm going to get
you you old freak!

89
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:34,356
Ah!

90
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:38,556
That's it!

91
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,523
You better give in.

92
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:41,789
I think not.

93
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:43,189
I don't know what
you think you're

94
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:46,489
doing but I've had enough.

95
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:47,223
Huh?

96
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:49,356
What's this?

97
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,356
Huh?

98
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,223
Wh-- what in the
heck's going on here?

99
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,389
Happosai.

100
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,289
I can't move.

101
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,556
I'm trapped.

102
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,556
Something's wrong here.

103
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,556
Please, somebody help me.

104
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:03,923
Hey, are you OK?

105
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:04,523
Happosai!

106
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:15,523
We're too late!

107
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:16,423
Oh, this is terrible!

108
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,056
You've got a lot
of explaining to do!

109
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:39,123
Why don't you let
me explain this?

110
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:41,089
These ancient cards
have been handed down

111
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:43,256
from the ancestors
of the Kuno family

112
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:44,923
from generation to generation.

113
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:47,256
Those are the ancient
cards of the beast.

114
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,356
Yes, they're evil.

115
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,989
A long time ago
foreigners created

116
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:57,389
the ancient cards of the
beast to express their rage

117
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:58,756
against the world.

118
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:02,556
The cards react to the evil
that exists in a human heart,

119
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,089
then posses that person's
body and manifest

120
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,689
a devil in this world.

121
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:11,356
So you're saying
that these cards

122
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,489
reacted to the evil that already
existed in Happosai's mind?

123
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:17,389
Alas, what a tragic
mistake I have made.

124
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:21,323
Their deceptively harmless
appearance has fooled even me.

125
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:23,656
One good thing, at
least it was Happosai

126
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,423
the cards took as their victim.

127
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:26,823
Yeah, good point.

128
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:29,289
Oh gee, Akane.

129
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,123
We mustn't allow ourselves
to expect his safe return.

130
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:34,723
What do you mean by that?

131
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,323
A devil has possessed
Happosai's body.

132
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,956
Meaning Happosai will
become the devil himself.

133
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:42,389
And his soul will
become immortal.

134
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:45,889
He'll walk the earth
searching for new victims.

135
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,923
The world will be
veiled in darkness,

136
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:49,689
living in fear of him.

137
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:50,556
Huh?

138
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:51,289
Is this a joke?

139
00:07:57,923 --> 00:08:00,089
[evil laughter]

140
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,356
[scream]

141
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:22,589
Huh?

142
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:23,723
Did you hear that?

143
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:25,056
It came from over that way.

144
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,289
Stop right there you old prune!

145
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:32,771
Hey!

146
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:37,938
Come here you freaky pervert.

147
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:39,738
I'll take you on right here.

148
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:40,938
Ha!

149
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,738
You don't really
think you can stop me.

150
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:43,838
Stop this Happosai.

151
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,105
What do you think you're doing?

152
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:48,805
No Akane. he's not
Happosai any longer.

153
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:49,705
Look!

154
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,771
He's got an evil aura.

155
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:51,905
Very observant.

156
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:54,738
I'm the devil himself.

157
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:57,838
And the world will live to
regret the day I arrived.

158
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,371
Just wait and see for yourself.

159
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:01,571
Come back here!

160
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,438
Let me get a piece of
you, you bald old buzzard!

161
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:10,738
There you are.

162
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,705
So you've finally
shown yourself.

163
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:14,171
My wait is over.

164
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:18,905
Now I will end your
misery and save the world.

165
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,338
Blue thunder, or whatever
you call yourself,

166
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:25,038
do you honestly have what
it takes to defeat me?

167
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:26,305
Most certainly.

168
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:29,938
Feel the wrath of
Kuno's justice.

169
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:30,771
Righty ho then.

170
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:37,471
Curses, I am beaten.

171
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:46,838
Hold on a minute.

172
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:48,805
That's a different devil.

173
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,071
This is trouble.

174
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:51,871
We can't even handle
one of those demons.

175
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:55,271
And now we've let
two of them get away.

176
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:59,871
Once again, I find myself here,
in the town where my sweet love

177
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:01,438
Akane lives.

178
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,638
Huh?

179
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,838
Who're you?

180
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,605
Ah!

181
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:09,938
Happosai, is that you?

182
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:12,671
No, it can't be.

183
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:13,571
Come on monster!

184
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:14,238
Want to fight?

185
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:26,505
Ryoga!

186
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:29,005
Are you all right?

187
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:31,038
That's the third
devil we've seen.

188
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:32,638
[woman screams]

189
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:33,905
It's coming from that way.

190
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:34,871
Let's go.

191
00:10:34,905 --> 00:10:35,471
Hurry!

192
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:40,905
He got her too.

193
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:42,471
Ranma, up there.

194
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:47,971
That's the fourth
devil we've seen now.

195
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,405
Yeah, how many more
of them are there?

196
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:52,538
Akane, Ranma,
we've got trouble.

197
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:55,338
The devils are tearing
the town to pieces.

198
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:56,305
Huh/

199
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:58,271
[screams]

200
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:00,738
Ah!

201
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:03,571
Look out!

202
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:06,538
Now this is what I call heaven.

203
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:17,405
The devil, devil night,
centaur, vampire, witch,

204
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:18,871
and fallen angel.

205
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:21,038
Six evil Happosais.

206
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:24,338
Is there any chance that
i can defeat all of them?

207
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:41,052
[laughing]

208
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,986
[scream]

209
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:51,552
Get away from me!

210
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,519
[scream]

211
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:54,919
Bring back my underwear!

212
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:02,652
There they go.

213
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:06,686
This is getting out of hand.

214
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,452
Ranma!

215
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:08,686
We've got to do something.

216
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,786
Or the whole town
will be destroyed.

217
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,152
In fact, the whole
world's in danger.

218
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:14,886
We must take action and soon.

219
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:19,152
What a haul!

220
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:20,186
Those devils.

221
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,652
They can't get away with this.

222
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:26,119
OK, I'm going after
every last one of them.

223
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:26,719
Ranma!

224
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:35,686
Incoming!

225
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:45,819
One down, five to go.

226
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,619
Looks like you're up
to bat you old freak!

227
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:54,086
That makes two.

228
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,652
Wow, that's what I call a man.

229
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:04,552
Get off!

230
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,052
Well, now you've done it.

231
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,752
A woman scorned knows no bounds.

232
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,419
Ha!

233
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:14,119
What do we have here?

234
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:15,119
What'd you do that for?

235
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:15,719
Ah!

236
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:25,152
Let go!

237
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:27,819
Let me go!

238
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:30,352
Even devils need
a piece of heaven.

239
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:32,386
The devils are
absorbing Ranma's energy.

240
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,919
At this rate Ranma's doomed.

241
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:36,019
This ain't good.

242
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:39,619
They're draining my power.

243
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,019
Ranma!

244
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:42,819
Saotome, let's do it.

245
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,452
I'm right behind you.

246
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,252
This'll be interesting.

247
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:50,852
Move!

248
00:13:57,852 --> 00:13:59,219
They're gigantic.

249
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,152
This is something I
sure wasn't counting on.

250
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:02,419
Mhm.

251
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:03,352
Ranma, Ranma!

252
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:05,019
Help's on the way.

253
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,052
Come on you guys.

254
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,252
We're counting on you!

255
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:09,052
In a life or death
case such as this

256
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,386
there's only one thing to do.

257
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:14,519
And that's give them
what they least expect.

258
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:18,486
Please, I beg you to have
mercy on our humble town.

259
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,619
Ugh, and dad calls
himself a fighter.

260
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,819
[laughing]

261
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:25,652
We might have mercy
depending on what you offer.

262
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,252
If it means saving
our town then

263
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:30,252
them please consider anything
that belongs to me as your own.

264
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,552
All right, but I won't be happy
if you go back on your word.

265
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,086
You're dealing with the devil.

266
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:37,752
And I take these
things seriously.

267
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:38,752
Yes sire.

268
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:50,419
Now a toast.

269
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:52,452
Let's celebrate with
one last blowout

270
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:55,886
together before we go out
and conquer the world.

271
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,119
I never thought our
training hall would be used

272
00:14:58,152 --> 00:14:59,419
for dining with the devils.

273
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:06,886
Huh?

274
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,052
Thank goodness,
you've finally come to.

275
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:11,319
What happened to the devils?

276
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,152
I think they've left
for the time being.

277
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:14,319
No!

278
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:15,619
Well, just wait
till they come back.

279
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,819
I'm going to do some
serious damage to them.

280
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:18,752
It won't work.

281
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,752
Those are devils
we're up against.

282
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,552
Martial arts won't
stop those guys.

283
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:27,919
Hey Ryoga, can you think of
any ideas that might work?

284
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:29,252
Hmm--

285
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:33,652
I know Akane Tendo, the
two of us can run away.

286
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:37,352
You're the one who started this
whole thing in the first place!

287
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:39,419
Man, this is really rough.

288
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:41,919
If it was normal human beings
we were up against then

289
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:44,452
I know I could get them
with my fighting skills.

290
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,319
But they're devils from the
ancient cards of the beast.

291
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:50,986
Also, there's six of them.

292
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,252
Oh!

293
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:55,452
The ancient cards of the beast.

294
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:57,786
A long time ago
foreigners created

295
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:00,786
the ancient cards of the
beast to express their rage

296
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:01,886
against the world.

297
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,552
They're the ancient
cards of the beast huh?

298
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:10,119
Uh--

299
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:11,086
That's enough.

300
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,052
You're hurting my ears.

301
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:13,252
Get off the stage.

302
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,786
Snoozer, snoozer!

303
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:18,086
Can't you think of some
other performance you can do?

304
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,319
I'm so sorry.

305
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,952
This is our only number.

306
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:25,152
Well maybe it's time to
move on to that other thing.

307
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:27,119
You mean you want more?

308
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,419
Yeah, seeing as I've come
all the way here to earth,

309
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:33,052
I figured I might as well
get myself a human wife.

310
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:33,919
What?

311
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,019
You want a wife?

312
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:35,786
K--K--K--Kasumi!

313
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:44,552
Akane!

314
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,119
Ranma!

315
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:45,886
Where are you?

316
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,652
Can you hear me?

317
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:47,168
Huh?

318
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:47,801
What?

319
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,068
Nabiki?

320
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,368
Akane, we've got trouble.

321
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:53,101
The devil's got Kasumi.

322
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:53,701
Huh?

323
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:00,068
There she is, over there.

324
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:00,668
Ha!

325
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:01,150
Ha!

326
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,750
Ha!

327
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:02,583
Ha!

328
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,583
This calls for a special toast.

329
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:07,316
Oh Kasumi, what have I done?

330
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,483
Don't worry about me father.

331
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,516
I take full
responsibility since I'm

332
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,716
the one who bought those cards.

333
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,198
Ha!

334
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:14,798
Ha!

335
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:15,280
Ha!

336
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:15,980
Ha!

337
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:16,614
Scrub me.

338
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:17,414
Oh Kasumi.

339
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,780
I can't take this anymore.

340
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:25,414
We've got to find
some way to stop them.

341
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:26,947
Hey, what happened to Ranma?

342
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,647
Huh?

343
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,780
Jeez, I'll go find him.

344
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:34,147
Huh, must've gotten
scared and bolted.

345
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,314
Akane, you can rest
assured that I'm

346
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,514
going to find a way to drive
those devils out of town.

347
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:42,214
Uh, Ryoga--

348
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:43,280
Yo devils!

349
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:45,680
Party's over!

350
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:46,880
After him!

351
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:56,214
Ryoga.

352
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:58,547
Well, if it isn't
another beautiful wife.

353
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,480
Back off.

354
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:01,147
This one belongs to me.

355
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,747
Ugh.

356
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,514
[scream]

357
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,114
Ranma!

358
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:08,714
Akane!

359
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:15,447
This time I'm not going
to let you get your way.

360
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,347
Ranma.

361
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,614
Not this brat again.

362
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,147
He's a stubborn one.

363
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,647
Do you really think that you
can defeat all of us devils?

364
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,380
I don't know about that.

365
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:27,280
But I do know that
these cards are

366
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,147
pretty important to you devils.

367
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,147
Bah!

368
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,547
And if I did something
like burn them,

369
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,914
then you guys would disappear.

370
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:37,947
Don't do it!

371
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,180
Seems my theory was correct.

372
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,847
I've had enough of you.

373
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,614
Ah!

374
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:53,214
Oh no!

375
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:54,114
Ha! ha!

376
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:54,980
ho!

377
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:55,462
Ha!

378
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:57,529
Ha!

379
00:18:57,562 --> 00:18:59,529
Now you can't touch us.

380
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:00,496
get him!

381
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:02,029
Just try evil freaks.

382
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:12,762
You won't escape kachu
tenshin amaguriken.

383
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:14,962
[wailing]

384
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,896
That just leaves
you to take care of.

385
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,862
Take this brat!

386
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:33,362
Ranma!

387
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,429
Watch it!

388
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,529
Feisty one aren't you,
you red-haired vixen.

389
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:43,762
Oh my, I hope that didn't hurt.

390
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,296
Nice move.

391
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:49,896
Don't hurry back to
visit us now, you hear?

392
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,062
Oh Saotome, at last
this nightmare is over.

393
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,129
So we finally managed
to get rid of them all.

394
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:01,729
I was starting to think we were
going to be stuck with them.

395
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:02,962
[groaning]

396
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:05,529
Well well, look who's woken up.

397
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:06,862
Hey, where'd the devils go?

398
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:09,729
They all went up in smoke.

399
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:10,662
All right!

400
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:11,962
That's terrific!

401
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:13,329
Things couldn't have
turned out any better.

402
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:13,929
Mhm.

403
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,129
Mhm.

404
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:16,296
What's that?

405
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:16,896
Look!

406
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:23,329
I told you Ranma, I'm immortal.

407
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:26,462
And if you value your life
you'll do exactly as I say.

408
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,462
How come he came back?

409
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,229
And the first thing I'm
going to command you to do

410
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:36,229
is put on this bra.

411
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:37,429
Hmm?

412
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:40,729
Hurry up and put it on
before I lose my patience.

413
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:41,896
Hang on.

414
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,062
Hey, what's this?

415
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,896
Unless I'm mistaken, I'd
say it was the devil's tail.

416
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:53,496
Huh?

417
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:54,696
What's going on?

418
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:57,229
How did I end up
here in this room?

419
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,196
Ah!

420
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,496
Now I remember.

421
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:02,429
The devil possessed me and
I had absolutely no control

422
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,729
over my mind.

423
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,996
Ranma Saotome, is that you?

424
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:09,229
And Soun and Genma, what
are you all doing here?

425
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:12,762
Master I'm relieved to see
that you're back safe and sound.

426
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:15,229
Yo, are you sure that
devil hadn't already

427
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:18,762
left you by the time you
woke up a little while ago?

428
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:22,029
No, I was possessed
until you hit me just now.

429
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:22,729
Honest.

430
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:24,096
Yeah right, then here.

431
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,796
Maybe this will
dispossess even more.

432
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:29,462
In other words, it doesn't
matter whether or not

433
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,062
Happosai is actually possessed.

434
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:33,462
He just can't help
but always play

435
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:34,796
the part of a little devil.

436
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:37,296
Tell the world my story!

437
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,337
[theme music playing]

438
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:18,164
Ryoga comes back
from a training trip

439
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,998
and surprises every one.

440
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,298
What is this new technique
that he's learned?

441
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:26,231
Next time on Ranma 1/2, From
the Depth of Despair Part One.

442
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:28,631
We'll see you there.
