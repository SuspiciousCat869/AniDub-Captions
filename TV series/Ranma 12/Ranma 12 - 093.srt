limited to a single school.

It was during the
feudal era of Japan

that the art first
came to prominence.

who combined aspects

the next heir, we're finished.

-That I am the sole heir
of the Daimonji School

108
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,900
is my own bad luck.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,533
My most important duty at
this point is to find a bride

110

it's also the way

meeting is the marriage.

-I mean, is it so wrong of me to
want some choice in the matter?

Which is why the chance
encounter with you

134
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,933
was so fortunate.

135
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,766
First, you'll defeat Grandmama.

136
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:38,400
And then--

137
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,600
-Wait a sec.

-So she's to beat me, is she?

140

Before she does
that, perhaps she

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,533
should know that I've yet to
be defeated, and that further,

142
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:57,933
your Grandmama should
find it surprising indeed

143

to be bested by a girl who
takes rides from strange horses.

Ah, you're upset.

If you can't keep
your temper now,

how can you be expected to
control yourself in battle?

-You let me worry about that.

148
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:13,233
-I really think it's better if--

149
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,733
-I don't what you think,
and neither should Sentaro.

150
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,466
-My, you're a feisty one.

151
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:21,300

After consulting
the usual sources,

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,266
an appropriate date will
be set, at which time

160
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:44,066
your aptitude for tea ceremony
will determine cancellation

00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,333
-Oh, however shall I repay you?

167
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,733
No, not like that.

168
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,333
Like this.

169
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:06,200
Before I can teach
you the Way of Tea,

170
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,633
first you must learn the basics.

171
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,266
-Not if I forfeit first.

172
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:12,300
-Just think.

173
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,200
In as little as a
week's time, you and I

174
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,266
may already be living
as man and wife.

175
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:21,966
-You're going to make me do
this the hard way, aren't you?

176
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,433
-[gasp]

177
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:27,866
-Ah.

178
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,400
You see now, don't you?

179
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,133
Why it wouldn't work.

180

[whimpering]

181
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,333

RANMA: Oh, there you go
with the boohoo again.

185
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:51,600
-If you were a guy, then why'd
you accept the challenge?

186
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,733
-I was ambushed.

187
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,166
-Now what?

188
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,666
Who can I find who'll be able--

189
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:57,533
GRANDMAMA: You there!

190
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:01,200
Where do you think you're going?

191
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,533
-(PANTING) Don't you lie to me.

192
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,833
I know what I saw.

193
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:06,133
Ranma's here somewhere,
and I'm gonna find him.

194
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,000
-Akane, what are
you doing here--

195
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,466
-Ranma, are you OK?

196
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:10,733
-Yeah, I'm fine.

197
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,766
Hey!

198
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,366
-My tea swizzle.

199
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,566
You found it.

200
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,966
I've been so worried.

201
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,566
-It was right where
you threw it at me.

202
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:23,233
-And you came all this way to
return it to me personally.

203
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,233
-Mm, now, wait.

204
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,000
-Oh!

205
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,933
How can I ever repay you?

206
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:28,474
-Ugh!

207
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,900
SENTARO: I-- I don't
know what came over me.

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,900
If I may, there's a favor I'd
like to ask of you, as a woman.

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,833
-As a woman?

211
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,333
[sigh]

AKANE: Ah!

215
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:15,145
Would you really prefer me for
the tea ceremony over Ranma?

216
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:18,579
Well, it does make more sense,
when you think about it.

217
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,112
-It does?

218
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:20,912
-That's great.

219
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,779
I'm sure you're very graceful.

220
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,279
-We are talking about
the same person, right?

221
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,579
-Oh, shut up, Ranma.

222
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,479
I learned from Kasumi.

223
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,445
What do you care, anyway?

224
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:31,912
RANMA: [laughs] I just can't
believe it, that's all.

225
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,312
You're k-kidding, right?

226
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:34,379
AKANE: Fine, then.

227
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,545
I'll show you.

228
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,312
SENTARO (VOICEOVER):
She knows tea ceremony

229
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:39,045
and she's beautiful.

230
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:41,545
It's too good to be true.

231
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:43,812
She'll make a fine bride.

232
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:50,645
[howls with frustration]

233
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:55,212
-Excuse me, what was that
you were saying about grace?

234
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:59,179
--[groans] But
she's so beautiful.

235
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,945
-Uh, Akane, you let
me take care of this.

236
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:04,512
You go sight-see, and
I'll do the tea thing.

237
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:06,479
-You will, Ranma?

238
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:07,379
-OK.

239
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:10,379
You got a better idea?

240
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:13,445
Look, if you want to risk
your freedom on Godzilla here

241
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:14,979
making tea, go ahead.

242
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,479
Go right ahead.

243
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,379
-One more word and so help me--

244
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:21,312
-But you're not a girl, though.

245
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:23,345
-What's important is to win.

246
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:25,345
It don't matter if I'm a guy.

247
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,379
-In that case, I accept.

248
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,479
But I'm warning you.

249
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:31,612
Just because I'm
taking you as champion,

250
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:34,779
do not think I'm going
to take you as my bride.

251
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,912
-For both our sakes,
I'm going to pretend

252
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:38,479
I didn't hear you say that.

253
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,612
SENTARO: Martial
Arts Tea Ceremony

254
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:45,912
is based on one thing-- sitting.

255
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:47,779
RANMA: OK.

256
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,212
-One must remain
in this position.

257
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,979
-This room's really long.

258
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,812
SENTARO: In fact, the entire
battle is conducted from it.

259
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:02,512
-Mm-hm.

260
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:06,479

263
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:15,145
How does he do it?

00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,079
[grunting with effort]

265
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:20,379
-You're doing it the wrong way.

266
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:23,479
-If-- if I can keep
up, what do you care?

267
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,045
-Oh, I don't care.

268
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:26,979
But I think perhaps you will.

269
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,079
-Aaah!

270
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,912
-Do I make myself clear?

RANMA: Where is she?

276
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:52,145
-So she cannot even
sit properly, can she?

277
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:54,345
-How in the world's
she doing that?

278

-[laughs]

What is she, half bat?

00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:02,745

tomorrow's duel at this rate.

-Tomorrow?

283

-For the right to
choose your own wife,

284

it's tomorrow or never.

285

Unless you'd rather
I chose for you.

286
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,145
-But Grandmama, you promised I--

287
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:18,212
-Then you'd best be sure to take
advantage of the time you have.

288
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:22,879
You're the one you wanted
the jewel, my boy, not me.

289
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:26,179
If you still intend to marry

the horseys already?

I'll see you tomorrow.

-Aha.

296
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:46,912
I get it.

297
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,845
The secret's in using the toes.

298
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:49,812
That's it.

There's plenty more
where those came from.

without dropping it?

If you can't learn patience,
you may as well stop trying.
