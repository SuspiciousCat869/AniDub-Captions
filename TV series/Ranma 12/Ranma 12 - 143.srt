to, my sweet Shampoo?

00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,962
Shampoo, where are you?

00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:46,395
At least answer me, Shampoo.

Oh, there you are, you
naughty little vixen.

Oh, Shampoo!

That's where you were.

She hasn't come
back from a delivery

I sent her on this morning.

But it's already
late in the afternoon.

No.

left to make a delivery here?

Nope.

111
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:58,969
But I'm not fooling around.

I know you.

You're Maomolin,
that spirit who's

136
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,436
been looking for a bride
for over 3,000 years

137
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,503
but could never find even
a single woman to accept

138
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,869
your proposal because you're
just a good for nothing,

Hey!

141
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,703
You're blowing my cover, girl.

142
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,236
You did this to her?

143
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,403
[laughter]

144
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:52,003
I've made myself the
temple master here.

145
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:56,069
Shampoo will never be
able to escape from me.

146
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:57,803
You hideous monster!

147
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,969
Why are you keeping
my Shampoo from me?

148
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,469
The obvious!

149
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:05,103
I've trapped Shampoo in my
temple to make her my bride!

150
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,936
That flea bag just doesn't
know when to give up.

151
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,003
Shampoo!

152
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,469
Tell me it ain't so.

[sigh]

154
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:14,036
Shampoo must stay
this temple and be

155
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,936
stuck with evil monster cat.

156
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,869
Oh, this terrible tragedy!

[laughter]

158
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:26,103
Isn't there some way
to break the spell?

159
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,369
Only one way break spell.

160
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:29,203
No.

161
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:30,503
Nothing will break the spell.

162
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:32,303
What?

163
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:32,785
Listen.

164
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:38,636
[scream]

165
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:43,969
Glad you could make it.

What you say now?

171
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:58,569
Call for your uncle?

172
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:00,203
Uncle!

173
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,403
But it's too late now.

174
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:05,603
Because I cast the
spell on you the instant

175
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:07,036
you stepped into the temple.

176
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,303
What you talk about?

177
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,936
I'm the only one who
can break the spell.

178
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:13,903
I'll never let you
leave this temple again.

179
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:17,803
You'll stay here
and become my bride.

180
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:19,169
[scream]

181
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,003
Hitting me won't
change anything.

182
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,136
[stick dropping]

183
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:24,618
Huh?

184
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,403
Why so quiet?

185
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:31,903
No resist.

186
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:33,069
Huh?

187
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:35,869
Shampoo stop
resisting her destiny.

188
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,836
I knew you'd come around.

189
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:40,703
But Shampoo no become cat wife.

190
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:42,869
Shampoo choose this fate.

191
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,069
[scream]

192
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:45,569
No!

193
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:46,436
Don't do it!

194
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,736
You're too lovely!

195
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,369
And I don't want to start
searching for another bride!

196
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,469
Please!

197
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,536
If cat feel that way,
then let Shampoo go.

198
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,669
You're taking tough
love to new heights.

199
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:57,636
[whimpering]

200
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:58,936
Tell me what you want.

201
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,336
Anything!

202
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:04,436
Shampoo have young prince
she deep in love with.

203
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:07,169
If Shampoo get
kiss from that man,

204
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:11,303
then Shampoo want ghost
cat to break magic spell.

205
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:12,036
[groan]

206
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,869
I can't do that.

207
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,003
[gasp]

208
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,403
That leave Shampoo one choice.

209
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:18,403
[scream]

210
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:19,103
All right!

211
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:20,603
I'll go along with it.

212
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:21,836
OK.

213
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,136
Then chop-chop and
make deal official.

214
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,236
You're a tough cookie.

215
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:30,136
This requires snake
eye concentration.

216
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:34,369
[meowing]

217
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,236
Oh, Ranma, my prince.

218
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,036
Hurry and rescue Shampoo
form this temple.

219
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:47,969
Huh.

220
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:50,169
I don't think so.

221
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:53,536
Ranma, you help Shampoo
and give big kiss on lips.

222
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:54,703
Wait!

223
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:55,903
What kind of deal's
that, Shampoo?

224
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,503
Shampoo can no change spell.

225
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,503
Now official.

226
00:08:58,536 --> 00:08:59,836
But you're the one
who suggested it.

227
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:01,736
Why'd you rope
Ranma into it for?

228
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,303
Hi-ya!

229
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:06,336
You want Shampoo to
explain real reason?

230
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:07,303
Jeez!

231
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:09,036
Would you two knock
it off already?

232
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,703
Shampoo, I'm your
handsome prince,

233
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:14,469
and I'm here to break the
magic spell cast on you!

234
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:16,803
You no handsome prince.

235
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,736
My love!

236
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:19,703
[ringing]

237
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,169
Huh?

238
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:22,403
[scream]

239
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:29,103
Oh, good, cats!

240
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:34,003
[humming]

241
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,003
Yoo-hoo!

242
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,069
What's going on?

243
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:41,403
Something happen to you, Ranma?

244
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:42,003
Huh?

245
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,969
A herd of cats.

246
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:46,669
My, so you left Shampoo
back there at the temple

247
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:47,836
after the cats mauled you?

248
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,169
Yeah, sort of.

249
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:51,269
You ran away with your
tails between your legs.

250
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:53,803
So much for your backgrounds
in martial arts, you two.

251
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:56,336
We can rescue her
tomorrow or something.

252
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:59,369
Ranma, can't you grow up
and be a man just this one?

253
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:00,336
Lousy ghost cat.

254
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:03,769
I won't let him
get away with this.

255
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,336
The ghost cat?

256
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:06,403
You called?

257
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:06,869
Huh?

258
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:07,536
[scream]

259
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:09,736
That cat!

260
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:10,936
How'd it get in here?

261
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,503
You're Maomolin--
the cat that's

262
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:14,503
been looking for a bride
for over 3,000 years

263
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:17,836
but can't find anyone crazy
enough to accept his proposal.

264
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:18,869
Uh-huh.

265
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:21,669
I forgot to mention something.

266
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:22,969
Good timing.

267
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:25,403
We've got something
to ask you, ghost cat.

268
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:26,403
What's that?

269
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:28,636
Is kissing Ranma
the only way Shampoo

270
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,903
can break that magic spell?

271
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:33,336
Ah, a kiss, huh?

272
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:33,803
Oh, my.

273
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:34,836
Oh, my.

274
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,369
[groan]

275
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,036
Why is it that Ranma always
gets the most enviable jobs,

276
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:40,036
and the rest of us are
left with the crud?

277
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:45,269
Dad, will you two
stay out of this?

278
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:46,169
Huh?

279
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,603
Ghost cat, what's your answer?

280
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:50,403
Let me explain a few things.

281
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:53,369
Take a seat.

282
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,503
By the time the temple
bell rings 108 times

283
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,903
tonight, if she's not
kissed by her prince,

284
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,369
she will never
escape from my temple

285
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:02,503
and will be completely
and permanently a cat

286
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,003
and can never turn
into a human again.

287
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:05,969
[laughter]

288
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:07,103
AKANE: You're not serious!

00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:09,536

serious to me.

290
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,036
GIRL: Oh, what a cute kitty.

291
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,736
So stay away from
the temple tonight.

292
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,236

293
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,936
Huh?

294
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:18,336
Stay away from me, cat.

295
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:19,636

Powder?

299
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:30,869
Ah.

300
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,403
Ranma, are you OK?

00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:34,869

busting into our house

There's no reason to be afraid.

be helped, Shampoo.

The scent of

What do you think of this plan?

412

What if you took off those
stinky catnip clothes

413
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:44,923
and went in the temple
in other clothes?

414

Then maybe you could get in
without the cats licking you

Huh?

[groan]

519
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:11,456
Listen!

520
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:12,723
The sound of the bell.

521
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:13,456
Oh, no.

522
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,489
I forgot Shampoo!

523
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:16,089
Hi-ya!

524
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:16,723
[gasp]

525
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:17,723
Shampoo!

526
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,723
[gasp]

527
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:22,489
Look!

528
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:23,656
She's got cat ears.

529
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,023
No, wait!

00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:44,064
[bell]

531
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:46,030
Huh?

532
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:47,297
Ah.

533
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,564
Shampoo will turn
completely into a cat.

534
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:50,530
[gasp]

535
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,664
I don't want to say this.

536
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:55,764
[groan]

537
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:58,430
But just this once,
I'll let you kiss her.

538
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,497
Ranma, hurry and kiss her.

539
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,664
But what about the cats?

540
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:04,030
Forget the cats
and kiss Shampoo!

541
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:04,630
63.

542

Five, six.

544
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,664
He's striking the
bell faster and faster.

545
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:11,630
Lousy cheater.

546
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:12,397
Oh, no!

547
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,164
Look at Shampoo!

Ranma!

553
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,564
What's taking you so long?

554
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,230
74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.

[sigh]

556
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:28,864
Akane, Mousse, kick my
back as hard as you can.

557
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:29,864
What?

558
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:30,697
Just do it!

559
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,364
Hurry!

560
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,930
All right, Ranma.

561
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:35,130
Here goes nothing.

That makes 107.

That smarts.

The cat.

Just in time.

579
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:15,397
The spell's been broken.

580
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,564
Ranma, one more kiss.

581
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:24,364
How dare you kiss
my Shampoo, Ranma!

582
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:28,064
Just in the nick of
time, eh, Shampoo?

583
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:29,197
Meow!

584
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,030
Another keeper,
and she got away.

585
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:37,030

AKANE (VOICEOVER): As the
spring slowly fades into summer,

589
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:22,441
a stranger comes, asking
Ranma to grant a dying wish.

590
00:23:22,474 --> 00:23:24,541
Are you sure you're
going through with this?

591
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:28,574
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Run Away with Me, Ranma.

592
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:29,608
We'll see you there.
