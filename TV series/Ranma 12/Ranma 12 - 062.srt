3
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:28,589
-Master, please be fair Why
do you have to eat my food?

4
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:32,823
I-- I take it back.

5
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:35,089
In fact, why not
eat the whole thing?

6
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:39,756
-OK, baby.

7
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:42,623
Now say, "ah."

8
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,389
-It's the chance of a lifetime.

9
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,656
Can you afford to miss out?

10
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:49,489
Win an all expense
paid trip to China!

11
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:50,989
-It could happen.

12
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:54,223
-Many will enter, but
only one will win.

13
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,589
So be sure to send in
your application as soon

14
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:57,723

WOMAN (ON TELEVISION):
And we'll see you there.

16
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,189
-Hm, China, huh?

17
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:04,197
-Hm.

18
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:05,689
Hm.

19
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:06,723
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Fight!

The Anything Goes

21
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,356
-Who invited you guys anyway?

22
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,589
Go home!

23
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:33,589
-Jee, Ranma.

24
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,189
Hadn't it ever
occurred to you that I

25
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,089
might like to go
visit China too?

26
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:37,923
-That's right.

27
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:38,923
As would I.

28
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:39,464
-Mhm.

29
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:40,656
Mhm.

30
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:42,756
-China's just full
of pretty ladies

31
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,523
who would love to see me again.

32
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:45,456
How can I stay away?

33
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:45,997
--Uh-huh.

34
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:47,956
Sure.

35
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:48,723
-Hi, Ranma.

36
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:49,956
-Sh-- Sh-- Shampoo.

37
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:53,589
-Shampoo go wherever Ranma go.

38
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:56,056
-And wherever Shampoo
goes, I too go as well.

39
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:59,523
-Aw, why don't you
invite the neighborhood?

40
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:01,189
Kuno and Kodachi.

41
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,589
-Bonjour, my dear rival.

42
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:08,189
-Ranma Saotome,
the rival of Kuno.

43
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,523
Never.

44
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:14,656
-You know you have no hope
of beating him, brother dear.

45
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,289
-I'll get you for that.

46
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,089
-You and what army?

47
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:21,589
-Whoa, what do you know?

48
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:23,356
It's Ryoga!

49
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:24,189
You made it in time.

50
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:24,756
I'm impressed.

51
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:34,756
-I left the minuet I saw
it advertised on the TV.

52
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:37,823
-Jee, what's your reason
for going to China?

53
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,589
-What do you think, jerk?

54
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,523
I'm gonna find
Jusenkyo, and then I'm

55
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:45,456
gonna undo the damage from
that stupid, lousy spring.

56
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:48,723
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Great
minds think alike, I guess.

57
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:49,989
-OK, everyone.

58
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,156
Are you ready to begin the
Anything Goes Martial Arts

59
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:54,589
Obstacle Course Race?

60
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,489
Are you all ready
to go to China?

61
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:01,889
-Let's go!

62
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:03,156
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!

63
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:06,989
-Whoa.

64
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,189
Seems like he wants to
go even more than me.

65
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,556
-Are we ready to begin?

66
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:11,889
-Yeah!

67
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:14,456
-The first thing you do is
enter the giant sorting wheel,

68
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,323
where, depending on
which gate you choose,

69
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:18,289
you'll either qualify
or disqualify.

70
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,156
-This one too easy.

71
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:38,723
-Sh-- Shampoo!

72
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:48,323
W-- wait up, Shampoo.

73
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:49,589
I'm right behind you.

74
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,723
-Hey, hey.

75
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,123
What the heck's this?

76
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:03,623
Genma, Soun, let's run
on straight through.

77
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:04,589
-Yes, Master.

78
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:11,923
-Piece of cake.

79
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:15,456
Hey, what happened to Soun?

80
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:17,323
-Spindle [? fold. ?]

81
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:18,389
-You miserable worm.

82
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:20,689
How dare you call
yourself my disciple.

83
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:21,823
Why, I oughtta--

84
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,889
-Now, now.

85
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:26,756
I Let's keep things
friendly, shall we?

86
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:27,956
-My thoughts exactly.

87
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,723
-Disqualified.

88
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:30,264
-Hey.

89
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:34,397
-Hm?

90
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:35,256
Hm?

91
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:37,323
Hm?

92
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:40,223
KODACHI (VOICEOVER): All alone
with Ranma darling in the dark.

93
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,623
KUNO (VOICEOVER):
Akane Tendo, such pains

94
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:47,789
you've taken to get me alone.

95
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,423
Your innocent machinations
shall not go for naught.

96
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:53,556
In fact, I myself shall
take you into my arms.

97
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,123
-Curse you, Ranma Saotome.

98
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,756
How very like you to
tag long and impose

99
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:03,789
where you're not wanted.

100
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:04,756
-Oh yeah?

101
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:06,389
Look how's talking,
Bushido butt!

102
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,623
-Akane Tendo, how
very like you to barge

103
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:11,989
in on our longed for love tryst.

104
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:12,889
-Love tryst?

105
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,156
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
Don't worry, Akane.

106
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:22,856
There's no need to be afraid
with me here to hold you.

107
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,356
Ryoga, you lady killer, you.

108
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:26,123
I can't believe
you just said-- uh?

109
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:35,589
-And here, ladies and
gentlemen, it's truly a sink

110
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,423
or swim situation.

111
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,223
Carnivorous dinosaurs,
erupting volcanoes--

112
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:44,289
if you think you're up
to it, swim to shore now.

113
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:45,523
-Pah.

114
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:48,189
Such things are mere child's
play to Tatewaki Kuno.

115
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,389
-You said it.

116
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:51,356
-Wait for me.

117
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:57,297
-Why you!

118
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,089
Jeez, why'd they even bother?

119
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,923
-My love, you've
come to be with me.

120
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:18,689
Your loyalty rivals
that of Akane Tendo.

121
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,189
Aye, but here's the rub.

122
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,756
How can I accept support of only
one of you, when both are so--

123
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:29,589
-Yeah, right.

124
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:30,489
-Ranma darling?

125
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:32,689
Ranma darling, where are you?

126
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,289
You tell me what
you've done with him,

127
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,223
you hateful, hateful girl.

128
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:37,889
Tell me before I--

129
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,156
-Aw, come on.

130
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:41,956
-How dare you menace
the pig-tailed girl.

131
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:46,123
Sister or no, I cannot allow it.

132
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:49,056
-I'd like to see you
stop me, brother dear.

133
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:49,597
-Indeed.

134
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:00,023
-Akane, look out!

135
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,023
Bakusai Tenketsu!

136
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:08,456
-Ryoga, you saved me.

137
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,489
-Well--

138
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,823
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Not bad, pig boy.

139
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:13,364
-Huh?

140
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:13,864
What?

141
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:14,371
Hey?

142
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,830
Hey?

143
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,289
A hot spring.

144
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:22,256
-To me, twisted sister.

145
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:23,889
-En garde, brother dear.

146
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:24,856
-What is that?

147
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,889
-Ranma darling, you've come
to your loving Kodachi.

148
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:39,289
-Ranma Saotome, what have you
done with the pig-tailed girl?

149
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,723
-Lay one finger on
him, brother dear,

150
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:44,656
and you'll have to answer to me.

151
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:47,856
-I may change,
but they never do.

152
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:49,723
-Well, as if I even care.

153
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,956
Ryoga, come on.

154
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:51,497
-OK.

155
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:54,856
-Wait up.

156
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:56,423
-Not so fast, Saotome.

157
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:59,156
Hand over the pig-tailed girl.

158
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:00,889
-Ranma darling, go on ahead.

159
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:02,689
I'll take care of him.

160
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,889
-Yeah, thanks.

161
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:05,423
-Yield.

162
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,156
-I will not.

163
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:11,123
ANNOUNCER: And another
two disqualified.

164
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:12,889
-Where's the exit?

165
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,556
-Something's wrong.

166
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,523
I feel like we've been
running around in circles.

167
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:21,123
-Jee, Akane, what
gives you that idea?

168
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:27,556
-See you.

169
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:30,689
-Ranma, you're not
gonna leave me, are you?

170
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,989
-But, Akane, I thought
you were with Ryoga today.

171
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,956
-Who needs a coward
like him, anyway?

172
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:37,923
Right, Akane?

173
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:41,656
RANMA:Hah.

174
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,556
-But didn't you?

175
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:44,123
-What?

176
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:44,664
Go ahead?

177
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,123
Why should I, when
the exit's right here?

178
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:50,689
Thanks, Akane.

179
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:57,223
-Maybe we don't want
your thanks, OK?

180
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,356
You big dummy.

181
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:14,811
-Huh?

182
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:15,511
Aw, jeez.

183
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:16,578
Now which way do I go?

184
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,178
-A dead end?

185
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:22,311
-Oh no.

186
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,378
-So now what, Ryoga?

187
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:25,511
-We-- we go back.

188
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:26,745
ANNOUNCER: Sorry, contestants.

189
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:27,711
No can do.

190
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:28,311
-Hey.

191
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:28,852
-No.

192
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:29,511
Fair!

193
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:30,711
-So what do we do, then?

194
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:32,445
Either way, you'll
disqualify us.

195
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,011
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): The
rest of my life as a pig.

196
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,245
ANNOUNCER: Ready to surrender?

197
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,678
Just say the word, and
we'll lead you out of there.

198
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:44,011
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Can you
live like this, Ryoga Hibiki?

199
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:45,945
You can't, can you?

200
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:48,545
Whatever It takes, you've
gotta get to China.

201
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,645
Just get that plane
ticket Jusenkyo,

202
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:53,411
and you've still got a chance
to be rid of the pig forever.

203
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:54,811
Isn't that what you want?

204
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:55,352
Isn't it?

205
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:59,645
-Yes, that is what I want!

206
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:01,845
And I'm gonna get it
too, no matter what!

207
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:03,211
-R-- Ryoga?

208
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:03,752
-Akane?

209
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:05,711
I-- I--

210
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:06,845
-Huh?

211
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:11,411
-I just wanna say that I
know a way out of here.

212
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:11,952
-What?

213
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:15,919
-Huh?

214
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,178
ANNOUNCER: Good job, contestant.

215
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,511
Not only do you qualify,
you're in the lead.

216
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,145
-Way to go!

217
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,978
-Sh-- Shampoo!

218
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:35,411
-Shampoo?

219
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,811
-Ranma.

220
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:38,978
Shampoo never leave you.

221
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:40,111
-Come on, you don't gotta--

222
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:45,211
-Ranma, you take your
hands off my Shampoo.

223
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:46,478
-Who you calling Shampoo?

224
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,445
-Who you calling Ranma?

225
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:49,611
-Hm?

226
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:50,411
Oh.

227
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:51,578
If it isn't Ryoga and Akane.

228
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:52,978
-Ryoga, no fair, man.

229
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:55,811
You can't just break
through walls like that.

230
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:56,511
-Oh yeah?

231
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:57,645
Well, who says I can't?

232
00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:58,411
ANNOUNCER: He can.

233
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,378
He can.

234
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,011
You've got a lot
of spirit, kids.

235
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,245
You all qualify.

236
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:04,345
Are you ready for the
next exciting round?

237
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,311
-So, Nabiki, how are they doing?

238
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:25,845
-Well, at this point,
Akane, Ranma, Mousse, Ryoga,

239
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:28,311
and Shampoo are still
hanging in there.

240
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:28,878
-Oh dear.

241
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:29,711
That's right.

242
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:31,411
It completely slipped my mind.

243
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:31,952
-Hm?

244
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:38,145
-What did?

245
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:40,378
-Oh, it's just that I
forgot to ask father

246
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,311
to bring home some bean paste.

247
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:42,852
-Mhm.

248
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,011
ANNOUNCER: OK, boys and girls.

249
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,578
Here's where the
real fun begins.

250
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:50,645
Only five contestants
remain in the race.

251
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:51,878
Which one will be the winner?

252
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:02,111
-I didn't scare you, did I?

253
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,811
You'll forgive me
though, won't you?

254
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,111
-Just tell us where
we gotta go next.

255
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,611
-Where you go next is
the goal at the end

256
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:10,011
of this terrifying jungle.

257
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:16,945
-Aw, man.

258
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:18,278
That's easy.

259
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:23,111
-But first, I want you new
contestants to come on down!

260
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,111
-Yay!

261
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,945
-Wh-- what the?

262
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:30,078
-We believe in nothing
if not second chances.

263
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:34,345
This way we've got a nice even
number, so you can all pair up.

264
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:37,378
-Shampoo know who
Shampoo pair with.

265
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:38,745
-I put dibs on him first.

266
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:43,045
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
Maybe Akane and I can--

267
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:49,911
-How the heck did I wind
up with a jerk like you?

268
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:52,078
-I was just gonna ask
you the same thing.

269
00:14:57,578 --> 00:14:58,178
Oh, man.

270
00:14:58,278 --> 00:14:58,945
Too close for comfort.

271
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:01,045
Eh, Ryoga?

272
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,278
You pig.

273
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,778
Why the heck didn't you duck
when the water splashed?

274
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:06,111
[squeaking]

275
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:09,345
-Ranma, Ryoga, how
are you two doing?

276
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:09,911
Huh?

277
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,811
Where's Ryoga?

278
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,278
Is that Pi-chan?

279
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,145
Ranma, how long has
Pi-chan been here?

280
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:15,945
-Look, what's that!

281
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:21,545
Good thing, I Remembered
to bring this along, huh?

282
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:22,511
-What's the big idea.

283
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,278
There was nothing there.

284
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,211
Hey, where's Pi-chan?

285
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,711
-What-- what are
you talking about?

286
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:27,345
-Pi-chan.

287
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:28,878
He was just there.

288
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:29,778
Right?

289
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,611
-Maybe he was and
maybe he wasn't.

290
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:33,711
-Stop kidding around, Dad.

291
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:36,311
He was right there,
and you know it.

292
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,511
-Give it up, Akane.

293
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:39,178
You're just imagining things.

294
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:40,278
Well, gotta go.

295
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:41,645
-Hey, wait up, you guys.

296
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:44,145
-Huh, looks like good old Ranma
saves your bacon yet again.

297
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:45,678
Eh, Pi-chan.

298
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,045
-Yeah right, Ranma.

299
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,945
-Jeez, you're an ingrate.

300
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:49,486
Alley-oop!

301
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:55,745
-Shampoo never
get what she want.

302
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:58,245
-All I wants to go
is where you go.

303
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,145
-Then go.

304
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:00,478
-Wh-- wh-- what're you're doing?

305

[quacking]

306
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:05,478
See you later.

307
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:14,711
-Hey, what happened to Mousse?

308
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:15,411
-Shampoo no know.

[quacking]

310
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,211
-Congratulations, contestants.

311
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:23,245
And allow me to present
the key to unlock your 10

312
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:24,445
handcuffed hands.

313
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:25,211
Wait a minute.

314
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,611
There's only nine of you.

315
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:29,611
I coulda sworn there's-- one,
two, three, four, five, six--

316
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:30,178
who cares?

317
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:32,545
[quacking]

318
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,645
And now for the third
and final round.

319
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:54,286
-Huh?

320
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:55,311
-Right.

321
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:56,478
Round three takes
place in this canyon.

322
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,878
While racing for
the far goal, feel

323
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,511
free to attack your partner.

324
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:02,745
However, if the balloon on
top of your head breaks,

325
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,211
you're disqualified
and out of the race.

326
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:05,811
Ready, go!

327
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:13,345
-Bet you wish you were
fighting someone else, huh?

328
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:14,345
-No, not all.

329
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:15,778
At least this way
I get to use what

330
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:18,011
I brought along in this flask.

331
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:18,611
Ooh.

332
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:19,845
Hubba, hubba.

333
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:21,145
-What do I look like?

334
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:22,278
An amateur?

335
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:25,245
Do you think I'm gonna
fall for a trick like--

336
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,311
-Pop goes the weasel.

337
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,611
See you.

338
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:31,078
I'm late for an appointment
with a man in China.

339
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:31,660
-Ow.

340
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,211
-Very well.

341
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:38,611
Since you leave me no choice,
prepare for my Special Overhand

342
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:39,378
Strike of Death.

343
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:48,152
-Huh?

344
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:53,345
-Curses, foiled again.

345
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:54,911
-We needn't fight,
need we, Saotome?

346
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:56,845
Wouldn't it be more
efficient for the two of us

347
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,245
to join forces?

348
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,211
Huh?

349
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,445
[mumbling]

350
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:04,645
-What?

351
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:06,045
ANNOUNCER: No joining forces.

352
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:07,178
You're both disqualified.

353
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:18,211
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
If I attack first,

354
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:19,611
then they'll have the advantage.

355
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:20,978
Let them make the first move.

356
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:23,645
KODACHI (VOICEOVER): I just know
those harpies'll gang up on me.

357
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:24,345
Hm.

358
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:25,311
Better to wait it out.

359
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:26,445
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER): Hah.

360
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:28,245
Shampoo wait all day to
attack if she have to.

361
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:33,111
-No attacking means no winning.

362
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,978
You're all disqualified.

363
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:38,911
And here's the moment
you've been waiting for.

364
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,545
Every one of the
other contestants

365
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:44,045
has been disqualified
except for these two.

366
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:47,245
Who will be the one to
win the ticket to China?

367
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:49,845
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): I'm going to
China no matter what it takes.

368
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:52,745
And then I'll go to Jusenkyo
and revisit that cursed spring.

369
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:55,045
And then I'll-- And
then Akane will--

370
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:57,978
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Whoa, he's
really taking this serious.

371
00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,511
-Listen up, gentleman.

372
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:00,945
While battling
your opponent, you

373
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:03,178
must also race for
that far off goal.

374
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:03,719
See?

375
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:20,545
-It's a sand drift!

376
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,145
-Bakusai Tenketsu!

377
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:42,978
-What're you-- Look,
what the heck is that?

378
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,211
-It's a giant antlion!

379
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:45,911
-Listen dude.

380
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,245
There's not much time.

381
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:49,245
While I hit it with
my chestnut fist,

382
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:53,545
use your Bakusai Tenketsu to
dig a hole and bury it, OK?

383
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:55,978
-OK.

384
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,445
-Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken!

385
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:02,345
-Bakusai Tenketsu Rapid Fire!

386
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:18,311
OK then, Ranma.

387
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:18,852
Truce over.

388
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:28,586
But--

389
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:34,678
-Gotta go.

390
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:36,611
That ticket to China's
as good as mine.

391
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:48,386
All right.

392
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:52,119
Hey!

393
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:56,945
-Hm.

394
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:59,211
-Ryoga, you little--

395
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:00,345
-Congratulations.

396
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:01,311
You did it.

397
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:03,078
The ticket to
China is all yours.

398
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:15,978
-Now where.?

399
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:19,411
-Hey, look.

400
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,878
It's Ryoga.

401
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:23,045
What are you doing here?

402
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:24,178
-I--

403
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:27,145
-I thought you'd be in
China by-- Oh, I get it.

404
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,778
You got lost again, didn't you?

405
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:29,745
-Shut up.

406
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,187
[airplane takes off]

407
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:46,913
[ending theme]

408
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:16,676
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

409
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:19,243
Ranma used that magic
mirror to go to Jusenkyo.

410
00:23:19,343 --> 00:23:22,776
Will he really be able to
go back to the way he was?

411
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:25,676
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Ranma Goes Back To Jusenkyo

412
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:29,276
At Last We'll see you there.
