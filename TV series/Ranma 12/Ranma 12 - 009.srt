NARRATOR: True Confessions,
A Girl's Hair Is Her Life

2
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:46,816
-Don't bother.

3
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,149
I really couldn't care less.

4
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:51,516
From now on, I want
nothing to do with you.

5
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,049
-(Softly) Uh.

6
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:09,549
-Huh?

7
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:26,616
-Oh, Akane.

8
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,983
-I think she's in shock.

9
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,249
-Of course she is.

10
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:42,516
Caught in public with
a haircut like that.

11
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:45,516
I bet you'd be in shock
too if it happened to you.

12
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:46,683
You should know that.

13
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,516
You're a girl too.

14
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,749
-Uh.

15
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:52,449
Sure.

16
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:53,316
Yeah.

17
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,416
A girl's hair is
her life, right?

18
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,683
CLASSMATE: Who are you anyway?

19
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:57,949
-Huh?

20
00:02:57,983 --> 00:03:00,316
-Yeah I don't remember seeing
her around here before.

21
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:01,116
-Me neither.

22
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:02,316
Well, who is she?

23
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,349
And where did Saotome go anyway?

24
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:10,983
-This is no time to be worrying
about that now you guys.

25
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,649
Right now, we need
to worry about Akane.

26
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:16,683
-Calm down.

27
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:17,783
Just relax.

28
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:22,016
Well, it's not like she
was cut or anything.

29
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,449
-She wasn't cut, but her hair
just got the cut of it's life.

30
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:37,349
Go ahead and hit me Akane.

31
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,849
I can take it.

32
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:42,449
-Hit me, too.

33
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,683
-Come on Akane, you'll
feel much better.

34
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:45,616
Go ahead.

35
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:49,149
Wack me as hard as you like.

36
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:51,416
-Hit us really hard Akane.

37
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,716
Get rid of that anger.

38
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:53,216
-Huh?

39
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,816
-Eager to please, isn't she.

40
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:17,383
-Sure is.

41
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:47,749
-Uh, I must have twisted
it when I tripped.

42
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:49,916
Guess I'll have to pay
another visit to Doctor Tofu.

43
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,116
-Huh?

44
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:09,583
[gasp]

45
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:11,449
She's even madder
than I thought.

46
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,649
DR. TOFU: All better now Akane.

47
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,383
Bye Bye.

48
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,616
-Thank you.

49
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:28,383
-You be careful
crossing the street now.

50
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,383
-Bye Bye Dr. Tofu.

51
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,249
See you later.

52
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:31,816
KASUMI: Akane?

53
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:32,816
What are you--

54
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,283
-Oh hi, Kasumi!

55
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:35,783
-Another fight Akane?

56
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:38,249
I'm terribly sorry Dr. Tofu.

57
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:39,249
-Huh?

58
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:40,349
He's no problem.

59
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,316
-I'm sorry Akane,
but sometimes I

60
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:49,949
feel like I got a
boy for a sister.

61
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,049
If you don't start acting
more like a little girl,

62
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,883
Dr. Tofu won't like you anymore.

63
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,749
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Huh?

64
00:05:55,783 --> 00:06:02,516
Maybe if I grow my hair as
Kasumi, he'll like me again.

65
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:05,916
[knocking]

66
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,583
-Thought you'd catch
me crying Ranma?

67
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:19,316
-Well, uh--

68
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,616
-Sorry to disappoint you.

69
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,716
Now, get out of here.

70
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:31,083
-Uh-oh.

71
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:48,916
-Hey, Kasumi.

72
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,349
-How was your day Akane?

73
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:02,383
-You don't have to make such
a big deal out of it Kasumi.

74
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,683
-What happened to
your hair Akane?

75
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,883
-Actually, it was--

76
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,283
-Well, I thought I'd give
myself a little haircut.

77
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:11,249
And I guess I messed
it up a bit though.

78
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:14,316
I was wondering, could you
even it out for me Kasumi?

79
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,049
RYOGA: (ANGRILY)
Curse you Saotome.

80
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,983
I don't care if I have to camp
out on the Tendo's doorstep,

81
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:23,349
we're going to finish this
fight once and for all.

82
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,516
Where?

83
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,649
Where is that stupid
house of theirs?

84
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,416
-Oh excuse me?

85
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,749
-What?

86
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:37,049
-Could you tell me how to get
to the Tanaka's residence?

87
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,149
-Huh?

88
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:40,516
-I've come to visit my
grandchild, you see,

89
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:41,916
but I'm lost.

90
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:42,916
-Don't ask me.

91
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,116
Go to the police
office and ask them.

92
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:49,149
-Just point the
way, and I'll go.

93
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:50,283
Come on Sunny.

94
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,283
Show me the way and I'll
get out of your hair.

95
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:02,183
-Guess I'd better go
tell her I'm sorry.

96
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:07,916
-She hurt her ankle
this afternoon,

97
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,416
so naturally she
went to see Dr. Tofu.

98
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,149
Did something happen
at school today?

99
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:13,949
Oh my!

100
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:21,149
-Akane Uh.

101
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:23,283
Oh, sorry thought you
were someone else.

102
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,683
-Who were you looking for?

103
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:26,983
-Huh?

104
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:30,916
-What are you looking at?

105
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,149
-Is it you?

106
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:34,616
-It's different, isn't it?

107
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,883
-Akane, I'm sorry.

108
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,283
-Gee, aren't you being
nice for a change?

109
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,616
-Well, yeah.

110
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:46,483
-It's OK.

111
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:50,349
You're off the hook.

112
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:51,549
I was going to cut it anyway.

113
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:00,749
-Hey, uh how's your ankle?

114
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,683
You want a piggy-back ride?

115
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,016
-Stop being so nice, Ranma.

116
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:04,949
You're scaring me.

117
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:13,349
-Hello there.

118
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:15,549
-Good afternoon Dr. Tofu.

119
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,216
-Hey, you're hair
is short again.

120
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:18,716
-Yes.

121
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:27,783
-Don't worry.

122
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,649
This will heal in no time.

123
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:30,849
It's not too bad.

124
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:40,983
-Dr.Tofu You like my hair?

125
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:43,116
-Oh, it's very cute.

126
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:48,249
You know short hair looks
very good on you Akane.

127
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:48,749
-I knew it.

128
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:54,549
-Hm?

129
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,383
-Oh, Akane does
it hurt that bad?

130
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,616
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:04,783
-Huh?

132
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:06,183
No.

133
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:07,183
It's not that.

134
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:10,316
It's just they won't stop.

135
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,283
-Talk to me.

136
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,216
-Dr. Tofu

137
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,149
[sobbing]

138
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:46,516
-A good cry really does
make you feel better.

139
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:51,816
Hm?

140
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:52,290
Ranma?

141
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,949
What is it?

142
00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:00,616
What's wrong?

143
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:01,949
It-- He said cute.

144
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:02,816
That's what he said.

145
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:03,949
I heard him.

146
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,983
I'm happy for you.

147
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,083
-Oh, who cares.

148
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:09,483
It's over

149
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:12,249
-Hey, what do you
mean who cares?

150
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:17,116
Dr. Tofu is in love
with Kasumi, not me.

151
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,816
It's OK though.

152
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:22,583
I think I'm finally over him.

153
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:23,049
-Wait up.

154
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:30,749
I wanted to tell you, your
hair really does look cute.

155
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,483
-Huh?

156
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:33,283
-What?

157
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:34,416
What are you looking at?

158
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:35,949
-Are you feeling OK Ranma?

159
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:37,883
-Hey, I was just trying to--

160
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:38,983
-You can cut it out now.

161
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:40,716
You don't have to cheer
me up anymore dummy.

162
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:43,083
-Oh that's not what I meant.

163
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:45,749
OK then, I take it back
about you being cute.

164
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:46,783
-Go right ahead.

165
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,049
Who cares if I'm not cute?

166
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,916
-Anyway, I like you
better in short hair,

167
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,583
not that you should
care what I say.

168
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:54,783
I'm just a dummy, right?

169
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:05,549
-Ranma, thank you, even
if you don't mean it.

170
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,049
-Woah, can it be?

171
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,516
She really is cute.

172
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:11,016
-Got you!

173
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,183
-Why'd you do that?

174
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:27,549
-Now we're even.

175
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,249
Don't you just feel the burden
of guilt just washing away.

176
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,083
-You're not cute.

177
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,383
I take it back.

178
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,216
-Who cares?

179
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,516
-We wouldn't happen to be at
Mount Aso in Kyushu, would we?

180
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,149
-Shut up!

181
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,947
-Well, this is it, the
Tendo Training Hall.

182
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,313
I made it.

183
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:47,647
But oh, the horrors I had
to endure along the way.

184
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,847
-Officer, were could I
find the Tanaka residence?

185
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,380
-Oh, it's right
over there ma'am.

186
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,080
-Congratulations to you.

187
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,580
You found it.

188
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,547
-(ANGRILY) Are you
out of your mind?

189
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,413
How dare you drag an old woman
all over Japan for a week,

190
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,880
you little whipper snapper ?

191
00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:21,713
-But tonight is when
my suffering ends.

192
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:25,880
Ranma Saotome, today is the day
you go to your final reward.

193
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,647
-(WHISPERING) Wake up.

194
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,647
Ranma, it's me.

195
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,380
Let's fight.

196
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,880
Come on.

197
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:55,847
Wake up already.

198
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:01,313
(ANGRILY) Wake up!

199
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,280
(SHOUTING) Wake up stupid!

200
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,047
-Ryoga!

201
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,013
What the heck are you doing
here in the middle of the night?

202
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:41,947
-You shut up.

203
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,747
Does revenge know night or day?

204
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,347
-This has gone too far.

205
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,647
What could I have possibly
done to make you so mad?

206
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,680
-Listen, these may be your
last moments on this Earth.

207
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:58,280
After you skipped
out on our dual,

208
00:15:58,313 --> 00:16:00,180
I followed you all
the way to China.

209
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:07,413
-Oh Ryoga, you didn't
go to Jusenkyo?

210
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,713
You fell in a lake,
now you change?

211
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:11,213
-Not another word!

212
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,213
You've done enough
to ruin my life.

213
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,447
-What's going on out there?

214
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,613
-Akane, are you awake?

215
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,747
-It sounds like an intruder.

216
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,980
-I'll take care of him.

217
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,813
-It might be a prowler.

218
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:05,747
-I doubt it.

219
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:12,113
-It is a prowler.

220
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,147
Look, he's got a big sack.

221
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,247
-Well, wait 'til I
get my hands on him.

222
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,880
-Akane, it's too dangerous.

223
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,113
Here, use this.

224
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:20,613
-Mhm.

225
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:24,480
-Come back here.

226
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,380
-Ryoga!

227
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:36,880
-Ryoga?

228
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:38,680
-Oh look!

229
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:41,447
Why it's only Ranma's
little friend.

230
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,280
-What a pain in the--

231
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:46,580
-Ryoga!

232
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,980
Oh.

233
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,780
So, he really did
take the plunge.

234
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:02,247
Ah, the poor slob.

235
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,680
[growling]

236
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:17,780
-(VOICEOVER)They sure
make a lot of noise.

237
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:20,080
I just wish they'd
finish their silly fight

238
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:22,047
and stop waking us
up at all hours.

239
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:30,813
Somethings in my room.

240
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,480
Hey!

241
00:18:47,513 --> 00:18:48,080
Who's there?

242
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:48,647
Show yourself!

243
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:56,813
Ow!

244
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,447
A little pig.

245
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,147
Wonder how he got in here.

246
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,213
Come here.

247
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:13,747
Come on piggy.

248
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,547
That's right.

249
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,847
Come on.

250
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,980
Come here.

251
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:19,313
Oh you poor little thing.

252
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:21,247
You're all wet from the rain.

253
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,580
Are you lost little fella?

254
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:26,913
Oh, look.

255
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:28,213
there's a bow.

256
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,013
-I feel bad for you Ryoga.

257
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,713
I really do.

258
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:34,347
But you've got to stop attacking
me in the middle of the night,

259
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,547
OK?

260
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,013
You see, this ain't my house.

261
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,047
They got rules here.

262
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,280
-Where'd that dog come from?

263
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,313
What happened to Ryoga?

264
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:47,213
-Hey, where'd you get
the weird looking pig?

265
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,713
Shh, baby.

266
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:50,080
Be a good piggy now.

267
00:19:50,113 --> 00:19:54,513
We'll get some nice medicine
and put it on your boo-boo, OK?

268
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:56,247
-Hey, I think it's blushing.

269
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
-Don't be stupid.

270
00:19:58,313 --> 00:19:59,613
-You dirty little pig.

271
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:00,113
Ha!

272
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:02,413
It's a he.

273
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:05,513
-You're right.

274
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:06,447
-Hey!

275
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,413
Cut it out you--

276
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:20,347
-Come to think of it Ranma, I
know I've seen that dog before.

277
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,013
-Yeah?

278
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,247
(VOICEOVER) Don't worry Ryoga.

279
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,680
I'll keep your secret.

280
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,480
It's the warriors code, right?

281
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:29,647
It's funny though,
even when you're a dog,

282
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,047
you still look like Ryoga.

283
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,413
Those bloodshot eyes
are a dead giveaway.

284
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:36,080
-Ah, now I remember.

285
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:37,513
That's Yomada's dog.

286
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:38,080
-Huh?

287
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,180
-I'm sure of it.

288
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:39,813
Here Bess.

289
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,680
-Look away for a sec, will you?

290
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:00,880
Well that's odd.

291
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:02,680
And here I thought.

292
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:03,513
Oh well.

293
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:04,280
-Hey.

294
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:05,113
Where are you going?

295
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:06,047
-Take a bath.

296
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,513
All that running
around in the rain

297
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:09,547
practically froze
me half to death.

298
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,747
[sneezing]

299
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,180
-Well then can you
take him with you?

300
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:17,080
-Take a bath with a pig?

301
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:18,780
-Take him.

302
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:22,380
-So if he's not the
dog, then where'd

303
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,113
that idiot, Ryoga, run off to?

304
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,047
Come on.

305
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,880
Settle down.

306
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:37,913
A bath's not going to kill you.

307
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:38,680
In you go.

308
00:21:58,388 --> 00:21:58,921
Ryoga?

309
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:12,570
[music playing]

310
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:41,503
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma,
are you fighting Ryoga again?

311
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:44,770
Well, cut it out already.

312
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:48,203
Why is Ryoga so
mad at you anyway?

313
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:51,703
Next time on Ranma
1/2, Pee Pee Pee-chan,

314
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:53,636
He's Good for Nothing.

315
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,503
See you there.
