Akane, or your friends

00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,547
will leave without you.

AKANE: I'm going,
I'm going, already.

10
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:18,714
OK, I'm leaving.

00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:19,914
-Well, you have fun.

12
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:22,247
-Hot springs, what
a waste of a trip.

13
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:24,347
Only old fogies go there.

-Oh, no.

Actually, I here they're

Admit it.

18
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:31,714
Don't you get sick
of tea kettles?

19
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:33,981
Why not get some real hot water?

[laughing]

21
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:38,181
-Or use a tea kettle.

22
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:39,214
Big deal.

23
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,347

00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:45,247
Don't tell me you
want to come along.

-Why didn't I think of it?

28
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:48,714
Go on, son.

29
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:49,481
I'll allow it.

30
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,014
Go with Akane.

31
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,214
I'll even let you two take a

00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:56,514
-Yeah, why would
he ever think I'd

35
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:59,481
want to take a bath with a
tomboy-type like you, anyway?

-Excuse me?

-Where you go is
none of my business.

38

You got that?

you go with, for that matter.

00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:18,047
in a nice, hot spring
right now. [sobbing]

00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,914
Ah!

47
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:27,147
-Whoa, more therapy, Gramps?

48
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:27,981
-Give that back!

49
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:28,514
Hand it over!

50
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:29,281
It's mine!

-No, it's mine!

-Aren't you going along, son?

59
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:45,947
-It's none of his
business where I go.

60
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,781
-Just go, already, or
the springs will dry up.

think you're going?

-Please Master, try
to control yourself.

-I don't wanna, I don't wanna!

I wanna go to the hot

I'd never again
use this technique.

I should have gone

have gone real low.

in here, do ya boys?

168
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,714
That's when I noticed
the big boulder.

169
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,814
What else could I
have done but unleash

170
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,614
the ultimate attack
of The Anything

171
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:42,381

172
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:44,847
-Happo-Fire Burst!

[crash]

174
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:52,414
GENMA SAOTOME: That
white light was

175
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,014
the last thing we remembered.

176
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,614
When we came to, it was like
something out of a nightmare,

177
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,581
or one of those horror movies.

178
00:07:58,614 --> 00:07:59,747
Fortunately, the Master--

179
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,314
-Oh, what a fool I've been.

180
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,381
How?

181
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:04,781
How could I have
been so selfish?

182
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:08,514
Abusing a poor, defenseless
brassier like that.

183
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:10,081
Never again.

184
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,147
Never again will an innocent
undergarment be made to suffer.

185
00:08:13,181 --> 00:08:15,214
GENMA SAOTOME: The Master
was as good as his word.

186
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:17,514
He consigned the
Happo-Fire Burst technique

187
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:21,447
to the mists of time, wherein
he promptly forgot all about it.

188
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:22,081
[laughing]

189
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,281
-Huh?

190
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:25,547
HAPPOSAI: Ah, but now
I've remembered it again.

191
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:29,681
All I've got a do is find that
scroll and you three traitors

192
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,681
are going to be
my first victims.

193
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,481
[squawking]

194
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,614
-Cut it out, you guys!

195
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,314
-Guys?

196
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,147
What guys?

197
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,114
-Just us chickens.

198
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:37,914
[squawking]

199
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:39,414
-Come on, I'm serious, here.

200
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:40,981
He needs that dumb
scroll, right?

201
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,814
Well what if he don't got it?

202
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:46,514
If we can track it down before
he does we can use it on him,

203
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:47,381
see?

204
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:48,147
-That's the spirit.

205
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:49,114
-That's my boy.

206
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,914
You'll get our
revenge for us yet.

207
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,381

[chirping]

209
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:04,881
GENMA SAOTOME: I'm sure he
hid it around here, somewhere.

210
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,381
Look, it's under there.

211
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,081
Oh!

212
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:08,614
-Huh?

213
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:09,647
What is it?

214
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:10,947
-The-- the-- the-- the Master.

215
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:11,514
He--

216
00:09:11,547 --> 00:09:12,247
-Ah!

217
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:13,281
Where?

218
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:15,247
-Now you're just seeing ghosts.

219
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:17,881
I'm going.

220
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:19,381
-Ah

221
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:23,081
[crashing and screaming]

222
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:23,881
-Did you hear that?

223
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:25,081
-What did you think it was?

224
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:27,047
-Maybe wild animals?

225
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:30,714
-It-- it's in the
middle of a hot spring.

226
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:33,081
-I don't remember
anything about-- uh--

227
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,214
What are we going
to do, Saotome?

228
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,181
-(VOICEOVER) Ha ha!

229
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:37,547
Just where I left it.

230
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:38,381
SOUN TENDO: Ah.

231
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:39,681
So close, Saotome.

232
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:41,514
So close, and yet so far.

233
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,847
GENMA SAOTOME:
Don't worry, Tendo.

234
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:46,047
We'll get to that scroll
before the Master does.

235
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,414
I have an idea.

236
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:48,681
-I ain't doing it.

237
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,414
Besides, turning into
a girl is no good.

238
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:53,214
I'd only change back when I
hit the hot water, anyway.

239
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:54,947
[splash] Hmm?

240
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:55,847
Huh?

241
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,314
-Disguising with paint.

242
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,514
Oh, Saotome, how clever of you.

243
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,114
[shrieking]

00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:05,614
-What we know to be
a perfectly harmless,

245
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,381
friendly panda will
appear to those girls

246
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:10,214
as a man-eating grizzly bear.

247
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,114
-Hey, hey!

248
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,647
Way to go, Mister Tendo.

249
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:15,081
That plan of your
ain't half bad.

250
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,514
-It's a bear!

you think we are?

00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:28,081
-Polar bears in Japan?

256
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:29,247
Please.

-What next, genius?

260
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:41,114
-Nice try.

261
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:42,381
-You stinking amateurs.

262
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:43,814
-Master, I--

263
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,581
-I'm very disappointed.

264
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:48,547
I know I've taught
you better than that.

265
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,081
Ha!

266
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:53,214
Watch carefully, and let a
Master show you how it's done!

267
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:53,814
-Huh!

268
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:54,281
-Oh!

269
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,214

Ah, look, how cute,
it's a monkey.

00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,714
-I've never seen one
u up close before.

a nature show on TV.

-What-- what skill.

00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:09,714
-Observe how he didn't just
dress up as the monkey.

277
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:11,614
He actually became the monkey.

-(VOICEOVER) Now do you get it?

279
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,847
The secret to
successful voyeurism

280
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,514
is to imitate the
chameleon, to blend yourself

281
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,747
naturally in with
your surroundings.

282
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:22,414
Once you understand that,
it's simple, really.

-Oh, what a smart
Master we've got.

forgetting something here?
