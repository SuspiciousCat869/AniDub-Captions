00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,601
Come on, Kasumi.

4
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:57,134
Can't you find some other place
to dry out all this laundry?

5
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,867
It's starting to feel like
we're a bunch of Bedouins living

6
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,401
in a tent city or something.

7
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,734
Right behind you, Saotome.

8
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,767
I know, Father.

9
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,067
But it's been raining for weeks.

10
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,434
So it's far too wet
to hang them outside.

11
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:08,767
Here, Ranma.

12
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,001
Have another bowl of rice.

13
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:12,101
Great, thanks, Kasumi.

14
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:15,167
Aw, man, how am I
supposed to eat?

15
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:15,901
That reminds me.

16
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,334
Why isn't Happosai here?

17
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:19,001
The usual reason, I guess.

18
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:21,601
He's probably out on
one of his panty raids.

19
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:23,134
Hm.

20
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:25,201
He won't have much luck stealing
lingerie from clotheslines

21
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:25,834
today.

22
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,134
Not in this rain.

Happo Mold-Burst.

25
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,867
Oh, lingerie, where are you?

26
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,301
My pretty panties.

27
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,634
My beautiful bras.

[grunt]

31
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:01,801
Hi, Ranma.

32
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,767
I figured you might
be practicing.

33
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:05,734
Yeah, I had to do something.

34
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:08,101
And there's no way I'm
going out in that weather.

35
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,434
Yeah, I know what you mean.

36
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:11,001
How about we work out together?

37
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,301
Sure.

38
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,334
Hey, I wonder why they don't
hang the laundry in here.

39
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,934
It's certainly big enough.

40
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:18,401
Yeah, it would dry way faster
in the hall than in that house.

41
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:19,601
KASUMI: Oh, hi.

42
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,667
I didn't know you
two were in here.

43
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,201
Hi, Kasumi.

44
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,367
This training hall is a lot
older than you might think.

45
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:29,134
So you'd better be careful of
all the leaks in the ceiling.

46
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:29,934
What leaks?

47
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:35,401
[scream]

48
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,401
That explains
why you don't hang

49
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:40,801
the clothes to dry in here.

50
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,567
Maybe I should have
warned you a little sooner.

51
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,167
[sigh]

52
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:53,834
All that hard work and
not a thong to show for it.

53
00:03:59,134 --> 00:03:59,801
Hm?

54
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,301
What's this?

55
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:04,501
No men allowed?

56
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:06,034
[gasp]

57
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:10,767
Bikinis.

58
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:12,034
Halter tops.

59
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,967
So far as the eye can see.

60
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:16,567
So this is where
you've all been hiding.

61
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,134
AKANE: Happosai!

62
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,534
Hm?

63
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,701
Uh oh.

64
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:24,701
What are you doing in here?

65
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:26,801
Uh, you see, I, uh--

66

[groan]

69
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:35,367
This turning into a girl
stuff sure is getting old.

70
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,167
Huh?

71
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:37,067
[scream]

72
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:38,501
[groan]

73
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:39,801
Thanks a lot.

74
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:40,801
Now I'm going to have
to take another bath

75
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,534
to turn back into a guy.

76
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,334
Sorry, but you'll have to do
a lot better than that if you

77
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:46,701
want any sympathy from me.

78
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:48,467
Then how about this?

79
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,334
[grunt]

80
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:53,634
Now I've got you
right where I want you!

81
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:54,401
Hey!

82
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:55,367
What's going on?

83
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,401
What's all the commotion?

84
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:57,134
[gasp]

85
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:59,101
Take this!

86
00:04:59,134 --> 00:04:59,667
Keep it down.

[grunt]

88
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,967
What's going on out here?

00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:03,934
[scream]

90
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:17,501
Huh?

91
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:18,134
A dud?

92
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:22,583
Huh?

93
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:26,467
I don't get it.

94
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:28,234
Why didn't it go off?

95
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:31,467
This time you won't escape
the Happo Fire-Burst!

96
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,567
Hm.

97
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:41,634
These explosives will wipe
the smile off your face, Ranma.

98

[scream]

99
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:46,934
That's impossible.

100
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:48,267
Every one of them was a dud?

101
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:52,601
No!

102
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:53,734
They're soggy!

103
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:54,901
[laughter]

104
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,934
Your bombs are useless.

105
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,201
Too bad, you old freak.

106
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,534
[crying]

107
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:02,467
The horror.

108
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,201
Now it's payback time!

109
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,167
[groan]

110
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,334
Ranma beat Happosai.

111
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:09,934
Hm.

112
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:10,434
My.

113
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,567
[laughter]

114
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,634
That was hardly
even a challenge.

115
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,034
SOUN: Hang on, Ranma.

116
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,034
Huh?

117
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,667
How do you propose
to fix this leak?

118
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:19,834
[groan]

119
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:21,601
RANMA: Come on.

120
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:22,801
You can do better than that.

121
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:30,101
No slacking off, old man.

122
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:32,801
Poor Master's been
reduced to a cleaning boy.

123
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,301
How pitiful.

124
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:37,367
He deserves it.

125
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:39,701
And don't forget to
separate the colors.

126
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,767
Yes, sir.

127
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:41,467
Get a move on.

128
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,401
Chop-chop.

129
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,967
Anything you say, sir.

130
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,734
Put your elbows into it.

131
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:48,501
Yes, sir.

132
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,901
AKANE: Ranma, don't
you think you're

133
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,967
being a bit too hard on him?

134
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:54,201
You talking about
the old freak?

135
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:55,467
It's not fair.

136
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:58,067
You're treating him like
he's your slave or something.

137
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,301
COLOGNE: Hm.

138
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,234
Happy did that?

139
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,367
Yeah.

140
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:03,734
And now he's in shock
because apparently he

141
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,367
thought he'd be able
to beat everyone

142
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:08,067
with that bomb trick of his.

143
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:09,134
Pardon me.

144
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,967
Cold noodles to mark
start of new season.

145
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:15,034
Shampoo make them extra
special for Ranma.

146
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:15,601
Eat up.

147
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,501
You get strong.

148
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:18,901
I'll tell you one thing.

149
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,434
If I know Happosai, I'm
almost certain he won't

150
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,501
take this insult sitting down.

151
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,401
I'd watch your back.

152
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:26,401
No prob.

153
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:27,701
This stuff rocks.

154
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:29,501
Shouldn't you be at
least a little worried?

155
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:34,967
[grunt]

156
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:41,267

158
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,667
Oh.

159
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:48,267
Potent.

160
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:01,167
[laughter]

161
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,301
I finally succeeded.

162
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,801
This time my performance
will blow you away.

163
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,634
I guarantee it.

164
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:10,534
Happo Bomb-Burst!

165
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:17,601
Get off!

166
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:18,401
It's not me you're after!

167
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:23,734
Oh.

168
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,101
This ought to do it!

169
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,401
Whoa!

170
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,334
Oh, no!

Maybe I need a little break.

174
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:43,934
[groan]

175
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:49,601
Ah, for crying out loud!

176
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,234
My strawberry rice cakes!

177
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,001
Look at them.

178
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,667
They're covered in-- huh?

179
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,267
Mold?

180
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,834
[laughter]

181
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,101
[man talking on tv]

182
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:05,067
Hey, old man!

183
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,734
We need to channel changed!

184
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:07,567
[man talking on tv]

185
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,167
Hey!

186
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:10,301
Old man!

187
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,267
[knocking]

188
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,234
Huh?

189
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:14,834
Huh?

190
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:18,801
[laughter]

191
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,067
Ranma, you've shown
nothing but utter disrespect

192
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,067
for me for the last few days.

193
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,967
But now I'm going to make you
regret that you ever crossed me

194
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:27,834
with that attitude.

195
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,167
I don't get it, Master.

196
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:33,567
I've never seen you look
so confident before.

197
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,134
You're not yourself.

198
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,067
[laughter]

199
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,301
Not that old trick again.

200
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:42,101
It's getting really tired.

201
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:42,601
Wait!

202
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:43,634
That bomb.

203
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,167
It's the Master's new weapon.

204
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:45,701
[groan]

205
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:46,834
What?

206
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,534
A new weapon?

207
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,101
Take this, Ranma!

208
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,001
Happo Mold-Burst.

209
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:58,616
What?

210
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:05,967
[explosion]

211
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:15,667
Darn it all.

212
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:19,101
Ranma must have escaped.

213
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:19,667
Wait!

214
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,101
Wait!

215
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:25,567
This must be karmic retribution
for that junior high experiment

216
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:27,001
that went so wrong.

217
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:30,501
What did I ever do to
deserve such rude treatment?

218
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,034
[groan]

219
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:34,834
Wait, you coward!

220
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,834
Come and get your
fistful of fungus.

221
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:38,101
(VOICEOVER) Jeez.

222
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,567
I can't even breathe
with all that mold.

223
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,567
Now what's going on?

224
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,534
Run, Akane!

225
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,267
Huh?

226
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:45,367
Get back here!

227
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:46,134
Oh!

228
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,667
What's all this?

229
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,267
He's got me cornered.

230
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:50,167
[laughter]

231
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:55,001
Why don't you just give
up now while you can?

232
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,001
If you model this
for me, then I just

233
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:58,634
might consider forgiving you.

234
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,101
Think again, you old freak.

235
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:01,734
[yelling]

236
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,001
All right!

237
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:06,534
Have another Happo Mold-Burst.

238
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,101
[scream]

239
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,601
AKANE: Ranma!

240
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:15,534
Maybe you should have given
my offer more thought, huh?

241
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,034
[scream]

242
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,401
The Happo Mold-Burst
is utterly invincible.

243
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:21,901
[laughter]

244
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,567
Ranma.

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:47,996
[sigh]

247
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:52,363
Finally, Mr. Sun shows
shiny, happy face today.

248

[coughing]

251
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:02,763
Huh?

252
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:04,929
Hi-ya, Ranma!

253
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:07,496
Whew, that feels better.

254
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,496
Thanks, Shampoo.

255
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,529
That better.

256
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,163
Now Ranma no look disgusting.

257
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:14,396
I have to say, I've never
heard of that mold trick before,

258
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:15,863
though.

259
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:18,063
Trust the old man to come
up with a moldy old trick

260
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:19,463
like that.

261
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:20,729
There must be
something I can use

262
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:22,463
to counter that move, Granny.

263
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:23,696
Hm.

264
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:24,729
I'm sure if we put
our heads together,

265
00:12:24,763 --> 00:12:28,063
we could come up with a plan.

266
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:28,545
Huh?

267
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,196
AKANE: Jeez, this is
getting ridiculous.

268
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,563
Kind of livens things up,
though, don't you think?

269
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,229
Not a chance.

270
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:47,429
And where's Ranma?

271
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:48,896
He hasn't even come back
since Happosai turned him

272
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:49,896
into a mold ball.

273
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:50,963
Aha.

274
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:53,129
So that's why you're
in such a bad mood.

275
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,596
It is not!

276
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:57,063
Don't worry, Akane.

277
00:12:57,096 --> 00:13:00,663
I'm sure Father and Mr. Saotome
will think of something.

278
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,563
Hm.

279
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:03,529
[chatter]

280
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,063
Hm?

281
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,763
Thank you for coming to the
Tendo Living Museum of Mold.

282
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:11,263
Be sure to tell all your
friends, and please come again.

283
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:13,863
Nabiki, what on earth do
you think you're doing?

284
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:15,163
Making some money.

285
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:16,329
Huh?

286
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,729
How could you be so greedy
at a time like this?

287
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:21,829
Akane, one must never,
under any circumstances,

288
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:24,863
forget her aspirations
and goals for the future.

289
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:27,463
Now I mustn't keep
the crowds waiting.

290
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,296
Back to work.

291
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,329
[groan]

292
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,129
Please, Master,
have mercy on us

293
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:37,363
and return our house to
its former moldlessness.

294
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:39,563
We're begging you.

295
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:40,763
I didn't do it.

296
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:43,196
It must've been a
rogue mold spore.

297
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,529
Then talk to it.

298
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:46,196
HAPPOSAI: No chance.

299
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:47,663
Why won't you help us?

300
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:48,996
It feels so cushy.

301
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,363
It's like sleeping on
a bed of fluffy clouds.

302
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:54,629
I bet you two haven't
even tried it out yet.

303
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,263
If we don't stop
him soon, our house

304
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,163
will be completely
covered with mold.

305
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,796
We've got to go
straight to the source.

306
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,596
Yes, for world peace.

307
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:03,363
As peacekeepers.

308
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:07,796
You monster!

309
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:09,729
Enough's enough!

310
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:11,929
Happo Mold-Burst!

311
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:13,163
[groan]

312
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:15,829
And over there,
ladies and gentlemen,

313
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:18,396
we have Tendo Living
Museum's famous mold

314
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,163
statue, Rhapsody in Green.

315
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:20,963
[chatter]

316
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:29,829
COLOGNE: Are you ready, Ranma?

317
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:32,463
I'm going to release
these boulders now.

318
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,763
Imagine that they're
the mold bombs,

319
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,629
and try your best to dodge them.

320
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:39,963
Then climb your way to
the top of this cliff.

321
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,196
That'll be a snap, Granny!

322
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:43,396
Hang on.

323
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,663
You mustn't inhale the
poison of the mold bombs,

324
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:47,329
so you'll have to
hold your breath.

325
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:50,663
And of course, you mustn't have
any contact with them, either.

326
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:55,296
Now let's commence with
Operation Mold Buster.

327
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,263
Right!

328
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,663
Ready when you are.

329
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,296
Shampoo!

330
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:01,263
Shampoo ready!

331
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,796
Here goes!

332
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:21,463
Come on, Ranma!

333
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:22,863
Just one more!

334
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,463
Shampoo know you can do it!

335
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,996
[groan]

336
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:39,329
That boy needs a
lot more practice.

[groans]

338
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:54,063
Hi-ya.

339
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,529
Ranma still not good enough.

340
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:01,329
[grunts]

[scream]

344
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,029
SHAMPOO: Come on, Ranma.

345
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:08,229
[groan]

346
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:10,529
COLOGNE: You don't stand
a chance against Happosai.

347
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:11,229
RANMA: OK.

348
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,596
Once more.

349
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,196
[chatter]

350
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:20,563
RANMA: Old man!

351
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,563
HAPPOSAI: Oh, Ranma, it's you.

352
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:23,629
You freak!

353
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:24,496
Happosai!

354
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,863
What you doing here?

355
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,463
Long time, my friends.

356
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:28,829
What's with all the backpacks?

357
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,729
You people been away
on a trip or something?

358
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:33,896
I've been training so I
can defeat you, old man!

359
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:34,496
Huh?

360
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,329
Hi-ya.

361
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,929
Look at his feet.

362
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,063
They're covered in mold.

363
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,329
[laughter]

364
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,296
It's more comfortable
than the best shoes

365
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:44,829
I ever slipped my dogs into.

366
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:47,163
This mold attack
is the greatest.

367
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:48,163
[groan]

368
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:51,896
How dare you do this--
spreading that filthy mold

369
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,163
in my restaurant where we pride
ourselves on customer service.

370
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:58,429
Now Ranma's not the
only one who's mad.

371
00:16:58,463 --> 00:16:59,363
Oh, yeah?

372
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:00,629
So you want to fight.

373
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:03,229
I'll be glad to take you on.

374
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,829
[explosion]

375
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,196
He's more powerful
than I thought.

376
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:14,563
[laughter]

377
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:18,563
Here I come, Happosai.

378
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:20,163
[grunts]

00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:26,129
[yelling]

380
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:28,596
Come on!

381
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:30,129
Right!

382
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,096
[yelling]

383
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:39,663
What's going on?

384
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:40,929
Master, what is it?

385
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:42,429
Granny, is that you?

386
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:43,163
Darn it all.

387
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:43,996
I'm too late.

388
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:50,429
[laughter]

389
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:53,696
Welcome to my crib, Granny.

390
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,596
[groan]

391
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:56,463
Oh, no.

392
00:17:56,496 --> 00:17:58,329
I can't stand mold.

393
00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:59,696
[laughter]

394
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:03,729
Sounds like a white
flag, unless I'm mistaken.

395
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:04,963
Take this!

396
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:06,829
My infamous Happo Mold-Burst!

397
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:10,829
[scream]

398
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:13,363
[groan]

399
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,296
Nice move, Granny.

400
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,263
I'll take over.

401
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:17,196
We're counting on you.

402
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,563
Ranma!

403
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:21,563
Old man, I'm not going to let
you have your way, anymore.

404
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:22,829
Here I come!

405
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,996
Huh.

406
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,029
Want to try your luck as a
walking Petri dish again?

407
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:32,663
Sorry, old man, but your
luck's run out this time.

408
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:33,863
[grunts]

409
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:35,263
I knew Ranma could do it.

410
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:37,829
He must have come up
with a new and better way

411
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:38,863
to attack Happosai.

412
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,463
Shampoo no convinced.

413
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:41,629
Huh?

414
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,096
Ranma's new move
never work in practice.

415
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:46,396
How would you know
if it worked or not?

416
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:49,896
Shampoo help Ranma to
practicing hard and work out.

417
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,229
Shampoo know everything.

418
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,729
You've been practicing
with Ranma every day?

419
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:54,929
[laughter]

420
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:55,896
[groan]

421
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,329
Happo Mold-Burst!

422
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:01,329
[groan]

423
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:02,329
Ha!

424
00:19:02,363 --> 00:19:03,329
Take that!

425
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:06,329
And this!

426
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:07,929
Ranma!

427
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:08,696
Come on!

428
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:09,996
Ranma!

429
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:12,296
Pretend you practicing
with Shampoo again!

430
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,696
Hm.

431
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,496
There's a lot of big talk
coming from you, Ranma.

432
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,829
Yet I don't see
you doing anything

433
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,063
except trying to
dodge my attacks.

434
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:20,429
Pretty cowardly.

435
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,763
(VOICEOVER) Darn.

436
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:23,963
If I could only find a
way to crush that bomb.

437
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,429
But if I did that, I'd get
completely covered with mold.

438
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:29,029
Huh?

439
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:39,729
No.

440
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,329
This rain will only help
Master's mold attack.

441
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:44,429
He couldn't have planned
it better himself.

442
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,763
Have this and another!

443
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:47,496
And another!

444
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:48,096
Here!

445
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:48,563
Ha!

446
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:49,463
Come on.

447
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:50,929
Take that.

448
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:51,396
Ranma.

449
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:52,429
Oh, my.

450
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:53,963
It's starting to rain again.

451
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:55,363
What's going on, Kasumi?

452
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:57,763
What on earth have you
dragged out of the closet?

453
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,829
What's that gizmo
supposed to be for?

454
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:01,129
Oh, it's just
something I found.

455
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:03,296
And I thought it might
come in handy for Ranma.

456
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:04,363
Yeah?

457
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,896
I just found this mold spray.

458
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:08,196
And I was wondering if you
could use something like this.

459
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:09,163
Oh, yeah!

460
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,496
(VOICEOVER) Here goes nothing.

461
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,296
Super Anti-Mold Spray!

462
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:19,829
Nice try.

463
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:22,996
Just try and survive
my Mega Mold-Burst!

467
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:33,696
Impossible.

468
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,996
My Mega Mold-Burst.

469
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:38,563
You're through, [inaudible].

[scream]

471
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,496
Not again.

472
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:45,063
Ha!

473
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:46,763
So much for him!

474
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:47,963
Well, Ranma.

475
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,596
Very impressive, my boy.

476
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:51,329
Way to go, my son.

477
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,563
Wicked move, Ranma.

478
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:55,863
I knew you could do it.

479
00:20:55,896 --> 00:20:58,596
That because Ranma and
Shampoo practice together.

480
00:20:58,629 --> 00:20:59,363
[giggle]

481
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:00,929
You think I care?

482
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:08,696
RANMA: Hey, what's the
old man doing out there?

483
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,896
He's trying to save
his precious lingerie

484
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:12,929
collection from all
that nasty mold that

485
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:14,063
got through the house.

486
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:14,537
Doorknob.

487
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:15,329
Yep.

488
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,396
You got that right.

489
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:18,963
[laughter]

490
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:22,696
Silence!

491
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:25,629
I don't have to take this!

492
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:26,263
Hm?

493
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:27,296
Come on.

494
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,063
Not one of these old
soggy bombs again.

495
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:29,545
Uh oh.

496
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:34,196
Oh, yeah.

497
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:37,129
The rainy season's
over now, isn't it?

498
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,496
[groan]

[music playing]

500

GIRL (VOICEOVER):
What do you mean

501
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:20,161
Kuno has an album full of racy
pictures of Ranma as a girl?

502
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,395
And what's that got
to do with Kodachi?

503

Next time on Ranma 1/2--
The Kuno Sibling Scandal.

504

We'll see you there.
