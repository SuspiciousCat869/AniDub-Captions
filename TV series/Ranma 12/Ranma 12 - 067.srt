2
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:41,085
-Ranma!

3
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,085
You can stay a weakling for the
rest of your miserable life,

4
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:44,985
for all I care.

5
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:52,985
-Aw, come on.

6
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:54,218
You know how he is.

7
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:56,818
I'm sure he'll come around.

8
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:57,751
Ranma?

9
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,185
Ranma, you OK?

10
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:06,951
Ranma?

11
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:07,951
-Hey!

12
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:10,618
What's the matter with you?

13
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:13,718
-Stop trying to cheer me up.

14
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:15,185
-But-- I--

15
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:20,018
-Father!

16
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:20,985
They're gone!

17
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:25,818
Both Ranma and Mr.
Saotome have left!

18
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:28,185
They must have packed last
night, while we were sleeping.

19
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:30,118
And then--

20
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,318
-But why?

21
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,918
-Perhaps he felt
that being weak,

22
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:35,085
he could not take over the dojo.

23
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:37,418
-Oh, the humanity!

24
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,251
-I don't believe it!

25
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:40,251
-Ranma's no coward.

26
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,885
He would never run
from a real fight.

27
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:43,785
You believe that,
Dad, don't you?

28
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,251
Don't you agree?

29

NARRATOR: Eureka!

30

The Desperate Move
Of Desperation!

31
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:11,818
-Ranma Saotome absent again?

32
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:15,051
-Ukyo's absent, too.

33
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:16,051
-I wonder where she is?

34
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,685
-Moxabustion Rocks.

35
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:26,751
Yamogi Valley?

36
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:27,651
She's gone after him.

37
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,285
I just know she has.

38
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,218
What's with Ranma, anyway?

39
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:37,851
He doesn't even
say a word to me,

40
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,585
but then he invites
Ukyo along for the ride?

41
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:48,651
[grunting]

42
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:52,751
-Oh, man.

43
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:53,300
It's hot.

44
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,418
And heavy.

45
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:58,685
-You want to be strong
again, don't you, boy?

46
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:01,551
You're not being crushed
under just any rock, you know.

47
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,285
The moxa rocks of
Yamogi Valley are

48
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:05,818
known all over Japan for
their natural healing.

49
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:09,518
For example, monkey
back aches, sprained

50
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:12,518
bear ankles, birth
pains of deer.

51
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:15,651
Many fish suffer from
myopia, which they-- huh?

52
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,885
-Will you shut up, already?

53
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,785
-Yes!

54
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,785
Hold it.

55
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,751
Hold it.

56
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:23,918
I knew it wouldn't last.

57
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,418
-So I guess we
wasted a trip, huh?

58
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,118
If the rocks don't work, then--

59
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:34,318
-All the rocks in the world
won't do us any good unless we

60
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:38,018
can cure the strength sapping
moxabustion with that pressure

point chart of the master's.

62
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:46,318
-But we're here cause he
wouldn't give it to us.

63
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,118
-Precisely.

64
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:48,818
But I have a new plan.

65
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:49,518
-What is it?

66
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:50,451
Tell me.

67
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,585
-Come on, spit it out.

68
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:53,151
What are you waiting for?

69
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,351
-Ranma, my boy,
sometimes the cure

70
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,218
can be worse than the disease.

71
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:59,385
-To beat the old freak,
I'll try anything.

72
00:04:59,485 --> 00:04:59,951
Do you hear?

73
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:06,018
-Just remember, it
was you who asked.

74
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:08,918
Saotome Anything Goes
Desperation Move,

75
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,051
the Crouch of the Wild Tiger.

76
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,051
-Crouch of the Wild Tiger?

77
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:15,218
-Assume the position.

78
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:16,585
-You mean like this?

79
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:19,251
-Place both hands on the earth.

80
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:24,285
Finally, face your
opponent and-- I'm sorry.

81
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:25,318
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:26,051
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,451
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,785
I'm sorry!

85
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:32,751
The technique itself is named
for a legendary wild tiger

86
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:34,618
which fell from a cliff, and--

87
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:38,051
-It's nothing but groveling with
a fancy name, and you know it!

88
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,851
-Having a hard with
the son in law?

89
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:40,985
-Hey, the old ghoul.

90
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:44,285
-You do make a powerful,
tasty okonomiyaki.

91
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:44,826
-Really?

92
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,351
RANMA: What do you want?

93
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,818
-Oh, come now.

94
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:55,985
You didn't really think that
I'd abandon my future son in law

95
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,485
on his most desperate
hour of need, did you?

96
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,818
Seriously, though, from
the look of things,

97
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,918
you're going to need all
the help you can get.

98
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,985
-Thanks but no thanks, granny.

99
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:07,618
You know, I'd just as
rather do it on my own,

100
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:10,585
if it's all the same to you.

101
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:16,951
-Not by using the Crouch of the
Wild Tiger nonsense, you won't.

102
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:18,385
Oh, that is rich.

103
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:24,718
That's not to say there isn't
a technique you can use, even

104
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,085
in your weakened state.

105
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,118
-Huh?

106
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:29,118
-That technique is
the Hiryu Shoten Ha.

107
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:35,418
-The Heaven Blast of the Dragon.

108
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:38,085
-Why, that sounds
even more powerful

109
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:41,385
than the mighty Crouch
of the Wild Tiger.

110
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,018
-I'm warning you, this
heaven blast technique

111
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:46,751
better not mean heaven
fart, or nothing like that.

112
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,051
Huh?

113
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:49,951
-Care for a demonstration?

114
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:51,885
Maybe the three of
you would like to try?

115
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,985
-Can't be much further.

116
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,751
Ranma.

117
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:02,685
Oh?

118
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:05,085
Ah!

119
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:06,551
[scream]

120
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:10,685
-What the-- Oh!

121
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:13,385
Ranma!

122
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:14,651
Ranma!

123
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,285
-The old ghoul was right!

124
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:18,051
What an incredible technique!

125
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:18,985
I can do it!

126
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,551
I can beat the freak!

127
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:25,851
I'll have it down
in three days, tops!

128
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,392
-What?

129
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:32,885
He didn't even notice me!

130
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,185
Oh well, no big deal.

131
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:36,051
At least he seems happy.

132
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:37,151
-I'm starving.

133
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,651
What have we got to eat
around here, anyway?

134
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:43,018
-Yamogi Valley, eh?

135
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:44,518
Well, if you want
the valley, you'd

136
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:47,485
best head that-a way,
past them there mountains.

137
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:57,385
-All right.

138
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:58,885
You stay here while
I go to Yamogi Valley

139
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:00,185
and look for Ranma, OK?

140
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:05,059
-Akane.

141
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:09,851
-Hm.

142
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:10,951
Admit it, boy.

143
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:13,118
Aren't you glad I asked
Ukyo to come along?

144
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:13,918
-Oh, yeah.

145
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:15,218
You did good, pop.

146
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:19,285
Just imagine Akane's nasty
food during training.

147
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,618
-Never mind before a match.

148
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:21,318
-Yeah.

149
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,285
I'd be dead for sure.

150
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:26,785
-Hm?

151
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,118
-Hm?

152
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:31,418
-I was really worried
about you, y'know?

153
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:33,318
Huh?

154
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,985
-Assume the position!

155
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:37,885
-I suppose it does
have its uses.

156
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:44,985
Well then, let's get
on with it, shall we?

157
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:48,051
Tell me what it was you saw.

158
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:51,618
-At the time, I thought that
we were surrounding you.

159
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:54,918
But then I realized, it was
you who was drawing us in.

160
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,518
And then at that point,
with a single strike--

161
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,351
[screaming]

162
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,751
-I could be wrong,
but I think the steps

163
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:15,851
went-- kind of like this.

164
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:17,951
-That's my future son
in law, all right.

165
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:21,085
All it took was a
single demonstration.

166
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,551
Not to oversimplify, but
yes, the Hiryu Shoten Ha

167
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:27,918
is essentially a spiral.

168
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:30,585
-I may have lost my strength,
but I haven't lost my speed.

169
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,885
-Listen.

170
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:38,285
It doesn't matter
how you come at me.

171
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:41,585
In fact, the stronger the
opponent, the more powerful

172
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:42,718
your attack.

173
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:45,585
The important thing is
not to lose the spiral.

174
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,518
Step outside even once
and you lose momentum.

175
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:50,618
Now, step into that box of ash.

176
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:57,418
This way we'll be able to see
exactly where your feet are.

177
00:09:57,518 --> 00:10:02,318
Remember, concentrate on
keeping to the spiral.

178
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:03,485
-No problemo.

179
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:04,285
-Very well.

180
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:07,185
Begin the attack.

181
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:10,351
-Forgive me, son.

182
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:15,685
But a dad's gotta do
what a dad's gotta do!

183
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:16,785
-Huh?

184
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:20,385
-Ranma at age seven,
after he wet the bed.

185
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:20,951
-Ah!

186
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:21,851
Give me that!

187
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:25,285
Hand it over!

188
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,785
Give me that!

189
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:29,918
-Humiliating photo
fu number two.

190
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:30,918
A recent example.

191
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:36,851
-What are you trying to
do, embarrass me to death?

192
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:41,118
-Where's Yamogi Valley?

193
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:42,318
-What's the matter with you?

194
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:45,118
Look at your footprints, idiot.

195
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:47,651
Is this what you call
staying in the spiral?

196
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:49,951
There's no room in the
spiral for embarrassment,

197
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:51,618
no room for anger.

198
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,018
You've got to keep
your ego out of it.

199
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:56,118
If you're obsessed
on watching yourself,

200
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:57,985
when are you gonna
watch your opponent?

201
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:02,151
So in other words, what you need
to cultivate is a soul of ice.

202
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,251
-But how can a soul be ice?

203
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,485
-I can't tell you that.

204
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,451
That's something that
you'll have to figure out

205
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:12,418
for yourself, otherwise
you'll never master it.

206
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:13,985
-I can do that.

207
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:16,851
If it means mastering
the Hiryu Shoten Ha,

208
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:19,818
there's nothing too
embarrassing for me to endure.

209
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:20,785
-Ranma!

210
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:21,985
-Ranma honey!

211
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:23,951
-That's the spirit, my boy!

212
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,051
You're going to make me proud.

213
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,318
No matter what it takes.

214
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:32,518
Last night in his
sleep, Ranma said,

215
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:36,185
Akane, make me your love slave!

216
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:36,751
-Hey!

217
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:37,751
That's a lie!

218
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:39,218
I never said that,
and you know it!

219
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:41,851
-Don't lose your cool
remember, remember?

220
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,985
-Akane, I love you!

221
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:44,951
-Cut it out!

222
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:45,618
Admit it!

223
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:47,418
Admit you're lying!

224
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:49,651
-You're such a
jerk, you know that?

225
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,151
-And what about me, huh?

226
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:51,918
Huh?

227
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:53,418
-That's [inaudible], baby!

228
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:54,751
-Shut up, OK?

229
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,185
-Is this how you repay
me for helping you?

230
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:59,818
-Hey, what about me?

231
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:01,285
-I love you!

232
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:02,251
RANMA: I do not!

233
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:12,185
I-- I did it!

234
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:13,918
-I knew you could do it.

235
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:15,551
-This was only the first step.

236
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,051
Don't get too excited.

237
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:19,018
It gets worse from here on in.

238
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:20,251
-Bring it on, granny.

239
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,085
I'm ready.

240
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:23,218
-It's not you I'm worried about.

241
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:24,651
It's those two.

242
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:25,585
They'll have to leave.

243
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:26,451
-But-- but why?

244
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:27,851
Why can't we just stay here?

245
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:28,418
-Yeah.

246
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:29,651
Why can't we?

247
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:32,285
-Can you honestly say
you're ready to attack Ranma

248
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,751
without holding back?

249
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:34,818
-Huh?

250
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:36,785
-And what of you, son-in-law?

251
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:38,685
Even if you master
the technique,

252
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:41,618
will you be able to use
it against these girls?

253
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,085
-I-- uh--

254
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:44,851
-And so, an impasse.

255
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,885
Unless we can find someone
willing to go against Ranma

256
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:50,118
with all their strength,
we can't possibly--

257
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,818
RYOGA: That someone is me!

258
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:54,018
-Hm?

259
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:55,918
-I'd be glad to help out.

260
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:57,751
Course, I can't give
you any guarantees

261
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:59,151
that I won't kill him.

262
00:12:59,251 --> 00:12:59,692
-Ryoga!

263
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,627
Ryoga, why-- why are you--
you've come to help me,

264
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:21,560
haven't you?

265
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,993
I-- I just don't
know what to say.

266
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,927
I-- I can't believe it.

267
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,793
Ryoga!

268
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,527
-That's not why I'm here!

269
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,160
-Ryoga, I don't know
how to thank you--

270
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,727
-Wait!

271
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:34,560
Wait a minute!

272
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,060
Let go of me!

273
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,293
-Ryoga!

274
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:39,360
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I wonder
if he got lost again?

275
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,327
-Ah, now this is the life.

276
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:50,993
This hot water is great.

277
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:53,827
-So what are we doing
at hot springs, anyway?

278
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:54,960
-I don't know.

279
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,527
What's with that silly get up?

280
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,860
That's what I want to know.

281
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,460
-You're asking me?

282
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,093
-Shall we start phase
two of the training?

283
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:02,993
-Oh, yeah.

284
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:03,660
-Very well.

285
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:08,368
-Ranma!

286
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:14,260
-What'd you do that for?

287
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,660
-That tension suit
you're wearing

288
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,460
reacted to the heat
of your angry attack.

289
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,727
Keep your cool.

290
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:22,393
Resist the urge to let go
with your fighting spirit,

291
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,393
and it won't resist
your movement.

292
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:26,127
Ready to try again?

293
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:28,293
-You can do it, Ranma honey!

294
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:30,093
-Attack him at
your full strength,

295
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:32,160
and don't hold anything back.

296
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,160
-Lady, you don't
gotta ask me twice.

297
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,193
-Try me, why don't you?

298
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:39,127
-Yah!

299
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:41,093
-Keep cool, son in law!

300
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:45,160
Hold back your emotions and
draw Ryoga into the spiral.

301
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,727
-Wow.

302
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:47,093
He's doing it.

303
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:48,960
He's drawing Ryoga
into the circle,

304
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,493
and the suit's not giving
him any trouble-- meaning

305
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:52,893
that he's keeping his cool!

306
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:59,660
-What's wrong with you?

307
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,527
-That hurt!

308
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,627
-Do you take me for a fool?

309
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:06,127
I told you to attack
him with full strength.

310
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:08,127
-Hey, I attacked him
with all that I--

311
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,327
-Did you?

312
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:12,460
The heat of battle
is the fuel that

313
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,627
enflames the dragon's fire.

314
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:19,993
In other words-- unless you're
willing to hurt him, really

315
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:23,760
hurt him, this training
exercise is useless.

316
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,993
-But I-- I thought
I was serious.

317
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:29,593
-Moron.

318
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:30,527
Jerk face.

319
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:33,127
You got no sense
of direction, huh?

320
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:34,193
How was that?

321
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:37,360
You finally ready to
be serious, pig boy?

322
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,727
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): When this
new Ranma hits me, or calls

323
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:42,893
me those names, it
doesn't hurt a bit.

324
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:45,093
In fact, to me his
curses sound more

325
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:49,260
like the barks of a frightened
dog from behind a fence.

326
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,627
-What's the matter
with you, man?

327
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:54,227
You going to come at me, or not?

328
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:55,793
-Ranma, forgive me.

00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:56,493
-Why?

330
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:58,060
What did you do wrong?

331
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,893
-It seems I-- I didn't
mean to, but I-- I guess it

332
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:03,927
must be true.

333
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:06,393
I'm a nicer guy than
I myself thought.

334
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:07,827
Ranma, I'm sorry,
but I'm just too

335
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,660
nice a guy to hit you
when you're like this!

336

Go ahead and laugh
at me if you want.

337

-Ryo-- Hey, where are you going?

338
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,293
-Off for a good cry?

339

RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
I'm just too nice

you're like this!

341

-Who needs you?

342
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,060
Run away for all I care.

343
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,827
I'll figure it out on my own!

344
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:48,368
Ah!

345
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,293
-I'm ready.

346
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:55,093
Come at me!

347
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:57,427
-Wha-- What the heck are you?

348
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:59,593
-If it's hear that
you need, try these.

349
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:01,127
Pretty smart of me, huh?

350
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:01,793
-Smart?

351
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:03,493
Try stupid.

352
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:04,427
-Shut up and fight.

353
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:04,968
Hiya!

354
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:10,893
-Akane!

355
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:12,327
See, I told you so.

356
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:23,027
-It seemed like a
good idea at the time.

357
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,460
What was I thinking?

358
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,001
-Here.

359
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,327
Go home, will ya?

360
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,393
-Why?

361
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:32,127
I was only trying to
help you, you know?

362
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:34,893
-Well, maybe I don't
need your help.

363
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:38,060
To be perfectly honest, I never
wanted you to come and follow

364
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,493
me here in the first place.

365
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,227
-You don't need me.

366
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,593
-What?

367
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:54,693
-I'm not good for
anything, am I?

368
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:57,127
-Are you crying?

369
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:57,827
-Wait!

370
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:58,627
You don't understand.

371
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:02,493
Akane, I-- I can explain!

372
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:03,893
Wait!

373
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:04,827
Whoa!

374
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,327
Akane, I-- look, it's like this.

375
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:07,593
I didn't want-- listen.

376
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,260
I couldn't stand for
you, of all people,

377
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,093
to see me so weak and pathetic.

378
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:17,893
-Oh, like you're not weak
and pathetic even when

379
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:19,193
you are strong.

380
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:20,560
-Hey, you.

381
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,793
I'm trying to apologize.

382
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,027
-Well, gee whiz.

383
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,793
You could have fooled me.

384
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:26,334
Huh?

385
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:31,427
How long have you been--

386
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:37,793
-Your clothes ripped to
pieces, tears in your eyes?

387
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:38,560
-Oh.

388
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,793
Oh, it's not like that.

389
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:41,560
Really.

390
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,693
-Don't say a word, Akane!

391
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:44,360
Not to me!

392
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Now, Ranma--

393
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,001
-Hm?

394
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,460
-You animal!

395
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,327
You had your way
with her, didn't you?

396
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:52,760
-I what?

397
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,027
-Die.

398
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:57,760
-Look, you've got it all wrong.

399
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,560
Hm.

400
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,960
Akane, forgive me.

401
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,660
-Hm?

402
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,693
-Something came over me.

403
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:03,427
I-- I couldn't help myself.

404
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:04,227
-What?

405
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:06,127
-I took advantage of you.

406
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:07,360
-You what?

407
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,860
-Look, there's no use crying
over spilled milk, but--

-What?

409
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,193
What is the matter with you?

410
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:12,960
It's not true.

411
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
He's a liar.

412
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,593
A liar!

413
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,293
-Ah-ha!

414
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:19,927
Got him!

415
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,993
-Shut up!

416
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:24,960
-Ryoga, listen to me.

417
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,927
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Yes!

418
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:28,627
Now to get him into the spiral.

419
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:29,168
-Die!

420
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,727
-OK.

421
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,127
Now I'm in trouble.

Stop it!

425
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,960
You'll kill him
if you keep just--

426
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,927
-Back off!

427
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,460
I can handle it!

428
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,993
Do you want to ruin my training?

429
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:57,827
-Training?

430
00:19:57,927 --> 00:19:59,993
Is that what you think this is?

431
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,793
Time for you to
think again, Ranma!

432
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:04,160
Time for you to suffer!

433
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,960
RANMA: That's good!

434
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,593
Come on!

435
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:06,827
-What will we do?

436
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:09,527
-That Ryoga boy puts
out a fine battle aura.

437
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,993
And what a good
friend to Ranma, too.

438

-You're not listening!

439
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:14,927
If we don't stop him, he'll--

440
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,160
-Can't you see?

441
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,993
-What?

442
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:19,460
-See the waves of Ryoga's anger?

443
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,893
Soon he'll be locked in
the coils of the dragon.

Five more steps

the heat of his
opponent's battle aura

will awaken the sleeping dragon,
thereby claiming its power

00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,227

him the final step.
