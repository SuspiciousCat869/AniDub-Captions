1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,083
-Meet Ranma Saotome
of the Anything

2
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:11,716
Goes School of Martial Arts.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,783
And here's Akane of the
Tendo Training Hall.

4
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:15,716
-What are you doing?

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,083
-The two have been
engaged to marry

6
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:18,816
by they're loving parents.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,316
-I didn't ask for this.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,616
-Who asked you?

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,150
-As for the cause of
poor Ranma's suffering--

10
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:26,716
-What did you do that for?

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,850
-When Ranma is splashed with
cold water, he becomes a she.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,020
-Goodbye Girl-type.

13
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,587
-My very own horn of plenty.

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,254
[laughing]

15
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:01,820
-Give me that [inaudible].

16
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:11,220
-The more things change, the
more they stay the same, right?

17
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:11,820
-Right.

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,654
-Huh?

19
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:20,954
-Ow.

20
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm going to get that old goat
if it's the last thing I--

21
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:26,287
-Must you keep interrupting?

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,554
-Interrupt?

23
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,687
You think I enjoy when
he beats up on me?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,320
How else am I going to be
a whole man again, huh?

25
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:33,354
-What's this?

26
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:35,887
Be a whole man again you say?

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,287
-But son, what actual proof do
you have that there's really

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,754
a spring of drowned man
right here in Japan?

29
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:45,220
-He won't know unless he can get
that urn from master Happosai.

30
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:46,554
Right, Ranma?

31
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:48,554
-But Kasumi, this isn't
exactly the first time

32
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,454
he's claimed to
have found a cure.

33
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,454
-Let's not forget that
instant Nanniichuan.

34
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,187
-This time it's for real.

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,254
I just know it
is, I can feel it.

36
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:58,320
-But maybe you
should reconsider.

37
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:00,020
I mean, think how
much more interesting

38
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,920
your honeymoon
would be this way,

39
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,387
at least you'll never be bored.

40
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,154
Right, Akane?

41
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:05,987
-Huh?

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,287
What did you say?

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,720
-You don't know what
it's like to be a guy.

44
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:09,720
-The boy's right.

45
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,620
No woman could
ever understand how

46
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:13,787
we've suffered for
the sake of our art.

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,087
-Here, have some desert.

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,487
-Thank you Kasumi.

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,954
If the master would
only be so reasonable,

50
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:21,754
then we could get those
urns, find the spring and--

51
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:23,320
-Good luck.

52
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:25,287
You how selfish the master is.

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,187
He has no respect for
other people's property.

54
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,420
I'd give up if I were you.

55
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:35,220
-Boy, I don't care what it
takes, you that urn, hear me?

56
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:36,254
-You bet.

57
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,720
-Never let me take what's yours.

58
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:38,420
-I won't.

59
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:39,987
I'll make you proud pop.

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,620
That pot's as good as mine.

61
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,387
-Atta boy.

62
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,554
-If only was that easy.

63
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,120
-Huh, he's practically
giving it to me.

64
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:09,587
Got it.

65
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:16,954
-Ranma, you can do it.

66
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,187
Do it if it kills you boy.

67
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,787
-That's easy for you to say.

68
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,754
Get me down.

69
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,054
-To your feet boy.

70
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,454
Get up I said.

71
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:33,920
What are you, a man or woman?

72
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:35,354
-I'm a guy!

73
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,387
You hand that pot over.

74
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,887
-He's never been subtle has he?

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,287
-Oh my.

76
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,887
I guess I'll have to call
the repair man tomorrow.

77
00:03:57,587 --> 00:04:01,620
-There's got to be a
better way to do this.

78
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:03,187
Huh?

79
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,020
What the heck are these?

80
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:08,254
-Well, want to talk to me about?

81
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:13,320
-I uh, hey, Ryoga,
how's it going man?

82
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,420
We're pals, ain't we?

83
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:17,987
Pals do stuff for each
other without having to ask

84
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,054
questions, ain't that right?

85
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:24,654
-I, uh--

86
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:27,220
-Don't say it, you don't
got to say nothing.

87
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:29,254
I know just how you
feel, without you

88
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:30,754
saying a word at all.

89
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:33,920
We're enemies and all, but
we can still be friends.

90
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,987
Like now.

91
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,587
Yes.

92
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,954
You understand Ryoga,
it's all for the sake

93
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,854
of the spring, alright.

94
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:51,620
Now go.

95
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:04,154
-Hey, ho, who's the runt?

96
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:07,787
That piece of merchandise
on your head belongs to me.

97
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,654
Give it right back!

98
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:35,154
-All right.

99
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:37,120
-No fair, you cheated coward.

100
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:38,687
Let me down.

101
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,820
You put me down this instant
or I'll come down there and--

102
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:46,287
-So that's the red urn?

103
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,220
-Atta boy.

104
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:49,354
-Well what do you know.

105
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:51,754
-Ha, ha, there
was nothing to it.

106
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:52,954
-Ranma, no fair.

107
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,087
-Hey look, It's Ryoga, hi.

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,820
-How dare you force those on me.

109
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:58,554
-Force?

110
00:05:58,587 --> 00:05:59,220
These?

111
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:00,587
Huh?

112
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,720
-Nothing, Akane, certainly
not girls underwear.

113
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,187
Ranma!

114
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,254
-Come on man, it's like I said
before, all for the spring.

115
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:12,954
Right peach hen?

116
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:14,354
-Don't call me that!

117
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,520
-Sorry man, I got
no time for that.

118
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:20,154
See ya.

119
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:21,654
-You come back here!

120
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:22,454
-Wait for me!

121
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:23,720
-That's the spirit Akane.

122
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,854
It's times like these
that fiance's need

123
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,187
each other the most.

124
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,720
-Yeah, go for it.

125
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:32,854
-If only our dear
mother could you now.

126
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:34,054
-I'm not.

127
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:37,087
Oh forget it.

128
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,320
-OK, now I'm really mad.

129
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,354
What are you waiting for?

130
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:41,254
Cut me down!

131
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:43,454
-Now only one to go.

132
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,154
-I want to know where
the heck on Earth

133
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,787
is that last crummy pot.

134
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,054
-Patience son-in-law, these
old urns are tough to read.

135
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:56,287
Let's see, if this stands for
that then that would mean this.

136
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,387
-Ranma, giving me
that underwear,

137
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,320
that was a dirty
trick, even for you.

138
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,254
-You still thinking about that?

139
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,754
-I've got It.

140
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:05,654
This should lead you to the
third time and final urn.

141
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:06,720
-All right.

142
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:08,620
-Bring me that third
pot and I'll bet you

143
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,620
we figure out where that spring
of drowned man is located.

144
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,087
-OK.

145
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,220
Hey, no fair, come
back here Ryoga.

146
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:19,720
-Wait up you guys.

147
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:22,687
-It says start by going
three thousand steps north

148
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,520
by northeast.

149
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:26,787
-Ryoga, wait up, you little--

150
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,054
-Which way is north
by northeast anyway?

151
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,387
-It's this way.

152
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,720
-Give me back my map!

153
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:35,454
-Hey, haven't we been
through this once before?

154
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,954
You leave the
path-finding to me.

155
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,987
Next, 790 steps east.

156
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:06,554
-Whatever happened to
us being pals Ranma?

157
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,754
-OK, run up the
slope heading north,

158
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:22,154
and then, it should be the
next building, dead ahead.

159
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:22,754
There.

160
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,054
What the?

161
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,687
-What are you doing here?

162
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,420
I thought you were
finding the urn?

163
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:43,920
-What's going on?

164
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,987
-Admit it, you did it
on purpose, didn't you?

165
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,320
-Oh, Ranma, calm down.

166
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:59,354
-I'm going to get
you, you old ghoul!

167
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:02,854
-Calm down I said.

168
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:03,854
-Ronma!

169
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,454
-Ronma, is you OK?

170
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:20,354
-Cyan urn.

171
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:22,287
The Magenta urn.

172
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,420
The yellow urn too.

173
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,287
What do you know it
was here all along.

174
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,154
-That one [inaudible]
when building

175
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,120
cat cafe, right
great-grandmother?

176
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,454
-That's right.

177
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:34,587
I thought I might use
it for making pickles.

178
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,654
-Yeah, OK, whatever
granny, just read the code

179
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:39,020
and tell me how to turn
back into a guy already.

180
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,087
Now what?

181
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
What's wrong now?

182
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,354
Does it say where
the Nanniichuan is?

183
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:52,787
-Ah, it's written right here.

184
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,354
When you see the
first evening star

185
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:59,354
sibling stones will not be far.

186
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:01,620
What you seek flows
from the jars.

187
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:05,487
-Uh, when you see the
first evening star.

188
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,354
What was that again?

189
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:10,587
The stupid stones
will not be far.

190
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,720
What you seek floats
from the jars.

191
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:14,254
-Sibiling?

192
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:15,187
What's that?

193
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,387
-Who knows.

194
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,654
Maybe they're
brothers or something?

195
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,187
-Ah!

196
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,854
I think I know where they!

197
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:24,820
-What!

198
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,520
You sure Akane?

199
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:27,520
-Uh hmm.

200
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:49,439
-Whoa, get a load of
the gorgeous scenery.

201
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:50,839
-Yep.

202
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:53,739
And those rocks you were telling
us about are right over there.

203
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:55,306
-Is you sure?

204
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,506
-Well, yeah, it's the
name that tipped me off.

205
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,939
They're called the three
boulder brothers or something.

206
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,872
I came here on a
field trip once.

207
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:04,472
-Three boulder brothers, huh?

208
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:06,506
Hey what do you say we
go and introduce them

209
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,606
to our three pots?

210
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,339
-Yeah!

211
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:12,639
-I never thought
I'd see the day.

212
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,039
You really are friends.

213
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:16,572
I used to think that you
two hated each others guts

214
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:19,072
but why else he go to all
this trouble just to help you?

215
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:22,106
-Well, he can't fool you but
Ryoga is not really-- whoa!

216
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:27,206
-Come on let's go.

217
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,239
What are we waiting for?

218
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,739
We're not getting any younger.

219
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,872
Come on, hurry up.

220
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:31,706
Come on.

221
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:39,839
-That was a dirty
trick, even for him.

222
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:43,139
Come back here you cheater!

223
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,872
-Hey Ranma, you
little punk, what

224
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:46,606
am I supposed to store
my collection in?

225
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,939
-There's nothing like
good, clean mountain air

226
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,206
is there, Saotome?

227
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,339
-That's right, Tendo.

228
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:01,272
-Ranma, you find them rocks boy.

229
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,572
The future of the Saotome
school of anything

230
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,206
goes martial arts depends on it.

231
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,406
I'll take care of the old
geezer just you watch.

232
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:09,372
-Go on Genma.

233
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:11,672
What's that about
the old geezer?

234
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:12,272
-Huh?

235
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:13,339
What?

236
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:15,839
Ha, ha, the geese must
love this weather.

237
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,872
-An actor are we?

238
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:19,172
Don't give up your day job.

239
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:24,439
You fool.

240
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:27,206
The day you pull one over
on me is the day I retire.

241
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:32,572
-Got it.

242
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:34,239
Until we find that spring
no more dirty tricks.

243
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:35,972
It's for our own
good, all right?

244
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,239
-Well just remember that
I'll be watching you too.

245
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:40,639
-Unlike you Ranma,
I keep my promises.

246
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:44,039
Don't think I've forgotten about
those panties you put my head.

247
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:48,439
-Are you still
thinking about that?

248
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,406
-You be quiet.

249
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:56,039
-Why you come here Akane?

250
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:57,672
You no hate Ranma no more?

251
00:12:57,706 --> 00:13:00,706
-Because I'm the only one who
knows where the stones are.

252
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,039
I could ask you
the same question.

253
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,306
-Ranma is finance.

254
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:05,672
Shampoo want real
man on her honeymoon.

255
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:07,739
-I am so sorry I asked.

256
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:10,839
-What a beautiful
day for a hike.

257
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:13,172
Don't you girls think so?

258
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:21,706
-Uh oh, it's getting cloudy.

259
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:24,506
We better hurry.

260
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:25,439
-Look out!

261
00:13:29,506 --> 00:13:31,239
-That's my son-in-law.

262
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,006
I'll be you don't want
to be a man again, eh?

263
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,006
-Close one.

264
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,972
-Ranma you really
worry for shampoo?

265
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,539
-For the pot, yeah.

266
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,539
-Goodbye!

267
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:47,272
I know where I'm not wanted.

268
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,639
Forget it!

269
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:49,639
-Ah true.

270
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,639
Akane is green-eyed monster.

271
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:52,272
-Huh?

272
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:52,906
-Wrong!

273
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:54,406
I am not jealous.

274
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:57,839
You two can stay here the
rest of your for all I care.

275
00:13:57,872 --> 00:14:00,839
-Hey dope, if it weren't
for the pot I'd be--

276
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,106
-Ranma, is that you really feel?

277
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,006
Maybe broken pot not worth.

278
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,439
-Ah, don't do that, ah.

279
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:07,039
Oh?

280
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,172
-Somebody did that on purpose.

281
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:20,972
It's the old freak.

282
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:21,739
-Hello son.

283
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:23,672
-Yoo hoo, Ranma.

284
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:24,372
-Huh?

285
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,206
-Hey pop.

286
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:31,272
-I've got you,
you little creeps.

287
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:33,039
If you want to get
through this pass then

288
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,339
give me back my property.

289
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:35,306
-Oh yeah?

290
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,339
-But, but master
what about a loan?

291
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:39,639
-Oh please, I just
want to be normal.

292
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:40,606
Is that so wrong?

293
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,139
-I'm not stupid!

294
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,539
No, he stole something
that belongs to me

295
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:45,606
and now he's going to pay.

296
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,806
Give me back my property.

297
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,539
-No you can't have it.

298
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,672
Later, maybe.

299
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:50,939
-You can't take it
without a fight.

300
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:52,906
-Shampoo ready fight you too.

301
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:55,272
-So am Time! .

302
00:14:55,306 --> 00:15:00,039
(THUNDER)

303
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:02,106
-Looks like we'll be
here a while boys,

304
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,939
why don't you take a load off.

305
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,939
-Come on, you want
a piece of me?

306
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,372
-You better be careful.

307
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,606
He don't look like too much,
but he's about as sneaky

308
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,006
as they come.

309
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,239
-So let's beat him up
before he tries anything.

310
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:14,053
-Get him!

311
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,772
-School Anything Goes Martial
Arts final attack bean

312
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:20,472
jam blowout.

313
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:35,639
-Ow, that's got to hurt.

314
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:38,839
-Hmm, the one he developed
to eat seasonal bean jam

315
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,272
buns by himself.

316
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,439
Only the master would invent
a technique like that.

317
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:48,539
By using his key to knock
his opponents off their feet

318
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,206
he can enjoy the entire
feast by himself.

319
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,006
-How's about it, hmm?

320
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,839
Are you bums ready to surrender?

321
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,506
Or do you want me
to really get mad?

322
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,639
-Think again freak.

323
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:00,939
We haven't come this far
only to turn back now.

324
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:02,806
Are you with me Ryoga?

325
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,106
-Yeah!

326
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,339
Wait I'm not sure you
kids are up to this.

327
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:10,572
I'll have to take
him on myself .

328
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,372
-Great grandmother?

329
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,539
-Who wants to live
forever anyway?

330
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:18,639
Besides that old crony
hasn't beaten me yet.

331
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:24,539
-Whoa, check it out.

332
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:26,872
-Their battle orders
are going head to head.

333
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,406
-Mmm huh.

334
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,706
It's the beast that came from
China versus the greatest

335
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,006
evil in all of Japan.

336
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,139
Which one of them has
the strongest will?

337
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:57,372
-Oh, how sweet.

338
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,839
-It's not just me you
want to see in a bra.

339
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:01,772
It could be anyone.

340
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:09,706
-Oh, no!

341
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:11,139
Master!

342
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:12,772
Look how deep the
ravine is, Saotome.

343
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:13,772
How can he survive?

344
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:17,472
-What a terrible tragedy, Tendo.

345
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:18,039
-Yes!

346
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:19,439
You did it boy.

347
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,506
You're your father's
son all right.

348
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,972
-I'm proud to have
you as my son-in-law.

349
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,006
-Tendo at long last,
we can look forward

350
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,272
to growing old in peace.

351
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:36,206
-They ought to be
ashamed of themselves.

352
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:45,172
-Master, please forgive us.

353
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:47,339
-You traitors can
stay there all night.

354
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:51,906
You too Ranma.

355
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,506
Don't think you're
off the hook yet.

356
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,239
-Come on you slow pokes.

357
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:09,406
-Just a little more and
I'll change back for good.

358
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,039
Normal, I can, I
can be normal again.

359
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,539
-See, we made it.

360
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:38,439
-Where are the stones?

361
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:39,972
-I don't know.

362
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:42,239
There, there they are.

363
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:44,272
-The three boulder brothers.

364
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:56,772
-I'm so happy for you Ranma.

365
00:18:56,806 --> 00:18:58,506
-Ranma!

366
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,606
Come on, I help you
with [inaudible].

367
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,872
-Oh, sure, OK.

368
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:07,072
-Thanks Akane, you
can go home now.

369
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,072
-You have got to be kidding.

370
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,406
-OK granny, now what?

371
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:22,439
-Don't ask me, you
remember as well as I do.

372
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:25,272
When you see the first
evening star, what you seek

373
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:29,206
is in the jar, and
all that nonsense.

374
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:32,672
Maybe it's still too early
for the first evening star.

375
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:33,672
-Come on baby.

376
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,906
Twinkle.

377
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:36,372
Once you come up the
spring will appear

378
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:39,639
and then I can say goodbye
to me girl side for good.

379
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:40,506
-Goodbye P-Chan.

380
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:41,306
Goodbye humiliation.

381
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:46,039
-Ryoga looks like
he's going to cry.

382
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:48,539
He must really can
about Ranma after all.

383
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:52,139
Look.

384
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:59,472
-Oh, the first star.

385
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:04,872
(GASP)

386
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:06,406
-At last, it's the spring.

387
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,572
-Wait, let's let
it fill up first.

388
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:10,172
-OK.

389
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,772
-Is it ready yet?

390
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:21,472
-Almost, room from one I'd say.

391
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:23,406
Ah, over there!

392
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,006
-Huh?

393
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:31,893
-Ranma.

394
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:34,006
-Ranma.

395
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:34,972
-Alright!

396
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:37,539
I'm 100% guy again!

397
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,706
Or, maybe not.

398
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,272
-You broke it!

399
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:50,172
-I did not.

400
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:54,772
What's this?

401
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:57,072
Looks like some kind of sign.

402
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:59,039
To our valued
customers, thank you

403
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:00,806
for visiting
Japan's Nanniichuan.

404
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,139
Unfortunately, this local
spring of drowned man franchise

405
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:06,772
is no longer in service.

406
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:09,039
However, we look
forward to serving you

407
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:12,372
at the original Nanniichuan
in mainland China.

408
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,306
Thank you.

409
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,206
The manager.

410
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:18,872
-Well, that's that.

411
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:21,039
Come on girls, let's go.

412
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:11,279
-Ta Da!

413
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:13,112
Look, I made cookie
all by myself.

414
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:15,146
You'll try one, won't you Ranma?

415
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,212
What do you mean Kodachi, the
black rose has made some too?

416
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:19,512
Next time on Ranma
one and a half,

417
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:21,979
it's a fine line between
pleasure and pain.

418
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:23,874
See ya there.
