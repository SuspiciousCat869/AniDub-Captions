-Soun Tendo, owner and
proprietor of the Tendo Dojo.

So I hear you're interested
in becoming a disciple?

-Yes, sir.

My name's Genji Heita.

00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,333
I'm not sure I'm worthy,
but, uh, well, I'm

50
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:25,833
hoping you'll accept me.

51
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,566
I promise you will
not be disappointed.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,933
-May I ask, young man, how
you came to choose this dojo?

53
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:34,633
-Well, sir, today in town,
I had the great privilege

54
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:38,066
of seeing the one and only
master, Happosai, in action.

55
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,966
Heita, I said, if you could
learn technique like that,

56
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:44,000
then you'd be a real martial
artist, now, wouldn't you?

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,000
-I-- I don't think
you understand--

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,566
-So you want to be like me, huh?

59
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,300
-(STUDDERING) Great Master.

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,900
-I got a bad feeling about this.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,133
-It's not going to
be easy, you know?

62
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:55,766
You ready?

63
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,133
-Sir, yes, sir.

64
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,700
I'm ready to do anything.

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,433
Just ask me.

66
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,333
-Well, I'll just have to
hold you to that, kid.

67
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,833
-Where are you going?

68
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,600
Shouldn't we warm up first, sir?

69
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,100
-Whoa, hold on a minute, son.

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,633
You don't want to distract
a great master now, do you?

71
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,933
-So you mean it's
part of the training?

72
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,233
Well, why didn't you say
so in the first place?

73
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,800
If it means a chance to study
Anything Goes martial arts,

74
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,266
there's no sacrifice in
the world too great for me.

75
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,900
-You-- you really feel that
strongly about learning

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
our techniques then?

-You noticed, huh?

82
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,133
Well, it's not what you think.

83
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,666
-Me and my pop are guests.

84
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,566
You got a problem with that?

85
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,800
-I know you.

86
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,600
You're that guy that got
beat up by the great master.

87
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,300
I just want you to
know that I haven't

88
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,600
come to your dojo empty-handed.

89
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,833

ya quite a while.

-And when that's
gone, don't worry.

94

My folks run a farm, so--

95
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,400
-Young man, allow me
to be the very first

96
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,033
to welcome you to our dojo.

97
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,133

-Geez, your dad'll take in
just about anyone, won't he?

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,033
-That's true.

103
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,000
He did take you and your
dad in after all, Ranma.

-Excuse me?

105

-Never mind.

OK, now you try it.

113
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,666
A really good kiai,
or battle yell,

114
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:42,400
is essential to the
Anything Goes technique.

115
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,466
Without it, you'll
never build yourself up

or so I always say.

-Well, I guess you
know best, right?

124
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,066
OK, then.

125
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,833
Well, how about I just go
through my normal warm-up?

126
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:01,866
-There you go, son.

127
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:02,933
That's the away.

128
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,933
-And what would
that they be, eh?

129
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,766
-Oh, nothing too hard.

130

Punches, 2,000 Squats, 3,000.

00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,233

-What do you say we-- oh.

136
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,233
-That looks like the hole
in the roof's getting worse.

137
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,866
-If that keeps up, the rain's
going to ruin the floor.

138
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,866
-Well, that looks like
it's it for the day then.

139
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,866
-Or maybe I'll just go fix it.

[hammer pounding]

141
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,133

Hey.

143
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,200
Heita, what are you doing?

144
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,033
-Who, me?

145
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,566
Oh, I'm just fixing the roof.

146
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,666
-Well, you could just put
it off till later, you know?

147
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,166
Was it my dad's idea?

148
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:53,866
-Oh no.

149
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,433
It was my idea.

150
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,333
You see, I figure
it this way-- we

151
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,933
won't have to worry about the
days when it rains anymore.

152

-Oh, shucks.

154
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,566
It was nothing.

Are you OK?

00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,333
Uh, should I go get a doctor?

163
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,266
-Ah, don't be silly.

164
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:22,900
There's a reason they called
me Heita the He-man, you know?

-Me?

493
00:19:57,735 --> 00:20:00,035
I wouldn't touch your toxic
jockeys if you paid me.

494
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:01,402
Go ask the freak, why don't you?

495
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,535
Freak.

496
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:06,335
Hand over that under--

497
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,102
[sobbing]

498
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:09,168
-It's all gone.

499
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:10,968
-Just give them back
their stupid undies.

500
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:13,002
You should hear the way
they've been complaining.

501
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:16,135
-(SOBBING) You haven't
seen them, have you?

502
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:18,602
My collection's gone
without a trace.

503
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:19,702
-(TOGETHER) Gone?

504
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,368
-You mean yours are gone, too?

505
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:23,068
-Wow, I think he's serious.

506
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:24,568
-Well, who would've
taken them then?

507
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:25,535
[rumbling]

508
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,002
-Oh dear, earthquake!

509
00:20:29,502 --> 00:20:30,402
-What was that?

510
00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:31,002
-The garden.

511
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:31,502
Quick.

512
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:35,468
-What the--

513
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,535
-Geez. it's huge.

514
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,935
-Oh my.

515
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:39,302
-What's going on back here?

516
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:40,368
-We heard a noise.

517
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,235
-What in the--

518
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:47,968
AKANE: Oh, gross,
those are mine.

519
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,668
HAPPOSAI: Hey, that's
part of my collection.

520
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:52,468
RANMA: But who the
heck would've--

521
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,868
Hello, Akane.

522
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:56,902
Hello, Great Master.

523
00:20:57,002 --> 00:20:58,235
-Heita?

524
00:20:58,335 --> 00:20:59,668
-How sweet it is!

525
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:00,168
Oh.

526
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:03,702
-Well, master, does
this mean I passed?

527
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:08,002
-Heita, my boy, consider
yourself an A student.

528
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:08,768
-OK.

529
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:09,435
That's it.

530
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,102
I give up.

531
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,368
He can have it all.

532
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,302
So you and him taking
over the dojo, huh?

533
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:17,502
-Now, now, son.

534
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:18,668
Don't rush.

535
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,735
I just know you and Akane
can work things out.

536
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:21,602
-Akane?

537
00:21:21,702 --> 00:21:23,235
If it wasn't for
your pep talk, I

538
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:24,802
would've never
had the confidence

539
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,635
to steal all that underwear.

540
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:29,102
I don't know how to thank you.

541
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:33,235
-But that wasn't the reason
I-- say something, Ranma.

542
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,702
Hey, I'm talking to you.

543
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:38,702
RANMA: Guess you need me
more than you thought, huh?

544
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:48,602
[music playing]

545
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,499
AKANE: Would you
cut it out already?

546
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,732
He's just a kid.

547
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,566
And besides, his
health is so delicate.

548
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,166
You don't want to hurt
his recovery, do you?

549
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:26,066
Next time on Ranma
1/2, "Step Outside."

550
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,466
We'll see you there.
