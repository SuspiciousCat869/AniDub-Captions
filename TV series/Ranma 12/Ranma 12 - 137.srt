Why did you summon me here?

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,966
I'd like an explanation.

00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:10,166
Me be a needing you to act
as the Furinkan High School

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,666
Substitute principal?

00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,266
You be getting it.

10
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:21,166
Me be needing some recreational

from this place.

So me be choosing you
to take over the school

while I be getting jiggy.

You know me wouldn't

I hear the principal's
going to be away for a while.

Wouldn't it be great
if he never came back?

Can't you do something
about that guy, Akane?

It's a hopeless case.

Heh.

35
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:47,933
Allow me to present the
Furinkan Enforcers Squad.

00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,766
Time to learn some

as the substitute principal.

41
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:04,300
Now I am in charge, and we're

Saotome, for slandering
the principal,

you shall receive a
caning of 100 lashes.

join the Enforcers Squad

and finally get my turn
to pay you back but good.

probably use a hand.

on the terms.

back over this way, please?

It is Akane Tendo.

Nothing would give
me more pleasure

101

than to throw this
ball back to my love.

with a female student.

106

Aha!

As punishment, I sentence
you all to one week in a wig.

That's not fair!

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,100
I definitely can't go
outside looking like this.

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,500
That's for sure.

129
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,366
Well, then just
take the thing off.

130
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,066
But if Kuno finds out--

131
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,366
What if he does?

132
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,200
Yeah, so what?

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,133
Huh?

134
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,200
Ranma's making a
valid point here.

135
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,033
There's really no reason to be
afraid of the Enforcer Squad,

136
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:53,900
now is there?

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,200
Hey, there's a change.

138
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,600
You're right for the first time.

139
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,066
He is?

140
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:58,833
[groan]

141
00:07:58,933 --> 00:07:59,566
Quiet, baldilocks.

142
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,100
OK, I give.

143
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,533
I give.

144
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:01,833
Ranma!

145
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:05,900
Enforcer Squad, Gosunkugi here
reporting that Ranma Saotome is

messing with Daisuke's
skullcap and--

147
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:08,900
Drop that!

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,633
I'll need backup.

149
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:12,966
Mercy.

150
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,800
Have mercy on me.

151
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,766
[whimpering]

152
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,066
Ranma Saotome.

153
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,966
This time, I cannot let your
indiscretions go unpunished.

154
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:22,966
Your point?

155
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:25,366
It is not out of
personal satisfaction

156
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,833
that I mete out your punishment.

157
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:30,500
It is solely for the future
of our country, which

158
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,533
rests with the youth of
the Furinkan High School.

159
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:37,400
Justice, love, and passion
motivate my severity.

160
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,366
I have no course but to act
while my heart cries out

161
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:41,800
for your pain.

162
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,700
Why do you have such a
problem understanding that?

163
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,900
Speaking of mental
pause, did it

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,766
ever occur to you that
the principal's just

165
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:51,533
using you to get back at us?

166
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:52,533
What?

167
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,966
This will teach you!

168
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:55,800
Whoa!

169
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,266
RANMA: Thanks for the lesson!

00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,633
Now I've had enough!

171
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,533
Just who the heck
do you think you are?

172
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,300
You're going to pay for this.

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,700
I forbid you from buying
lunch at the school snack

174
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,900
shop for the entire week.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,733
Huh?

176
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,566
[laughter]

177
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,333
[gasp]

178
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:15,666
STUDENT: Hey, come on.

179
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:16,433
I was first.

180
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,633
STUDENT: No, I was first.

181
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,433
I've been here for,
like, half an hour.

182
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,833
Have at it.

183
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:24,566
Give me a chow mein sandwich,
one bun, and a meat and veggie

184
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,233
sandwich.

185
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm afraid I can't.

186
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,833
I'm not allowed to
sell you anything.

187
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:29,766
[chatter]

188
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:30,307
Huh?

189
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,266
I've got to pay the
bills, too, you know.

190
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,833
He may only be the
substitute principal,

191
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,033
but his word's the law.

192
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,266
TATEWAKI: Hey!

193
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,500
No opening umbrellas
inside the school.

194
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,233
You, girl!

195
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,066
Polka dot raincoats are
against regulations!

196
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,466
Hm?

197
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,700
[sigh]

198
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,666
Those loud footsteps are
against school regulations.

199
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:05,933
[gasping]

200
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:06,900
Out of the way!

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,766
I've got to go!

202
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:08,766
Out of the way!

203
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:09,766
Aha.

204
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,400
It's that deviant Saotome.

205
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,866
I've gotta go!

206
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:16,000
Halt, Ranma Saotome.

207
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,666
Furinkan regulations, section
two, article one, part three--

208
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,366
walking in the corr--

209
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:23,300
[groan]

210
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,700
Passing through.

211
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,666
[groan]

212
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,533
The substitute principal.

213
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:29,100
Are you all right?

214
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,933
This is the sub principal.

215
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,333
Come in, boys' restroom,
third floor north.

216
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,833
BOY (ON RADIO): This is boys'
restroom, third floor north.

217
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:36,600
We copy.

218
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,141
Over.

219
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,366
[groan]

220
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,666
What's this doing here?

221
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,366
I'm terribly sorry.

222
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:48,166
I've got to make a living, so
I can't disobey the substitute

223
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,800
principal's orders, either.

224
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,800
[groan]

225
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,766
[screaming]

226
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:56,600
Do you really expect
me to fall for that?

227
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,700
Oh, man.

228
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,100
Stupid Kuno.

229
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,733
I'm sure that it's just
me that he's out to get.

230
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,400
You gonna get him, Ranma?

231
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,566
Course I am.

232
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,700
Huh.

233
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,266
But Ranma, if you attack
Kuno out in the open,

234
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,366
then you'll just end up
falling into his trap.

235
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,500
Got any other ideas?

236
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,333
Hm.

237
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:17,800
It just so happens that I do.

238
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,633
[animal noises]

239
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:38,507
RANMA: We can't let the
enforcers treat us this way.

240
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,341
BOY: If we don't stand
up for ourselves now,

241
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,841
they'll just get more
and more carried away.

242
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,307
Let's do something then.

243
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:46,941
I'll round up some other
students who hate him, too.

244
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:51,141
We're going to make that fake
principal sorry he ever met us.

245
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,274
Huh?

246
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:54,407
I am the swordsman Kuno,
Furinkan High School's

247
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,741
substitute principal.

248
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,441
Get em.

249
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,441
[screaming]

250
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,674
No, please, have mercy.

251
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:05,274
Justice is served.

252
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,974
Kuno, baby, I've
got some good news

253
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,574
you might be interested in.

254
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:11,341
Oh?

255
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,241
Your 10th report already.

256
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,974
Give me the details.

257
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:18,007
Pay up first.

258
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,741
Hm.

259
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:21,741
Someone's posting
pictures of girls

260
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,907
here where I've
marked on the map.

261
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,174
Oh!

262
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:27,407
Let's move, men.

263
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:28,307
Yes, sir!

264
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:34,241
It can't be.

265
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:40,107
This is our clubhouse.

266
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:41,041
[groan]

267
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:53,374
How come I'm the one who
has to do this, anyway?

268
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:54,941
Now what's your problem?

269
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:59,374
It was my idea, so you've
got to put it into action, K?

270
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,941
She's right, Ranma.

271
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,074
Now get in touch with your
feminine side, and be strong.

272
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,374
But I'm a guy!

273
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:08,407
Keep it down!

274
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:09,241
Hey, wait a sec.

275
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,174
Did you hear something just now?

276
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:11,941
[groan]

277
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,741
Don't say a word.

278
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,174
I've been duped.

279
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:18,874
Something has gone
awry in my kingdom.

280
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:22,607
Forgive me, pig tailed
girl and Akane Tendo.

281
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:25,774
But mark my word,
the day shall dawn

282
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:30,807
when we will be free to hold
discourse as in days of yore.

283
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:32,274
[sigh]

284
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:37,274
Farewell, my loves.

285
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:37,841
Huh?

286
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:40,574
It's me, Kuno!

287
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:41,341
Ah!

288
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,107
It's the pig tailed girl!

289
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:44,074
[grunt]

290
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,007
Still got my touch.

291
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,874
How about a date, Kuno?

292
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:55,307
Jeez, Ranma just had to go and
boot him-- now, of all times.

293
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:56,474
A date?

294
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,007
I'd be honored!

295
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,807
Let's go, pig tailed girl.

296
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:00,674
So far, so good.

297
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,974
Wouldn't you say, Akane?

298
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:05,207
Furinkan regulation,
section two,

299
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:07,207
article one--
close relationships

300
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:08,841
with the opposite
sex are prohibited.

301
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:09,382
[gasp]

302
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:11,807
Wait just a moment.

303
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:14,941
As substitute principal,
I must set an example.

304
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,974
Oh, but Kuno, come on, huh?

305
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:21,307
Wouldn't you rather
spend time with me?

306
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,541
(VOICEOVER) Forgive
me, pig tailed girl.

307
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,841
It sorrows me to turn you away.

308
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:40,407
But history is being written.

309
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:44,241
Ow, that's hot!

310
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,407
It's hot!

311
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:47,741
For now, suffer this
hot embrace as a prelude.

312
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:49,041
Oh, disgusting!

313
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:49,874
[groan]

314
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:51,841
Sorry about that, Ranma.

315
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,541
But my own life is at
stake here, too, you know?

316
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:56,641
It's that scoundrel Saotome.

317
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:57,974
Come back here!

318
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:58,941
[groan]

319
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:03,641
Uh oh.

320
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:06,907
Thanks a lot, Nabiki.

321
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,874
Whose side are you on?

322
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,941
Just out of curiosity.

323
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,807
Who, me?

324
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:12,207
The money side, of course.

325
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:21,841
You just about had
Kuno trapped, too.

326
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:24,174
Drop it, because
I'm not trying again.

327
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,641
The problem here is
really your sister.

328
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:28,341
You mean, Nabiki?

329
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,107
It's not easy talking her
out of doing something.

330
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:32,974
While we're stopping
her, we've got

331
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:34,974
to get Gosunkugi in the process.

332
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:38,341
All we've got to do is convince
them to come over to our side.

333
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,174
Yeah, right.

334
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:41,674
Like that's going to be easy.

335
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,474
I'll take care of things.

336
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,507
There are two ways
to people's hearts,

337
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:48,874
so I'll convince them to
see things like we do.

338
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:49,607
Two ways?

339
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,507
This is on the house.

340
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,741
So eat up, OK?

341
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,707
Oh, I see.

342
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:03,474
So you're buying us off.

343
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:04,674
I get it.

344
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:07,707
So food is one of the
ways to win people over.

345
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:09,741
Ukyo said there were two
ways, so the other one

346
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:11,241
must have something
to do with love.

347
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:14,107
GOSUNKUGI: Uh, listen, guys.

348
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,874
I don't want anything to
do with that kind of stuff.

349
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,107
Forget that, Gosunkugi.

350
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,407
We need your help.

351
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:21,541
Oh, sure.

352
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,607
You can definitely count on me.

353
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:27,041
I'll take care of that
substitute principal right now.

354
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,041
What?

355
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:30,174
Time to repent!

356
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:31,174
Ah!

357
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,141
Ow!

358
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,607
[groan]

359
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:39,907
Huh?

360
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:43,774
He won't be needing this one.

361
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:46,207
You guys want to hear
something really juicy?

362
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:49,141
What do you mean?

363
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,841
Well, the principal's
coming back tomorrow morning

364
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:54,174
during the homeroom period.

365
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:55,541
You serious?

366
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,241
See, what did I tell you?

367
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:59,574
Buying people off
really does work.

368
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:02,507
If there's anything I've
learned, it's that money talks.

369
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,674
And the timing was impeccable.

370
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,007
I see your point.

371
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:08,141
You must be raking
in a serious profit.

372
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:09,374
Better believe I am.

373
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,007
[laughter]

374
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:16,374
(VOICEOVER) If only they knew,
I've been eavesdropping this

375
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:18,574
whole time.

376
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:20,707
If there was any
trouble during homeroom,

377
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,341
it'd be the sub principal's
fault, wouldn't it?

378
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,341
Yeah!

379
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,707
So I'll make sure
there is trouble.

380
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:26,874
Don't be stupid.

381
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:29,174
If you got involved,
you'd be blamed, not him.

382
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:32,241
But if I don't stir things up
during homeroom period, then

383
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:33,407
who will?

384
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:34,707
Hm.

385
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:37,341
This is the perfect time to
dust off a secret weapon.

386
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:39,141
Secret weapon?

387
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,641
Secret weapon?

388
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:41,674
RANMA: What do you mean?

389
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:42,774
What is it?

390
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:44,041
NABIKI: You'll have
to wait and find out.

391
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:45,541
(VOICEOVER) This
sounds foreboding.

392
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:49,107
I'll have to tell
Master Kuno right away.

393
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,674
The elements are simple,
but the overall effect

394
00:17:51,774 --> 00:17:53,007
will blow you away.

395
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:28,841
Do you really think that
this secret weapon thing

396
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,307
is going to get here on time?

397
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,307
Let's hope so.

398
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:35,774
The Monday morning homeroom
period shall now commence.

399
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:38,341
To begin with, allow me
to take this opportunity

400
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:40,074
to introduce myself.

401
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:44,507
I am your substitute
principal, Tatewaki Kuno.

402
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,074
I have several
proclamations this morning.

403
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:48,674
It's been one week
since I've become--

404
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:49,874
(VOICEOVER) About that time.

405
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:51,407
TATEWAKI: --subsitute principal.

406
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:55,207
And as far as your
behavior is concerned--

407
00:18:55,307 --> 00:18:56,841
It's here.

408
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:57,382
Huh?

409
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,207
Where's my bride?

410
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,674
Where's my bride?

411
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:07,607
[inaudible].

412
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:10,074
Oh, that-- that voice!

413
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:11,041
My bride!

414
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:12,474
Where's my bride?

415
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:13,015
[inaudible]

416
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:19,307
[stuttering]

417
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,574
Me statue be falling.

418
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:25,374
Oh, my god, the horror!

419
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:26,341
[screaming]

420
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:27,841
Huh?

421
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,341
[screaming]

422
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:34,807
What be happening to me school?

423
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,307
[screaming]

424
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:39,874
Scoundrels!

425
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:43,574
How dare anyone interrupt the
sacred Monday homeroom class!

426
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:46,007
[interposing voices]

427
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:47,007
Huh?

428
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:48,941
[interposing voices]

429
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,441
You can't treat
Master Kuno that way.

430
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,274
[screaming]

431
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:56,441
Don't you think this is going
a bit over the top, Akane?

432
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,107
Yeah, a bit.

433
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:03,274
Nabiki's gone way overboard
with this secret weapon thing.

434
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:04,641
OK, I guess you're right.

435
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:06,141
Maybe I overdid it a little.

436
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:09,407
So what say I run
plan B by you, Akane?

437
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,374
I think our only
hope at this point

438
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:14,707
is to get Ranma into the
mix, working for the cause.

439
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:15,407
Huh?

440
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,774
You're right.

441
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:19,041
There's really only one way
we're going to be able to quiet

442
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,007
down this riot.

443
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:21,041
[gasp]

444
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:22,641
You-- you don't mean I--

445
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:25,674
Do it for the
kids, Ranma, honey.

446
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:26,541
[gasp]

447
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:27,641
My darling!

448
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:28,674
Oh, happy day.

449
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:30,674
We found Ranma.

450
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:32,407
Soon to be my bride.

451
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,274
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

452
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:35,674
[screaming]

453
00:20:35,774 --> 00:20:37,074
My bride.

454
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:40,174
Meddling interlopers,
you won't escape my wrath.

455
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:41,274
[screaming]

456
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,674
Come back, my luscious
bride. [inaudible].

457
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:45,174
Stop, you scoundrels!

458
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:47,141
And face your punishment.

459
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:49,007
Oh, me Buddha.

460
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:51,274
I make you the
make-do principal,

461
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:54,274
and you let this cat and
this freaky old man into me

462
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:57,141
school while I be
recreating, man?

463
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:58,574
[screaming]

464
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:01,907
The boys and the girls
should no be associated

465
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,741
and not be playing tag.

466
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:06,341
Oh, they running
straight for me.

467
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:07,441
Oh!

468
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,974
Come back here, and
face your punishment!

469
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:10,941
[screaming]

470
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,074
Oh, this looking
dangerous, man.

471
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,007
Me best be going.

472
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:16,974
[screaming]

473
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,907
My [inaudible]!

474
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:21,307
Come back here, you!

475
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:22,874
And there they go.

476
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:24,641
You think Ranma will be OK?

477
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,741
Mhm.

478
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:28,141
Well, if he makes it
back in one piece.

479
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:31,007
Maybe I should go
easy on him, for once.

480
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:33,074
That might be a good idea.

481
00:21:33,174 --> 00:21:34,574
[screaming]

482
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:46,507
[music playing]

483
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:18,844
There's a secret tradition
amongst martial artists

484
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:21,544
known as the Ogre
Festival of the Dark.

485
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:22,085
No, Ranma!

486
00:23:22,144 --> 00:23:23,810
Don't do it!

487
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,944
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Ranma's Greatest Challenge.

488
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:28,844
We'll see you there!
