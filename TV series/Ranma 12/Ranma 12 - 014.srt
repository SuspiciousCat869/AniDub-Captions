00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:37,377
-Charlotte!

333
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,610
-No!

334
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:39,444
-Here, Charlotte!

335
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:40,777
Azusa's got a present for you!

336
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,244
[giggles] Oh!

337
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:48,510
So cute!

338
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:49,510
-What did you do to him?

339
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:52,444
You leave him
alone, you here me?

340
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:53,010
What is this?

341
00:17:55,644 --> 00:18:00,444
Don't worry I'll get
it off of you, P-chan.

342
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:01,410
-Oh, no!

343
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:04,477
Azusa locked it
with her little key.

344
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,377
If you want it off,
first you'll have

345
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,610
to defeat Azusa in the match.

346
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:09,377
-Huh!

347
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,177
Golden Pair, shmolden pair!

348
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,910
I don't care who you are.

349
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:14,044
Ranma and I don't
intend to lose!

350
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:15,210
-Akane, help me!

351
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:16,544
Make me stop, I'm going to fall.

352
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:18,077
Come on, you've gotta help me!

353
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,210
Oh I feel dizzy Akane.

354
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:20,877
Don't just stand there,
hurry up and help me!

355
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,210
-Don't worry my
pigtailed pretty.

356
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:27,010
I'll show you how to skate.

357
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:27,510
-Oh.

358
00:18:27,544 --> 00:18:28,977
You again.

359
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,144
Stay out of my business
and put me down!

360
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,610
I don't need your help.

361
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,044
-Oh, well I can't do that.

362
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:35,410
You still owe me.

363
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:38,710
A reward for saving
you earlier, remember?

364
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,810
-Get lost!

365
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:43,805
I'll give you a fat lip
if you-- [struggling]

366
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:07,910
-(OFFSCREEN) Ranma?

367
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:14,010
-Ah! [crying]

368
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:17,044
-Ah, to be moved so by my kiss.

369
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:20,777
She's such a pure and sweet and
innocent, naive, young child.

370
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,110
-(TO HERSELF) You'd cry too
if you realized who you just

371
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:23,610
kissed.

372
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:31,977
-[crying]

373
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,510
-That stupid jerk!

374
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:35,744
(angrily) How dare he?

375
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:36,277
How dare he?

376
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,210
How dare he?

377
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,177
And in front of Akane, no less.

378
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,410
-I'll get him!

379
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,544
-Are we on candid
camera or something?

380
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,744
Huh?

381
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:51,810
-Oh, toying with that
sweet child's emotion

382
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:55,710
like that, I really should
be ashamed of myself.

383
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:57,344
[laughs]

384
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:57,844
-Mikado!

385
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:03,344
Come on, fight me right now.

386
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:06,077
You've gone too far
this time, buddy!

387
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,177
-Ranma!

388
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,510
-Where did you come from?

389
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:10,744
Why you so angry?

390
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,377
-Now you've done it!

391
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,610
For the first time in
my life, I'm really mad!

392
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:32,010
-[muttering]

393
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,944
-That rice ball is cute!

394
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:36,910
Josephine, Josephine!

395
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,410
Gimme!

396
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,877
Ugh!

397
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,344
Gimme!

398
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,277
Ah!

399
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,710
-Hmm.

400
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,177
-Josephine, Josephine!

401
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,577
Give Azusa back her Josephine!

402
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,710
-How about it?

403
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:57,710
Let's fight.

404
00:20:57,744 --> 00:20:59,944
Or are you just
going to stand there?

405
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:02,810
-I don't know what your
grievance is with me.

406
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,277
But damaging the rink
is a serious crime.

407
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,677
I accept your challenge.

408
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,110
Come on!

409
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,244
-I'm gonna make you
sorry you were ever born!

410
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,410
-Josephine, Josephine!

411
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:19,877
You monster, you
ate my Josephine!

412
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,344
Give me my Josephine back!

413
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:25,777
Josephine, Josephine!

414
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,277
-I'm sorry!

415
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:46,978
[music playing]

416
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:16,732
-Ranma, it's your own fault
you got kissed like that.

417
00:23:16,766 --> 00:23:18,766
You left yourself wide open!

418
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,366
These two look like they
won't be easy to beat.

419
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,066
Next time on Ranma
1/2, Close Call:

420
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:25,899
The Dance of Death on Ice.

421
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:28,032
See you there!
