The battle for Ms. Beachside.

Skin melting-- must find water.

8
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:10,588
Ah!

[grumbling]

10
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:23,255
Maybe I wouldn't be
so hot and bothered

11
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:26,188
if I didn't have your fur
coat stuck to my back!

Huh?

AKANE (VOICEOVER): Uh-oh.

19
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:50,455
I wonder if this bathing suit's
too loud-- how embarrassing.

20
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:53,422
Hm?

21
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:55,188
Huh?

--[sigh] Kasumi's so
popular with all the guys.

25
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,388
They haven't even left her side
from the second we stepped out

26
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:13,622
of the changing room.

27
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:14,422
Yeah.

28
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,555
So what's the big surprise?

29
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:17,055
Guys prefer to
take their chances

30
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:18,655
going after pretty women
rather than wasting

31
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:20,155
their time with tomboys.

32
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:21,655
Yeah, I guess.

33
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:22,655
Hm?

34
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:23,355
Hey, tomboy?

35
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:25,122
Who do you mean by that?

36
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,622
I'm just saying.

37
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:28,988
I don't understand why
all these boys I don't know

38
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,422
are asking me to
go out with them.

39
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:32,255
They're obviously
after you because of how

40
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,522
you look in that swimsuit.

41
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:35,022
How do you know
they didn't hear

42
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:37,055
about my cooking or something?

43
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,855
That's probably it.

44
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:38,888
Uh.

45
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:39,888
Oh, why didn't I think of that?

46
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:40,888
You're right.

47
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,422
It's probably your cooking.

48
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,822
By the way, you didn't see
where Nabiki got to, did you?

49
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:47,988
Well, I saw her, but that
was quite a while ago.

[chatter]

51

What's going on?

52
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,588
Hi, everyone.

53
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:54,288
Hey, you over there, no
stepping over the line now.

54
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:56,022
There's room for everyone.

55
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:56,922
There she is.

56
00:03:56,955 --> 00:04:00,022
Let's get in closer.

00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:01,955
GIRL: That's so strange.

00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:02,888
He's gonna cut them.

your nice, fresh watermelon

at 150 yen a slice.

MAN: Oh, I'll take a slice.

68
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,455
Yes, sir, coming right up.

What's Kuno doing here?

74
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:27,322
Why are you asking me?

75
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:28,588
How should I know?

76
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:29,070
Hm?

77
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:33,022
Uh.

I must be hallucinating
from all this intense heat.

80
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,722
There's a mailbox
hoping this way, Akane.

81
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:42,088
Don't be silly.

82
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:44,055
Honestly.

83
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:44,655
Charge!

84
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:56,022
That mailbox-- you
don't think it's--

85
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:58,655
Uh-oh, this seems
strangely familiar.

86
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:04,188
It's got to be him.

87
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,722
AKANE: Yeah.

88
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,355
Tsubasa is at your service
once again, ladies and gents.

89

It's been a long time.

00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:14,055
Your order of veggie and
seafood okonomiyaki is up, boys.

91
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:15,688
That'll be 500 yen.

it's hot out here.

94
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:22,588
Wait a second, if it
isn't Akane and Ranma.

95
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,488
This is some coincidence,
meeting up like this.

96
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:27,655
So, dressing as a boy today?

97
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:29,655
I am a guy!

--[awkward laugh] So, uh, what
are you doing here, Tsubasa?

Actually, I'm working
at Ukyo's beach stand.

100
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:36,255
Uh-oh.

101
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:37,988
I better get a move on!

102
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,055
No time to dawdle!

103
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,288
See you later!

104
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:44,355
Come by the shop
for a bit sometime.

105
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:47,122
So Ukyo's got a stand now, too?

106
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:47,988
Weird.

107
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:49,822
TSUBASA: Charge!

108
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:51,288
Huh?

109
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:52,388
Forget it, pops.

110
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:55,555
That's a guy, not a girl.

111
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,688
Bingo.

112
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:57,722
You don't say.

113
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:59,122
That's quite the figure.

up while it's hot.

Mhm.

119
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:07,855
Sounds good to me.

120
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,988
Hey, Ukyo, how come
you hired Tsubasa

121
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:14,388
to work the stand with you?

122
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:16,122
Isn't it obvious, Ranma, honey?

123
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:17,955
'Cause it doesn't
cost me much money.

You southern gals sure know
how to stretch your yens,

125
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,255
don't you?

129
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:27,588
Ranma, you here.

130
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:32,255
Hello, everybody.

131
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:33,655
Sh-- Shampoo.

132

Ranma, Shampoo so happy
to see you here at beach.

133
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:38,688
What are you doing round here?

134
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:41,355
Setting up Shampoo's
store near here.

135
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:44,488
Ranma, you come eat
Shampoo's noodles?

136
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:45,822
Huh?

137
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:47,555
Ranma's just filled up on my
delicious veggie and seafood

138
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:50,188
okonomiyaki, so he
doesn't have any room left

139
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:52,455
for some greasy
roadside noodles.

140
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,855
Shampoo no talking to you.

141
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,822
What did you say?

142
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:59,655
Uh.

143
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:00,788
No!

144
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:03,188
What-- what's he doing here?

145
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,555
It's the ghost cat!

146
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:06,922
My bride.

147
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:08,788
I mean, who ordered some cold,
refreshing noodles, noodles

148
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:10,488
from my wifey, yeah?

149
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:13,688
Cat a little creepy, but
good worker and cheap labor.

150
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,122
MAOMOLIN: I'm back.

151
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:19,888
Yeah.

152
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,388
That was fast.

153
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:23,155
Well, good, because I've got
another delivery for you!

154
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:25,522
Nah, isn't it break time?

155
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:28,355
You'd better hurry, or
Shampoo will get mad.

156
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:31,955
Oh, you don't know how to
treat a kitty good-- despicable.

157
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:34,522
Yeah?

158
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,004
Mm.

159
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:48,422
Yeah, that girl is heaven-sent.

160
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:52,222
She'd make me the perfect bride.

161
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:54,655
You take care of this delivery.

162
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:57,188
Where do you
think you're going?

[eating noises]

164
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:01,422
Huh?

165
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:02,822
Well, I guess it is
close to lunchtime.

166
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:06,288
For today's lunch, Ranma
eat what Shampoo cook up.

167
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:07,488
Hold your horses.

168
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,355
Let's hear what Ranma
says about this.

169
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,422
Ranma no can live
on okonomiyaki alone.

170
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:15,588
My okonomiyaki is for
morning, noon, and dinnertime.

171
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:18,488
People eat it as a meal or as
a snack all around the clock

172
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:20,788
and never get tired of it.

173
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:22,788
Come on, you too.

174
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:25,088
Akane, give me a hand here.

175
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:26,755
Which one are you gonna choose?

176
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:27,322
RANMA: Oh.

177
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:33,655
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
My dearest Akane.

178
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:34,755
I hope you are well.

179
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,122
The smell of autumn
is already in the air

180
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:38,555
here in the Japanese Alps.

181
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:46,055
[squealing]

182
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:46,955
MOUSSE: Well, well.

183
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:48,088
If it isn't Ryoga.

184
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,688
[squealing]

185
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:56,555
Sad little pig-- you're looking
pathetic as ever. [laughs] Ooh!

186
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:57,555
[quacking]

187
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:58,888
[squeal]

188
00:08:58,922 --> 00:08:59,522
[quack]

189
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:00,222
[squeal]

190
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,122
What's all the racket?

191
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:01,755
Hey, look, it's a duck.

192
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:02,422
Get it.

193
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,888
[eating noises]

194
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:24,222
Excuse me, ladies.

195
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:26,888
If you're going to compete,
I have a good idea that

196
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:29,155
just might solve your problems.

197
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:30,688
What do you mean?

198
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,122
What is good idea?

199
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,222
Come here, and I'll
give you the details.

200
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:40,022
Man, this is just great.

201
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:43,188
Have you made up your mind what
you're having for lunch yet?

202
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:44,655
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

203
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:45,522
Quit rushing me.

204
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:46,722
Sure.

205
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,888
'Cause either way, it
makes no difference to me.

206
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,688
[squealing]

207
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,988
AKANE: P-chan!

208
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:53,622
Hi, baby.

209
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:56,955
What are you doing down
here all on your own?

210
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:58,588
What?

211
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:00,355
What's this thing?

212
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:03,322
Ms. Beachside contest?

213
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,955
NABIKI: Looks like
fun, don't you think?

214
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,622
Huh?

215
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:11,522
Akane, you should
enter the contest.

216
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:13,322
Ukyo and Shampoo
are going in it.

217
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:15,555
And they're betting
Ranma's lunch.

218
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:17,355
Whichever one of us
stays in the contest

219
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:21,022
the longest is the one who gets
to cook Ranma his lunch today.

220
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,188
Well, it sounds like you two
have things all figured out.

221
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,222
It won't be much of a
contest with just two.

222
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:28,155
The more people who enter
it, the better it'll

223
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:29,055
be for business.

224
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,388
AKANE: Business?

225
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,088
What's the point of a
swimsuit contest if you

226
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:33,522
don't sell tickets to the guys?

227
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,122
Think of the profit margin.

228
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:36,855
KASUMI: Oh, here you are.

229
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:38,788
What are you all up to?

230
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:42,355
Oh, Kasumi, you've got to
enter the swimsuit contest.

231
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,188
That kind of
thing's not for me.

232
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:45,488
Why don't you enter, Akane?

233
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:47,555
Don't you start in
on me now, Kasumi.

234
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:51,155
Make no difference whether
Akane enter contest or not.

235
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:52,188
Pardon?

236
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:53,222
What's that supposed to mean?

237
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:55,888
SHAMPOO: Just what Shampoo say.

238
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,955
I'm entering, too!

239
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:57,955
Then it's all settled.

240
00:10:57,988 --> 00:10:59,988
Let's go sell tickets!

241
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:02,722
TSUBASA: Charge!

242
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:04,455
I'm entering the contest!

243
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:07,888
You scrawny girls don't stand
a chance against Tsubasa!

244
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:09,155
What's this?

245
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,888
Can boys enter the
Ms. Beachside contest?

246
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:12,622
[grumbling]

247
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:21,322
Would you mind getting
away from me, Saotome?

248
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,555
You're making me hot.

249
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:23,488
[grumble]

250
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:25,288
Let's see.

251
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:27,655
That makes it four contestants.

252
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,222
[animal noises]

253
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:47,064
[chatter]

254
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:52,052
That's a whole mess of
people you got gathered there.

255
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:56,152
It's like I told you, old man--
location, location, location.

256
00:11:56,186 --> 00:11:58,552
Don't say I never
told you nothing.

257
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,419
So this is where
the contest will be?

258
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,019
KODACHI: Yes, brother dear.

259
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,686
Kodachi, you're wearing
a lot of clothes.

260
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,386
Don't you find it hot?

261
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:09,719
I thought this
white outfit would

262
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:11,386
be perfect for a summer day.

263
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:13,319
Well, if you're
OK, then let's go.

264
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:16,119
Yes, dear.

265
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,686
Kodachi, you're not
going to the contest?

266
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,386
KODACHI: [giggle]
Of course I'm going.

267
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,852
I'll wave to you from up
on the stage, brother dear.

268
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:25,919
[grunt]

269
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:30,252
KODACHI: [laughs]
Voila, Ms. Beachside!

270
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:34,019
That's what I'll be called
from now on, brother dear.

271
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,619
She's mad.

272
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:39,486
KODACHI: [giggling]

273
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,386
Hello.

274
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,986
Sorry to keep you
waiting, folks.

275
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,352
The moment you've been waiting
for-- the Ms. Beachside contest

276
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:46,986
will now begin!

277
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:47,652
Huh?

278
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:50,186
What is that thing?

279
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:53,486
SOUN: The winner will receive
this succulent pig and duck!

280
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,752
[audience oohing and aahing]

281
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:58,219
So without further delay,
ladies and gentlemen,

282
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:02,452
let's begin the contest
you've all been waiting for!

283
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:07,386
Contestant number
one, Akane Tendo.

284
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,019
Akane Tendo!

285
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:10,919
Get going, girl.

286
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:11,919
You're up.

287
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:12,719
Oh!

288
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:16,652
[crowd oohing and aahing]

00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:19,319
ALL: Wow, what a babe!

290
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:24,452

Mwah, thank you, fans!

297
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,286
MAOMOLIN: Good luck, Tsubasa!

298
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,186
You're so cute!

299
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:50,086
Yeah!

300
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,419
[gasp] [grunt]

301
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:58,686
Whoa!

302
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,852
[yelling]

303
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:00,519
[grunt]

304
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:02,019
What a performance.

305
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,252
SOUN: And now for
the last contestant--

306
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:05,319
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Huh?

307
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:06,986
There's another contestant?

308
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,319
SOUN: Contestant number
six, Ranma Saotome.

309
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,452
[crowd oohing and ahhing]

310
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:16,352
Heh.

311
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:17,819
Figured she'd show up.

312
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:20,019
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma?

313
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,152
What's he doing?

314
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:22,719
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I've
got to win this thing,

315
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:27,352
otherwise those two will
never get off my back.

316
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:29,352
First is the swimsuit category.

317
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:32,852
Now if the audience would
please cast their votes.

318
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:35,552
TATEWAKI (VOICEOVER): Akane
Tendo or the pig-tailed girl--

319
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:37,852
both of them deserve my vote.

320
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,886
Akane Tendo or the
pig-tailed girl?

321
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,552
The pig-tailed girl
or Akane Tendo?

322
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,086
Akane Tendo or the
pig-tailed? (ANGRILY)

323
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,019
The pig-tailed girl
or Akane Tendo?

324
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:49,552
I-- [stutter] I just don't know!

325
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:50,886
I can't!

326
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:53,386
How is a man supposed to
decide between the two

327
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:55,252
loves of his life?

328
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:57,786
GIRL: Just cast your darn vote!

329
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:03,119
Look at this, Mommy.

330
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,586

of the swimsuit category.

331
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:08,519
It is with enormous regret
that I must tell you

332
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:11,452
that as a result of your votes,
one person has been eliminated

333
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:12,719
from the contest.

334
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:15,552
Kodachi Kuno, thank
you for participating.

335
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:16,786
What's the deal?

336
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,919
This doesn't make any sense.

337
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:22,586
Maybe your lasso performance
scared off the voters.

338
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:25,452
How could you?
[crying] How could you?

339
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:26,986
Kodachi! [grunt]

340
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:31,219
Check out your feet.

341
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:35,119
Huh? [gasp] Oh.

342
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:48,719
So without further delay,
ladies and gentleman,

343
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:51,519
I would now like to proceed
with the singing category.

344
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:52,852
And the first will be--

345
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:56,086
Me, me, me, me, me.

346
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,219
It seems the first
performance will

347
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:00,519
be given by Tsubasa Kurenai.

348
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:02,086
You're on.

349
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,419
TSUBASA (VOICEOVER): [giggle]
My beautiful voice is gonna

350
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:06,352
blow them all out of the water.

351
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:09,752
--[inhales] (SINGING DEEPLY
AND OFF-KEY) Big boy,

352
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:14,119
I know you want me, big boy.

353
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:16,486
I've never heard
such a beautiful voice

354
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,819
in my entire life!

355
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,252
(SINGING) Big boy,
you'd do anything for me!

356
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:21,386
[grumble]

357
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,152
TSUBASA: (SINGING)
I can't feel it.

358
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:23,752
[grumble]

359
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,619
TSUBASA: [sigh] I
don't understand.

360
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:31,452
It's just not fair!

361
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:34,586
You're gonna listen
to the whole song!

362
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,086
You're gonna kill
all the voters!

363
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,586
[grumble]

364
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:40,952
But my song's not finished yet!

365
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:44,119
I won't allow you to speak
to my future bride that way!

366
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:45,119
Ah!

367
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:46,486
What is that?

368
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,519
It's the ghost cat!

369
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:49,452
MAOMALIN: My bride, my bride!

370
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,452
TSUBASA: [screams]

371
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:51,819
[explosion]

372
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:54,386
MAOMALIN: Ms.
Tsubasa, wait for me!

373
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,419
Yeah.

374
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:58,319
TSUBASA: Ah, get away from me!

375
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,486
Ah!

376
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,986
Well, it seems two more of
our contestants have withdrawn.

377
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:06,719
And seeing as time is
running short, please

378
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:08,586
cast your vote for
one of these three

379
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,219
to be the new Ms. Beachside.

380
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,952
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER):
Shampoo win, hands down.

381
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:14,686
UKYO (VOICEOVER):
This contest is mine.

382
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,452
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
I've lost it for sure.

383
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:25,619
Ah, ah!

384
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,319
Oh, that was close.

385
00:17:27,352 --> 00:17:28,519
KODACHI: Ranma, darling.

386
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,219
Ah!

387
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:31,619
KODACHI: Oh, Ranma.

388
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:34,752
What a coincidence meeting
you here of all places.

389
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,852
Uh, how's it hanging, Kodachi?

390
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:37,352
Huh?

391
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:40,086
My bride!

392
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:42,919
[screaming]

393
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:43,486
Ah!

394
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,586
Ranma, darling!

395
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:46,019
Get away, flea bag!

396
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:47,619
Hey, my bride!

397
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:50,686
[drumroll]

398
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:51,452
NABIKI: Here.

399
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:52,852
SOUN: THANK you.

400
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,852
And now I will
announce the results.

401
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:57,319
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER):
Ranma be eating

402
00:17:57,352 --> 00:18:00,686
Shampoo's delicious, nutritious
noodles in few minute.

403
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,919
UKYO (VOICEOVER): Ranma,
honey, I'll bet you're hungry.

404
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:05,886
I'll let you eat as much of
my okonomiyaki as you want.

405
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,619
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Uh, I'd give anything

406
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:11,186
to have the last 20
minutes of my life back.

407
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:11,652
[squeal]

408
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:12,586
[quack]

409
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,119
[pattering]

410
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:15,086
What is that?

411
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:15,619
Huh?

412
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:18,419
[screaming]

413
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:20,752
I will now announce the winner.

414
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:23,319
UKYO (VOICEOVER): And now
for my moment of glory.

415
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,786
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER):
Shampoo's glowing moment.

416
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:30,619
The winner of this summer's
Ms. Beachside is-- huh?

417
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,152
Thank you, thank you.

418
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,086
Hiya!

419
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,186
[fighting sounds]

420
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:37,186
And now I will announce
the winning contestant.

421
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:38,219
SHAMPOO: You want
piece of Shampoo?

422
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,119
UKYO: You want Ukyo?

423
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:39,786
I'll give you Ukyo.

424
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:40,952
SHAMPOO: I take you on.

425
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,719
UKYO: I'll shake
your little noodle.

426
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:42,919
SHAMPOO: Hiya!

427
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:46,519
The new Ms. Beachside
is my daughter--

428
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:48,119
What?

429
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:49,086
--Kasumi.

430
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,486
[crowd cheering]

431
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,086
Oh, my.

432
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,086
Aw.

433
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,086
Huh?

434
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,852
Huh?

435
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,452
Every vote--
that's what it says.

436
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:03,552
It's like they say.

437
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,086
There's no accounting for taste.

438
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,560
[pattering]

439
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,260
Hm?

440
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:07,893
Time to go.

441
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,060
Come back, Ms. Tsubasa!

442
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,460
No way!

443
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:12,227
No!

444
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,027
Ranma, darling!

445
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:26,260
[squeal]

446
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,593
[quack]

447
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:29,293
[gasp] Ranma!

448
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:31,060
I got away from them all.

449
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:31,727
SHAMPOO: Hiya!

450
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,793
Hiya, Shampoo's
stall fly to sky.

451
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:42,793
Well, I guess that means
Ranma will be eating his lunch

452
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:44,660
at my stand now for sure.

453
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:47,227
Shampoo no know about that.

454
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,893
Huh?

455
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:49,193
MAOMALIN: My bride!

456
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:50,260
TSUBASA: No!

457
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:54,493
--[scream] Get away
from my food stall!

458
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,160
This place is a mess.

459
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:59,993
Now I won't be able to get lunch
at Ukyo's or Shampoo's stall.

460
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:00,660
Wait a sec.

461
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:02,527
I know.

462
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,760
Wait right here.

463
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:05,960
Uh, hey, don't tell
me you're gonna--

464
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:06,427
Uh-oh.

465
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:07,627
Uh-oh.

466
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,260
Hi!

467
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:09,227
[groan]

468
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,427
I-- I made a bunch
of rice balls.

469
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,293
There's enough for everyone,
even for Ukyo and Shampoo, too.

470
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,327
Of all the things I
could have had for lunch,

471
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,593
and now I get stuck
eating Akane's rice balls.

472
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:28,627
You know what this
means, don't you, Saotome?

473
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,060
Mhm.

474
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:32,460
Ms. Tsubasa, sing a duet
with your future bridegroom!

475
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:34,060
[singing]

476
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:36,693
Look, if you made that kind of
lifestyle, then good for you.

477
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:39,293
But I don't go for
boys, so back off!

478
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,693
I don't care what you are.

479
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:41,893
You're beautiful to me.

480
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,460
And I'm gonna have
you for my bride!

481
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,260
I told you already!

482
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:48,827
[grunt] I'm a guy, numskull!

483
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:56,427
[laugh]

484
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,760
[rattling]

485
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:01,360
Don't beat yourself up
over it, Ms. Tsubasa.

486
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:05,660
After all, everyone has
one or two character flaws.

487
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:07,293
Blah?

488
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,993
This is all your fault!

489
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:11,060
You fix Shampoo's food stall!

490
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:12,360
And mine, too!

491
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:13,493
[grumble]

492
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:15,893
You owe us lunch
at the very least.

493
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,827
Come to me, Ranma, darling.

494
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,393
You deserve to be
punished, Ranma Saotome.

495
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,327
Where's everybody
running off to?

496
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,660
I told you, I have enough
food for all of you to eat.

497
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:28,693
You're gonna pay for
this, you lousy ghost cat!

498
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:29,727
[yelling]

499
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,593
KODACHI: Come on, get back here!

500
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:33,027
[yelling]

501
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,560
Oh, my.

502
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,627
What a fix.

503
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,260
[squeal]

504
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,860
[quack]

505
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,127
There's no telling how things
will turn out in the end, huh?

506
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:47,914
[music playing]

507
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:16,610
NARRATOR: The
heavens, the earth,

508
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:18,043
and the people call for him.

509
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:19,743
They call for him
to defeat evil.

510
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:23,743
Yes, they call for
Tatewaki Kuno, age 17.

511
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:26,543
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
The Musical Instruments

512
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:27,410
of Destruction.

513
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:28,776
We'll see you there.
