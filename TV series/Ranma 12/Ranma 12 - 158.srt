00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:43,607
SASUKE: My hometown,
Sarugakure Village.

3
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,474
it's a secluded place
high in the mountains

4
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:50,441
and shrouded in mystery.

5
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:54,607
Many ninjas live and train
in the village, not only

6
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:58,207
ninja people but
also many ninja dogs.

7
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:05,341
But for the weak, it
can be a dog's life.

8
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:12,141
In a ninja society, we are
bound by the strict rules

9
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,807
of tradition.

10
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:17,341
Unable to cope,
many ninja attempt

11
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:19,874
to run away from the clan.

12
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,074
But by doing so, the
others in the clan

13
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:25,341
have no choice but
to track them down.

14
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:30,241
AKANE (VOICEOVER): A Ninja's
Dog is Black and White.

15
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,074
I've traveled a great distance.

16
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,507
Huh?

17
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,341
A raccoon.

18
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,007
No, it's a dog.

19
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:54,207
I'll save you!

20
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,574
Here, hold on to this.

21
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:57,174
Hurry.

22
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,541
Come here, P-Chan.

23
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:18,374
Time for beddy-bye.

24
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:22,807
Hah.

25
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:24,974
Have a good sleep, P-Chan.

26
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:49,074
In the end, you were the
one that did the rescuing.

27
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:56,907
I take it you haven't
eaten for a while, eh, pup?

28
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,007
Huh.

29
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,041
You don't look like
you belong to anyone.

30
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,541
I know.

31
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,774
I'm out here on my own as well.

32
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:05,107
How about sticking together?

33
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:14,841
Get away.

34
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:15,974
This is an important letter.

35
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,107
You wouldn't understand.

36
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:24,907
My life is staked
on this letter.

37
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:25,674
Huh.

38
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,807
You wanna hear about it?

39
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,574
Her name is Akane Tendo.

40
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:34,574
She's always smiling and kind.

41
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,874
And she's got a mean punch.

42
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,541
I wrote down all my feelings
for Akane in this letter,

43
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:42,774
and I didn't hold back anything.

44
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:43,474
So someday--

45
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:48,207
What's this?

46
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:53,007
It looks like a
letter from Ryoga.

47
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,107
KASUMI: Akane, it's time to eat.

48
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:16,007
Oh, Ryoga.

49
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,741
You finally opened
up your heart to me.

50
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:22,241
I'm so glad.

51
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:22,841
Imagine!

52
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:31,574
Ranma, in Anything Goes Martial
Arts, having quick perception

53
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,141
is the key.

54
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:35,107
You must use all your senses
to perceive your surroundings

55
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:36,407
and your opponent.

56
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:39,207
There's no time for making
assessments with your eyes.

57
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,407
Got it.

58
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,041
Now get in position.

59
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:42,507
Right.

60
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,574
Good.

61
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:44,974
You ready?

62
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,407
Don't let your guard down.

63
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,574
Hey, who's the wise guy?

64
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:02,174
Huh?

65
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:06,307
Oh my.

66
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,941
What a cute little doggy.

67
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:10,974
Come here, little puppy.

68
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,074
Oh, you're such a good dog.

69
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:22,241
Smart doggy.

70
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:24,474
You could have been hurt.

71
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,807
Nice move for a dog.

72
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:28,474
How could he have
sneaked up like that

73
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:30,574
without me sensing him coming.

74
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,441
Hey, where'd that
dog come from?

75
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,507
He just wandered into our
yard all on his own, Father.

76
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,841
What a weird-looking dog.

77
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,441
I think he's kind of cute.

78
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:40,341
Give me a paw.

79
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:41,274
Come on.

80
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:42,707
I'm home.

81
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:46,907
Oh, did you do have
a nice jog, Akane?

82
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,541
Wow.

83
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,341
What a funny dog.

84
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,574
Hmm?

85
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:52,507
What's this letter
in the dog's mouth?

86
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,141
What?

87
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:55,007
For me?

88
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,441
Hmm.

89
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:58,907
Gone.

90
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,341
Gone.

91
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:03,141
My letter's gone!

92
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:06,074
You know, I haven't seen
the dog this morning either.

93
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,374
Wait.

94
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,007
More footprints.

95
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,474
Did that hound dog steal
my letter to Akane.

96
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:16,274
What is it?

97
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:18,341
What does it say, Akane?

98
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:20,941
I think it's a love letter.

99
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,541
Someone sent my
daughter a love letter?

100
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:24,941
Cool.

101
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:27,007
So this dog sniffed you
out and came all this way

102
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,107
to give you that love letter.

103
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,341
Yeah, I guess.

104
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:31,207
Something like that.

105
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:39,541
I'm done.

106
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:41,207
My, you're full already.

107
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:41,807
Yeah.

108
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,841
Hey, Daddy.

109
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:50,107
Do you have any idea who wrote
that love letter to Akane?

110
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:51,407
Not really.

111
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,207
Any idea, Saotome?

112
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,841
I'm sure it wasn't Ranma.

113
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:01,007
No kidding, Sherlock.

114
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:13,107
I'm sure this love letter
couldn't be from Ranma.

115
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,907
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
I love you, Akane.

116
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:17,574
From the first time
I laid eyes on you,

117
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,074
I've known you were
the only one for me.

118
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:23,041
You're my dream
girl, my soul mate.

119
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:26,407
I want that sweet smile
of yours all to myself.

120
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:30,874
Akane Tendo, I
would die for you.

121
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:33,141
Oh, why did I tell
her everything!

122
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:39,607
if anyone were to get a hold
of that letter to Akane--

123
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:41,774
or even worse, what
would happen if Ranma

124
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:43,507
got a hold of my love letter?

125
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,141
I couldn't bear it.

126
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:50,374
I'll have to become a moleman
and live the rest of my life

127
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,407
in this hole.

128
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:53,441
No!

129
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:54,741
Give me back that love letter!

130
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,407
Hmm.

131
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,641
Let's see.

132
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:05,507
I'm sure that dog
came into this yard.

133
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,741
Looking for something?

134
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:10,874
Nice try.

135
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:16,941
Very impressive.

136
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,641
You figured out the ninja
disappearing in the tree move.

137
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,441
Some move.

138
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,874
Hey, Sasuke.

139
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:25,041
Mind telling me what you're
doing in the backyard?

140
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:26,241
What?

141
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,341
You wouldn't be planning
on doing anything stupid,

142
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:30,341
would you?

143
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:32,474
I just need to find
that black and white dog.

144
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,507
That's all.

145
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,574
How do you know about the dog?

146
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,541
It just got here.

147
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,607
Because I'll will warn you.

148
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:39,207
That's no ordinary dog.

149
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:45,507
I wonder what I should
give him for dinner.

150
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,341
How about some rice with miso
soup and maybe a few pickles?

151
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:50,641
A deserter?

152
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,841
Hmm.

153
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:55,441
It was last night
around midnight.

154
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:56,907
Good night.

155
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,307
Sasuke.

156
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,274
Sake to me.

157
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:04,007
Huh?

158
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,974
Hey, that dog looks familiar.

159
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:10,274
Huh?

160
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:11,974
He's gone.

161
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:15,141
Wait, something's
not right here.

162
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:16,374
Hey, wait a second.

163
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:22,074
I'd seen a dog that
looked just like him.

164
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:25,374
Days before, a missing
poster for a runaway dog

165
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,707
arrived from my hometown.

166
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:31,507
I was certainly it
was that same dog.

167
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,741
You're right.

168
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:35,041
This looks like the
same dog, but then

169
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,341
who wrote that love letter?

170
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:40,674
Forget it.

171
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,741
It's nothing.

172
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:46,574
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
Now where am I?

173
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:50,041
This forest goes on forever.

174
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:53,141
Oh, what a terrible
time to be lost!

175
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,074
Maybe I should make
some smoke signals.

176
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:23,174
Don't you have to
go home now, pooch?

177
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:26,007
Of course you can
stay if you want to.

178
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,741
Hey, are you waiting
for somebody?

179
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:30,774
Huh?

180
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,541
You want me?

181
00:11:32,574 --> 00:11:34,807
Oh, I see, a reply.

182
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:43,441
Hmm.

183
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:44,241
Thanks, poochie.

184
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,874
Finally, I'm going
to get that dog.

185
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:14,622
Gotcha.

186
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:18,755
Now you're mine.

187
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:24,870
Hmm.

188
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:32,888
Hey, you're not the right dog.

189
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,588
Pigeons are getting mighty
heavy these days, aren't they?

190
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:39,955
Maybe it's a cat.

191
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:42,488
What's with all the cats and
dogs at our house these days?

192
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:44,722
It's like a zoo around here.

193
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:46,588
He got away.

194
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,822
That dog's more
skilled than I thought.

195
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:55,655
Guardians of the
ninja way, give me

196
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,722
the powers I need to catch
that transgressing dog.

197
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:01,688
Hah.

198
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:02,288
Hmm.

199
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:07,222
Huh?

200
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:14,888
Now what are those cats up to?

201
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:15,522
Why you!

202
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:21,622
Hey, Sasuke, are you all right?

203
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:24,888
The dog got away, and
he was carrying a letter.

204
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:26,188
Another one?

205
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:31,322
Master Ranma, you have
to capture that dog.

206
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,955
Hang in there, Sasuke.

207
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:36,255
[snoring]

208
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:49,622
Dirty dog.

209
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:50,922
Who's he gonna take
Akane's reply to?

210
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:56,255
I'll stop that dog
and get the letter!

211
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:02,222
Thanks for the directions.

212
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:02,988
Appreciate it.

213
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:08,955
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): First of all,
I'll go straight to the Tendos.

214
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:09,788
Huh?

215
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:10,722
Am I lost already?

216
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:14,455
Wait a second.

217
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:15,688
Where was that policeman?

218
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,488
Go away, mean doggy.

219
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:27,904
Huh?

220
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:39,355
Thank you, doggy.

221
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:43,722
How, that runaway dog
isn't all that nasty.

222
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:46,222
I wonder whatever
happened to that stray dog.

223
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:47,555
Who knows?

224
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,655
Maybe he decided that
he missed his master.

225
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,588
It was almost like he
came here for a reason.

226
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:54,488
And he left when
his job was done.

227
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:01,788
Speaking of which, when
the dog was here with us,

228
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:05,588
I decided he needed a name
so I called him Checkers.

229
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:06,422
Checkers?

230
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:09,888
Isn't that name just adorable?

231
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,688
Checkers-- now that's original.

232
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:17,288
Checkers is it?

233
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:19,955
I wonder if he delivered my
reply to that love letter.

234
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:26,822
You won't get away this time.

235
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,055
The same dog?

236
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:41,455
What?

237
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:42,688
Did he come back with his
friends to get revenge?

238
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,255
I get it.

239
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,388
He can't attack by
biting 'cause he's

240
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:08,555
got that letter in his mouth.

241
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:10,488
So he can't cause much damage.

242
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:11,622
Precisely.

243
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,088
And he won't drop the
letter and attack them

244
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,155
since he wants to
complete his mission.

245
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,055
Hey, where did you come from?

246
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:19,355
I'm caught up on my sleep now.

247
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:21,022
Comfortable roof.

248
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:22,155
Enough of this small talk.

249
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,055
Now let's go get that dog!

250
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,155
Don't look at me.

251
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:26,488
You're the one yapping.

252
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:29,688
That ninja dog is very
brave, almost as brave

253
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,822
as a ninja like me.

254
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:39,388
They've got him cornered.

255
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:41,855
I don't know he'll
get out of this one.

256
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,322
That poor dog.

257
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:46,122
Sasuke, what's say
we help him out?

258
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,755
Count me in.

259
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:48,555
Stop right there!

260
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:53,888
It's Ryoga.

261
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:54,788
You dirty dogs!

262
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:57,188
Ganging up on one pooch?

263
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:59,188
You'll have to get
through me first.

264
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:00,388
Bakusai Tenketsu!

265
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,122
Had enough, or you want more?

266
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:14,288
I warn you.

267
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:16,522
Next time you won't
get off so easy.

268
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:18,855
[whimpering]

269
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:24,888
Can't say I blame 'em
for running away from me.

270
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:30,355
You OK, boy?

271
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:36,822
Cut it out.

272
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,588
That tickles.

273
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:40,522
Huh?

274
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:41,955
Where do they know
each other from?

275
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:49,422
That's a letter.

276
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:54,855
It's from Akane.

277
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:57,355
Did she give this to you?

278
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:58,788
I don't believe this.

279
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:00,622
So you must have given
Akane my letter, then stuck

280
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:04,155
around waiting for her
to give you this reply.

281
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:05,355
Oh, you're the best.

282
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:10,288
Um, I wonder what she wrote me.

283
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,688
Thank you very much
for your letter.

284
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,955
After reading it, I
think I understand

285
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:20,488
how you feel about me.

286
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:22,655
Akane said I understand
how you feel,

287
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:28,222
which must mean I must
be the luckiest guy

288
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:29,788
on the entire Earth.

289
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:33,722
I finally got through to
Akane with my love letter!

290
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:35,788
You're the best friend
a guy could ever have.

291
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,855
Oh, thank goodness
that idiot Ranma didn't

292
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:39,755
get hold of my precious letter!

293
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:41,488
What about that idiot Ranma?

294
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:42,011
Huh?

295
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:45,688
Ranma?

296
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:46,788
So you're the lover boy.

297
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:48,722
I never woulda guessed
you were the one who

298
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:49,822
wrote that love letter.

299
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:51,088
Huh.

300
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:52,222
I don't know what
you're talking about.

301
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,455
Don't play stupid
with me, Ryoga.

302
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:55,255
Got that letter
from Akane is proof

303
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,855
that you wrote the first letter.

304
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:59,755
Ranma, even if Akane and
I have been writing letters

305
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:03,322
to each other, it's nobody's
business but our own.

306
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:06,222
On the other hand, maybe
you should hear for yourself

307
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:08,522
what Akane has to say to me.

308
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:09,755
But be warned.

309
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:12,555
Because from now on, things
will never be the same.

310
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,388
Are you ready?

311
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:16,322
I don't want any bawling now.

312
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,422
Thank you very much
for your letter.

313
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:20,122
After reading it, I
think I understand

314
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:23,022
how you feel about me.

315
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:24,722
But unfortunately
at this time, I'm

316
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:30,955
unable to return
your feelings for me.

317
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:31,555
Hah-hah.

318
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:36,888
Hey, what did it say, Ryoga?

319
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:42,422
Ryoga, you're starting
to freak me out.

320
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:42,904
Huh?

321
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:49,255
Thank you very much
for your letter.

322
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,055
After reading it, I
think I understand

323
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:52,488
how you feel about me.

324
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:54,522
AKANE (VOICEOVER): But
unfortunately at this time,

325
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:57,255
I'm unable to return
your feelings for me.

326
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:59,588
I'm in love with
someone already.

327
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:03,722
I don't mean to hurt you, but
I want you to know the truth.

328
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:04,688
From Akane Tendo.

329
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:12,555
Huh?

330
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:13,355
Oh.

331
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:15,155
Anybody in there?

332
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:17,088
I don't suppose by
any chance you forgot

333
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:19,422
to sign your name, Ryoga?

334
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:19,988
Huh?

335
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:21,455
Take a look.

336
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,855
It says "to whom it may
concern" on the envelope instead

337
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:24,822
of a name.

338
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:26,088
Oh.

339
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:28,088
Come to think of it--
so in other words,

340
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:31,255
Akane wrote that without knowing
that I was the one who sent her

341
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:32,222
the letter.

342
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:34,022
Looks like.

343
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:35,155
I see.

344
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,422
Now it makes sense.

345
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:45,422
So in other words, it might
be me that she's in love with!

346
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:52,422
Sure, you wish.

347
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:55,755
Ranma?

348
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,622
Yeah?

349
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:58,355
I'll see you. .

350
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:01,922
What?

351
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:02,822
Let's go!

352
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:23,255
Hey, what are you
burning that for?

353
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:24,755
I'm giving him his freedom.

354
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:46,489

355
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:16,657
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
The Tendo Household

356
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,990
is in an uproar with
an approaching typhoon.

357
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,424
But the typhoon
isn't the only thing

358
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:23,157
nearing the Tendo residence.

359
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,690
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
The Tendo Dragon Legend.

360
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:28,057
We'll see you there.
