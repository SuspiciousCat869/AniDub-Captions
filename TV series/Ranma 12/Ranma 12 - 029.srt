00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,833
NARRATOR: Meet Ranma
Saotome of the Anything

00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,633
Goes school of martial arts.

4
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,266
-Here we go!

5
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,566
-Hi-yah!

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,500
NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo training hall.

7
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:45,500
-What are you doing?

8
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,833
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

9
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,600
to marry by their
loving parents.

10
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:49,866
-I didn't ask for this.

11
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,366
-Who asked you?

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,833
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

13
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,233
-What'd you do that for?

14
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,066
NARRATOR: When Ranma's
splashed with cold water,

15
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,666
he becomes a she.

16
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:14,242
-Watch.

17
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:26,156
-Incredible!

18
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,523
-Behold, the technique
preserved through 3,000 years

19
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:31,689
of Chinese Amazon history,
the Breaking Point or Bakusai

20
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:32,823
Tenketsu.

21
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:34,189
-Bakusai Tenketsu?

22
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:36,989
-Can I defeat Ranma
using the Breaking Point?

23
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,823
-Well, now, shall
I teach it to you?

24
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:41,356
-Oh, would you?

25
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,856
Oh, please, if it helps me
defeat Ranma, I'll do anything.

26
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,356
Please, teach it to me.

27
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:51,556
RANMA (VOICEOVER): The breaking
point, Ryoga's great revenge.

28
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,323
-Yo, Pop.

29
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,523
I don't believe this.

30
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,856
Stupid old man.

31
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,656
As soon as I turn my back on
him, he runs for the hills.

34
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,723
COLONGE: Oh, good grief.

35
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:48,189
Look at the miserable fool.

36
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,656
How many times do
I have to tell you?

37
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,156
Look for the breaking point.

38
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:03,923
Listen to me.

39
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:06,056
You must learn to find
the breaking point

40
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:08,523
using your mind and
not with your eyes.

-Ryoga, you fool.

45
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:25,623
If you cannot master this,
the simplest of techniques,

46
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:28,756
you haven't got a chance
of defeating Ranma.

47
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,289
You will lose.

48
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:31,771
-Ranma!

-Huh?

52
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:49,405
Mr. Saotome.

53
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:49,887
-Uhh?

54
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:01,587
-Hm?

55
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,020
RANMA: Ha!

56
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,153
Ha.

57
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:05,753
Ha!

58
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,020
Huh?

59
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:14,920
Yo, Pop.

60
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:16,053
What are you doing here?

61
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,053
I thought you took
off hours ago.

62
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:17,920
What?

63
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,220
Did you get lonely?

64
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,920
-I was on reconnaissance.

65
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,087
Know thy enemy and know thyself.

66
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,787
That's a prime tenet of the
Saotome school of Anything

67
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,753
Goes Martial Arts.

68
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,220
-You mean, in
other words, you've

69
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:31,620
been sneaking around
and spying on Ryoga.

70
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:32,587
Look, Pop.

71
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,653
Don't be putting
yourself out for me.

72
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:36,253
I'll be just fine.

73
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,653
Ryoga ain't got a chance.

74
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:40,653
-Well, since you seem
so confident, boy--

75
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,987
-Huh?

76
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,253
What are you doing?

77
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:45,520
-Digging your grave, boy.

78
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,887
It may be the last
thing I can do for you.

79
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,653
-Hey!

80
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:49,553
That's bad luck.

81
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:51,753
Quit it.

82
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,087
-Listen to me, Ranma.

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,053
Your rival is learning the
deadly Breaking Point technique

84
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:56,887
as we speak.

85
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:00,287
-Huh?

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,153
Breaking Point?

87
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,720
-None other.

88
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:05,220
Everything in nature has its
own breaking point-- mountains,

89
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:07,687
snakes, frogs, dogs,
birds-- even insects.

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,820
Any one of them
can be obliterated

91
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,987
with a touch of a finger.

92
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,953
Even the human body.

93
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:16,320
-Even the human body?

94
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:19,187
Where in heck's the
breaking point for that?

95
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,487
-Foolish boy!

96
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,253
If we knew that, the
technique would be ours!

97
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:27,787
I saw him practicing
it with my own eyes.

98
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,887
-So like, OK.

99
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Whatever, but what about
if I stay away from him?

100
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:33,553
How's about that?

101
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:35,153
What if he can't even touch me?

102
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,987
It'll be-- huh?

103
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,820
-Let's test that theory, boy.

104
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:42,053
Ah-ow!

105
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:43,653

GENMA: If you can stun the
bees without being stun,

108
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,653
then you'll be safe
from the Breaking Point.

109
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:49,520
Otherwise--

110
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:50,120
-Ha!

111
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:51,453
Just watch me.

Ow!

Argh.

[grunts] Are you OK?

You poor guy!

124

COLONGE: Did he faint again?

125
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:32,002
I've told him, over and over,
see with the mind and not

126
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,535
with the eyes.

127
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,169
-But don't you think he's
had quite enough for one day?

128
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:39,602
COLONGE: If you're so worried
about the poor boy's welfare,

129
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:43,269
why don't you give up on Ranma
and devote yourself to Ryoga?

130
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:44,369
-Excuse me?

RYOGA: [groaning]

-Oh, Ryoga.

-Hold, woman.

134
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,269
Don't interfere where
you're not wanted, got that?

As far as I'm
concerned, (SHOUTING)

136
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:57,002
defeating Ranma is the

142
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:28,569
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I
don't care what it takes,

00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:30,735
no matter how dangerous.

144

Stupid, stupid, stupid, Akane,
no way I'm going to lose.

145
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:35,635
No way.

146
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:40,469
-OK, any time.

147
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,469
-All right, prepare yourself.

148
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,069
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Not with
the eyes, but with the mind.

149
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,535
See with the mind's eye.

150
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:59,269
-Yeah.

151
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:01,769
[shouting]

152
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,702

153
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:12,302
-No way!

154
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,702
I felt it.

155
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:16,169
-If you'd just clear your
mind like I told you,

156
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:17,535
you'd be able to do it.

157
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:18,202
-Oh, no!

158
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,402
Now, you listen up.

159
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,069
The only thing that's
on my mind right

160
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,102
now is how I'm going
to defeat Ranma.

161
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:26,502
My mind is absolutely clear.

162
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:27,169
-Hm?

163
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:28,602
AKANE: Hey, you two.

164
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,602
Dinner!

165
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,902
-Wha?

166
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:32,869
We'll be right down, Akane.

167
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:34,702
[laughs]

168
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:36,702
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Why
is he laughing like that?

169
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,735
Could it be that he's-- oh, no.

170
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:42,269
Has he learned the
Breaking Point already?

171
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:42,869
Ranma!

172
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,602
Ryoga's been practicing so
hard, I can't hardly believe it.

173
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:53,369
It's already been six
days since I left Ranma.

174
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:55,035
Is he taking care of himself?

175
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,069
Is he eating properly?

176
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:01,869
-Ah, there's nothing like
catching your won dinner.

177
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,002
How's yours coming out?

178
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:03,702
-Huh?

179
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,269
Oh, fine.

180
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:08,535
[gags] That's weird.

181
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,235
I guess I made another
mistake somewhere.

182
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:13,802
[laughs] That's OK.

183
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:16,902
Unlike Ranma, at least Ryoga
likes the taste of my cooking.

184
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:21,502
-If things are so bad between
you, why not accept Ryoga?

185
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:24,469
Give up on Ranma, and
let Shampoo marry him.

186
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:26,335
Everyone would be much happier.

187
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:30,569
-Well, maybe it would make
you happy, but not me.

188
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,702
-So you intend to keep my
son-in-law for yourself then?

189
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:34,369
-Who said that?

190
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:36,235
I didn't say that!

191
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,269
-Shh.

192
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,169
Uh, I just sensed something.

193
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:41,169
-Well, what?

194
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:42,069
-Hey!

195
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:42,669
Wait!

196
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:47,402
AKANE (VOICEOVER): It's Ryoga.

197
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,035
-I feel it!

198
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,969
Bakusai Tenketsu!

199
00:10:57,002 --> 00:10:57,935
-Oh, Ryoga!

200
00:10:57,969 --> 00:11:00,402
-That a boy, Ryoga!

201
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:02,435
-Heh, I got you now, Ranma.

202
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:15,602
-All right!

203
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:25,635
-At last, the day is here.

204
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,302
-By the time this
sun sets, you'll

205
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,835
be begging for your life, Ranma.

206
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:33,035
[laughs]

207
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,202
-Ranma.

208
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:34,802
No.

209
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,869
-I've been waiting
for this, Ranma.

210
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,069
AKANE: Hey!

211
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:50,335
What's the big idea of
kidnapping me in my sleep?

212
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:51,835
This was your idea!

213
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:52,502
-Patience.

214
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,902
It'll be over soon.

215
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,669
Well, now, are we both
clear on the terms?

216
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:59,335
The winner will get Akane Tendo.

217
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:02,102
If Ryoga wins, he and
Akane will be a couple.

218
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:05,135
Then you, son-in-law,
become Shampoo's bridegroom.

219
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:08,035
That way, everyone is happy,
and we have peace at last.

220
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,169
-All right, look here.

221
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,935
-Oh, now I get it.

222
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:14,902
So that's why you went and
sided with Ryoga against me.

223
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,335
-You be quiet!

224
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,469
I've come here to do one
thing, and that's defeat you

225
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:19,335
and nothing else.

226
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,802
Do you understand?

227
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:24,735
All my training and my
hardship has come down to this!

228
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:25,369

You can't even focus.

-Ah, shut up, Ranma!

-Oh, let me guess.

237
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:05,966
This is some kind
of smokescreen.

AKANE (VOICEOVER): It's obvious
that's Ranma's going to win.

239
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,699
Ryoga is always in the
center of the blast,

240
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,999
so he keeps getting hit
with those rock pieces.

241
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:24,132
Ranma isn't taking
any damage at all.

242
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,666
Why did Ryoga suffer so much
to learn that technique?

243
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:34,032
Was all his training
for nothing?

244
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,232
I can't believe she'd
let him lose like this.

245
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:39,066
COLONGE (VOICEOVER):
[chuckles] You'll

246
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:43,499
learn the true terror of the
Bakusai Tenketsu soon enough.

247
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,766
-Hey, give it up, man.

248
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,632
Those rocks are hurting
you more than me.

-Shut up!

250
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,366
-I guess I'll have to put
you out of you misery.

251
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,932
Heh, that was easy.

-That didn't hurt at all, Ranma.

259
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:19,781
It's felt like a baby's kick!

-What did you say?

261
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:24,314
I kicked you hard enough to bust
that stupid head of yours open!

262
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:25,348
Of course it hurt!

wasted at all.

333
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,430
How was that?

334
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:04,696
Bet you felt that one.

335
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,996
-That's strange.

336
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,830
The rebound he got off
that tree shouldn't

337
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:08,863
have been that effective.

338
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:09,930
-What did you say?

339
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,630
RYOGA: Now you've done it!

340
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,963
[shouts]

341
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:18,263
AKANE (VOICEOVER): No
rebound this time, either.

342
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:18,996
That's it!

343
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,596
That's got to be it!

344
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,196
It looks like a single
attack, but he's

345
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,596
using the Chestnut fist to hit
the same spot over and over.

346
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,330
He could win after all!

347
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:30,596
-We'll see about that.

348
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:36,796
-Did it work?

349
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,930
Did I-- beat him?

350
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:46,530
-There's no chance of
Ranma winning this fight.

351
00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:48,730
-Huh?

352
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:51,863
But how can you say that?

353
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,496
You saw what he did.

354
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,796
Huh?

355
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,963
-It's not over yet--
not by a long shot.

356
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:08,996
[chuckles]

357
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,396
RANMA (VOICEOVER): He's
some kind of monster.

358
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:16,930
-Those punches are good, but how
long can you keep it up, Ranma?

359
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,330
RANMA (VOICEOVER): He's right.

360
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,830
If he keeps this up, he's
going to wear me down.

361
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:23,163
Man, I got to think
of something fast.

362
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:24,163
-Surrender!

363
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:26,063
-Hey, don't just stand there.

364
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:26,696
-Eat this!

365
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,063
Bakusai Tenkestu!

366
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:32,096
-Oh, no!

367
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,396
Ranma!

368
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,130
-[grunts]

369
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:35,796
-Now, Ryoga!

370
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,763
This is the end.

371
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:38,363
Haaaaaa!

372
00:18:44,563 --> 00:18:50,630
-[groans]

373
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,596
-[gasp]

374
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,196
-I won.

375
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,563
[shouts]

376
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:04,563
AKANE: Ranma!

377
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:05,196
Hey!

378
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,059
Ranma!

379
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,130
-Oh, well.

380
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:14,130
RANMA: [breathing heavily]

381
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,330
-Ryoga, you big jerk.

382
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:27,430
Just look you now.

383
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:41,696
[whirring noise]

384
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,930
-What a pity.

385
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:44,330
Here I went through
all that trouble

386
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:47,663
to train Ryoga so he'd take
the girl away from you.

387
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:49,230
That's my son-in-law, though.

388
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:52,530
-Why you-- how dare you teach
an unstable type like Ryoga

389
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:54,663
a dangerous trick like that?

390
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:56,796
-What dangerous
trick do you mean?

391
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,230
-[gasp] [shouts]

392
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,096
-You don't mean this little
old Bakusai Tenketsu?

393
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,863
-[shouts]

394
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:03,163
-Oh, relax.

395
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:05,830
The Bakusai Tenketsu
Breaking Point technique

396
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:08,063
was developed for
work in the quarries.

397
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:10,463
It has no effect
on the human body.

398
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:11,296
-[whimpering]

399
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,330
-Did you hear me?

400
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:13,330
No effect, I said.

401
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:21,630
-It's lucky for you
that I'm not the type

402
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,463
to hold a grudge, Rama.

403
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:24,696
Give my best to Akane.

404
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,296
Farewell.

405
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:38,630
-It's Bushido for a
defeated warrior to leave.

406
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:42,563
We won't see him
around for some time.

407
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:43,596
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Ryoga.

408
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,030
[dog barking]

409
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:55,363
-You two should slow down.

410
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:56,796
You'll make yourself sick.

411
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,696
-Give me more.

412
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,330
-All right.

413
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:02,630
-Ah, there's nothing like a
home-cooked meal, is there?

414
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,596
KASUMI: Here you go.

415
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,330
AKANE: Oh, look!

416
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:07,263
P-chan.

417
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,263
Just in time.

418
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:10,996
Let's have some
dinner, OK? [giggles]

419
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:18,630
-I thought you were going to
make yourself scarce, porky.

420
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:20,530
-Quiet, I won't have
you bullying him now

421
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:22,296
that he's finally home again.

422
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,330
-[squeals]

423
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,963
-Oh, so much for not
holding a grudge.

424
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,930
RYOGA: W-wh-what do
you think you're doing?

425
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:33,630
You cut that out.

426
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:35,263
AKANE: Oh, get over it, Ranma.

427
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:37,830
I can't believe you're
jealous of P-chan.

428
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,157
[music playing]

429
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:16,178
AKANE (VOICEOVER): What?

430
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:17,545
A dojo destroyer?

431
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:19,892
How can Ranma go on a date with
Shampoo at a time like this?

432
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,592
Well, I'll defend the Tendo
training hall all by myself

433
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,825
if I have to.

434
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:27,225
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
"Danger at the Tendo Dojo."

435
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,025
See you there.
