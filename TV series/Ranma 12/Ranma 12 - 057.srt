00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,487
When that time comes,
you'll know what to do.

167
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:50,720
It's all written
down in my will.

168
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,120
SOUND AND GENMA: Master!

169
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,487
No!

170
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:56,853
HAPPOSAI: [gasping for air]

171
00:07:56,953 --> 00:08:00,620
-If anything ever happened to
him, I don't know what I'd do.

172
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,587
-However, there's
a good possibility

173
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:05,687
that this time the
master may not recover.

174
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:06,953
-True.

175
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,487
Snow in the middle of summer,
ravens on the rooftop--

176
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:11,787
all signs are
pointing to the worst.

177
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,120
-Can the Anything Goes
School of Martial Arts

178
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,920
survive the loss
of the master who

179
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,553
founded its techniques
in the first place?

180
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:19,587
Is this the end?

181
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:20,387
-No!

182
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:21,853
Not so long as we're alive!

183
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:24,053
The Anything Goes School is
something for which we've

184
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,853
shed blood, sweat, and tears.

185
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:27,620
Are you ready to
throw it all away?

186
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,153
We have to do
something, whatever

187
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,920
it takes to make
sure it goes on.

188
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,453
-For our school, no
sacrifice can be too great.

189
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:37,120
-Whatever it takes, Tendo.

190
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,353
That's what we've got to do.

191
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,253
SOUND AND GENMA: Hmm!

192
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:45,087
[wind howling]

193
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:47,287
-[gasps] That has to be it.

194
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,253
Tarot cards, crystal
ball, Ouija board.

195
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:52,087
No matter what fortune-telling
method I use to try and predict

196
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,920
the future, the result
always comes out the same.

197
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,420
Something awful is about to
happen at the Tendo residence.

198
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
And it's probably
already started.

199
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,287
It's the old man,
just as I've foreseen.

200
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,220
He's destined to bring disaster.

201
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:11,220
-I think Pop and your dad were
up with the old man all night.

202
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,087
-Too bad it took something
like this for them

203
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,520
to finally be nice
to him, huh, Ranma?

204
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,953
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

205
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:18,753
-He is their master, after all.

206
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,753
It's only natural
that they're worried.

207
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,487
-Something was wrong
with him, though.

208
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:23,687
That's for sure.

209
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,887
I don't think we should
be too worried about him.

210
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:28,420
He'll be back to his
obnoxious self in no time.

211
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,420
-I hope you're right.

212
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,253
RANMA: Huh?

213
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:31,087
AKANE: Huh?

214
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:32,487
RANMA: What the heck is that?

215
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:35,387
Gee, what's the celebration for?

216
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,520
AKANE: It's in here too.

217
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,920
Nabiki, what's--

218
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,587
-Your future is about to
be decided in the dojo.

219
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:46,120
So you lovebirds had best
hurry up and get over there.

220
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,653
RANMA: OK.

221
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,287
We're here.

222
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,653
What do you want?

223
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:51,587
-I'm sure you both are aware
that the master's condition has

224
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:53,720
only gotten worse,
and that the master

225
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,787
himself seems to have somehow
lost the will to live.

226
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,153
Ranma, while the master
is still alive to see it,

227
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:03,887
I want you and Akane to wed,
to carry on the Anything Goes

228
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:04,820
School.

229
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,487
-What?!

230
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:06,653
-Marriage?

231
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,987
-Ranma, my boy,
it is your destiny

232
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,287
to sire enough children
to carry on the Anything

233
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:13,820
Goes School for
generations to come.

234
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,820
-Akane, it may be
asking a lot of you.

235
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,753
But you've known for a long
time now that it's your destiny

236
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,687
to be a good wife to Ranma.

237
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,220
-The ceremony will be held five
days from now in this dojo.

238
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,620
-As your future father-in-law,
son, I thank you.

239
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,620
-Thank you, Akane.

240
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,253
-Five days from now?

241
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,587
-I know it's an emergency.

242
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,020
But they're still
in high school.

243
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,687
Isn't it too soon?

244
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:40,720
-Seeing as it's not
a real marriage,

245
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,120
and there's no sense in
spending more than we have to,

246
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,753
how would you feel about
cold cuts and a no-host bar?

247
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:49,220
[thunder]

248
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,087
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Akane, please be patient.

249
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:54,220
I'll be showering you with
souvenirs before you know it.

250
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,620
The strange feeling in the
air worries me, though.

251
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,520
Shouldn't it be the
middle of summer?

252
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,953
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

253
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:03,953
[rain]

254
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:04,953
RANMA: Oh, great.

255
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:05,753
This is all I need!

256
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:33,216
[rain]

257
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,752
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I
can hardly believe it.

258
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:44,118
But if Master Happosai
doesn't get better soon,

259
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:48,352
five days from now Ranma
and I will be married!

260
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,152
-Stop worrying, Akane.

261
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,085
I'm telling you, this marriage
ain't never gonna happen.

262
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:55,918
It's gonna take a lot more than
this to stop the old freak.

263
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:59,052
I'll bet you money it's just
an act to try and scare us.

264
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,185
-You really think so?

265
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:00,885
[window rattling]

266
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:03,285
-Who's there?

00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:04,252
[pig squealing]

268
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:07,118
-If it isn't P-Chan!

269
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:08,085
Ah!

270
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,852
[laughing] Look at you.

271
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:10,618
You're soaking wet.

272
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:12,585
You poor baby.

273
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,252
You must be so cold.

274
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:15,752
Let Mommy warm
you up in her bed.

275
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:21,852
AKANE: Honey!

276
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,118
-Huh?

277
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:24,285
-Honey, look.

278
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:25,618
RANMA: Hello, darling.

279
00:12:25,718 --> 00:12:27,585
-Look what the storm brought--
our little bundle of you.

280
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:29,318
He looks just like you.

281
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:29,885
Ah!

282
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,885
-Oh, let me see.

283
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:42,818
[screams] [panting] Oh,
it was just a dream.

284
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:45,885
Oh, that's all it was.

285
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:51,685
[squealing]

286
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:55,485
After that, I don't think
I'll ever dare sleep again.

287
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:56,952
Huh?

288
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:59,985
Guess I'm not the
only one who's awake.

289
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,818
Akane.

290
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:03,585
What the heck's the
matter with you, Akane?

291
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:05,985
What, are you
sleepwalking or something?

292
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,152
-Ranma.

293
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:09,685
What are you doing here?

294
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:13,118
RANMA: Well, I, uh-- let's
just say I had a bad dream,

295
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:15,318
thought I'd come in
and work out a bit.

296
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:17,185
-What kind of a bad dream?

297
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:19,685
-J-- just, uh, you know, bad.

298
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:20,518
-Uh-huh.

299
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:21,952
-I'd rather not talk about it.

300
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:26,952
Um, Akane.

301
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:28,418
-Y-- yes?

302
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:31,518
RANMA: I'm, uh, you know,
still trying to get used to it.

303
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:35,285
It's not that I mind doing what
they're asking but, you know,

304
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:36,918
looking after the
dojo and stuff.

305
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,918
It might not be that bad.

306
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,218
[screams]

Aggh!

309
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:51,918
Ow, that hurt, you little-- uh!

310
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:54,352
So now what did I do
to tick you off, huh?

311
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,585
What are you suddenly
attacking me for, huh?

312
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:57,285
[pig growling]

313
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:59,152
Uh, c-- calm down now.

314
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,552
No need to, uh-- ah!

315
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:02,118
Mr. P!

316
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:02,818
That's enough!

317
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:03,918
That's enough, I said!

318
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:07,118
-Wh- why is P-Chan so
upset all of a sudden?

319
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:08,052
RANMA: OK!

320
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:08,618
OK!

321
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:09,159
Now cut it out!

322
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:09,826
Ow!

323
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:10,926
What did you do that for?

324
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:11,467
Hey!

325
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:12,426
That hurt!

326
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,126
What's the matter
with you, P-Chan?

327
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:19,093
-Ah, look what time it is?

328
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,993
Hey, why didn't you guys and
wake me up for school, huh?

329
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:24,459
-Relax, Akane.

330
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,826
There's a flood
warning at school

331
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:26,959
because of the heavy rain.

332
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,693
So we're off the hook
for a couple of days.

333
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:29,993
-Ah, what a relief.

334
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:31,926
That's great.

335
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,293
Hey where's Dad and--

336
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:34,693
-We think it's
nervous exhaustion.

337
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:35,793
-Huh?

338
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:36,959
-The both of them have
taken to their beds.

339
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,759
-Oh, Master, no.

340
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,326
D-- d-- don't-- don't leave us.

341
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:44,959
No.

342
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:45,593
-Oh, Master.

343
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:46,959
School.

344
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:47,859
We must protect--

345
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:04,593
-Hello, Akane.

346
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:05,293
Come in.

347
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:07,693
I've been expecting you.

348
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:10,026
I know it looks a little
strange, but trust me.

349
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,659
I know what I'm doing.

350
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,726
So what is it you wish to know?

351
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,459
-So it's Happosai's
illness that's

352
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,826
causing all this trouble?

353
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:17,726
-His illness?

354
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:18,559
Oh, no.

355
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,459
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.

356
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,026
The cause of his problem
isn't his illness.

357
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:26,293
It's his exhausted lifespan.

358
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,526
-His lifespan?

359
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,359
-I've been doing some research.

360
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,893
Although the old man was born
under an extremely lucky star,

361
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:35,659
once every 100 years the
alignment of the stars

362
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,759
becomes extremely unlucky.

363
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:39,859
AKANE: But, well,
I don't understand.

364
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,426
MIYO : Four days from now
will be the critical point.

365
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,993
That's when it will all
end one way or the other.

366
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:49,859
The scary thing is, since his
luck has been so good so far,

367
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,359
when it turns bad, it's
going to be really bad.

368
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,226
There could be a
terrible whiplash effect.

369
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:56,559
-But what should I--

370
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,193
-Don't look so gloomy.

371
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:02,493
I think I may have
a way to help you.

372
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:03,826
See?

373
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:06,226
It's all in here.

374
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:09,493
Every folk remedy of its type
collected everywhere from China

375
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,593
to Europe.

376
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:13,326
All the ingredients are
clearly written out.

377
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:16,226
AKANE: But-- but
where would I get--

378
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:17,959
MIYO : I said don't worry.

379
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:20,626
With all these jars I have, I'll
make you a little care package.

380
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:21,826
-Oh, Miyo.

381
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:22,859
Thank you.

382
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,193
-You'll need to boil
it for three days.

383
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:28,093
It's all up to you now, Akane.

384
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:32,159
Remember, we're dealing with
some powerful forces here.

385
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,926
There's always a chance
things could backfire.

386
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,726
So be extra careful.

387
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:37,759
-Ugh.

388
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,759
Like Miyo said, it's
all up to me now.

389
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:41,759
The future depends on it.

390
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,526
I've got to give it my best.

391
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,326
Mm.

392
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,359
-What is that girl doing?

393
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,993
-She said something
about a fold remedy.

394
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,693
Whatever it is, she
seems determined.

395
00:16:54,593 --> 00:17:01,126
--[grunting] Stupid P-C. He
wasn't holding back at all.

396
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,759
What could I have done
to tick him off so much?

397
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,559
Come on, P-Chan!

398
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:09,459
Cut it out!

399
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,326
What are you so mad about?

400
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:14,359
[pig squealing]

401
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,893
How can I know what I
did unless you tell me!

402
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:17,659
[pig squealing]

403
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,493
Fine, then.

404
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:20,126
If that's the way you want it--

405
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:26,593
[screaming]

406
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:29,593
[gurgling]

407
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:31,593
Ryoga!

408
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:32,134
Ryoga!

409
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:40,359
Little jerk's probably
washed out to sea by now.

410
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,226
Who knows when he'll
come back. [grunting]

411
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:44,893
AKANE: OK.

412
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:45,926
Let's see now.

413
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:49,126
What am I forgetting?

414
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:50,926
Eye of newt, check.

415
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,226
Toe of frog, check.

416
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:53,767
Hmm.

417
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,693
-Oh my-- what is she making?

418
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:03,126
-She must be making
her folk remedy.

419
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:05,559
-Talk about the cure being
worse than the disease.

420
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,559
-Hey, everyone.

421
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,026
I'm home!

422
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,559
[gasps] What is that smell?

423
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,726
-I've always loved you, Kasumi.

424
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:36,126
-Nabiki, we're not dead yet.

425
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:37,759
Akane's still up and about.

426
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:38,826
-I know.

427
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,826
That's precisely what
I'm worried about.

428
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:42,626
Ugh.

429
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:43,626
She must be getting closer.

430
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,493
-Hey, how are you guys feeling?

431
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:46,326
Here.

432
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,559
I brought you some nice gruel.

433
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,293
-We'll eat it!

434
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,159
We'll eat it already!

435
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,426
Just close the door!

436
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:51,726
-Good job, Akane.

437
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,126
I'll take it from here.

438
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:55,026
You just run along now.

439
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:56,993
-Hmm?

440
00:18:57,093 --> 00:19:01,493
The whole family is depending
on me finishing this medicine.

441
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:04,793
If it'll work for Happosai,
it should work for them, too.

442
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:08,693
It's done!

443
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:15,026
Ah, there's still time.

444
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,993
-Uhhh.

445
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:26,459
[gulps] [screams]

446
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,193
-Don't die!

447
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:28,159
Don't die!

448
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:29,559
Oh, no!

449
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:30,493
Wake up!

450
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:35,459
-Seems he didn't make it.

451
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,126
Ah, well, there's no
flying in the face of

452
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:40,093
Huh?

453
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:41,059
wh-- wh-- what?

454
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,459
AKANE: I killed Happosai!

[sobbing]

456
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:55,393
-I feel I've been granted
a new lease on life.

457
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:56,659
-Wh-- what-- what's happening?

458
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,059
What's going on?

459
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,593
-The medicine must be working.

460
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:05,426
-Akane, you saved me!

461
00:20:05,526 --> 00:20:08,893
AKANE: Glad you're
feeling better.

just stepped on my grave.

-I've brought you some medicine.

00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,059
I made it by myself.

469
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,693
Drink up and you'll
feel all better.

470

-I'm-- I'm feeling much better.

I-- why don't you
make Pop drink it.

472

-Oh, don't worry.

473
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:31,426
There's plenty to go around.

better too, actually.

to your father now.

How about a drink?

He's got more energy
than men half his age.

490
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:01,882
AKANE: Hey, good
morning, you guys.

491
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:02,416
-Huh?

492
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:03,316
-Hey, Akane.

493
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,216
How are you?

494
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:04,916
-Akane.

495
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,049
Um, um, hi.

496
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:07,282
-Oh, Miyo.

497
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,249
Thanks to you, Grandfather's
back to his old self.

498
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,016
-You don't say.

499
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:10,982
That's, uh, great.

500
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:11,882
Yeah, uh-huh.

501
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:12,916
-I' don't get it.

502
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:14,549
-Akane, where's Ranma?

503
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,649
-Huh?

504
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:19,749
He, uh, he's kind of
got an upset stomach.

505
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,149
-Oh, so you mean
you're not married yet.

506
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,182
-Guess the tarot
cards were wrong, huh?

507
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,882
-But that's only because
of Grandfather's illness.

508
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:28,249
-Akane!

509
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:29,082
Ha!

510
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:30,416
The fortune lady's here, too.

511
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:32,349
-Oh, it's a monster!

512
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:33,049
[crash]

513
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:34,782
HAPPOSAI: Oh, no fair.

514
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:35,716
Ow.

515
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,949
-Go back to bed
already, will you?

516
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:49,384
[music playing]

517
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:15,782
-What?

518
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:18,148
Big sister Shampoo?

519
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:22,015
You're from the same
Chinese Amazon tribe as her?

520
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,715
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
"Two Too-Violent Girls,

521
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:26,148
Ling-Ling and Lung-Lung."

522
00:23:26,248 --> 00:23:27,948
See you there.
