This is my dream.

-Why, you-- I
should've known you

141
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,833
didn't have any kind of plan.

00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,700
-To proceed, please
insert 1,000 yen.

171
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,533
To proceed, please
insert 1,000 yen.

172
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,966
RANMA: Insert this!

173
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:25,033
Paid in full.

174
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:29,133
Oh, Ranma, that area's
off limits unless you pay.

175
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:30,400
-Nabiki.

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,233
-There's no way I'm
paying you a single yen.

177
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,166
-OK, that's fine with me.

178
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,533
But in my dream
it's pay-as-you-go.

179
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,100
-So how much is it?

180
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,566
You name your price,
and I'll pay it.

181
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,666
-3,000 yen.

182
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:43,207
-What?

183
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,366
3,000 yen?

184
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:45,933
-That's just to open the gate.

185
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,200
Another 3,000 to point
out the right one.

186
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,566
-Well, thank you.

187
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,700
-Well?

188
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,566
-You'll find the gate
right over there, Akane.

189
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:00,233
-Well, see you later, Nabiki.

190
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,082
-Look!

191
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:10,474
-Huh?

192
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:11,600
[laughing]

193
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,433
-Welcome to my nightmare.

194
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:16,866
-She tricked us.

195
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:20,466
-Well, well, it's not very
nice to talk about someone

196
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,000
behind their back.

197
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,933
-N--Nabiki?

198
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,466
-Now you must ask
Master Happosai.

199
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:30,900
-Nabiki, can you rub my back?

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,100
-Coming, hun.

201
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,633
-I think I'm going to be sick.

202
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:36,800
-Isn't this great?

203
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,166
I have never been this
happy until I decided

204
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,866
to move into Happosai's
little fantasy world.

205
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:57,335
-Open wide, my sweet.

206
00:11:57,435 --> 00:11:59,002
-Ahh.

207
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:05,168
-Oh, please, Nabiki,
would you stop it already?

208
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:07,002
-You'll figure it
out for yourself.

209
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,368
There's no point in
fighting him in his dream.

210
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:12,168
-You know that Nabiki's
smarter than she looks.

211
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:13,468
Huh?

212
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,335
-By the way, you still
owe me for dinner.

213
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,335
-Maybe a bit too smart.

214
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:18,335
-Oh, boy.

215
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:18,876
-Ranma.

216
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:20,202
-Huh?

[whispering]

-There's no way.

219
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,802
Do it yourself, Akane.

220
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:27,802
-You want to stay here forever?

221
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,702
Let's just hope you
like modelling underwear

222
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:30,902
for him, Ranma.

Maybe we can come to
some kind of arrangement.

230
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,102
That is if you're
willing to wake up

231
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:52,968
from this little fantasy.

232

00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:18,568
But what for?

243
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:20,735
-You want information, you pay.

244

-But that's all I've got.

245

-Thank you.

246
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,668
You know, I'm making some
pretty good cash in here.

00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:29,835
-OK, I paid.

248
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:34,068
Now tell us how to
get out of here.

-I don't know.

-What'd you do that for?

-Please, Ranma.

252
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:42,668
I'm just as weirded out in this
pointless fantasy as you are.

-Well, you sure seem
to be enjoying it.

-Give me back my money, Nabiki.

paid me with dream money.

Just promise you're not
gonna hurt me, all right?

-Yeah, if you can get
him to faint somehow,

00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:11,435
then he'll snap out of it.

00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,902
I gotta figure out a way
to get that little munchkin

337
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:29,135
to pass out.

338
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:30,702
-You don't get it, do you?

339
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:31,568
There is another way.

340
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:32,502
-Huh?

341
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:33,902
Oh, great, Nabiki,
let's hear it.

342
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,802
-1,000 yen.

343
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:36,835
-500.

344
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:40,035
-OK, you got a deal.

345
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:41,402
-Tell us!

346
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:46,402
-Happosai isn't necessarily
the only one that has to faint.

347
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:47,868
-Now I get it.

348
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,235
-Yeah, so do I.

349
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,702
[screaming]

350
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:53,802
-Would you stand still?

351
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:56,135
Don't you remember
what Nabiki just said?

352
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,968
It doesn't have to be Happosai.

353
00:17:58,068 --> 00:17:59,568
-Get real.

354
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,968
-You are such a wimp, Ranma.

355
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:04,735
-Psst, Akane, if you
faint in this dream,

356
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,802
then will you wake up too?

357
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,535
-Huh?

358
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:11,502
-But the Master says he
doesn't want to wake up.

359
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:12,468
-Please.

360
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:13,668
That's because he's
having the time

361
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:16,035
of his life with those girls.

362
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:16,968
-What now?

363
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:18,268
-We must--

364
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:20,568
GENMA AND SOUN: Give him an
old-fashioned wake-up call.

365
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:21,843
-Huh?

366
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:28,335
-If this doesn't wake him
up, I don't know what will.

367
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:30,202
-Look, Saotome, I
think the Master's

368
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:32,668
starting to snap out of it.

369
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,668
Hey, I'm starting to enjoy this.

370
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:38,102
-And it's good exercise too.

371
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,535
-[inaudible].

-Hey!

373
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:44,935
Would you two quit
hogging all the fun?

374
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:46,968
-I got ya.

375
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:47,509
-Saotome!

376
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:54,235
-Hey, stop!

377
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,802
Time to fight back.

378
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,302
-All right.

379
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:00,002
-He's gonna make us faint.

380
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,002
-It's working.

-You fools!

How many times do
I have to tell you?

387
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:29,168
You can't escape my dream.

388
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,368
Even if you or I faint, it
doesn't make any difference,

389
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:35,035
because you're trapped
in here for eternity.

pretty much the end of Ranma.

-I'm kidding.

Nobody's going to bite
the big one in this dream.

Huh?

00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,602
-On the downside, this
could go on forever.

ALL: Huh?

409

I just had the best dream ever.

410
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:59,268
But it's such a shame that
I had to wake up from it.

00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,368
-I'm glad to hear it.

-So you gonna tell us all
about it, you old goat?

-Huh?

414
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:09,435
-There's no way it was
as good as my dream.

415
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,735
-Don't be so sure
about that, Nabiki.

416
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:12,835
-Yeah.

417

forgive us, Master.

-Huh?

00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:17,102
I just had a little dream.

Is that so wrong?

00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:23,435
Take that!

00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:30,868
-Please hurry back, or
your lunch will get cold.

can be Ranma's fiance.
