-Now she can no trick Ranma
into fall in love with her.

Would you just wait a sec!

then we no get married either.

101

you feel better,

108
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,700

123
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:50,507
-Oh, yeah?

124

What's going on?

129
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:02,507
-I wouldn't be so
happy if I were you.

130
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:03,574
-Argh.

131

You have big nerve Akane Tendo.

135
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:15,874
-Oh, nothing much.

136
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:18,407
They've just come to kill
me and marry you to Shampoo.

137
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:18,948
That's all.

138
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,682
-Th-that's all?

139
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:24,282
-Listen Ranma, I don't
care how you handle it.

140
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:26,448
Just leave me out of it, OK?

Maybe you like Akane
Tendo better after all.

150
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:46,082
-What's that got to do-- look,

151
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:48,182

-Mommy!

155
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:53,248
Mommy!

156
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,148
What's that?

157
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,982
-Pretend we don't see them.

158

00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:01,682
-Well?

161
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,715
-Shampoo?

162
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,848
-Or Akane?

163
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:04,848
-Uh.

164
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:06,515
Not that it's any
of your business,

165
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:10,282
but we just happen to live
in the same house, all right?

166
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:11,015
Are you happy now?

167
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:13,148
Huh?

168
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:14,248
-You hear?

169
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:17,482
Ranma Saotome no

170
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:20,082
-And Akane say she
hate Ranma, so--

171
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:22,248
-Well, yeah.

172
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,515
I mean, technically
that's true but--

173
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:27,715
LING-LING: So that mean

00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:30,982
-Huh?

LUNG-LUNG: Ay ya!

180
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:41,948
-Wait, wait you can't do that!

181
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:44,182
-And why you say that?

182
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,848
-It's, uh, because
I, uh-- look, I

183
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:49,748
ain't got nothing
to be ashamed about.

00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:52,682

00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,348
-Ling-Ling, what you mean?

187
00:08:56,615 --> 00:09:00,148
- --that maybe Ranma
Saotome like someone else?

188
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,548
Somebody else like--

194
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,582
-Hey, hey.

195
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:11,948
What's this all of a sudden?

196
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:14,148
Hey.

197
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:16,982

199
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:21,682
-Why don't you let me help?

200
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,948
-Oh, if only we

201
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:28,448
-We no can help it.

Please no hate us.

00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:36,982
-How we tell big sister Shampoo?

205
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,448
-Ugh, me and my big mouth.

206
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:39,548
-Ranma!

207
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:41,415
I don't believe you!

208
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,382
Here you've got a
wonderful girl like Akane,

209
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,348
and yet you still--
what I do, I do

210
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:48,948
in the name of the
girl you betrayed!

211
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,082
-Ryoga, Wait!

212
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:50,948
You don't understand!

213
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,682
-There is nothing to understand!

214
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:56,415
-If you just slowed
down I could explain!

215
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:57,615
-I doubt it!

216
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:58,156
Hya!

217
00:09:58,256 --> 00:09:58,856
Hya!

218
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,356
BOTH: You no touch him!

219
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:04,356
-We no let you hurt Shampoo
groom you big bully!

220
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:06,889
-Before fight him you
have fight with both us.

221
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,123
[laughs]

222
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:09,323
-You know what?

223
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:11,223
I'm gonna let you two
guys explain this to him.

224
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:12,589
Sorry man, gotta go!

225
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:13,856
-Ha!

226
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,356
Better move.

227
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:19,423
-Is better you fight us now
then try fight us later.

228
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:23,389
-We have special attack
we saved just for you.

229
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,389
BOTH: Ugh!

230
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,556
-Huh?

231
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,856
BOTH: Ling-Ling Lung-Lung
strike back attack!

Super Phoenix!

233
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:35,323
-How'd do that?

Oh, jeez.

238
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:50,023
-Ranma!

239
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:52,523
We finished fight
just like you say!

240
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:55,956
-Now you stop running
and give us answer!

241
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:59,223
-So me, what'd you guys
end up doing to Ryoga?

242
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:02,356
BOTH: [laughter]

243
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:08,023
-Hi ya!

244
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:13,056
Why is it that all of Shampoo's
acquaintances are so violent?

245
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:15,056
Huh?

246
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:15,597
Ah!

247
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:20,164
An arrow!

248
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,464
And what's this?

249
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:25,030
A message.

250
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,530
-Akane Tendo, we challenge
you have fight with us.

251
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,864
-When lose you give up Ranma
Saotome, you understand?

252
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,064
-Come on you guys!

253
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:37,964
How many time have I told you?

254
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:38,797
Ranma and I--

255
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:41,430
-We already take care of Ranma?

256
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,597
-You what?

257
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:45,697
-This way you accept
fight challenge for sure.

258
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:48,097
-For womans of
Chinese Amazon tribe,

259
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:52,030
fight to death for man what
woman loves is only natural.

260
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,297
But for woman of Japan,
maybe is different.

261
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:58,897
Womans of Chinese Amazon
tribe think way too much

262
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,897
of themselves if you ask me.

263
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:01,597
[bushes rustling]

00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:02,138

00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:04,212
Ryoga?

266
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:06,246
-Huh.

267
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:06,787
Ah!

00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:09,094

00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:11,446
Oh.

270
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:13,379
-One would get in
way is obstacle.

271
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,779
Obstacle is for killing!

272
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,279
-Too too tragic story.

273
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:18,820
-Huh?

274
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:20,828
Oh!

275
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,712
Th-the kiss of death.

00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,812

-The Phoenix.

282
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:36,612
-Can it be true?

283
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:40,146
Did those girls
really do this to you?

284
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,279
If so, how would they possibly--

285
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:45,746
COLOGNE: From the look of that
scar, it can be only one thing.

286
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:47,246
-Huh?

287
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:49,212
A-and when did you get here?

[music playing]

290
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:09,312
-Note how even Ryoga is helpless
in the face of their attack.

291
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,579
Ling-Ling and
Lung-Lung's Super Phoenix

292
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,012
is nothing short
of extraordinary.

293
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,946
-Super Phoenix Attack?

294
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:17,487
-Hmm.

295
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:20,046
Tough to explain.

296
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:22,746
Desperately in need of a
way to prevent an attacking

297
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:25,046
army from crossing the
Great Wall of China.

298
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:27,546
A small group of
women got together

299
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:30,446
and devised a technique
of amazing effectiveness.

300
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:33,512
In a single blow,
this [chinese],

or Great Dance of
the Super Phoenix,

disabled their entire force.

303
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:42,879
It's no wonder they were able
to subdue Ranma so easily.

304
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:47,812
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised
if their ingenuity took him out

305
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:49,046
of action completely.

306

-Before fight though,
you agree to promise

311
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:48,379
if you no can win us, then
you no see Ranma no more.

312
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,346
-If I can't?

313
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:52,212
What have you done
with him anyway?

-Just like Cologne said.

337
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:58,779
BOTH: Made in China
over 3,000 year ago.

338
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,679
Great Phoenix Fire Dance!

339
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:01,220
-Ah.

340
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:02,687
Huh?

341
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:08,579
-Ha ha ha.

342
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,879
Those two crack me up.

343
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:12,912
First it was the fire dragon
and now it's the Phoenix.

344
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:16,346
You sure gotta give them
credit for trying though.

345
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:17,812
-Ranma, you're alive!

346
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:21,446
-Well, of course I--
and why wouldn't I be?

347
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:22,146
-Ranma!

348
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:23,046
-Hmm?

349
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:23,746
-Go away!

350
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:24,712
We busy!

351
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:26,146
Fight Akane now!

352
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:29,179
-Why you no eat
picnic we leave you?

353
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,912
-After we win Akane,
we come find you.

354
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:32,879
Is OK?

355
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:34,846
-Then you marry
big sister Shampoo!

356
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:37,879
-Are you gonna tell me what--

357
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,646
-Don't get the wrong idea, OK?

358
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:42,012
It's not for you.

359
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:44,479
If I can't beat a
couple of Amazons,

360
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,179
then I don't deserve
to be a Tendo.

361
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:50,179
[crying]

362
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,146
BOTH: Ugh, we fight!

363
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,146
-Bring it on!

364
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,046
[yelling]

365
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:12,646
[panting]

366
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:17,246
-Good girl, Akane.

367
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:18,979
That's my girl all right.

368
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,212
You sure showed them!

369
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:25,646
[bear murmuring]

370
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:26,646
-Ugh.

371
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,112
Fight not over yet.

372
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,579
-Just started in fact.

373
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,120
-Huh?

374
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:42,412
-Ah!

375
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:45,146
This must mean the Super
Phoenix is coming up soon.

376
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:47,712
-Now you be scared
for sure this time.

377
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:48,879
-Here it come!

378
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:49,420
Ugh!

379
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:49,961
Ah!

380
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:53,061
-Akane, look out!

381
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,061
-Ugh!

382
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:54,628
Ugh!

383
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:56,628
[coughing]

384
00:17:56,728 --> 00:17:57,169
-A-Akane.

385
00:17:58,602 --> 00:17:59,435
-Those idiots!

386
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:00,802
-Not so fast!

387
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,969
It would be better for
you not to interrupt.

388
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,502
Wait and see what happens.

389
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:09,435
-Almost there.

390
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,669
-Now for finish.

391
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:12,210
Hya!

392
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,576
-I'm ready to finish
whenever you are.

393
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:19,676
Huh!

394
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:20,543
Huh!

395
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:21,843
Hya!

396
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:24,543
-Not that I'm complaining,
but why don't they explode?

397
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:26,543
-That's Akane Tendo for you.

398
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:27,084
-Ugh!

399
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:27,884
Hya!

400
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,317
-Can't you see, son-in-law?

401
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,284
She's accurately
knocking them away

402
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:33,184
without hitting
the explosive tips.

403
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:35,551
-So basically she's so awkward
she probably couldn't even

404
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:37,684
get them to blow
up if she tried.

405
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,225
Ah!

406
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:42,658
[screaming]

407
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:43,199
-Hi ya!

408
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,133
BOTH: [screaming]

409
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,133
[coughing]

410
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:49,674
-Hey!

411
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:50,807
No fair!

412
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:53,607
She no supposed to hit
smoke bomb back at us!

413
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:54,607
-Cheater cheater!

414
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:55,574
-Ling-Ling, quick!

415
00:18:55,674 --> 00:18:56,207
Quick!

416
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:57,574
Pedal more harder!

417
00:18:57,674 --> 00:19:00,040
-Lung-Lung, is no good!

418
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,007
Pedal broken!

419
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,474
Ah!

420
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:04,907
What we do?

421
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:05,807
BOTH: Ah!

422
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,240
-Nothing can do!

423
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,074
BOTH: [screaming]

424
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:13,907
-Well, so much for
Ling-Ling and Lung-Lung.

425
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,407
Guess we've seen
the last of them.

426
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:22,907
-You've summoned the
wrath of the Phoenix.

427
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:27,915
-Ah!

428
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:30,548
[gasp]

429
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:33,548
-Now we use super,
super special attack!

430
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,015
-Super Phoenix--

431
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:37,015
BOTH: Fire Dance!

432
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:38,048
-Ah!

433
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:39,981
Is that the attack
they used on Ryoga?

434
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:51,848
[trembling]

435
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:55,815
-Ling-Ling hate when we need
use this special attack.

436
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:58,915
-It's too too scary
for Lung-Lung.

437
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:02,248
BOTH: [screaming]

438
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:09,715
-I can't quite believe it.

439
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:10,256
-Hya!

440
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:15,256
[screaming]

441
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:21,722
[crash]

442
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,456
[groaning]

443
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:37,256
-So, that was your so-called
super secret special attack,

444
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:38,289
huh?

445
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:40,656
-We missed aim by
little bit that all.

446
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,489
-By little, little, little bit.

447
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,356
-According to who?

448
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:48,356
[groaning]

449
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,956
-What is the meaning of this?

450
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:54,330
-Phew.

451
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,997
-The match goes to you my dear.

452
00:20:58,097 --> 00:20:59,297
Ugh.

453
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:01,997
Well, actually, seeing as
Shampoo was never involved,

454
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:04,063
I wouldn't really
call it official.

455
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,830
Also, if Ranma hadn't saved
me, I-I would've-- well,

456
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,963
never mind that.

457
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:11,630
I've got no intention
of marrying him anyway.

458
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,530
[laughs]

459
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,930
-Whatever you say dear.

460
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,330
I was young once too, you know.

461
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,730
[laughs]

462
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,897
-Tell me something.

463
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:21,263
-Yes?

464
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,330
-As you say, the duel's
over so you may as well

465
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,663
fess up, and tell me the truth.

466
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:29,430
What was the point
of all that anyway?

467
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,897
-Huh?

468
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,330
Oh, well.

469
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,730
It is a legitimate
technique you know.

470
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,597
Just not a very
effective one that's all.

471
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,830
[theme music]

472
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:15,918
NARRATOR: What?

473
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:17,118
Oh, come on Ryoga.

474
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:18,918
You can't be serious.

475
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:19,818
Marriage?

476
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:22,518
Why now, a- and why so soon?

477
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:26,118
Next time on Ranma
1/2-- Ryoga's proposal!

478
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:28,251
We'll see you there!
