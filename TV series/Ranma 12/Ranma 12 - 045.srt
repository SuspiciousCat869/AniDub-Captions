00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,980
Another challenge letter?

00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:22,913
-Yuppers.

12
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:24,047
Prepare yourself.

13
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,380
I'm coming soon
to take your life.

-Coming to take your life?

15
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,847
That's a little
extreme, isn't it?

Who's it from?

-Tsubasa Kurenai.

18
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:35,247
Is that a girl's
name or a boy's name?

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,047
I guess it could be either.

20
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,580
I wonder if it's someone I know.

-So what do you do now?

Steal?

Eat without paying?

26
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:46,080
Get engaged maybe?

-Jinkies, Akane.

00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:51,013
I'm glad you think

-Ranma, what on Earth did
you do to that mailbox?

-I don't know.

Forget a postage

Oh, oh.

-Well, you gonna
tell me who she is?

47
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:55,347
-Hmm.

48
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,313
Well, no idea.

49
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:58,713
-I was right, wasn't I?

50
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:01,180
You did go and get
engaged again, didn't you?

51
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:02,747
-What are you talking about?

52
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,080
Oh, hi, Ucchan.

53
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:05,913
-Huh?

54
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,813
-Dear, dear Ukyo.

55
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,280
-Tsubasa Kurenai.

56
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:11,980
-Hey, that's the one
who sent me the letter.

57
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:13,680
-A friend of yours, Ukyo?

58
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:14,847
-Hardly.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,380
Hurry, hurry.

60
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:21,813
-Whoo.

61
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:22,947
Oh, great.

62
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,113
I never thought anyone
would follow me here.

63
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:26,747
-Funny how that works, huh.

64
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:33,880
-Tsubasa and I were in the
same homeroom at my old school.

65
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:35,213
-OK.

66
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:37,780
But then why-- why is
Tsubasa so mad at me?

67
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:41,113
-I was pretending to be a
boy when I first got here.

68
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:41,713
Remember?

69
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,080
-Dear Ukyo.

70
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:48,413
Here.

71
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,247
-Tsubasa, I don't want
to hurt your feelings,

72
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,713
but I've already got a fiance.

73
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:54,180
Fiance.

74
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,080
Fiance.

75
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:55,680
Fiance.

76
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:00,947
-Oh.

77
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,147
[crying]

78
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,447
-Oh, that's hot.

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,147
-But rejection
only spurred me on.

80
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,280
I decided to put my
thoughts on paper,

81
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:12,847
sending Ukyo letter
after letter,

82
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,247
until the skies were filled
with pretty pink envelopes.

83
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,447
-I needed some way to
take the heat off me.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,347
Which is how I came up with
the idea of sending Tsubasa

85
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,780
your picture, Ranma.

86

-[crying]

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,547
-Which Ranma was
it in the picture?

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,080
-The girl Ranma, of course.

89
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:30,913
What did you think?

90
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,180
-The girl?

91
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:34,047
-Tsubasa thought I
was a boy at the time.

92
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,413
OK?

93
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:36,747
I didn't want anyone
thinking I was a pervert.

94
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:41,247
-Hmm.

95
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,113
-What are you looking at?

96
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,647
-You're butt ugly.

97
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,747
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Butt ugly?

98
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,047
Butt ugly.

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,213
Butt ugly.

100
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,713
But ugly.

101
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:53,547
But ugly!

102
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:57,580
-What's wrong with you?

103
00:05:57,613 --> 00:06:00,047
Ranma, I don't believe this.

104
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,113
Are your feelings hurt?

105
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,680
-Ukyo, catch.

106
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:10,347
Ukyo sure doesn't seem to
think that I'm but ugly now,

107
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,880
does she?

108
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,747
-Oh.

109
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,213
-Who?

110
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:13,980
Ranma?

111
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:15,413
Never.

112
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:16,280
-So nice to see you.

113
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,113
Buh-bye.

-Na-na na-na-na.

117

Na-na na-na-na.

118
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,647
-I'll teach you
to make fun of me.

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,129
Charge!

120
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:32,813
Darn, I missed her.

121
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:34,180
-Tsubasa.

122
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,813
-Oh, don't hurt me.

123
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,813
-Prepare to fry.

124
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:40,547
-I've got a better way.

125
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,180
Look.

126
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:42,780
Now do you get it?

127
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,313
-What are you doing?

128
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:46,347
-Do you get it?

129
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,213
Ukyo is a girl.

130
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:49,713
A girl.

131
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:52,980
-Well, why didn't you just
say that from the beginning?

132
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,980
-Oh, yeah.

133
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,213
-Huh.

134
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:57,013
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

135
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:02,947
Don't you think that I
already knew that my dear,

136
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,713
dear Ukyo was a girl?

137
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:07,013
You got it?

138
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:11,447
It's because Ukyo's a girl
that I'm interested in her.

139
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,080
And you, Ranma
Saotome, do you really

140
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:15,047
think you can make Ukyo happy?

141
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,547
If you're serious, you'll
meet me at school tomorrow.

142
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,147
I'm going to take
Ukyo away from you

143
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,080
if it's the last thing I do.

144
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:25,047
Oh, by the way,
you're butt ugly.

145
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,713
-Oh.

146
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:26,613
-Seeya.

147
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,513
[laughing]

148
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:31,013
-Tsubasa already
knew I was a girl?

149
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,380
-So it seems.

150
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:36,147
-Why that-- that pervert!

151
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,813
[chimes sounding]

152
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:43,913
-Today from 12:30 to
1:30 Ucchan's okonomiyaki

153
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,347
is having a bake sale?

154
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,613
-Hey that one on the
left's kind of cute.

155
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:48,980
-That one looks so familiar.

156
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:51,680
-An okonomiyaki bake-off, huh?

157
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:54,280
-It's still not too late
for you to back out of this.

158
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:56,113
-You know me better than that.

159
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:57,847
Besides, accepting
challenges is what

160
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,313
the Anything Goes
School is all about.

161
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,680
Akane, it's my duty.

162
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:04,280
-How dare you involve
my [? sister ?]

163
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:06,980
without permission.

164
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:11,380
But I have to admit a campus
bake sale is a great idea.

165
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:12,880
-Do you really think so?

166
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:15,147
I'm so happy.

167
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,813
-We're agreed then?

168
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,247
-That's fine with me.

169
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,680
-Whoever loses has to
give up on Ukyo forever.

00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:23,313
-I'm glad you're
taking it so well.

171
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:27,813
-Ready, set, go!

172
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:30,913
-You take it well, Ranma,
because I intend to win.

173
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:34,080
-I hear that girl Tsubasa
isn't interested in boys.

174
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,747
-With all the perverts at the
school, does that surprise you?

175
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,013
-Oh, Ranma, why are you letting
that girl get to you like this?

176
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:42,647
-But ugly, am I?

177
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,447
Ha.

178
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,113
A hot little tamale like me?

179
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:47,080
I don't think so.

180
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:48,080
-Don't push me.

181
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,013
I'm full of chocolate.

182
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,513
-Come and get it.

183
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:53,080
-Buy your okonomiyaki from
the one you think is cutest.

184
00:08:58,113 --> 00:08:59,680
-Huh?

185
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:00,247
-Huh.

186
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,547
How did you do?

187
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,180
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I lost?

188
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:07,213
-Guess beauty wins
over butt ugly.

189
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,613
But don't feel so bad.

190
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,847
I hear they're doing
wonders with plastic surgery

191
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,147
these days.

192
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,313
RANMA (VOICEOVER): And here I
really thought I'd win, too.

193
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,647
Can it be?

194
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,347
Can it be that I
really am butt ugly?

195
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,313
-Fear not my Venus.

196
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:28,613
Thou art still the goddess
of love and beauty.

197
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:30,413
See how I worship you, my love.

198
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:32,680
-Get off of me.

199
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:37,647
[panting] I think
I'm gonna puke.

200
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,647
-OK, Ranma.

201
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,580
You're being ridiculous,
even for you.

202
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,913
I mean, you don't
really think you

203
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:45,013
could win against a
real girl, now, did you?

204
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:45,780
-Aha.

205
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:47,547
So that's it.

206
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,747
Just you wait Tsubasa.

207
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,047
This ain't over yet.

208
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,780
-That's not what I-- Ranma!

209
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:55,380
BOY: Whoa, what a babe.

210
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:56,847
BOY: Whoa, is she new?

211
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,147
-Step right up, boys.

212
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,047
Get your okonomiyaki.

213
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,580
-Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

214
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:02,047
-Me too.

215
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:02,647
Me too.

216
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,580
Me too.

217
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,380
-Oh.

218
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,847
Thanks, fellas.

219
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,613
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I just
wasn't sexy enough before.

220
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,813
Now they don't
even recognize me.

221
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:13,047
BOY: Well, if I buy one,
will you go out with me?

222
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
RANMA: Gee, I dunno.

223
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,013
I'll have to check my calendar.

224
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,013
Ow.

225
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:18,013
What are you doing?

226
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:19,013
-Move it, funny girl.

227
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:19,847
-Let go.

228
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,313
You're hurting me.

229
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:20,980
Let go.

230
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:21,613
Lemme go.

231
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:22,147
Ow.

232
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,613
Ow, I said.

233
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:24,280
Stop it.

234
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:25,247
What are you doing?

235
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,213
Where are you talking me?

236
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:27,147
Ow, you're bending my ear.

237
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,180
Let go.

238
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:29,447
-What is wrong with you, Ranma?

239
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,647
Do you like having
guys chase after you?

240
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,447
RANMA: Be quiet.

241
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,713
All's fair in love and war.

242
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:33,713
Ugh.

243
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:34,547
Shoot.

244
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,480
And I only had one left to sell.

245
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,680
-You're making me crazy.

246
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:40,680
-Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

247
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:41,513
-Tsu-Tsubasa.

248
00:10:41,547 --> 00:10:43,547
-Nice try, but you still lose.

249
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,480
Now promise you'll give up
Ukyo just like we agreed.

250
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,547
-Tough luck, sugar.

251
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,680
-Huh?

252
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:52,380
-That last okonomiyaki
is being saved for me.

253
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:11,109
I asked her to save
the last one for me.

254
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:14,375
Guess that means the
contest is a draw.

255
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,075
-Ucchan.

256
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,742
-Dear Ukyo, how cruel.

257
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,509
Why don't you just admit it.

258
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:24,009
You don't-- you don't want to
go out with me at all, do you?

259
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,509
Why?

260
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,375
Why couldn't you just tell
me that from the beginning?

261
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:29,175
-I did tell you, remember?

262
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,709
But you still wouldn't give up.

263
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:34,644
-[wailing]

264
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,509
And that's it.

265
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,342
Don't worry, Ukyo.

266
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,509
You won't hear from me again.

267
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:46,375
Farewell.

268
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,009
[crying]

269
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:48,609
-Tsubasa.

270
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:53,609
-Ranma.

271
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:56,542
-Ran-chan.

272
00:11:56,575 --> 00:12:01,442
[thunder]

273
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:15,442
-[panting]

274
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:20,409
-Tsubasa, I didn't want to
admit it, but you won, not me.

275
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:26,942
-You're not butt ugly at all.

276
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:27,542
-Tsubasa?

277
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,042
-I was jealous of you.

278
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,475
You were so cute, I knew
I didn't stand a chance.

279
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,709
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:43,142
Ukyo must hate me.

281
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,342
Why does life always have
to get so complicated?

282
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,842
RANMA (VOICEOVER): You don't
know the half of it, sister.

283
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:51,275
-Cheer up.

284
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:52,609
You're pretty cute yourself.

285
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:55,475
I'm sure you'll find a
boyfriend in no time.

286
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:00,675
-[sighing]

287
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,809
-Huh?

288
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,342
-Dear Ranma.

289
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:10,042
-Hey, hey.

290
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:11,442
Cut that out.

291
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:12,509
Quit it.

292
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,642
-I, Tsubasa Kurenai,
have fallen in love.

293
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,975
All over again!

294
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:19,975
-Never mind.

295
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,942
I take it all back.

296
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,509
Leave me alone!

297
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,075
-Is Tsubasa fickle or what?

298
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:34,475
-I'll bet almost
any non-boy will do.

299
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:37,642
Still, Ranma's secret
will be out soon enough.

300
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:38,942
Poor Tsubasa.

301
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:41,609
-Actually, it's Ranma
I feel sorry for.

302
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,509
-Come on Tsubasa.

303
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,509
Cut it out.

304
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,709
My life's complicated
enough as it is.

305
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,275
Leave me alone!

306
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:16,724
Ugh.

307
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,609
[interposing voices]

308
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:24,542
-Hey, you OK?

309
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:25,942
Hey.

310
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:26,709
-Durn.

311
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,109
She got away.

312
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:30,342
Dear, dear Ranma,
why did you leave me?

313
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,875
Why can't you love me back?

314
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:35,175
What is wrong with me?

315
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:39,009
-I'd get rid of the crazy
costume for starters.

316
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:39,875
-Ah, Tsubasa.

317
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:47,209
--[panting] It's almost
better being ugly.

318
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:48,975
-But thou art not ugly, my love.

319
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,642
Thou hast-- a strong kick.

320
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,209
-As if I didn't have
enough to deal with.

321
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:58,242
Now I've got both these
nut cases chasing after me.

322
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,275
-Tsubasa is persistent.

323
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:03,075
Once you've been
targeted, it's all over.

324
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,409
You'll be tracked to
the ends of the Earth.

325
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:08,409
Then your only hope
is to move away.

326
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:13,509
-Or then again, maybe I'm
going about this all wrong.

327
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,009
TSUBASA: [crying]

328
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,009
-Seriously, Tsubasa,
you're better off

329
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,242
without hi-- I mean her.

330
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:22,675
I'm sure you can find
yourself a more normal person.

331
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:23,675
-Never.

332
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:24,409
Never.

333
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:25,009
I hate boys.

334
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:25,909
