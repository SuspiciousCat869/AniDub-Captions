00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:17,365
Your turn, Nabiki.

171
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:20,231
-You have got to be kidding me.

172
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:21,631
-But aren't you worried?

173
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:25,498
NABIKI: I would be, if I didn't
have Kuno Baby in my class.

174
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,531
RANMA: She's got a point.

175
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:27,931
-Huh?

176
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:30,865
-You know, it's a sure thing,
as long as he's got his-- aah!

-Master Kuno!

181
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,398
-That you, Sasuke?

182
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,998
I'm trying to practice.

183
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:05,765
-B-b-but Master Kuno,
it's about your father.

184
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:06,931
-Tell me, quickly.

185
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,331
-I-- I looked into
it, like you asked.

186
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:12,098
His last known
residence was Hawaii.

187
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:13,098
Therefore--

188
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:13,639
-Hm.

189
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,198
Nonsense.

190
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,498
-But don't you see?

191
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:17,931
That's where--

192
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,331
-While it is true he
left to go abroad,

193
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:24,898
it's not Hawaii he's
at, but-- the sky.

194
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:26,365
-The wha?

can do that the three of us

00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:55,565
can't handle.

201

What do they want?

Everybody give big welcome.

Of course, they be

-OK.

218

Now I'm really, really worried.

for the big fun?

-Well, I mean, with a
"get out of rules free"

232
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,473
pass on the line, wouldn't you?

-You know, I feel bad
for the losers, though,

-No, no, my keke.

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,473
That is where you are wrong.

266
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:25,140
Rules say you go ID, you
is the official student.

-Those are fake,
and you know it!

The stronger they are, the
harder they fall, right?

00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:35,473
-Now that what Big
Kahuna like to hear.

271

-I'm still not sure
what you're up to,

272
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:39,607
but I'll take that
pass, either way.

PRINCIPAL KUNO:
You mean you try.

A photo?

Looks familiar, doesn't he?

-You're right, but who
do you think it is?

-Now, wait a sec.

a little that.

Ah!

284
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,540
-But what's the principal
doing with a picture like this?

285
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,207

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,707
-My theory is that
he's the father

290
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:18,673
Master Kuno lost
three long years ago.

291
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:21,273
-The principal's
related to Kuno?

292
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:24,607
[laughs] OK, then tell me this.

293
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,973
How come they've never
recognized each other all

294
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:27,807
this time?

295
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,440
-Because they're both insane.

296
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,707
-Huh?

297
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:34,607

continue the eliminations.

PRINCIPAL KUNO:
Oh, man, oh, man.

303
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:53,240
Too bad.

304
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,640
Look like that keke wipe out.

305
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,007
Now Big Kahuna need
new challenger.

306
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:00,707
-How dare you talk to
your own son like that?

307
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:01,407
-What?

308
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:04,673
That one is Big Kahuna?

309
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:07,740
Tell me, where you find
this picture of Tachi?

310
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,107
-Tachi?

311
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:11,307
-Short for Tatewaki.

312
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,773
This one no look like
age 14 Tachi, though.

313
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,507
-That's because
he's 17 now, stupid.

314
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:18,907
-No, no, no, no.

315
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,173
That is keke not
have that haircut.

316
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,973
He be more like this one.

317
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:24,940
There.

318
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,273
Now he look like
Daddy's little keke.

319
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:28,473
Oh, Tachi!

320
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:30,407
Daddy be missing you big-time.

321
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:33,507
Maybe if you had the buzzcut,
like when you was little--

322
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,140
-Don't touch me!

323
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,040
-You, wake up.

324
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,207
-Is it true?

325
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,407
Is the principal
really your dad?

326
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,207
-That again?

327
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,873
My father was fair-skinned.

328
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,907
-That's because he's
been in Hawaii, stupid.

329
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,040
Better face it.

330
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,240
You two are related.

[students gasp]

332
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,440
-I knew it.

333
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,240
-You-- you mean to say this
psycho, this sociopath,

334
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,673
this missing link--
