-Hey Ranma!

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,033
Is something wrong?

172
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:17,566
-I...

173
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,533
Don't know.

-I'm not sure what, but I did.

00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:44,966
-Come, now.

180
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:46,100
Be serious.

181
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,566
Perhaps this so-called
monster of yours really

182
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,500
is nothing but a monkey.

-For the last time,
it wasn't a monkey!

That thing is real, alright?

Whatever it is.

00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,033
-Kasumi, be honest with me.

187
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,533
Ranma's just making all
this stuff up, right?

188
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,433
-What do you think?

189
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:11,733
It could be true.

-Nabiki!

191
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,666
Not you too!

192
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:17,233
-It probably is haunted Akane.

193
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,300
Didn't you read The Shining?

Are you happy now?

198
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,966
It turns out the
ghost was just a goat.

-I wanna go to Akane!

Come on!

201
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,600

I know this really scary story.

Want to hear it?

207
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:59,166
On a night like this, when
the warm wind was blowing

208
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,633
at this kind of resort,
a murder was committed.

209
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:06,700
And the corpse abandoned
in the hot spring.

210
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,566
From that day on, in
the middle of the night,

211
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,866
in that lonely place, a
certain sound could be heard,

-In that room, a certain
sound could be heard.

220
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,000
-There was something there.

221
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,133
I felt it.

222
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:29,800
-What?

223
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,733
Who's there?

224
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,633
-Is there something
the matter, miss?

-Uh, the water, I-

-Yes?

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,500
-Nevermind.

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,041
-Hmmm.

-Dad, please.

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,700
Can't we leave early?

231
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,833
-But Akane.

232

It's a two night,
three day package.

233
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,533
If we leave early,
we waste money.

234
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,433
-Oh, who cares about the money?

235
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,533
-Hey you two, what's the ruckus?

236
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,866
-Akane seems to think there's
a monster in the hot springs.

237
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:16,833
-But there is, I tell you!

00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,733
-You know, you're really
starting to remind me of Ranma.

239
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,533
It's perfectly safe, Akane.

240
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:22,933
Trust me.

241
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:26,266
Speaking of which, Tendo, how
about a dip in the hot spring?

00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,566
-Don't mind if I do, Saotome.

243

-Oh, honestly.

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
-Now this is the life.

245
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,200

play video games.

heat that did this to them.

and he's taking a look around.

-I've got to go and help him!

-You find something yet?

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
Are you here?

269
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,800
Come on, where are you?

270
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,466
Answer me!

271
00:15:58,566 --> 00:15:59,966
Is- is that you?

272
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,066
I- I guess not.

273
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,033
-Ah!

274
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,866
What do you want with me?

275
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:21,533
-Actually, we've got a
couple questions for you.

276
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,333
-Yeah, and we want
the truth, too.

277
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:27,633
-The one who sent out this
invite was you, wasn't it?

278
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,900
-What is it, some kind of scam
to lure martial artists to you

resort so they can
practice with whoever

280
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,733
you got out in that water.

281
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,733
-Who do you got
out there, anyway?

282
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,766
-Well, whatever the kid
is, he's not a monster.

283
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:45,966
-He's a kid?

284
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,600
What kind of irresponsible-

285
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,900
-Wait.

286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,533
Save your judgments until
after I tell you the story.

287
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,633
We haven't always been
this run down, you know.

288
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,566
We used to be a
top-rated resort.

289
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,566
But then the master died,
leaving the young master

290
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,933
in charge and in heavy debt.

291
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:05,866
-Wow.

292
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,166
We didn't know.

293
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:10,433
-His father's last wish
was for a grandchild.

294
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:12,933
But what girls come
to a place like this?

295
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,700
Seems he'd be forever alone.

296
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,966
Because of our reputation,
the only ones who did come

297
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,766
were martial artists.

298
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:23,133
By engaging them in
combat, the young master

299
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:24,866
was able to forget
his loneliness,

300
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:27,433
and improve his fighting skills.

301
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,633
Thus the art of
Bathhouse-Fu was born.

302
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:30,766
BOTH: What?

303
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:31,866
-Yes I admit it.

304
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:34,633
I'm the one who sent
the invitations to you.

305
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,066
I swear, I never
meant to hurt anyone.

306
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,866
All I wanted was
for the young master

307
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,100
to meet some young ladies.

308
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,641
-Hm?

309
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,266
So, how are we
going to save Akane?

310
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,600
-Don't worry.

311
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,833
I got a plan.

312
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:50,433
-Like what?

313
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:53,200
-Like this!

314
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,033
-I'm sorry Ryoga, but
for what I got in mind,

315
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,400
you'd just drag me down.

316
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:06,833
-Wow!

317
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,600
What beautiful how waters.

318
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,400
First, I have to wash off.

319
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,633
Oh, it feels good!

320
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,233
Now that I'm clean I
can go into the spring.

321
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,700
AKANE (VOICEOVER): That's it.

322
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,241
Closer.

323
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,666
-Hah!

324
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:35,207
Gotchya!

325
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,833
-OK, where'd he go now?

326
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,800
Come back here you jerk!

327
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,766
And gimme back Akane!

328
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:53,700
It's so steamy in here,
I can't see a thing.

329
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,400
I'm gonna find you
sooner or later!

330
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:09,666
RANMA (VOICEOVER): How can I
fight him if I can't see him?

331
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,866
He's gotta be here somewhere.

332
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,700
-So there you are!

333
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,900
Can't hide forever, you know.

334
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,766
Ahh, I feel dizzy.

335
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:30,800
-Stupid Ranma.

336
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,933
Ditches me the first
chance he gets.

337
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:34,474
Akane!

338
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,566
-Ah!

339
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,566
-Ranma!

340
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,500
-Good news, Ronma!

341
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,933
I've rescued Akane!

342
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:47,566
-Whoopie.

343
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,133
-What?

344
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,866
Come on, get up!

345
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:52,866
What's wrong with you?

346
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:54,633
-I would if I could.

347
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,566
-Ranma, look out!

348
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,107
-Ranma!

349
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:13,033
-A girl?

350
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:19,000
-Saotome school final
attack-- bathrobe wrap.

351
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,541
Take that.

352
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,500
And that!

353
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,966
-Hit the showers, jerk.

354
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:31,033
-Let's find out
who he really is.

355
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,233
Huh?!

356
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,600
Who the heck is he?

357
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,733
-He's totally gorgeous!

358
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,133
-Well, I'll be.

359
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,466
-Wow, not bad.

360
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:54,066
-They have improved.

361
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,433
-Haha.

362
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:58,133
We certainly do look
better, don't we?

363
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:01,033
[inaudible] someone to see you!

364
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:04,966
-He there, remember me?

365
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:05,900
-Heh, not really.

366
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:13,533
-I mean honestly, if
it hadn't been for me,

367
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:14,633
he'd still be alone.

368
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,866
Not hanging out with
all those girls.

369
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:20,066
-Poor Akane, you'll get over it.

370
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,300
-Mind your own business.

371
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,666
I'll just [inaudible].

372
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:23,207
-Oh, yeah.

373
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:23,733
Sure.

374
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,533
We believe you.

375
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,366
-Why can't you be normal?

376
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:30,266
-Hiya, baby.

377
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:34,066
Would you like to jump
in the tub with me?

378
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,066
In our hot springs,
is what I mean.

379
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:46,266
