[theme music]

2
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:45,314
Ranma, change
into a girl and put

3
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:47,447
on the sexy swimsuit for me.

4
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:50,314
Swimsuit?

5
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,281
No way.

6
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:52,647
You're out of your gourd!

7
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,714
How could you be so callous
and not grant a dying old man

8
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,981
one last wish?

9
00:01:56,014 --> 00:02:00,147
You're not dying,
and I have my pride.

10
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:03,014
Yeah, and it's getting in the
way of your swimsuit routine.

11
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:06,081
Tell it to someone who cares!

12
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,447
Brother.

13
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,481
What a nasty little parasite.

14
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:10,814
Hey, Akane.

15
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,381
I'm sick of playing with
these stupid sparklers.

16
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:14,047
Let's go in.

17
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,781
Why don't you get
Kasumi to make dinner?

18
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:18,681
Come on out, little guys.

19
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:20,047
What you got there, Akane?

20
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,947
I bought some
fireflies in town.

21
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,514
I thought that it'd be nice to
set them free in our garden.

22
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:25,447
Oh yeah?

23
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:26,881
So where'd they all go?

24
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,181
I don't see 'em anywhere.

25
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,547
I just let 'em out when
you were walking up.

26
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:33,081
Where'd they go?

27
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:33,563
Huh?

28
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:38,547
Hey, what is so hilarious?

29
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:39,447
You.

30
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:40,581
You're such a scream.

31
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:41,614
The guy tricked
you into thinking

32
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:43,047
those bugs were something else.

33
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,347
He told you they were
fireflies, but he gave you

34
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,347
another kind of bug
because he knew you

35
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,681
couldn't tell the difference.

36
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:50,281
I can so tell the difference!

37
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:52,647
Then shouldn't we be
seeing some lights?

38
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,947
Come on, Akane.

39
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:57,814
Your bulb's starting
to burn a little dim.

40
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,347
Well, excuse me
Mr. Know-it-all.

41
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,914
I don't ever remember
hearing temple bells

42
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:12,014
in this neighborhood.

43
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,514
Did you see that?

44
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:19,547
What was it?

45
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:21,747
I don't think it was a firefly.

46
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:26,647
The young raccoon cried
looking at the sky up

47
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,514
in Kokkuuri Mountain.

48
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,547
So take a peek inside.

49
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,281
It can't be denied.

50
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:33,814
It's here--

51
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:34,547
Look, Ranma.

52
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,847
It's Kogane.

53
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,014
I have returned.

54
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:42,281
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Gosunkugi's Summer Affair.

55
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,881
You're looking
heavenly, Kogane.

56
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:51,114
So how have you been?

57
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,214
Fine.

58
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,514
Thanks for helping me
out so much before.

59
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:55,814
If it weren't for
you, I wouldn't

60
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,247
have made it to the other side.

61
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,314
The other side?

62
00:03:58,347 --> 00:03:59,747
Then don't you think
the "I've returned"

63
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,714
haunting stuff was uncalled for?

64
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:06,314
But that's what ghosts
are supposed to say.

65
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:09,114
I'm sorry if I scared you.

66
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:09,947
Huh?

67
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:11,314
Don't worry about it.

68
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:12,481
It's no big deal.

69
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:14,014
OK.

70
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,314
So it's the festival of the
dead, when you spirits visit

71
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:17,747
your earthly homes.

72
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:20,347
Sort of a summer vacation
for ghosts, I take it?

73
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,914
Something like that.

74
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:26,247
Except some of us have no living
relatives left to return to.

75
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,714
So I was wondering if
I could stay with you.

76
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:30,447
Of course you can stay!

77
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:31,847
Dessert's ready.

78
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:33,881
There's quite a lot, so
I hope you're all hungry.

79
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:35,214
What do you say, everyone?

80
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:37,714
Let's welcome Kogane
back with a party!

81
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:38,614
Hey, folks?

82
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:40,114
Thank you.

83
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,581
But won't you at least let
me help you with something?

84
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:43,714
Sure.

85
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:46,214
Could I ask you
to set the table?

86
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:46,814
Here.

87
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:54,981
One.

88
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:55,463
Two.

89
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:58,781
Three.

90
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:02,181
Four.

91
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,747
Kiku, you've destroyed
my most precious dish!

92
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:12,314
Now you must pay!

93
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:15,247
Forgive me, dear master!

94
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,647
Hmm.

95
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,614
Oh.

96
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,014
Hmm.

97
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:19,496
--Hmm.

98
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:24,547
That was scary, wasn't it?

99
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,847
Now what would possess me to
say such a terrible thing?

100
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:32,947
It was all my fault. Maybe
coming here was a mistake.

101
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:33,614
Come on.

102
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:34,747
Don't start crying.

103
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,414
Yeah, we told you
before, Kogane.

104
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:37,947
We're all glad you're here.

105
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,247
Right.

106
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,847
I always jump at the chance
to see a ghost, especially

107
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,614
when they're luscious--
I mean lovely young girls

108
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:44,647
such as yourself.

109
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:45,847
Give me a great big hug!

110
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,347
RANMA: Knock it off,
you old pervert!

111
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,581
Geez, I'm boiling.

112
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:00,914
I can't take it!

113
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,881
So what if it is
summer vacation?

114
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:05,481
I can't stand the thought of
him being with Akane all day

115
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:07,147
in the same house.

116
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,314
I can't take it.

117
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:12,681
I wish he'd never been born.

118
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:15,247
I hate you, Saotome!

119
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,681
This'll teach you for spending
time with my girlfriend.

120
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:18,747
You're gonna pay for this!

121
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:20,014
RANMA: Hey, Gosunkugi.

122
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,214
Huh?

123
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,781
Aren't you supposed to
wait till midnight to cast

124
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:23,647
spells and stuff?

125
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,414
Oh.

126
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,381
Hello, Saotome.

127
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:28,414
Hi, Gosunkugi.

128
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,414
What are you doing here?

129
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,114
Oh.

130
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:31,514
Hi, Akane.

131
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:33,347
It's nice to see you and all,
but could you take that voodoo

132
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,414
stuff somewhere else?

133
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:35,581
Yeah, sure.

134
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:36,181
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,214
What a pretty doll.

136
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,147
GONSUNKUGI (VOICEOVER):
She's beautiful.

137
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:52,281
No one's ever admired my
dolls like that before.

138
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,547
Excuse me.

139
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,081
I've got other dolls if you'd
like to come by my place

140
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:55,947
and see them.

141
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:57,747
You've got more
dolls like this?

142
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:58,847
I'd love to see them.

143
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:05,314
The secret ritual of Gelmatoria
must carried out at midnight.

144
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:08,347
First, you need to get a sheet
of leather paper made out

145
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:10,114
of the skin of a wild boar.

146
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,614
Then you take that
leather paper,

147
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:13,381
and you write down
the name of the person

148
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:15,747
you wanna put a curse on.

149
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:18,214
The ink must be made from
a minced lizard, frog,

150
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:19,781
and poisonous herbs.

151
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:24,147
Three days later, poof!

152
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:25,814
Very impressive.

153
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:27,914
You know a lot
about magic curses.

154
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,947
You make it all
sound so mysterious.

155
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:40,914
Where's Kogane?

156
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:42,714
I need to find Kogane now.

157
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,181
How many times must I tell you?

158
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,347
She went into town to hang
out with Ranma and Akane.

159
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,314
What were they thinking
not inviting me along?

160
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:50,181
I need to talk to
Kogane on the double.

161
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:51,414
I didn't see her
bring any luggage,

162
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:52,247
so she must need some lingerie.

163
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,581
So look.

164
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:55,081
I got these for her and look
how she shows her gratitude.

165
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:01,381
I think the Come owners
might appreciate them more.

166
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,547
One cotton candy.

167
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:11,614
Wow, thanks.

168
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,947
Where'd Gosunkugi
and Kogane go?

169
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:15,214
I dunno.

170
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:17,814
They were just over
there a minute ago.

171
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,514
I guess they wanted
some time on their own.

172
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:21,847
Yeah.

173
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,147
I don't know about you,
but I think they kinda

174
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:25,214
suit each other.

175
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:28,214
Kogane, this old cemetery
is one of the more notorious

176
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:30,047
for all the peculiar
ghost sightings people

177
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,247
have had here over the years.

178
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:33,347
So what do you think?

179
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:35,781
Is a great place to
be in or what, Kogane?

180
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,381
It's wonderful, Gosunkugi.

181
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:39,347
It's so secluded.

182
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:47,481
Beautiful.

183
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:49,514
GONSUNKUGI (VOICEOVER): I
can't believe how gorgeous

184
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:52,381
she looks in a graveyard.

185
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:56,547
Kogane, you're like a graceful
angel perched on a tombstone.

186
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:04,514
Thank you, Gosunkugi.

187
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,014
GONSUNKUGI (VOICEOVER):
K-- Kogane?

188
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:14,781
Does she-- would she-- could
she be in love with me?

189
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:18,581
Will she be my very first love?

190
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:22,514
Somebody fell in
love with me-- maybe!

191
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:26,047
There you are, Kogane.

192
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:26,647
A ghost!

193
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:27,814
Don't be afraid.

194
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,247
It's just Happosai,
little darling.

195
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,247
Be gone, puny ghost man.

196
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:31,847
Kogane!

197
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:41,981
Ranma, do you think we should
be worried about those two,

198
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,114
or do you think we should
just leave 'em alone.

199
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:46,547
You're the one who said
they seem like a good couple.

200
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:49,614
Well, actually,
that's what worries me.

201
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:51,047
What do you mean?

202
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,881
Gosunkugi doesn't know that
Kogane's a ghost, right?

203
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:55,914
What'll happen if he finds out?

204
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,814
Um, hey, Kogane.

205
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:20,281
That's quite a grip.

206
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:23,414
I like it.

207
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,147
Ow, ow, ow.

208
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:31,447
Kogane, I-- I-- I think
you're very good-looking.

209
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:32,981
Oh yeah.

210
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:33,747
Yeah.

211
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:34,514
Oh, that's good.

212
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:35,114
Right there.

213
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,268
Ranma, at least think about it.

214
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,135
Give it a rest, would you?

215
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,935
They're doing just
fine on their own.

216
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,302
They don't need us
interfering with 'em.

217
00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:58,302
I know.

218
00:10:58,335 --> 00:10:59,835
And I wouldn't normally
be this worried,

219
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,602
but if Gosunkugi finds out
that Kogane is really a ghost--

220
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:05,435
What does it matter who
the guy ends up falling for?

221
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:07,835
Kogane's a lot better than
some of the uncute choices

222
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,202
around here.

223
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,035
Hmph.

224
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,602
Care to explain yourself, Ranma?

225
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:14,002
Just who are you referring to
when you say uncute choices?

226
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,268
I wonder.

227
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:16,535
Ranma, tell me who
you're talking about!

228
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,468
The point is maybe
you should figure out

229
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:22,868
why you got such a problem
Gosunkugi falling for a ghost!

230
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:25,235
What?

231
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,835
What-- what do you
mean Kogane is a ghost?

232
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,835
How's it going, Gosunkugi?

233
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:32,602
I take it you heard.

234
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,502
Tell me you're not serious.

235
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,502
She's not really a ghost.

236
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,435
Um, sorta.

237
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:39,902
Yeah, she is.

238
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,268
But who cares?

239
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,102
Hmm.

240
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,768
Well, she does walk kinda funny.

241
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:50,135
Akane, you're touching Saotome!

242
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:54,935
Oh no.

243
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:55,868
Hey.

244
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:57,468
Come back, Gosunkugi!

245
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:58,068
Huh?

246
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:03,368
Oh.

247
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:04,135
Poor Kogane.

248
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:05,468
Now we've done it.

249
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:07,468
Kogane must've heard us
explaining everything

250
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:08,068
to Gosunkugi.

251
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,202
What should we do?

252
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,335
Hmm.

253
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:14,468
I'll go smooth things
out with Gosunkugi.

254
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:17,535
Akane, stay here and
take care of Kogane.

255
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:18,235
Ranma, wait.

256
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:23,102
Come on, Kogane.

257
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,068
It's not as bad as it seems.

258
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:27,702
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

259
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:31,135
I just can't believe how
nice you've all been to me.

260
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,368
That's why I'm crying.

261
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:36,535
I've had a wonderful
summer vacation here.

262
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:38,702
Huh?

263
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:41,135
Uh, can I ask you something?

264
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:44,368
I've been wondering what
you think about Gosunkugi?

265
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:46,102
What do I think?

266
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,602
Gosunkugi and I
are good friends.

267
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,902
You're-- you're just friends?

268
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:53,268
Oh.

269
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:53,750
Oh.

270
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:00,468
Geez, where did he get to?

271
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:02,835
Huh?

272
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:03,435
Gosunkugi.

273
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:11,835
I've been looking for you.

274
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:14,168
I know how you're
feeling, Gosunkugi.

275
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:20,335
But it's just-- how
can I explain it?

276
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:21,835
Um.

277
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,735
Hmm.

278
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:26,035
So what?

279
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,202
Who cares if the girl
you love is a ghost?

280
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:28,702
Do you think it
makes a difference?

281
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:30,602
Are you just gonna give up?

282
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,268
Listen, Saotome.

283
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:35,568
You can't possibly
understand how I feel.

284
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:37,035
Yeah, that's for sure.

285
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,202
because I fell for some girl,
it wouldn't matter to me

286
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,768
if she were a
ghost or a monster.

287
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:43,068
Hey, I wouldn't even care if
she were voted Miss Butt-Ugly

288
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:44,168
Girl of the Universe.

289
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:50,535
Sometimes, you just can't
help falling for somebody.

290
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,068
Hmm.

291
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:55,702
Saotome, I'm not upset because
the girl I'm in love with

292
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:56,302
is a ghost.

293
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:01,935
I've never felt this
happy in my entire life.

294
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:04,135
For the first time
ever, someone's

295
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:06,368
actually fallen in love with me.

296
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:08,535
It doesn't matter if
she's a ghost or anything.

297
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:14,635
Then what's stopping you
from going for it, Gosunkugi?

298
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:19,202
I've been secretly in love with
someone else for a long time.

299
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,802
I'd have to get
over her first if I

300
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:23,535
was going to be true to Kogane.

301
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:27,168
I just can't throw
away my love for Akane.

302
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:32,402
Then again, I'm never gonna
have a chance like this again.

303
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:34,968
If I take this girl, then
I can't have that one.

304
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:38,435
If I take that girl, then
I can't take this one.

305
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:39,402
Simon says stop.

306
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:40,268
Simon says give up.

307
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:41,102
Stop.

308
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,735
Oops-- I didn't say Simon says.

309
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:43,935
Ugh.

310
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:47,868
I think the poor
guy's finally lost it.

311
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:50,535
Take care of yourself, Kogane.

312
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:51,535
Bye.

313
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:52,868
Come back and visit us soon.

314
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:55,435
Thanks again for letting
me stay for the holiday.

315
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:56,468
RANMA: Hey, Akane!

316
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:01,402
Where's Kogane going?

317
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:04,668
She said it was time for
her to go back already.

318
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:07,002
The festival of the dead
will be over in just a few

319
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:10,435
more minutes, which
means that we ghosts must

320
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:13,035
carry our torches and
return to the other world.

321
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:21,168
I-- I understand
you have to leave,

322
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:22,768
even though it
breaks your heart!

323
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:29,268
It's just not fair.

324
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:30,702
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Gosunkugi.

325
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:31,635
Don't cry, Gosunkugi.

326
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,002
Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,135
Don't worry, my boy.

328
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,168
I'll put these
torches out myself

329
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:41,868
and our problems will be solved.

330
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:43,835
Now you don't have
to go anywhere.

331
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:44,868
Right, Kogane?

332
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,468
Pucker up!

333
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:50,168
Give it a rest,
you musty old coot.

334
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:51,868
Ranma, why do you
keep interrupting me

335
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:53,102
just when I'm on
the verge of hitting

336
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:54,002
it big with a beautiful girl?

337
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,135
Why I oughtta--

338
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,868
'Cause you're a
menace to society!

339
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:00,368
What have you done?

340
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:02,168
If I can get back
to the other side

341
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:06,402
by midnight tonight, as
punishment, I'll be cast out.

342
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:09,468
Then I'll be changed
into a zombie.

343
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,335
Changed into a zombie?

344
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:12,468
Come on.

345
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:13,968
This is a joke, right?

346
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:17,602
No, I'm completely serious.

347
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:20,068
Don't you worry, dear.

348
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:22,502
If it's torches you need,
then I can fix you up

349
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,502
with a whole bunch of 'em.

350
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:26,368
Please do.

351
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,535
Because if you don't, I'll
end up looking like this.

352
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:37,202
Wow, nice job on the mask.

353
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:38,702
You have to believe me.

354
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:40,035
If I haven't
returned by midnight,

355
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:41,735
I will be turned
into a zombie, and I

356
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,635
can't stop it from happening.

357
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:44,402
Look.

358
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:45,135
What is that?

359
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:56,602
The evil spirits have arrived
to take me back with them.

360
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,768
What?

361
00:16:58,802 --> 00:16:59,935
We still have 10 minutes.

362
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,702
We have to hurry
and help Kogane back

363
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:03,068
before the evil spirits get her.

364
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:06,668
Yeah, but how do we do that?

365
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:08,368
Watch out, Kogane!

366
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,402
I don't care what
these ghouls are.

367
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,235
I'm gonna send 'em
back empty-handed!

368
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,168
This is like fighting air.

369
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,202
I can't even make contact
with these stupid goons.

370
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:24,935
Huh.

371
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:26,268
These spirits are ethereal.

372
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:28,202
Even someone as strong
as Ranma can't stop them

373
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:29,468
if he can't make contact.

374
00:17:29,502 --> 00:17:30,935
Mhm.

375
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,902
Dad, can't you, and
Uncle, and Happosai

376
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,635
I think of something
to help Ranma?

377
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:40,068
[grumbling]

378
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:41,535
Did you see that?

379
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:42,735
I get it.

380
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:43,902
Even the evil spirits
are frightened

381
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,835
of our truly evil master.

382
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:47,735
All right.

383
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:50,935
Happosai Barrier!

384
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:53,468
Geez Louise.

385
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:54,135
Yeah.

386
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:55,568
All right, old man.

387
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:57,835
The evil spirits are
starting to take off already.

388
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,302
You truly are a great master.

389
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:05,935
Hey, that's my bra!

390
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:08,402
Come back here, Happosai!

391
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,102
Give that bra back.

392
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:12,035
If only he quit
while he was ahead.

393
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:19,768
I knew that little jerk
would screw this up somehow.

394
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:21,735
Only a few minutes left, Ranma.

395
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,468
We just have to do something.

396
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,868
If only Happosai hadn't
put out the torches.

397
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:26,668
GONSUNKUGI
(VOICEOVER): Of course.

398
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:27,368
We need lights.

399
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:31,635
It's no use.

400
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:34,435
I don't wanna cause you anymore
trouble than I already have.

401
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:35,568
Forget about me.

402
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:36,535
Come back.

403
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:37,702
No, Kogane!

404
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,168
Huh?

405
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,035
I refuse to let any evil
spirits turn you into a zombie.

406
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:45,002
I'll light the way back
to the other side for you!

407
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:46,702
Gosunkugi.

408
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:49,268
Look, he's become
a human torch!

409
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:50,202
Good plan.

410
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:51,435
He's covered
himself with candles

411
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:52,968
so he can light
the way for Kogane

412
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:54,702
and help her get back
to the other side.

413
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:59,268
Retreat, bad spirits.

414
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:03,835
Be gone with ye and
come back never more!

415
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:05,868
Now's our chance, Kogane!

416
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:07,102
Really, Gosunkugi?

417
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,968
You'd risk your life for me?

418
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:11,235
Come on, hurry!

419
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:11,717
Gosunkugi!

420
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:15,717
Gosunkugi!

421
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:19,635
Oh no.

422
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:20,635
The clock's striking midnight.

423
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:23,502
We've run right outta time.

424
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:26,268
Gosunkugi.

425
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:26,758
Kogane!

426
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,235
Huh?

427
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:33,768
How come Gosunkugi
is starting to glow?

428
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:35,068
What's going on, Akane?

429
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:44,602
The fireflies!

430
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:47,168
They're the fireflies I let
loose in the garden before.

431
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:50,902
My, how beautiful.

432
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:52,835
Hurry, Kogane!

433
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:54,402
These fireflies
will be your torches

434
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,368
and light the way back
to the other side!

435
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:07,602
Thank you, Gosunkugi.

436
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:09,235
You're welcome.

437
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:12,068
You've given me some wonderful
memories to take with me.

438
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:16,402
Same here, Kogane.

439
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:33,335
Farewell, Gosunkugi.

440
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:34,702
Kogane.

441
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:35,302
Farewell.

442
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:42,068
See you.

443
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:45,302
I'm sure we'll see each
other again next summer.

444
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:47,202
I'll be waiting for you, Kogane.

445
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,835
I can't believe I actually
considered giving her up

446
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:09,202
for a while.

447
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,602
Oh well.

448
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:11,702
That was then.

449
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:12,602
This is now.

450
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,802
So I suppose you're
gonna tell me you're

451
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:23,235
on a nature shoot or something.

452
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:24,502
Oh, hi.

453
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:25,902
nice to see you.

454
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:26,502
Well?

455
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:34,468
Don't mind me.

456
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,468
Yeah, have a nice dip.

457
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,017
[theme music]

AKANE (VOICEOVER):
To love is to trust.

459
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:19,058
To love is to endure.

460
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:21,991
And finally, to
love is to cheer.

Next time on "Ranma
1/2," Bring It On.

Love as a Cheerleader Part 1.

463

We'll see you there.
