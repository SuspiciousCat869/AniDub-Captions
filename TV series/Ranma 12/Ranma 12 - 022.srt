00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:09,100
NARRATOR: Meet Ranma
Saotome of the Anything

2
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,500
Goes School of Martial Arts.

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,200
-Hey, let go.

4
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,433
NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

5
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,466
-What are you doing?

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,666
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,433
to marry by their
loving parents.

8
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:19,733
-I didn't ask for this.

9
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,033
-Who asked you?

10
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,733
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

11
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,400
-What'd you do that for?

12
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,366
NARRATOR: When Ranma's
splashed with cold water,

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,766
he becomes a she.

14
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:41,229
AKANE (VOICEOVER): "Clash
of the Delivery Girls!

15
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:43,555
The Martial Arts Takeout Race."

16
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:49,970
GENMA (VOICEOVER):
There was once

17
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:51,970
a time in my mid
'20s when I walked

18
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:53,870
the earth with my
newborn son Ranma

19
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:57,570
on my back in search of
martial arts techniques.

20
00:00:57,604 --> 00:01:00,537
Together, we traveled many
a strange and desolate land.

21
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,437
-So hungry.

22
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:20,837
So hungry.

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,137
[baby crying]

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,570
[sniffing]

25
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:36,837
[humming]

26
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:45,504
-Ah, doesn't that
smell good, Kaori?

27
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:47,504
Look at you, sleeping
like a little angel.

28
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:50,537
Your old dad's going to have
himself some nice fish, just

29
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,037
like your mother used to make.

30
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,504
Ah.

31
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:54,004
Huh?

32
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,170
What do you want?

33
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:07,604
-Just a little bite,
that's all I ask.

34
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:08,537
-No way.

35
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,837
What am I supposed to eat?

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,570
Get your own.

37
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:11,537
-Just one bite.

38
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,270
-I said no and I mean no.

39
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:16,870
-I can't go on.

40
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,104
Help me.

41
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,904
My boy and I are starving.

42
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:21,670
[baby crying]

43
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:23,470
There, there now, Ranma.

44
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:26,037
Quiet.

45
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,470
I'll do anything.

46
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:30,404
Please just tell
me what you want.

47
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:31,237
Shh, shh.

48
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,637
Be a good boy and stop crying.

49
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,504
-Anything?

50
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:37,470
Even the child on your back?

51
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:38,637
-Huh?

52
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,637
-The only thing I need
to die a happy man

53
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,937
is a male heir to
my family name.

54
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,804
If you give me your
son, I can bring him up

55
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:47,170
to marry my daughter.

56
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:50,004
And then he can inherit the
Daikoku School of Martial Arts.

57
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,537
And then-- huh?

58
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,637
Forget it.

59
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,404
Who would trade
their son for a fish?

60
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:01,937
-Throw in the rice and
pickles and he's all yours.

61
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:08,037
-That's it, little man.

62
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,604
Drink that milk
and grow up strong.

63
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:14,937
What an appetite.

64
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,104
The Daikoku School of Martial
Arts has an heir at last.

65
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:23,037
Poor man, I'll never forget
that look on his face.

66
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,570
Oh well.

67
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:29,670
Time to break camp.

68
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:33,037
[humming]

69
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:41,637
-I could never leave you, son.

70
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,837
A man's got to do what
a man's got to do.

71
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,570
I'll remember you
to my dying day.

72
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,870
GENMA (VOICEOVER): Little
did I know the true price I'd

73
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:58,037
eventually have to
pay for his help.

74
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,537
Oh.

75
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:03,070
-Give it back, old man.

76
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:04,637
-What do you take me for, boy?

77
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:13,637
-That's my pickle, pop.

78
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,404
Hand it over.

79
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:15,604
-I'd like to, but I can't.

80
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:17,504
Martial artists must rise
above their stomachs.

81
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,704
If this pickle causes
you to lose your focus,

82
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,270
it's my job to remove its
temptation from your sight.

83
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,337
It's for your own good.

84
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,937
You understand.

85
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,770
-Oh no.

86
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,104
I ain't buying that this time.

87
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,937
-Self-denial and
constant exercise

88
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,737
is the path of a
true martial artist.

89
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,904
Through these things
alone may a martial artist

90
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:40,637
attain enlightenment.

91
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,337
-Well, there's an
interesting theory.

92
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,337
-I'm done.

93
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,637
-Have a pickle, pop.

94
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:02,070
ANNOUNCER: That's right, folks.

95
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:04,104
For 10 years now,
King Kadai Restaurant

96
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,904
has been bringing
you 4,000 years

97
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:07,904
of delicious Chinese cuisine.

98
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:12,804
Take this flyer and get a free
appetizer with your next meal.

99
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:14,004
Here.

100
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:14,537
-Here, sir.

101
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,370
Have a flyer.

102
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:17,337
-Here you go.

103
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:27,304
What a car.

104
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,970
Have a flyer, sir.

105
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:34,070
MR. DAIKOKU: Ah, the city
seems prosperous enough.

106
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:56,037
-Huh?

107
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,970
You idiots!

108
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,870
MR. DAIKOKU: Guess
who's coming to dinner.

109
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:16,804
-Come back here.

110
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:18,804
MR. DAIKOKU: Is anyone home?

111
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,570
-Sounds like
someone's at the door.

112
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:21,537
KASUMI: I'll get it.

113
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,770
Hello?

114
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,637
Who's there?

115
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,637
-Sorry about that.

116
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,470
The door was open.

117
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:29,270
I let myself in.

118
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:31,370
-Oh, and who might
you be, stranger?

119
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:33,604
-I'm here for Ranma,
Ranma Saotome.

120
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,004
He does live here, doesn't he?

121
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,770
-Hey, Ranma, it looks
like you've got a visitor.

122
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:40,437
-Huh?

123
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,237
-Oh, Ranma!

124
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,337
It's me!

125
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,804
Your dad!

126
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,804
At last, I've found you, son.

127
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,537
-Hey, get him off of me.

128
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,037
-Please call me dad.

129
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,404
RANMA: Dad?

130
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,670
MR. DAIKOKU: Of course, once
you marry my little girl,

131
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,970
you will become my
true and legal heir.

132
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:57,737
-Married?

133
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,637
-What do you mean heir?

134
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,870
-You can come out now, Kaori.

135
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:16,304
-Greetings, future husband.

136
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:19,970
-Yeah, she sure is a
beauty now, isn't she?

137
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:21,970
-Ranma, what is the
meaning of this?

138
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:22,804
-I don't know.

139
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:25,570
I don't know.

140
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:26,670
-Don't worry, son.

141
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:28,737
Your father has already
agreed to the match.

142
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,604
Now, where is Genma anyhow?

143
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:33,537
-Come on.

144
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,870
The jig is up, Mr. Saotome.

145
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:36,670
-Explain yourself Saotome.

146
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:37,770
What's going on?

147
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:40,570
-Did you have to use
boiling water, Tendo?

148
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:42,570
-That's your least worry.

149
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:43,670
You--

150
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:44,570
-There you are, Genma.

151
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,337
-Yeah, there he is.

152
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,704
-You left so very quickly.

153
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:50,970
-Yes, well I--

154
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,704
-What'd you do this time?

155
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:55,137
-Ranma, my boy.

156
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,037
Well, you see, I, uh--
try to understand, boy.

157
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,970
Things were different.

158
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:09,604
-You sold me for one crummy
little stinking fish, huh?

159
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,637
-He also threw in the
rice and two pickles.

160
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,804
-What kind of father are you?

161
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:18,804
-I know that I can
never take your place

162
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,204
in Ranma's little heart, Genma.

163
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:22,504
But I'll try and
be a good father.

164
00:08:22,537 --> 00:08:24,637
-Uh, I'm sure you would.

165
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,504
-Wait just a minute now.

166
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:28,237
There's something
you need to know.

167
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,904
Ranma has a fiancee.

168
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:30,737
-What's this?

169
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,704
Is it true, girl?

170
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:32,737
-No way, no.

171
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,837
Absolutely not.

172
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,404
-You know, I've been
saying that for months.

173
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:36,270
-Shut up.

174
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:50,370
-Please forgive my impertinence.

175
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,770
-Oh my, she's good.

176
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:53,637
-Very impressive.

177
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,437
[whistle]

178
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,704
-Meh, she's not bad.

179
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,304
-Well, I see.

180
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,370
You've got a certain
amount invested in the boy.

181
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:01,804
You must be compensated.

182
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:03,170
What would be reasonable?

183
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:05,404
-So how much you've got?

184
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,270
-Don't you dare.

185
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:07,937
-Put yourself in my shoes, boy.

186
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,004
KASUMI: Does this mean Ranma and
Akane won't be getting married?

187
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:10,037
-Why would I do that?

188
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,804
NABIKI: Poor Akane.

189
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:11,870
-You sold me, remember?

190
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:12,804
-I never said yes.

191
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:15,037
-Sir, your offer is refused.

192
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,837
After he marries my
Akane, he'll help

193
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,237
with the Anything Goes
School of Martial Arts.

194
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,370
-I've already named him
heir to the Daikoku School.

195
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:24,070
[clears throat]

196
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:25,370
What is it, Kaori dear?

197
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,604
Tell me, Akane,
my daughter would

198
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:34,170
like to know if
you truly love him,

199
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:36,737
or are you just being obedient?

200
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,070
-Love?

201
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:38,937
Hmph.

202
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,837
No way.

203
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,904
-Oh yeah?

204
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:42,404
Well, I don't like
girls like you anyway.

205
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:44,237
-Aw, who cares, pervert?

206
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,837
RANMA: Tomboy.

207
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,804
Flat-chested.

208
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:46,304
AKANE: Dope.

209
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:46,970
Dimwit.

210
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,137
Dummy, dummy, dummy.

211
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,304
You make me sick to my stomach!

212
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:52,437
[cough]

213
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,237
-What's that, dear?

214
00:09:57,504 --> 00:10:00,004
Akane, my daughter would
like to challenge you,

215
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,137
and the winner of the
duel will get Ranma.

216
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,370
-What?

217
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:06,370
-She is of the opinion
that, despite your protests,

218
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,837
you have some feeling for him.

219
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,804
She offers you a
chance to keep him

220
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,970
by engaging in combat with her.

221
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:13,904
-She accepts.

222
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,570
I as her father
grant permission.

223
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:17,137
What will they compete in?

224
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,837
-Ah yes, the sport.

225
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,104
Ah, that's it.

226
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:24,137
How does this strike you, huh?

227
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,270
-Let me see.

228
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:27,337
Miss Martial Arts Takeout Race.

229
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,604
The winner gets a
year's supply of ramen.

230
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,070
She'll do it.

231
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,837
-I'm not giving up young Ranma.

232
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,804
-There's no way I'm giving up
on that ramen, or on Ranma.

233
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,037
-How did this happen?

234
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,837
-First a fish and
now it's noodles.

235
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:03,398
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
the Miss Martial Arts Takeout

236
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:06,431
Race should be getting
started at any moment now.

237
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,898
As explained earlier,
the first delivery girl

238
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:12,098
to safely pass through the
checkpoints and reach the goal

239
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:13,465
is the winner.

240
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:18,265
We'd tell you the rules, but
the fact is there aren't any.

241
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:20,698
-So you agree then that
the loser will willingly

242
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,698
give up Ranma to the winner.

243
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,498
-I'll gift wrap him.

244
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:27,598
-Ranma, I'm not doing this
for you, you got that?

245
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:29,098
-Yeah, sure, whatever.

246
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:31,531
Just get out there and
win that ramen, all right?

247
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,598
-Oh yeah, that's right.

248
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:34,165
You've got half
a right to enter.

249
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:35,965
Why aren't you
competing in this?

250
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:38,365
-Because I'm a guy and
I plan to stay that way.

251
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,698
Got it?

252
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:41,765
ANNOUNCER: Will all contestants
come to the starting line,

253
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:42,731
please.

254
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:43,831
That's right, girls.

255
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:45,265
Move in a little closer there.

256
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:47,065
We're just about
to-- what's this?

257
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:49,631
It seems a young girl will be
competing in her wedding dress.

258
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:51,565
Very interesting.

259
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:53,998
-Who does she think she is?

260
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:54,498
Hmph.

261
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:01,498
-I have seen that grip
before, ladies and gentlemen.

262
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:05,965
I believe we are in for a treat.

263
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:06,465
-Hiya!

264
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:25,798
ANNOUNCER: Not one
delicious drop wasted.

265
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:28,331
We're talking takeout on
a scale unheard of, ladies

266
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:29,431
and gentleman.

267
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:32,498
We're talking clash
of the delivery girls!

268
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:34,198
-I'll bet you
didn't know my girl

269
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:36,965
is a master in the ancient
art of martial arts

270
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:38,665
restaurant takeout, eh?

271
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:40,931
-Martial arts takeout?

272
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:41,998
-What's that?

273
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:43,398
-Shame.

274
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,498
Everyone knows the ancient art
of martial arts takeout started

275
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,965
in the Aizuna prefecture
during the Edo period.

276
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:49,898
They were fields and
mountains to get through,

277
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,698
and other kinds of perils-- wild
boars, bandits, cut-throats.

278
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,298
Imagine the gratitude when
that food finally arrived, safe

279
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:56,465
and still piping hot.

280
00:12:56,498 --> 00:12:59,465
Thus was the art of
martial arts takeout born.

281
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:03,398
You haven't got
a chance, mister.

282
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,098
ANNOUNCER: Ready.

283
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:11,498
Set.

284
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:16,831
Go!

285
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:36,831
-Cheater.

286
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:40,165
-No rules, right?

287
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,631
-How did you?

288
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:45,131
-Observe, Daikoku
School of Martial Arts,

289
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,565
Special Technique--
It's Fast or it's Free.

290
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:06,531
-You can do it, Akane.

291
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:07,831
-Hey, try not to kill yourself.

292
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:08,531
-Ranma.

293
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:09,731
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Hmph.

294
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,531
Who does that idiot think
I'm fighting for anyway?

295
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:14,531
-Ranma, hey now.

296
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:15,365
Whoa.

297
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:16,665
Loosen up your grip there, son.

298
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:17,298
OK.

299
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:18,065
Come on, hey.

300
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:19,098
Look who it is.

301
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:21,765
I'm counting on you
to win that ramen.

302
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:23,365
-My old man?

303
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:26,865
Yo, pop, I thought this
race was for women only?

304
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:29,631
-But son, this too is part
of the Anything Goes fighting

305
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:30,131
style.

306
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:30,631
Whoa--

307
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:42,731
-Stay out of my way.

308
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,065
KAORI (VOICEOVER):
Why won't she quit?

309
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,531
-Daikoku School of Martial Arts.

310
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:54,198
-Not again.

311
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:54,998
-Fishcake Blizzard.

312
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:02,898
GENMA (VOICEOVER):
Ah, it's a small price

313
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,398
to pay for a year's
worth of ramen.

314
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:05,965
Ugh!

315
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:07,031
What is it?

316
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:09,898
Get it off me!

317
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:10,865
No, no!

318
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:19,965
-You look good like
that down there.

319
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:22,731
Don't look so stricken
on my account, dear.

320
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:25,465
I'm sure Ranma and I shall
be perfectly happy together.

321
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,231
-It's not over yet.

322
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:37,931
Martial Arts
Restaurant Takeout--

323
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:40,265
who thought up this
dumb race anyway?

324
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:44,931
There's no way
I'm going to lose.

325
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:55,998
-So long, Akane Tendo.

326
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:00,998
-Ow, my leg.

327
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:01,965
It's numb.

328
00:16:01,998 --> 00:16:03,498
-Guess it's just
me from here on in.

329
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:07,431
-I just can't let her beat me.

330
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,398
-Ramen Roundup Noodle Noose.

331
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:15,531
-Oh no!

332
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,931
That idiot.

333
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:20,231
-Observe the most lethal
attack of the Daikoku School

334
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:21,898
of Restaurant Takeout
Martial Arts--

335
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,131
the Ramen Roundup Noodle Noose!

336
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,898
Just like the coils
of a deadly snake,

337
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,765
the ramen noodles close
tighter and tighter.

338
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:29,598
The more you fight, the
tighter they become.

339
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:31,998
Surrender.

340
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:34,698
It's over.

341
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:37,131
-I'll let go if you give up.

342
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,731
-Ra-- Ranma--

343
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,431
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Don't ask me to do it.

344
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,131
-Ra--

345
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:44,631
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
I'll do anything,

346
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,531
but don't ask me to
become a girl again.

347
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:50,131
I just-- Whoa!

348
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:54,465
-Well, Akane, give up?

349
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:00,865
-Ranma, you came.

350
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:02,831
-Are you all right, Akane?

351
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:03,565
-Yes.

352
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:04,698
-Sorry, girly.

353
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,131
But I'm afraid I can't
let you win this race.

354
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:08,398
-Where did she come from?

355
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:10,965
-You're trying to take Ranma
away from me, aren't you?

356
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,365
RANMA: Wouldn't
you like to know?

357
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:20,365
-You can't have him.

358
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,165
-Oh no!

359
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:26,665
-There.

360
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:38,331
-Got it.

361
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,798
-Take a good look at that ramen.

362
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,631
RANMA: The fishcake,
it fell off.

363
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:45,631
-You can't serve ramen
without fishcake, dear.

364
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,498
You lose the fishcake,
you lose the race.

365
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:49,231
-Honestly.

366
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:50,598
Ranma, look up there.

367
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:52,865
-Huh?

368
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:53,331
OK.

369
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:56,431
-Ranma.

370
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:06,965
-No!

371
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:07,531
No!

372
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:08,398
Don't eat that.

373
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:09,398
Bad doggy.

374
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,565
-Oh no, you don't.

375
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,898
-There can only be one
winner in this race.

376
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,598
-Faster, faster, Kaori!

377
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:26,665
You can do it!

378
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:29,898
-For the sake of the Anything
Goes School of Martial Arts,

379
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:32,865
run faster, Ranma!

380
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:34,865
-We're almost at
the finish line.

381
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:41,265
Come here.

382
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:46,765
-Let go of my legs.

383
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,198
-No way, girl.

384
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:51,631
-Akane, go for it.

385
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,131
-Ranma.

386
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:05,898
-Kaori, try harder.

387
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:08,231
-Akane, do it.

388
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:10,198
-I can't.

389
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:11,631
-Akane, you can do it.

390
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,131
You're almost there.

391
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:32,398
SOUN: She did it.

392
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:34,131
She defended the
honor of the Anything

393
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:37,231
Goes School of Martial Arts,
and she defended the ramen too.

394
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:51,231
-Ranma, Akane, I hope the two
of you will be very happy.

395
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:54,365
Genma and Soun, thanks a
lot for the hospitality.

396
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:57,265
My daughter would like
to thank you as well.

397
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,665
-Oh, there's no
need to thank us.

398
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,098
At least let us offer you a
bowl of ramen for the road.

399
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:04,631
-Well, thanks for
the thought, but I

400
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,765
think we're a bit ramen'd out.

401
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,765
Perhaps we'll join
you the next time.

402
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:11,265
Farewell.

403
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:16,431
-Well, well well.

404
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,931
This has been a very
interesting day.

405
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:20,665
Wouldn't you say so, Saotome?

406
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:21,898
-Mm.

407
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:24,998
Well then, Tendo, shall we, ah--

408
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:26,931
-Of course, we shall.

409
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,965
Our favorite food is--

410
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:31,231
ALL: Takeout ramen.

411
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:32,998
-Eat up now, everyone.

412
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,931
There's plenty more
where that came from.

413
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:39,398
-Akane.

414
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:40,531
-Huh?

415
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:42,331
-I helped you because I
wanted the free ramen.

416
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:43,998
It's not because I
like you or nothing.

417
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:44,698
You got that?

418
00:20:47,598 --> 00:20:48,986
-Don't worry.

419
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:49,953
Your secret is safe.

420
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:59,053
-The Anything Goes
School is secure.

421
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:02,786
-And we got a year of
free ramen for nothing.

422
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:05,086
MAN: Is anybody home?

423
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,753
-Someone's at the door.

424
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:07,719
-Hello?

425
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:08,686
Who is it?

426
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,986
-Sorry about that, folks.

427
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,319
No need for alarm.

428
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,719
The door was open
so I let myself in.

429
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,453
-And who might you be, stranger?

430
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,953
-I'm here for Ranma Saotome.

431
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:18,619
-Huh?

432
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,286
Well, I'm Ranma Saotome.

433
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,386
That's me.

434
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,053
Who are you?

435
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:24,286
-Oh, Ranma!

436
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,753
It's me, your dad.

437
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,253
Call me dad, son.

438
00:21:30,286 --> 00:21:33,253
-How many more fiancees
do I have anyway?

439
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:41,881
[theme music]

440
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:11,781
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I
know Ranma's weak spot.

441
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:13,615
Aw, don't make such
a big deal about it.

442
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:16,615
Everybody's got a
weak spot, don't they?

443
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:17,881
Then again.

444
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:21,015
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
"You Really Do Hate Cats!"

445
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,715
See you there.
