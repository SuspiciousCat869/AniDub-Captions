I was talking to Akane

-Honestly, with dad and
Mr. Saotome out of town,

54
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:19,266
Happosai just gets more
and more out of control.

55
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:21,233
-Yeah, you ain't kidding.

56
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,433
What's the matter with
those two jerks anyway?

57
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,833
Every time Happosai
looks at them

58
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,900
cross eyed, they make a
break and run for the border.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
-Yeah, they're just
like a couple of kids

61

If they're not to do
something about how Happosai,

62
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,233
then maybe it's time we did.

-Don't worry.

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,266
I'm one step ahead of you.

65
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,233
I've already been
working on a plan to--

66
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:37,774
-AH!

00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:39,741
-What is it?

00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:40,707
What's wrong with them?

70
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:41,707
You OK down there?

71
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,074
-Ew, what do you
think happened to him?

72
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:43,974
-Ohh, that's harsh.

73
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,107
-Ahh!

00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:47,174
-Just hang in there a
little longer, Saotome.

75
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:48,741
I know you're weak
with hunger, but we

76
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:51,041
don't dare go back
to the Dojo, no, not

77
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,341
until the Master is ready to
forgive us our trespasses,

even if it is our own home.

00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,241
-It's the old man.

80
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:57,307
-And my dad, too.

81
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:03,874
Grandfather, Happosai and I
have had a good, long talk

82
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,874
about why we musn't bully
those weaker than ourselves.

83
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,507
So please stop running away.

locking them in their rooms.

-I wish you'd stop the
bowing and scraping, Pop.

86
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,041
It don't look good.

00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:18,382
-Hm?

88
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:19,215
-Hm?

00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:20,548
-Actually, son the truth is uh--

90
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:22,815
-Happosai: You don't mind
if I borrow your iron again,

91
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:23,915
huh Kasumi?

92
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:24,648
-What do you know?

93
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:26,148
Ain't you home early?

94
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:26,915
What's the matter?

95
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:28,115
You get hungry?

96
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:30,215
-You're unworthy student
abases himself before you,

97
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:31,748
oh great and terrible master.

98
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,015
May I say that your're
looking exceptionally spry

99
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:36,548
this fine day.

100
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:37,882
-Bleah.

101
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:39,982
-Does this mean you won't be
giving me any more trouble?

102
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:41,148
-SOUN TENDO: No, Master.

103
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,282
We're sorry Master.

104
00:05:42,382 --> 00:05:44,682
It'll never happen
again, Master.

105
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:47,582
-What a bunch of suck ups.

106
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,915
-Little do you know son,
it's not just sucking up.

107
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,215
It's part of our strategy.

108
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:52,715
-What strategy?

109
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:54,215
SOUN TENDO: Those
times we left home

110
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:56,115
without warning, we
weren't just running away,

111
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:57,382
we were doing it for a reason.

112
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,215
-What reason?

113
00:05:58,315 --> 00:05:59,582
SOUN TENDO: Well, since you ask.

114
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:04,882
We're talking nothing
less than complete

115
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:06,548
and utter defeat
of the evil master.

116
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,215
-What was that again?

117
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:10,848
Nothing less than complete
submission to our master.

118
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:13,348
-OK, then.

119
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,682
-Why, I can almost
remember it all as

120
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:16,715
though it were yesterday.

121
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:22,048
Saotome, I'm so hungry.

122
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,148
If we don't get
something to eat soon,

123
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:26,982
we're going to die out here.

124
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:28,582
-You're right, Soun Tendo.

125
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:30,848
Maybe we can challenge
that Dojo up ahead

126
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:32,182
and get some food money.

127
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:36,948
BOTH: This is a challenge.

128
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,082
Open up.

129
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:39,348
SOUN TENDO: It was as
though destiny itself

130
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:40,748
had guided us to his door.

131
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:42,548
Arriving in the Dojo
of Master Chingensai

132
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,715
was a blessing from the gods.

133
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:47,982
-Huh, don't get many
visitors out in these parts.

134
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:49,648
Well, boys, what
are you waiting for.

135
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:53,315
If you're going to
come at me, come at me.

136
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,582
BOTH: OK, we'll be right there.

137
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,182
-We'd better double team
him just in case, eh Tendo?

138
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:59,482
-OK.

139
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:01,682
Chingensai, super
secret special attack.

140
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:02,548
BOTH: What?

141
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:05,215
-Now you see me, now you don't.

142
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:05,782
-Whoa.

143
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:15,048
Oooh. [crash]

144
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:16,982
SOUN TENDO: After we came
to, Master Chingensai

145
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,548
told us his technique was a
small part of the skills he'd

146
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,148
acquired as a member of a secret
society of Chinese assassins

147
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:25,682
dating back over 3,000 years.

148
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:28,382
It should go without saying
that even here in Japan

149
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,815
with our own proud
ninja tradition,

150
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:33,648
Master Chingensai's secret
ninja tricks were without equal.

151
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:39,748
Naturally we begged
for the privilege

152
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,715
of becoming his disciples, and
soon began the long process

153
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:44,815
of self purification
to make ourselves

154
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:47,315
worthy enough to study
at his venerable feet.

155
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:54,582
Sometimes he'd have us sumo
wrestle the local wildlife.

156
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,615
Other times, we'd work on
our strength exercises.

157
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:08,848
The training was very
difficult, wasn't it Saotome?

158
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:09,982
-Ninja tricks, huh?

159
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:11,448
-RIght.

160
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:14,215
-The time has come to put those
ninja tricks to use and throw

161
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:15,848
down the evil master
once and for--

162
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:18,215
-Soun, Genma, how's
about the three of us

163
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,515
throw down a couple of drinks?

164
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:24,215
[laughing]

165
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:27,082
-Looks like you boys picked up
a few new tricks along the way

166
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:28,515
this time, huh?

167
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:29,982
-Nonsense Master, nonsense.

168
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:31,882
Why the student's only
as good as the master,

169
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:34,182
or so I always say.

170
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:34,748
Here, Master.

171
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,015
Have a drink.

172
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,448
Kasumi, the Master's not
getting any younger you know.

173
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:39,382
KASUMI: I'm coming.

174
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:40,148
-What ninja tricks?

175
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:41,482
I don't see any.

176
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:44,815
-Yeah, unless he means a new
way to suck up or something.

177
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:47,182
-Son, It's not sucking
up, it's strategy.

178
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:49,082
One, all things come
to he who waits.

179
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:53,515
[laughing]

180
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:54,882
-We'll be waiting a while.

181
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:56,215
-No kidding.

182
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:59,048
-Super secret ninja trick
number two, to fool your enemy,

183
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:02,015
it's first necessary
to fool your friends.

184
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:03,882
[laughing]

185
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:08,115
RANMA: The only one
he's fooling is himself.

186
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,315
-Super secret ninja
trick number three,

187
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:12,082
blessed is he who
expects nothing,

188
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:14,048
for he shall never
be disappointed.

189
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:15,215
-Now I'm confused.

190
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:17,148
-And you weren't before now.

191
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:20,782
SOUN TENDO: Go Master, go.

192
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:23,315
There he is, the
best master in Japan.

193
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:31,882
-Well boys, I'm off to work.

194
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:34,048
-Please be careful
out there, Master.

195
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:36,282
We'll be praying for
your safe return, Master.

196
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,215
HAPPOSAI: Ha ha, ha, ha.

197
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:39,882
Whoo, ha ha ha.

198

[doorslam]

199
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,182
-Super secret ninja
trick number four,

200
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,115
don't fix it if it ain't broke.

201
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,115
-Um hmm.

202
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:59,115
-So much for their
so-called strategy.

203
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,215
What a laugh.

204
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:02,082
-Last night was a new
low, even for them.

205
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:03,848
-Hey it's like you
said before, Akane.

206
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:05,215
If those two suck
ups ain't going

207
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:07,882
to put a stop to the old
freak, then maybe we should.

208
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,015
So you remember the plan?

209
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:10,415
I'll distract them
and then you--

210
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:12,382
AKANE: Don't worry
just leave it to me.

211
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,115
-Aah!

212
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:14,848
-Here he comes.

213
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:15,415
-Ha ha ha.

214
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,815
Ooh, hoo, hoo.

215
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:17,782
Woo.

216
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:20,548
How sweet.

217
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:22,515
-Sucker.

218
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,415
Hand them over, pervert.

219
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:26,648
-What are you doing?

220
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:28,448
It's made of paper.

221
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:30,715
Why, how dare you
fool an old man

222
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,082
with a paper bra
trick like that.

223
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:33,915
Give me back my
collection this instant.

224
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:34,615
-Mah.

225
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:35,582
-Why you little puke.

226
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:36,848
You won't get away with this.

227
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:37,648
Give it back.

228
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:39,015
Well give me back my precious.

229
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:39,615
RANMA: Ha, ha.

230
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:40,415
Make me, gramps.

231
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,615
HAPPOSAI: Oh, give it back.

232
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:42,715
That's it.

233
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,382
Look what you're going make me--

234
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:45,248
RANMA: Make you what?

235
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:46,648
HAPPOSAI: Make me cry.

236
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:48,015
RANMA: Cut it out.

237
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,815
No fair for you to start crying.

238
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,815
-Wait, I'm not ready yet.

239
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:54,315
HAPPOSAI: I'll teach you to
mess with me, you little punk.

240
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:57,148
Give me back my collection
this instant or I'll--

241
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:59,215
-Huh?

242
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:01,515
-I yi, yi.

243
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:03,315
I never knew--

244
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:04,615
-Never knew what?

245
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:07,882
-I never knew you shared my
enthusiasm for underwear.

246
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:10,515
AKANE: Dry up and die, you.

247
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:12,948
Honestly, shared his
enthusiasm for underwear.

248
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,748
Like I'd want to share anything
with that little creep.

249
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:17,515
-Man, for a runt,
he sure hits hard.

250
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:18,415
Did you do it?

251
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:19,748
-Yeah, I think so.

252
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,982
But do you really think your
plan's going to work Ranma.

253
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,948
-Trust me, Akane.

[music playing]

-How sweet it is.

256
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,382
Once again I've managed to
score myself some top quality

257
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:53,316
merchandise.

258
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,582
When it comes to
lacy under things,

259
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:56,216
only the very finest will do.

260
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,082
Like these frilly
undies, for example.

261
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:01,149
[coughing] Oh, Hey.

262
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,149
So now what did I do?

263
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:09,016
-Ha, sorry to disappoint
you gramps, but them undies

264
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:10,116
ain't undies at all.

265
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,082
They're jock straps from
the guys rugby team.

266
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,216
-What about these?

267
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,816
Some, some cuties leotard from
the gymnastics team, right?

268
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:20,916
RANMA: Close.

269
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,082
How about a member of
the wrestling team?

270
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,082
The these.

271
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:27,482
This would have to be
a sash from some guy--

272
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:29,116
RANMA: Sumo outfit.

273
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,382
Yeah, you've got it.

274
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:31,816
And the best part
is none of them

275
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,816
have been washed in a week.

276
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,016

-Ha, ha, ha ha, ha.

-That was cruel.

281
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:50,782
Is it all guy's
underwear, all of it?

282
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:52,049
Oh, what have you done with it?

283
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:52,882
-With what?

284
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:53,949
The undies that were in there?

285
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:55,349
Gave them back, that's what.

286
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,682
-You won't get away with this.

287
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,616
Oh, dear, I'm suddenly dizzy.

288
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:02,449
I gotta go.

289
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,382

00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:13,949
What happened your dizzy spell?

00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,349
You little--

294
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:19,016
-Hey, dizzy or not,
it's going to take

295
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:20,816
more than some
little punk like you

296
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:25,582
to-- it was the smell
of those underwear.

297
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:27,716
-Who would've thought
the stinky little goat

298
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:30,282
would get so grossed out by
a pair of some stinky guys

299
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:31,349
underwear.

300
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:33,316
AKANE: Ranma, he's
stopped moving.

301
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,582
-Serves the little
pervert right.

302
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,782
-Grandfather Happosai,
please I'm worried about you.

303
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:40,749
-Akane, help me.

304
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:41,549
I can't--

305
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,516
RANMA: Akane not this time.

306
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,416
Akane only let you get
away with that junk

307
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:46,782
because she feels sorry for you.

308
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:49,516
But I ain't got that problem
so you better start shaping up

309
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:50,982
or you're going to regret it.

310
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:52,749
-No more stealing, you got it?

311
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:56,082
-What've I ever done
to deserve this?

312
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:59,082
If I can't steal women's
undies, or look up their skirts,

313
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:01,616
or grab a girlies,
you might as well

314
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,082
kill me and get it over with.

315

-Dad?

-Hello, children.

318
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,016
We know you must be
wondering by now why

319
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:16,416
we weren't here to help you
bring the Master to justice.

320
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,682
But please don't think
it's because we don't care

321
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:21,182
or that we don't have complete
faith in your abilities.

322
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:24,249
No, it's more a matter
of a overall strategy

323
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:27,082
as in uh-- Help me
out here, Saotome.

325
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,082
SOUN TENDO: Enough talking.

326
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:32,282
Let's finish off the
Master, and be done with it.

327
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:34,082
-Why, you ungrateful little--

328
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:36,382
-Jeez, I think even a five
year old could finish up

329
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:37,716
the freak at this point.

330
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:39,849
SOUN TENDO: Super Secret
Ninja Trick Number

331
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,249
Five, if it is broke, make
sure it stays that way.

332
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,649
-Good thing I
brought this along.

333
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:48,816
All I need is a little of this
baby and I'll be back to myself

334
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,482
in no time.

335
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:52,616
Close thing too.

336
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:53,716
Woo.

337
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:54,916
For a while there I
thought I was a goner.

338
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:56,216
Ha ha, ha.

339
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:58,849
SOUN TENDO: That's
our Master, all right.

340
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:59,916
-There you go.

341
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:00,916
Suck it up again.

342
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:03,116
-Ohh, can't I just keep one?

343
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,116
-I said no stealing, remember?

344
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,082
Or have you forgotten all ready?

345
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:08,582
-Please Akane, please.

346
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:10,149
-She said no, and she means no.

347
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:12,582
-Oh, I feel the
dizzies coming on.

348
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:15,849
-Guess that bra
didn't last long.

349
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,016
-Behold, knowing that
the best place to hide

350
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,849
is in plain sight
in the Chingensai

351
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:22,082
school of martial arts,
even kitchen items

352
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:25,549
become deadly weapons.

353
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:29,549
-Take these whirling
blades for instance.

354
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,982
I gotta a couple of tricks
of my own up my sleeve.

355
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,049
Happo fire.

356
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:34,982
-Don't look!

357
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:39,116
SOUN TENDO: Hungry for
more punishment, Master?

358
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:40,982
Have some pot sticker bombs.

359
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,182
-Pot sticker bombs, huh?

360
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,516
-Now why didn't I think of that?

361
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,516
Why?

362
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,349
Why are you all picking
on me like this?

363
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,949
-Through 3,000 years
of Chinese history,

364
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:06,416
behold an invisibility
technique so deadly

365
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:07,949
even the assassins
of the Chingensai

366
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:11,182
school of martial arts
couldn't master it.

367
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:14,549
Now you see us,
and know you don't.

368
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:25,849
-Ranma, they--

369
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:27,616
-They d-- disappeared.

370
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:30,582
HAPPOSAI: When did those bozos
learn that dangerous technique.

371
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:32,482
Personally I'd rather
stick to the basics,

372
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:34,049
you know, things that I do best.

373
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,649
AKANE: Now it's your
turn to disappear.

374
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,216
HAPPOSAI: I'm back.

375
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:41,782
Thanks.

376
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,049
I needed that.

377
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:45,316
-I guess grabbing at you
brought the old freak back

378
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,449
from the dead, Akane.

379
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,349
-Bingo.

380
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:50,149
-How dare you use
me as a battery.

381
00:16:58,749 --> 00:16:59,982
SOUN TENDO: I can breathe again.

382
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,916
I knew it.

383
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:03,282
-You're our last hope, Saotome.

384
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:04,416
I'm counting on you.

385
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:11,049
HAPPOSAI: Come out, come
out, wherever you are.

386
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,782
-Hiding yourself in the
dirt with a hand trowel

387
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:20,516
is not what I would call
an invisibility technique.

388
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:22,349
-Hey, I did the
best I could, OK.

389
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,616
Do you think it was easy
to dig a trench this large.

390
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:25,882
It took me most of the week.

391
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:26,982
I tried didn't I?

392
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,082
Isn't that what counts?

393
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:29,682
-It makes me sick
to even look at you.

394
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,016
How dare you call
yourself my disciple.

395
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:35,549
-Hey, looking at it you makes
me sick, but am I complaining?

396
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:36,098
Ahh.

397
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:40,864
-Why you little--

398
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:46,731
-Happo fire burn.

399
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:47,464
No mercy.

400
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:52,698
-Come here you little freak.

401
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:54,498
-Ranma.

402
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:55,464
-Hey, thanks.

403
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:08,231
AKANE: Ranma.

404
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:11,231
SOUN TENDO: Good job, son.

405
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,264
-What the-- The freak's gone.

406
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:15,831
-He's what?

407
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:18,098
-Saotome, that total
submission routine

408
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,031
isn't going to get
you out of this one.

409
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,564
-Quit that bowing and scraping.

410
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:23,864
-Ranma, over there.

411
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:26,898
RANMA: We got you now, freak.

412
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:27,764
Give it up.

413
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:33,798
-You've caught be
fair and square.

414
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:35,631
As you said before,
the student's

415
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,698
only as good the
master and I guess

416
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:40,364
there's nothing else
I can teach you.

417
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:42,731
Before I go, allow
me to share with you

418
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,364
one last ultimate
technique as a parting gift

419
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:47,931
before I make my way
into the next dimension.

420
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:49,631
-Ultimate technique?

421
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:50,564
-Next dimension?

422
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:54,764
-Now you see me
and now you don't.

423
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,064
-He really did disappear.

424
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:02,364
-And here I thought he
was just making it up.

425
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:03,998
HAPPOSAI: Anything
goes founding school

426
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:05,998
of martial arts
ultimate technique,

427
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:07,598
extra-dimensional warp.

428
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:09,398
By becoming one with
your surroundings,

429
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:11,031
you become impossible to attack.

430
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,831
Are you two following all this.

431
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:13,564
-Go on, Master.

432
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:14,398
We're listening.

433
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,031
HAPPOSAI: On your knees, worms.

434
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:17,598
Frankly I'd heard
that you boys would

435
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,764
think that I didn't have a few
disappearing tricks of my own.

436
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:22,698
-We're sorry, Master.

437
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,964
Please, Master can you ever
forgive our doubting you?

438
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:30,198
Please take pity on us, and
grant us a merciful death.

439
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:31,964
HAPPOSAI: I'll agree
that you're pathetic,

440
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:33,998
but if you think you're
groveling your way out

441
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,998
of this one, you've got
another thing coming.

442
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,698
-If we can't see him
we can't attack him,

443
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:40,064
and that means we can only--
Please, Master, please.

444
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:41,231
We're not worthy.

445
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:42,864
HAPPOSAI: You can
sure say that again.

446
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:43,498
Ha, ha, ha.

447
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:44,698
Well, well, well.

448
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,564
If it isn't my own
disciples, Sohn and Genma.

449
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:49,931
I'd recognize that
crying voice anywhere.

450
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,498
I know that voice.

451
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:54,131
-Master Chingensai.

452
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:55,498
-Master Chingensai?

453
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:57,764
SOUN TENDO: It's him, he's come
to save us, good old Master

454
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,864
Chingensai.

455
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,098
CHINGENSAI: Ha, fat chance.

456
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:00,798
Ha.

457
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:01,964
You got that right.

458
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:03,731
You'd think these two
would've figured out

459
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:05,564
by now that the
now you see me, now

460
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,164
you don't technique's
nothing more

461
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:10,064
than a cheap trick,
a silly bit of razzle

462
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,831
dazzle designed to
frighten the locals

463
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:14,398
and impress gullible
martial art students.

464
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:16,998
Come and save them,
huh, what a laugh.

465
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,598
Sure it's impossible
to attack someone

466
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:21,464
whose using the technique,
but you can't attack either,

467
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:22,564
so it kind of balances out.

468
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:23,631
-I get it.

469
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:25,664
If you're invisible,
you can't fight, right?

470
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:29,364
Master Chingensai.

471
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:30,731
-Hi ya.

472
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:33,231
Don't tell me you didn't know
that the now you see me now

473
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:34,664
you don't technique
was developed

474
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:36,498
to spy into girls locker rooms.

475
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:37,731
-Bingo.

476
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:41,831
The same thing goes for
the extra dimensional warp.

477
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:42,898
Hey, there are Chingensai.

478
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:43,898
How's it going?

479
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,764
-Oh, I'm hanging in there.

480
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:46,598
-How are you?

481
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:48,231
-How long has it been any way?

482
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,764
-Jeez, I don't know.

483
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:53,098
Let's see, January,
February, March--

484
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:55,998
I don't know what
it's been too long.

485
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:59,531
-We sure had some great
times together, remember?

486
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:02,998
-We even ate our rice out
of the same pot, remember?

487
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:06,398
-Don't tell me, those
two trained together?

488
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,064
-So, the master they
ran away to study under

489
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:12,664
turns out to be a friend of
the master they ran away from.

490
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:14,898
Must be a weird kind
of fate or something.

491
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,631
-And not only that
there's a college dorm

492
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:18,898
right near my dojo.

493
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:19,964
-Really?

494
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:21,764
-And the best part
is, you can see right

495
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,298
into the bathing area.

496
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:23,998
-Let's go.

497
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:25,598
What are we waiting for?

498
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:26,331
Sohn, Genma.

499
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:27,564
-Yes, Master.

500
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:29,198
-Stop groveling
and give us a lift.

501
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:30,164
-Right away, Master.

502
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:36,264
RANMA: Yet another pervert
rears it's ugly head.

503
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:38,464
AKANE: I guess there's
no escaping fate, huh?

504
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:48,620
[music playing]

505
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,075
-Oh, come on, upper
classman Kuno,

506
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:23,342
stop picking on poor
Susuki like that.

507
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:24,875
Now look what you've done.

508
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:26,708
You've made him
run away from home.

509
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:30,508
Next time on Ranma one half, Les
Miserable of the Kuno Estate.

510
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:32,242
We'll see you there.
