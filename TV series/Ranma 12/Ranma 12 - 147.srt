And she say, yeah,
but that [inaudible]

used to be electric.

Oh, well, I am--

00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,442
Wow.

11
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:25,275
There.

12
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:26,209
Hold your horses.

13
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:27,375
What's the problem?

14
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:30,675
It was my turn, and I moved.

how about this?

Hey, yeah.

00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,375
Gee.

23
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:44,342
What is it?

24
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:44,975
I don't know.

25
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:48,542
My.

26
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,175

Oh.

Is that Mary Poppins?

It wouldn't mean that
woman from the [inaudible]?

AKANE: Madame St. Paul!

34
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:22,642
Bonjour, everyone.

35
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:28,775
I've brought some tea.

36
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,309
I've just made these cookies.

37
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:34,575
I hope you'll try one.

38
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:43,742
Help yourself.

39
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:47,009
Hm?

40
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,275
Huh?

41
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:49,975
Huh?

42
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:50,642
Thank you.

43
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,775
ALL: That was fast.

44
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:56,275
Fairly impressive
confectioneries,

45
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:59,675
considering the poor quality
of the baking ingredients

46
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,209
people such as
yourselves generally use.

47
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,742
Sure.

48
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:06,009
Typical.

49
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:09,709
Always find something
to criticize.

50
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:13,609
So, Madame St. Paul, there
must be some urgent reason

51
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:16,409
why a person of your greatness
would come into a commoner's

52
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:18,309
house like this.

53
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,409
Why don't you share it with us?

54
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,742
Very well.

55
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:25,575
For the past few
days, Monsieur Picolet

56
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:28,142
has been behaving
rather strangely.

57
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:30,409
What do you mean by strangely?

58
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,975
MADAME ST. PAUL:
For instance, he

59
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,842
leaves the curtains closed,
even in the daytime,

60
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,009
refusing to see
the light of day.

61
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:40,609
When he is served dinner, it
remains on the table untouched.

62
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:43,975
It's as if I'm living with a
completely different person.

63
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,642
Good food has always been
important to Monsieur Picolet.

64
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:48,975
I can't imagine him
not having an appetite.

65
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,642
In addition to that,
there is one other thing.

66
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,642
Recently, the
neighboring countryside

67
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:56,242
seems plagued with a
mysterious sickness.

68
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,709
What kind of sickness?

69
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:00,075
The young ladies
collapse with high fevers

70
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:01,475
in the middle of the night.

71
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,809
After which, they
inexplicably go missing.

72
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:07,475
And the numbers are increasing
with every passing day.

73
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,042
My, how dreadful.

74
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,809
MADAME ST. PAUL: There's one
aspect I haven't yet mentioned.

75
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:15,542
Every night, Monsieur Picolet
steals away from the mansion,

76
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,309
and he's gone until sunrise.

77
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:18,875
Blood sucking monster.

78
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:19,375
Blood sucking?

79
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:20,242
Say what?

80
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:21,575
Hang on.

81
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,142
You mean, the kind of
monster that sucks blood

82
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:25,342
from young women to stay alive?

83
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,342
In other words, the
legendary vampire

84
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,842
from medieval European times.

85
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,742
[scream]

86
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,142
Hey.

87
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:36,509
You're starting to give
us the creeps, Tendo.

88
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,075
I don't suppose
any of the girls

89
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:41,109
have weird marks on their necks,
like fang marks, would they?

90
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:41,942
Come on.

91
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:42,842
Get real, Nabiki.

92
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,642
You shouldn't joke like that.

93
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:47,242
Suggesting that Monsieur
Picolet has become a vampire

94
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:49,509
and is terrorizing
the countryside.

95
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,609
It's an insult to
poor Madame St. Paul.

96
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,009
I never suggested Monsieur
had turned into a vampire.

97
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,075
Get real, guys.

98
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,675
We're getting carried away.

99
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,742
MADAME ST. PAUL: No.

100
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,275
Huh?

101
00:05:59,309 --> 00:05:59,809
Perhaps not.

102
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,875
Now that I think
of it, the victims

103
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:07,209
did have strange
marks on their necks.

104
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,075
[gasp]

105
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:12,642
In any case, a curse has
befallen the Chardin family.

106
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:15,642
Monsieur Picolet's behavior
is very suspicious,

107
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,209
and we must do something
to spare the young ladies.

108
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,475
You're the only ones
I could turn to.

109
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:21,542
I beg you.

110
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:23,242
Please help Monsieur Picolet.

111

00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:56,975

Come.

116
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:12,409
Let's go inside, and
I'll show you your rooms.

117
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:13,109
Yeah, sure.

118
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:29,409
Ranma, do you find
it kind of cold here?

119
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:30,575

120
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,309

[bell]

122
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,242
Hello?

123
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:42,675
Huh?

124
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,042
Oh, I don't know about you,
but I'm starved, Akane.

125
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:45,475
Wait a second.

126
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,242
If I know you, you probably
brought along something

127
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:49,275
to eat in that backpack
of yours, right?

128
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,075
Uh, well, actually--

129
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:53,042
RANMA: What is this junk?

130
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,175
[laughter]

131
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,175
A cross?

132
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:55,909
Garlic?

133
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,809
Holy water?

134
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,409
A wooden stake?

135
00:07:58,442 --> 00:07:59,809
Don't tell me.

136
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:01,542
Nabiki gave me this stuff
when we were leaving.

137
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:05,209
And, uh, she insisted
I bring it along.

138
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:07,209
Dinner will be served shortly.

139
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:08,042
Oh, good.

140
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:11,142
I can hardly wait!

141
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:13,109

143
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:19,642
Why, thank you.

144
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:21,442
That was delightfully
delectable.

145
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,809
Thanks very much.

146
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:24,975
Hm?

147
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,942
You two haven't changed.

148
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:28,909
Heathens!

149
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,709
But this time, I won't
hold it against you

150
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:32,842
since you're here at my request.

151
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,809
Ah, sorry.

153
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:37,239
Huh?

154
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:42,142
You--

155
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:45,442
Bonjour Mademoiselle Ranma
and Mademoiselle Akane.

156
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:49,975
As usual, it is a pleasure
to be in your company.

157
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,342
Monsieur Picolet,
these young ladies

158
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,275
have come all the
way here to visit us.

159
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,042
Tres bien, madame.

160
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,542
I couldn't be happier.

161
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:06,142
Monsieur Picolet, please
sit and dine with us.

162
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:09,209
Your meal is all ready.

163
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:10,775
Forgive me, Madame
St. Paul, but I

164
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:13,742
don't seem to have much of
an appetite at the moment.

165
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:15,809
You should at least
have a little something.

166
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:17,509
Force yourself to
eat a little dinner,

167
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:19,409
even if you aren't hungry.

168
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:22,842
If you both insist,
then I'll have a bite.

169
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,809
[gasp]

170
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,009
Well, I've never seen anyone
lick your dishes so clean.

171
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,275
So much for table manners
of the rich and famous.

172
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,309
See what I mean?

173
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:42,209
I don't have any
appetite at all.

174
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:43,642
It's just as I feared.

175
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:45,842
Once again, you
hardly ate a thing.

176
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,242
My heart breaks for
you, Monsieur Picolet.

177
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:50,609
[crying]

178
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:53,575
20 course meal not good enough?

179
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,842
I'll be retiring.

180
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,609
Pleasant dreams.

181
00:09:58,775 --> 00:09:59,224
Hm?

182
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:19,775
Monsieur Picolet has stopped
coming out in the daytime.

183
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:23,342
He just stays in the tower?

184
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,409
Uh, you haven't seen
Ranma, have you?

185
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,409
Not since breakfast
this morning, now

186
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:30,275
that I think of it.

187
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:30,975
[sigh]

188
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,109
[footsteps]

189
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:38,109
I really wish
Ranma would tell me

190
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:41,909
where he's going before he
just takes off like that.

191
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:42,675
Oh, it's open.

192
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,642
I'll check in there.

193
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,942
Hm?

194
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:48,416
Yo.

195
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,550
[scream]

196
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,916
Hi.

197
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,750
Uh.

198
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,583
Jeez, don't scare me like that!

199
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:55,716
I almost had a heart
attack, you jerk!

200
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,250
[creak]

201
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:56,916
[gasp]

202
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,316
Hm?

203
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,316
[animal sounds]

204
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,018
[animal sounds]

205
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,385
[thunder]

206
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,000
It's an old library.

207
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,434
Look at all the books.

208
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:28,567
[gasp]

209
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,400
And they all look
pretty ancient.

210
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:33,434
Huh?

211
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:34,167
Look, Ranma.

212
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,067
That's strange.

213
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,834
RANMA: Yeah, it looks like
someone was just here.

214
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,534
AKANE: It's the
translation into Japanese.

215
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,800
This diary belongs
to Jonathan Chardin.

216
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,100
Volume 13.

217
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:47,434
There you go.

218
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,500
He must've been studying
Japanese translation.

219
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,000
Sounds like a serious kid.

220
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's see.

221
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:55,134
"July 10, 1892--
another sunny, hot day.

222
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,367
Summer is here."

223
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,300
Hey, this thing is
over 100 years old.

224
00:11:58,334 --> 00:11:59,867
Are you serious, Ranma?

225
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,034
"Yet again, young ladies in
the village have fallen victim

226
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,234
to the beast.

227
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,967
Someone in the village has
sworn to the authorities

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,400
that he saw my younger brother
at the scene of the crime.

229
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,500
There are no real
suspects at this time.

230
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,600
Recently, my brother
claims to have no appetite

231
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,200
and has been acting
rather peculiar."

232
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,400
That's freaky.

233
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:20,334
This describes Picolet to a T.

234
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,034
And the same thing
happened 100 years ago?

235
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,900
"July 11-- the weather
has turned to rain.

236
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:29,334
My younger brother has
locked himself in his room

237
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,267
and is eating next to nothing.

238
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,800
July 12-- sunny again.

239
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,067
This morning, the
ninth victim was found.

240
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,167
I will clean the
basement today and search

241
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,400
for anything unusual."

242
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,134
The next page has been
torn out of the book.

243
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,300
I wonder what he found
down in the basement.

244
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,034
Hm.

245
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:48,700
[footsteps]

246
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,634
[gasp]

247
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:50,634
Someone's coming.

248
00:12:58,434 --> 00:12:59,034
Madame--

249
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,000
[gasp]

250
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,567
[door closing]

251
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,667
What'd you do that for?

252
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,567
Doesn't that strike you
as weird-- Madame St. Paul

253
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,767
sneaking the book
away like that?

254
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Huh?

255
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,500
Akane, tonight we're
going to check out

256
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:19,200
the basement ourselves.

257
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:20,367
Uh, we are?

258
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,334
Hey, wait for me!

259
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,934
[thunder]

260
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:28,267
[shivering]

261
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:32,834
Oh, no!

262
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,334
Here.

263
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:38,900
I made some tea.

264
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,334
Hey, uh, Kasumi?

265
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,800
What is it, Nabiki?

266
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:43,767
[scream]

267
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,734
Look at those two chickens.

268
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,834
You'd better tell them about
the tea before they drink it.

269
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:52,434
Good idea.

270
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:53,767
[shivering]

271
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,534
Before you drink that tea,
I better tell you that it's--

272
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,300
That it's extremely--

273
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,900
[scream]

274
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,867
Hot!

275
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:11,834
[dog barking]

276
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:12,734
A full moon.

277
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:16,034
That's kind of creepy.

278
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:16,934
[knocking]

279
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:18,934
[sigh]

280
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:29,834
It's you.

281
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:39,534
[gasp]

282
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:41,134
Huh?

283
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:42,067
Who's over there?

284
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,667
Monsieur Picolet?

285
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,967
Mademoiselle Akane.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm always delighted
to be in your company.

287
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:51,334
No!

288
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,234
Stay away from me!

289
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,434
Don't come any closer!

290
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:54,467
Fear not.

291
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,967
Come with me.

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,900
[gasp]

293
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:57,867
[scream]

294
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,767
Huh?

295
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,034
Ranma!

296
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,234
[gasp]

297
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:04,034
[scream]

298
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,034
[gasp]

299
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,000
[sigh]

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,934
It was just a dream.

301
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,267
I guess I must
have fallen asleep.

302
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:17,434
Ranma, it's me.

303
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,300
Are you in there?

304
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,300
I'm coming in.

305
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:23,234
Ranma?

306
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,467
Wonder where he went.

307
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,034
He wouldn't have
gone to the basement.

308
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,234
Ran-- no, it's not him.

309
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,700
It wouldn't be like Ranma to
come down here by himself.

310
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:49,667
Huh?

311
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,141
Huh?

312
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:51,541
Oh!

313
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,075
Madame St. Paul!

314
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:53,941
Why are you here?

315
00:15:57,908 --> 00:16:00,708
A beautiful full
moon out tonight.

316
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,208
The full moon
reminds me of times

317
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:08,075
gone by when I made my
formal debut into society.

318
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:10,875
(VOICEOVER) That window's
too high to jump out of.

319
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:14,641
My only chance is by the tree.

320
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,741
Witness how the full moon
brings wings to my heart.

321
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,908
Beautiful, like
Paris at midnight.

322
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,941
This will be a night to be
cherished for an eternity

323
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:29,941
by both of us.

324
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:30,423
Hm.

325
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:36,341
We read that old diary.

326
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,775
Now explain something.

327
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:41,741
What's inside this wine cellar?

328
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:46,241
Mademoiselle Akane, it may
have been a mistake bringing you

329
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,841
here to help us.

330
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,275
Madame St. Paul, I know you've
got something behind your back.

331
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,541
Now show it to me.

332
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,675
I should never have
brought in outsiders.

333
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,441
This should have been kept
within our family walls.

334
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,075
Show me what you're hiding.

335
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:00,375
Oh!

336
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:02,308
Huh?

337
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:04,241
Blue wine?

338
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:05,408
It must be the light.

339
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,008
There's no such
thing as blue wine.

340
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,141
MADAME ST. PAUL:
It's Chardin blue--

341
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,941
handed down for generations.

342
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:14,308
I've never actually
seen it until now.

343
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:17,275
PICOLET: Sugar,
Mademoiselle Ranma?

344
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,308
Uh, one teaspoon, thanks.

345
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:21,708
PICOLET: Something
troubling you?

346
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,675
Huh?

347
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,508
Have your tea
before it gets cold.

348
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,775
Yeah, sure thing.

349
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:33,241
(VOICEOVER) I hope
it's not poisoned.

350
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:38,441
Obviously, Picolet
has drunken the wine.

351
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,441
I read the next
entry in the diary.

352
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:44,541
Everyone who drinks the blue
wine becomes poisoned and evil.

353
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:47,775
We must stop him before
he takes his next victim.

354
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:48,975
Ranma.

355
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:49,808
Ranma's in trouble.

356
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:55,241
Picolet, you poisoned my tea.

357
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,975
I should've known better.

358
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:59,741
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about, my pretty.

359
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:04,141
Simply do as I tell you, and
everything will work out fine.

360
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:05,875
Mademoiselle Ranma.

361
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:08,108
You dirty--

362
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:08,875
[groan]

363
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:11,741
[gasp]

364
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:16,375
[groan]

365
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:19,308
You'll pay for this.

366
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:20,575
This way.

367
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:23,675
This shortcut is
the fastest way.

368
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,008
Monsieur Picolet probably
drank the blue wine

369
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,075
without knowing
the consequences.

370
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,275
We must find a way to shock
him back to his senses.

371
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:32,108
(VOICEOVER) Ranma!

372
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,975
[scream]

373
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:42,208
[gasp]

374
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,475
No.

375
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:46,308
This poison's really
starting to kick in.

376
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,508
Resign yourself
and put your trust

377
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,341
in me, Mademoiselle Ranma.

378
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,308
Come.

379
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:52,275
[groan]

380
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:56,208
[scream]

381
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:56,841
Huh?

382
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,141
Ranma!

383
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:00,108
[groan]

384
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:02,075
Ranma!

385
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:02,875
Hm.

386
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,208
Hold it!

387
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:07,675
Take this, fang!

388
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,675
Care to explain
why you are holding

389
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,941
a cross, Mademoiselle Akane?

390
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:13,175
Huh?

391
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,075
OK.

392
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:14,908
Yah!

393
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:17,275
How about this?

394
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:20,075
Huh?

395
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:20,841
Mm.

396
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,608
Your garlic is tres bien.

397
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,108
Even under the effects
of the blue wine,

398
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:27,875
he has such grace and speed.

399
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:29,075
Excuse me.

400
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,775
This is no time to admire
his frog impersonation.

401
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:35,175
Now I believe it is time
to move on to the main dish.

402
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:35,941
Oh, no!

403
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:36,975
Please, don't!

404
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:37,841
[gasp]

405
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,208
Don't do it!

406
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:43,175
Bon appetit!

407
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,741
[scream]

408
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,641
[slurping]

409
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:58,241
We are the first ones to
ever witness this display.

410
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:00,475
The Chardin blue
wine has claimed

411
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,975
yet another tragic victim.

412
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:06,641
I've seen Picolet kiss before,
and it was nothing like that.

413
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:08,675
And this is all supposed
to have happened just

414
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,675
because he drank a little wine?

415
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:15,008
That's pretty far-fetched,
even for a creep like you!

416
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:18,575
Suck on this!

417
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:22,108
[groan]

418
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,041
[gasp]

419
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:30,041
[groan]

420
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,675
Uh, Mademoiselle Ranma?

421
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,808
That's Monsieur to you.

422
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:39,075
Uh.

423
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:41,375
Amazing.

424
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,341
[scream]

425
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,275
Madame St. Paul, I can't
seem to remember anything

426
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:01,841
about the last few days.

427
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,875
Would you be kind enough to
tell me what happened recently?

428
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:07,008
I'd rather not go
into it at this point,

429
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,475
but I will tell you one
thing, Monsieur Picolet.

430
00:21:09,508 --> 00:21:11,608
Never again drink any blue wine.

431
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:13,441
It carries a very bad bite.

432
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,275
Oh, Madame St. Paul!

433
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,975
How can you ever
forgive me for this?

434
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:19,075
Come on.

435
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,608
Tell me what happened
after I passed out.

436
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:24,041
Believe me, you
wouldn't want to know.

437
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:28,808
Hm. you know, something
reeks of garlic inside here.

438
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:29,441
[laughter]

439
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,108
I don't smell it.

440
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:32,341
RANMA: Come on!

441
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,775
Tell me what happened, Akane.

442
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:36,008
AKANE: Maybe some day.

443
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,008
RANMA: Akane!

444
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,408
AKANE: Just drop it.

445
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,141
RANMA: No!

446
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:46,103
[music playing]

447
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:17,734
GIRL (VOICEOVER):
The princess that

448
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:19,787
fell from the stars is a
daughter of a martial arts dojo

449
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:21,187
who's betrothed to someone.

450
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,354
Now where have I
heard that before?

451
00:23:23,387 --> 00:23:26,587
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
Meet You in the Milky Way.

452
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:27,954
We'll see you there.
