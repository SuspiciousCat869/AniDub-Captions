The road to mastering
the secret of the Saotome

4
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,200
School of Anything Goes
Martial Arts seems endless,

5
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,333
and the journey is a lonely one.

6
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:55,200
But one day, I shall
master all of them.

7
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,400
For this is my destiny!

8
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:03,374
Ahh!

00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,266
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Legend
of the Lucky Panda.

10
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,233
Ranma, don't you
think it's strange

11
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,733
that no one has seen
your dad in days?

12
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,033
Yeah.

13
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,200
I guess pops disappearing
like that is kind of weird.

14
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,633
It appears there's
been a sighting

15
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,300
of a mysterious village deep
inside the Japanese Alps.

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
And according to
reports from locals,

17
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,166
the area is almost inaccessible.

18
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,433
But hopefully we will have
a live report from the site

19
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:36,023
shortly.

20
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,100
Well, well.

21
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,833
What have we here?

22
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,166
An interesting
specimen, for sure.

23
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,233
And once we skin him, he
will make a nice throw rug

24
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,700
for my bedroom floor.

25
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,633
Do not let him get away!

26
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:41,974
Huh?

27
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,766
Ahh!

28
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:56,233
If it isn't my sweet
Kana, beautiful as always!

29
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,300
What-- what is it
that you want, Hyato?

30
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,433
My men and I were hunting the
panda that came down the river.

31
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,133
Hey, what would
you say if I were

32
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:08,466
to give you a tailor-made panda
coat as a birthday present

33
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,666
this year?

34
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:12,700
The panda came down the river?

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,666
Now, if you would be kind
enough to hand him over to me.

36
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,800
I can't do that.

37
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,533
I am the one who found him.

38
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:23,633
Besides, what are you going
to do with a panda, anyway?

39
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,866
Take him home and
keep him as a pet?

40
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:26,407
Hm?

41
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,533
Wait.

42
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,666
I have a better idea.

43
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:36,033
I shall give him to
you as a wedding gift.

44
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,100
What do you think?

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,733
Doesn't my brilliance
impress you?

46
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:43,000
I know it's a silly
question, but-- I just

47
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,766
love it when you tell
me how smart I am.

48
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,766
Hooray!

49
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,766
Hooray!

50
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,766
Please, no!

51
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,333
Hey, Hyato, would
you stop being a jerk?

52
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,533
What the--

53
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,900
Kotaro.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,633
You're interrupting.

55
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,933
If you had a brain in
your head, you buffoon,

56
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:09,033
you would realize I was just
about to propose to Kana.

57
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,633
Whatever are you talking about?

58
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,700
Attack, faceless minions!

59
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,666
Take him down!

60
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:15,666
All right!

61
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:16,633
Bring it on!

62
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,100
This is gonna be fun.

63
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,933
Are you ready?

64
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,166
Let's go.

65
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,000
Huh?

66
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,966
You really should
shave your arms.

67
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,733
Excuse me.

68
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,000
I said let's go.

69
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:41,000
Out of my way, you
overgrown furball!

70
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:48,474
Ahh!

71
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,933
Ha.

72
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,866
Weakling.

73
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:02,333
I will let you get
away with it this time.

74
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:06,166
Kana, soon I will return
to make you my bride.

75
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:06,707
Haha!

76
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,966
You really should be
a little more careful.

77
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,400
It's dangerous.

78
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,533
Aw.

79
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,933
I didn't know you were
that worried about me.

80
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,200
Hey, cut it out, would ya!

81
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,333
I just saved your
life from that creep.

82
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:32,300
I didn't come all the way out
here to marry you, you know.

83
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,900
Yeah?

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,166
Well, fine!

85
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:37,833
Because I don't remember
asking you to help me, either!

86
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,200
[grumbling]

87
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,366
Oh, man.

88
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:43,833
I give up.

89
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,166
I don't care, either,
because it was our parents who

90
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:47,766
arranged our marriage.

91
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,433
So go ahead and leave.

92
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:50,900
[thud]

93
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,941
Huh?

94
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,400
Oh, are you all right?

95
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,633
Well, I'd say you made
the right decision coming

96
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,600
straight home, Kana.

97
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,166
I was afraid Hyato and his
men might hurt the panda.

98
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,400
Don't you worry.

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,133
That will panda will be
safe and sound here with us.

100
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,433
It's OK.

101
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,500
But aren't you worried
they'll come here looking

102
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,566
for him, honorable father?

103
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,733
You're right.

104
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,966
That is a distinct possibility.

105
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,466
There's an old
saying in our village

106
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,566
that goes something like
this-- should a panda come down

107
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,566
the river to the
village, welcome him,

108
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,500
as he will bring happiness
to the land and its people.

109
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,033
This you have done.

110
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,333
And now we should all
thank him for coming.

111
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:47,300
And hopefully he will
bring us much happiness.

112
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,633
Come on, Kana.

113
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,600
Snap to it.

114
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,900
What are you waiting for?

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,766
Can't you see our honored
guest just ran out of food.

116
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:54,533
Yes.

117
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,133
Right away.

118
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,400
Well, here you go.

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,900
I-- I made it
especially for you.

120
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,233
I guess I used too much salt.

121
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Can I make a suggestion?

122
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,500
I vote we don't let Kana
cook for the family anymore.

123
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,066
Hey, you thief!

124
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,100
Huh?

125
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,433
It's a panda.

126
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,633
What in the world do you
think you're doing, calling

127
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,800
the lucky panda a thief?

128
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,966
You're right.

129
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,700
Ever since the lucky
panda came to the village,

130
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,533
there's been ample rain
after that long drought.

131
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,566
There's going to be a good
crop this yeah, for sure.

132
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,666
Oh, great and wise
panda, please forgive me!

133
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,033
And, if you could
find it in you,

134
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:59,233
could you give us
a healthy baby boy?

135
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,300
Thank you, Mr. Panda.

136
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,400
You just watch.

137
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,366
KANA: Oh, Mr. Panda!

138
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,833
[laughter]

139
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,100
Here.

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,641
Mm-hmm.

141
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:26,000
What the heck is that
stupid thing supposed to be?

142
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,433
Get lost.

143
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,966
I still don't see
how anyone could

144
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:32,333
believe that this panda is
gonna bring us good luck.

145
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,266
Just look at him.

146
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,500
Hey!

147
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,766
Back off, fuzzball.

148
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,333
Would you smarten up?

149
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,200
You're scaring Mr. Panda.

150
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,900
I think you're starting
to get a little jealous.

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,533
Huh?

152
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:49,966
Me, jealous?

153
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:50,766
Yeah, right.

154
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,533
Give me a break, would you?

155
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,366
You are jealous,
and you know it.

156
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:55,800
RANMA: All I know
is that you need

157
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,033
to get some professional help.

158
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,966
KANA: Oh, Mr. Panda,
your bath is ready.

159
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,666
Oh, there's nothing
to worry about.

160
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:18,100
Our bath tub's plenty
big enough for you.

161
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,800
Come on.

162
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,200
[grunting]

163
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,100
Here you go.

164
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,966
MAN: Oh my god!

165
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,233
Please come!

166
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,366
The elder!

167
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:44,266
Huh?

168
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:45,200
What about him?

169
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:52,733
[chanting]

170
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,933
Please, you must
tell us how he is.

171
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:07,833
We figure he won't make it.

172
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:08,866
No.

173
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,333
I don't believe this.

174
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,433
One minute the picture
of health, and the next,

175
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,766
as helpless as a baby.

176
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,133
Is there anything that
I can do or get him

177
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,700
to make him well again?

178
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,766
You must tell me.

179
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:22,266
I'll do anything you ask.

180
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,333
I'm begging you to help him.

181
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,633
There is one way to cure him.

182
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,633
Well, tell us.

183
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:33,400
He must consume the
heart of a living panda.

184
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,033
That is his only
hope of survival.

185
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:36,866
What?

186
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:38,500
Have you two lost your minds?

187
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,066
Huh?

188
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,466
Now where did that panda go?

189
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,133
WOMAN: And Kana's gone, too.

190
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,133
After them!

191
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,100
[music playing]

192
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,161
[crowd mumbling]

193
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:02,935
MAN: What's this?

194
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,635
A reward for a panda?

195
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:10,535
It says that the owner needs
the panda's heart to live.

196
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:13,502
We gotta find it.

197
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,268
Oh, this should be interesting.

198
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,168
MAN: You see him?

199
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:17,702
MAN: Nothing.

200
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,202
How about you?

201
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:20,635
MAN: Where can it be?

202
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:27,502
All right.

203
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:29,735
Let's get 'em, minions.

204
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:33,002
But sire, how can we find them
this deep in the mountains?

205
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,668
If only there was something
to help us track it.

206
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,302
Hm.

207
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:37,843
Huh?

208
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:47,902
Haha!

209
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:49,435
So, we meet again.

210
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,735
But how did you find us?

211
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:53,702
Run for it!

212
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:10,635
Come on, you guys!

213
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,402
Hurry up!

214
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:15,002
Kotaro!

215
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,002
You go first, Mr. Panda.

216
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:28,335
Curses!

217
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:30,368
Hurry up, minions!

218
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:31,302
Go!

219
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:32,735
RANMA: Have a nice trip.

220
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:43,335
Don't forget to write!

221
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,402
Why-- you--

222
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:57,335
Kana, you realize you can't
stay on the run forever trying

223
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:59,268
to protect him.

224
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:02,635
It'll only be a matter of
time until they find you.

225
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:04,502
But what should I do?

226
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:06,168
You know.

227
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:06,709
Huh?

228
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:12,235
Hey, he took off!

229
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:26,202
KANA: Mr. Panda, where are you?

230
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:26,743
Huh?

231
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,568
Oh, no.

232
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:31,668
Mr. Panda.

233
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:35,035
Hyato, you hand him
over right now, or else!

234
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,735
Sorry, peasant.

235
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,502
But the heart of
this panda is needed

236
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:41,502
to cure the elder
of his sickness.

237
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:42,735
Correct?

238
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:46,635
So, Kana, how is that
for a wedding gift?

239
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:49,402
Well, I'm really looking
forward to our wedding.

240
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:51,135
What about you?

241
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:54,435
Why, you-- you're just
using the panda to get Kana.

242
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:55,402
Not if I can help it.

243
00:14:55,502 --> 00:14:57,035
You untie him right
now, you hear?

244
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:03,002
KANA: Kotaro, don't!

245
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,268
Lay a finger on me,
and the panda perishes.

246
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:09,268
Not to mention that
Kana's father will die.

247
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,535
Do you want that to happen?

248
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:12,076
Kataro?

249
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:16,535
All right.

250
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:17,302
You win.

251
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:18,935
I'll marry you.

252
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,068
But you must let him go.

253
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:22,435
Huh?

254
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:26,302
Allow me to sacrifice
my heart for yours.

255
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:29,402
And somehow, when all this
craziness is said and done,

256
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:32,002
we can find a cure
for my father.

257
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:33,335
Kana!

258
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:36,068
I agree.

259
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,668
KANA: Mr. Panda,
you're free to go.

260
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:45,735
Now, Kana, I expect you to
go home and prepare yourself

261
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:46,768
for the wedding ceremony.

262
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:52,168
I must go make
preparations for myself!

263
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:18,202
Congratulations, master.

264
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:21,735
Not only are you going to marry
the most beautiful woman in all

265
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:26,202
the land, but you're also
become the head of the village.

266
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,335
Ha!

267
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:30,368
My little plan worked
with flawless precision.

268
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,468
Guess again, you jerk.

269
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:35,835
There ain't gonna be any wedding
bells until you beat me first.

270
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:36,902
You got it?

271
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:38,002
Ha!

272
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,168
No matter how crude your
challenge, I accept.

273
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:43,202
I could use a light
workout before the wedding.

274
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:43,743
Yaah!

275
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,235
[laugh]

276
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:55,568
If that's all you can
muster, I'd reconsider.

277
00:16:55,668 --> 00:16:56,968
Why, that little
creep's wearing

278
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:58,935
armor underneath his clothes.

279
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,068
Kotaro.

280
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,102
Kana!

281
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,435
Ah, I see my bride
has finally arrived.

282
00:17:20,902 --> 00:17:24,002
Oh, she is beautiful.

283
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:24,802
Isn't she, Kotaro?

284
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:30,935
Excuse me, my dear,
but I must attend

285
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:34,135
to your feeble ex-boyfriend's
chivalrous challenge.

286
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:34,902
Front and center!

287
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:39,002
Prepare to die!

288
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:42,935
Huh?

289
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:43,476
Ahh!

290
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,835
Kotaro!

291
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,602
Stay back, Kana!

292
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,535
You're finished!

293
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:59,668
What the-- huh?

294
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:08,202
Mr. Panda.

295
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:09,235
Ha!

296
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:12,602
Only a fool would
return to fight me.

297
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:14,602
Feel the wrath of Hyato!

298
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:20,468
Come back here, you cretin!

299
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:43,102
Mr. Panda!

300
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,835
It's time to be rid of
you, once and for all!

301
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,735
[screaming]

302
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:17,168
You're my hero!

303
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:36,568
Thank goodness you're OK!

304
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:38,068
Look, it's Father!

305
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,002
I can't believe my eyes.

306
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:40,735
You're alive!

307
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,002
Yes.

308
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:43,635
The doctor figures it
must've been something I ate.

309
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:45,202
I must admit, I was
a little worried.

310
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:48,268
But right now I feel like
I'm 20 years younger.

311
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:50,135
They said you were incurable.

312
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:53,002
And to think, we went through
all of this for nothing.

313
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:53,968
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,068
So don't mind me
asking, but why are

315
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:57,802
you wearing a wedding dress?

316
00:19:57,902 --> 00:20:00,002
And how come you're
holding hands?

317
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:01,835
Huh?

318
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:02,968
Oh, I get it now.

319
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,635
My prayers have
finally been answered.

320
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,902
You two crazy kids have
decided to tie the knot

321
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:08,435
without telling anyone.

322
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:09,502
I should have known!

323
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:12,002
I've never been so happy.

324
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:13,335
No, it's not--

325
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:14,268
--like that.

326
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:15,602
Oh, don't be shy.

327
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:16,902
Hey, everyone!

328
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:18,602
This calls for a celebration!

329
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:20,102
[cheering]

330
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:22,102
Yeah, congratulations!

331
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:23,068
This is great!

332
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:35,535
Mr. Panda?

333
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,076
Mr. Panda!

334
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:50,468
AKANE: It's starting
to get late.

335
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:51,735
RANMA: Ah, don't worry, Akane.

336
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,535
He'll be back.

337
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:55,435
How can you sit there so calm?

338
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:57,802
Your dad's been
missing for days now.

339
00:20:57,902 --> 00:21:01,335
Hey, for the last time,
don't sweat it, OK?

340
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:02,468
Gee.

341
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,702
I never never realized
you could be so cold.

342
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:07,302
Good thing I don't have
any feelings for you.

343
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:08,635
That goes double for me!

344
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,468
I'm glad I never fell for
such an uncute girl like you!

345
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:15,602
Well, excuse me
for being uncute!

346
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:16,702
Pop, you're home.

347
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:18,302
So when did you get back?

348
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:43,457
[music playing]

349
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:04,990
[singing in japanese]

350
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,390
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
A secret sauce

351
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,990
that Ukyo made 10
years ago turns out

352
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,090
to be a catastrophic failure.

353
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,624
What could this mean to Ranma?

354
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:28,390
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Ukyo's Secret Sauce, Part One.

355
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,990
We'll see you there.
