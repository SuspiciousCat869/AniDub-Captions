What am I supposed to tell my

How dare you sit here and

out to buy nails.

just fix it myself.

Since you're

-H-hey, Akane, since when did
you become the boss of me?

Besides, you can't fix
that leak, and you know it.

64
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,231
And you can't take away
my dinner, neither.

I acted more like a girl?

I'm his fiancee, but he treats
me like one of the guys.

Maybe I can show him
