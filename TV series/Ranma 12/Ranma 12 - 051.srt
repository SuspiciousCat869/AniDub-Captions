NARRATOR: Les Miserables
of the Kuno Estate.

3
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:26,098
-Baked with love.

4
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:35,031
And to think they'll soon be
ingested by my darling Ranma.

5
00:02:41,398 --> 00:02:45,331
At last, at last a true
woman's happiness is mine.

6
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:50,031
Be patient, mon chere.

7
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,131
I come anon.

8
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:55,831
Oh, but first, a quick
visit to the toilette.

9
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:56,798
Ah-ha.

10
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:58,731
Oh, ha, ha, ha!

11
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:11,698
-An odor sweeter
than youth itself.

12
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:15,231
But what can it-- oh!

13
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:16,731
Homemade cookies!

14
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:19,131
Oh!

15
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,331
Trusting her gesture
would not go unnoticed,

16
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,865
she leaves them without
so much as a word.

17
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,565
Such modesty well
becomes a maiden.

18
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,398
Indeed, she loves me well.

19
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:36,298
[laughing] Akane Tendo,
Akane, mon chere.

20
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:36,839
Very well.

21
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:39,231
I accept.

22
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:41,965
Each bite made twice as sweet
by the youth and affection

23
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:43,898
of the dainty cook herself.

[french]

25
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,231
That sweet, sweet girl.

26
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:55,731
What ails you, woman?

27
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:57,865
-Brother dear, you
have eaten that

28
00:03:57,965 --> 00:03:59,798
which you should not have eaten.

29
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:02,065
-What?

30
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:03,798
Speak she the truth?

31
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:08,198
No, she's merely jealous
of mine own good fortune.

32
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:10,698
-And who do you think
made those cookies?

33
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:11,531
Hm?

34
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,165
-Why, Akane Tendo, of course.

35
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,198
Or perhaps the pigtailed girl.

36
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,231
-En garde, brother dear!

37
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,398
-Kodachi, strike you
your own brother?

38
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,198
Take a moment to consider!

39
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:35,831
Consider at whom you would
fire, my twisted sister.

40
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:38,098
-Pardon, mon frere, but I
cannot forgive your egregious

41
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,798
consumption of the cookies I so
carefully baked for my own dear

42
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:42,398
love!

43
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:43,331
-Love?

44
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:44,431
Then those cookies
were for Ranma?

45
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:49,831
Come to think of it,
they did taste a bit dry.

46
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:54,131
-Something must be wrong.

47
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:59,065
Just as I suspected.

48
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,198
Never fear, Sasuke is here!

49
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:03,831
Huh?

50
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:05,065
-Wicked, twisted sister!

51
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:13,398
Master Kuno, Mistress
Kodachi, please be reasonable!

52
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:16,165
-If my dear brother
had been reasonable,

53
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:19,098
this never would have happened!

54
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,098
-Behave yourselves!

55
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:21,065
Both of you!

56
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,631
-Have you both gone mad?

57
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,398
Cookies?

58
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:45,398
You're fighting over cookies?

59
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:48,165
-How dare you try to trivialize!

60
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,598
-I wouldn't dream of it.

61
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:52,231
-Hey, what Kodachi said.

62
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,065
-It's your own fault
for interfering!

63
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,031
-But, but I--

64
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:57,098
-That's right, it's
your own fault.

65
00:05:57,198 --> 00:06:00,598
Whose side are you on, anyway?

66
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:04,031
-I just hate to bring this
up, but-- whose bedding

67
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,798
is it that's always out
there drying in the sun?

68
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:08,798
-But mistress, that
was to be our secret!

69
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,565
-Was.

70
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:13,265
-Come to think of
it, Master Kuno--

71
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,331
-What's this?

72
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:16,265
Dare you to criticize me?

73
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:16,898
-No.

74
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:17,998
No, of course not.

75
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:19,198
I was only-- I--

76
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:20,965
-Speak up, Sasuke.

77
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,431
-Come now, who is at fault?

78
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:23,565
-Well, I--

79
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:26,165
-Do not forget to whom
you owe your loyalty.

80
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:26,965
-To you, master.

81
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:28,265
To you.

82
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:30,798
-Don't forget who saw that
bedding hanging out to dry.

83
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:31,665
-You did, mistress.

84
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:35,331
-Traitor!

85
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:36,265
Get out of this house!

SASUKE: I've spent the
better part of my life

87
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,531
in service to the Kuno family.

88
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:47,331
I may not have been the best
retainer they've ever had,

89
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:49,865
but I've always,
always been loyal.

90
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:06,865
What matters a lowly ninja's
life without a worthy master

91
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:07,865
to serve?

92
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,198
Is there no place
else for me to go?

93
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:16,498
-Hey, that's--

94
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,965
-Sasuke, over here!

95
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,665
-That you, Miss Akane?

96
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:27,665
-You're all by yourself, huh?

97
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:29,898
-What makes you say that?

98
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:32,531
-Kuno's been bullying
you again, hasn't he?

99
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,765
-How'd she know?

100
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:37,231
-Well, would you like
to come home with me?

101
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,665
-Who, me?

102
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:39,665
-Yes, you.

103
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:40,998
Who else do you
think I'm talking to?

104
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:43,865
-But, but, but I couldn't.

105
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,865
I, I just couldn't.

106
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:50,331
Such warm and kind words.

107
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:50,872
-Huh?

108
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:57,165
I'm home!

109
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:57,698
Come on.

110
00:07:57,798 --> 00:07:58,798
Come on in.

111
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:00,431

113
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:03,831
No defenses to speak of.

114
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:04,565
Oh, dear.

115
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:07,331
There I go again.

116
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:09,298
-Home a little late, Akane?

117
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:11,465
Honestly, I-- oh, a guest.

118
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:12,498
-Uh-huh.

119
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,698
You remember Sasuke,
don't you, Kasumi?

120
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:15,498
-Sure.

121
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:16,665
From the Kuno Estate, right?

122
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:23,231
We're always happy to
have Akane's friends over.

123
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:31,165
-But I'm not-- she's not--
I mean-- I'm not worthy!

124
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,131
-Oh, my!

125
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:33,398
What a sweet little
fellow you are.

126
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:34,231
-Sweet?

127
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:35,831
Me?

128
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,765
I've never been
called sweet by anyone

129
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:41,465
in my entire,
miserable, lowly life.

130
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:42,598
-Enough politeness, already.

131
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:43,265
-Yes.

132
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:44,731
Come in, won't you?

133
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:45,931
-Oh-- OK.

134
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,765
-Hey, there's something
I've gotta do first.

135
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:58,065
You just make yourself at home.

136
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:07,731
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): There I
go again, sneaking around.

137
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,965
I've got to stop
thinking like a ninja.

138
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:18,347
-Wait.

139
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:20,465
Do-over!

140
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,898
Come on, don't be like that.

141
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:25,498
After all, once your Ranma
and my Akane are married,

142
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,431
we'll be family!

143
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:30,765
What a stubborn panda.

144
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:32,031
Huh?

145
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:32,572
-Hm?

146
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:44,198
-You there.

147
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:45,165
-Yes?

148
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,831
-Can you play
shogi, or can't you?

149
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:47,965
-Huh?

150
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:48,865
Well, I--

151
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:58,865
-Well, then?

152
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,131
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Here it is.

153
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,231
He's going to kick me out.

154
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:03,798
I knew it was too
good to be true.

155
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:07,365
-Please, let me do-over!

156
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:09,365
-Who's there?

157
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:11,065
-Sorry about that.

158
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,598
-Ranma Saotome!

159
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:15,831
You threw that ball on
purpose, didn't you?

160
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,065
-OK, then.

161
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:19,131
Let's say I make
this one a do over.

162
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,465
And this goes here.

163
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:21,731
-Get ready, Ranma!

164
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:30,531
-You OK down there?

165
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:46,598
-Why, you!

166
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,165
-Save some for me, Ranma!

167
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:49,198
-No prob.

168
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:50,231
-Hey, no fair.

169
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:50,898
Two against one.

170
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,765
Huh?

171
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:11,498
-Thanks for letting
me practice with you.

172
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:12,198
Ah.

173
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,231
What a great work out.

174
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,765
-Not that I'm
complaining or nothing,

175
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:16,398
but what are you doing here?

176
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:18,398
-Yes, well, I, uh--

177
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:21,765
-Sasuke and I kind of ran into
each other at the park today.

178
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:24,731
I thought it might be nice to
invite him over for dinner.

179
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:25,898
-Well, what do you now?

180
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:26,865
Gee, what's the matter?

181
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,265
Kuno kick you out or something?

182
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:29,965
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
How'd he know?

183
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,965
-Sorry about hitting
you with the ball.

184
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:33,598
Guess my aim must've
been a little off.

185
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:39,465
-Oh, a biwa plum.

186
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,198
Must be close to summer.

187
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:45,498
-You can have this
one if you want.

188
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:46,231
OK, suit yourself.

189
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:56,365
KUNO: Take that!

190
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,065
-You win, master.

191
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:01,565
-Of course I win, fool.

192
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,365
And to the victor
goes the spoils!

193
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:10,098
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): When
Master Kuno and I trained,

194
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,931
it was a whole other story.

195
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,831
He never did feed me, never
mind thank me, at least not

196
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:16,665
if he could help it.

197
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,986
KUNO: Sasuke!

198
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,986
Sasuke, where are you?

199
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:38,052
Ugh, where can that ninja be?

200
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:43,052
What if he's run away
for good this time?

201
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:45,019
The scamp.

202
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,986
He knows perfectly well I can't
sleep without his little shadow

203
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:49,386
puppet shows at bedtime.

204
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,819
[sigh]

205
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,686
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I think they've even

206
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:00,052
been washed recently.

207
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:00,593
Oh.

208
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:13,986
I know I can't expect
Master Kuno to reciprocate

209
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:17,619
my feelings, but there's got to
be more to a loyal retainer's

210
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,052
life than this.

211
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,252
There's got to be.

212
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:29,052
-Sneaky feet, creaky
feet, ninja feet.

213
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:34,419
Sneaky feet, creaky
feet, ninja feet.

214
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,186
I've got a perfect
right to be here.

215
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,919
Why am I sneaking
around like this?

216
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:39,786
Halt.

217
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:40,419
Who goes there?

218
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:45,119
-Oh, it's you, Sasuke.

219
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:45,719
-Uh oh.

220
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:47,119
It's Akane.

221
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:48,686
-Need the bathroom?

222
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,252
-Uh, uh.

223
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:49,986
Again please?

224
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:51,886
-Can't get to sleep?

225
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:52,452
-Yes.

226
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:53,419
I-- I mean no.

227
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,752
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Come on, Sasuke.

228
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:55,886
Why don't you just tell
her it's because you

229
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:57,652
don't want to wet the bed?

230
00:13:57,752 --> 00:13:59,386
AKANE: Would some
warm milk help?

231
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:00,586
-Huh?

232
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:03,919
-I'm sure this'll put
you right to sleep.

233
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,119
Well, are you gonna drink it?

234
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:07,668
Mm.

235
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,386
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I-- I had no idea.

236
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,852
How could I have
known that this milk

237
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:19,752
stuff would be so delicious?

238
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:26,919
Master Kuno always said the
water from the storm gutters

239
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:28,052
was good enough for me.

240
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,252
-Curse it all.

241
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:41,886
I slept not a wink.

242
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:42,952
Sasuke.

243
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:44,152
Oh, Sasuke.

244
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:45,052
Where have you gone?

245
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:53,986
-If only I could let you
know how terribly sorry I am.

246
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:55,319
-Sorry?

247
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:56,686
About what?

248
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,386
What ever are you talking about?

249
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:07,786
-And whose bedding is it
out there drying in the sun?

250
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:08,852
-What?

251
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:11,552
What a difference
from Mistress Kodachi.

252
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:12,093
Miss Akane.

253
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,386
-You sure that's just water?

254
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:22,686
-Of course I'm sure.

255
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:23,452
What do you care?

256
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:32,819
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
My sole sworn fealty

257
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,919
has always been to
the Kuno family,

258
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,252
and yet might not I too
enjoy a measure of happiness?

259
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:41,686
If only I had some sign.

260
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:42,268
Huh?

261
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,219
-Very well.

262
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,519
From now on, my sole
loyalty is to Akane.

263
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:58,552
-That's-- That's pickled garlic!

264
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,086
Gah!

265
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:03,652
Sasuke, where are you?

266
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:05,619
Where, oh, where have you gone?

267
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,552
How can I dine without you
to eat this foul vegetable

268
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:10,386
in my stead?

269
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:10,968
Sasuke?

270
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:16,486
Sasuke!

271
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:17,819
Sasuke?

272
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,386
Are you in there,
my dear Sasuke?

273
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:22,652
-Come on, Ranma.

274
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:24,919
We're gonna be late.

275
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,452
Hey, where'd my shoes go?

276
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:28,819
-Here, mistress.

277
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,752
I warmed them with my own body.

278
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:32,819
-Bu--

279
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,619
-Allow me to carry that for you.

280
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:39,919
-What's he doing all this for?

281
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,019
-How the heck am I
supposed to know?

282
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,919
-Mistress Akane.

283
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,552
Allow me to handle this.

284
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,319
Please.

285
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,919
Use me as your bridge.

286
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,819
-But Sasuke, I--

287
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,352
[bell chiming]

288
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,319
-Hurry, Mistress Akane.

289
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:03,486
Hurry or you'll
be late for class!

290
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:13,619
-Drat.

291
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:15,052
Now I'm late.

292
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:18,819
It's Sasuke's fault
for not waking me up!

293
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:19,852
Open the gate!

294
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:33,152
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Seven risers high, huh?

295
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,619
Looks pretty tough.

296
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:48,719
Who else could it be but--

297
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,152
KUNO (VOICEOVER):
That was Sasuke.

298
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:53,086
I'd swear to it.

299
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:55,952
[cheering]

300
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:02,386
-Why?

301
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:05,452
Why has Sasuke gone to
the side of Akane Tendo?

302
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:06,686
BOY: Yo, Kuno, incoming.

303
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:10,852
KUNO (VOICEOVER):
Can it be that he's

304
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:13,286
sworn [? fealty ?]
to one other than I?

305
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:20,252
Bah!

306
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:22,186
The noble [inaudible]
of House Kuno

307
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:24,752
groveling before
his own retainer?

308
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,586
Never!

309
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,986
And yet, can I truly
go on without him?

310
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:30,186
Never!

311
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:31,752
And yet I dare not.

312
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:32,719
Never!

313
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,619
And yet I-- Never!

314
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,160
Never!

315
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:35,660
Never!

316
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:36,152
Never!

317
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,052
Never ever.

318
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:38,019
Never ever ever.

319
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:42,860
Sasuke.

320
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,786
Sasuke!

321
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:45,419
-Huh?

322
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,686
I know that voice.

323
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:47,286
KUNO: Sasuke.

324
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:50,086
Sasuke!

325
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:51,052
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Oh.

326
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:53,852
So now he comes looking for me.

327
00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:54,986
Hm.

328
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:56,419
-Upper classman Kuno.

329
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,152
-Ah.

330
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,686
Akane Tendo.

331
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:00,519
Forgive me, [inaudible],
but now is not

332
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,652
the time for
heartfelt confessions.

333
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:05,319
-What makes you think I've
got anything to confess?

334
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:06,152
-Tell me.

335
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:08,219
Have you seen my good Sasuke?

336
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,286
In return, I will
gladly date with you.

337
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:12,886
-Gee, what an offer.

338
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,752
Well, you've come to
the right place, anyway.

339
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:16,186
He's with us.

340
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:16,752
KUNO: What?

341
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:17,719
Sasuke's here?

342
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,019
-Sasuke!

343
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,119
That's weird.

344
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,486
He was just here in the
garden a minute ago.

345
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:28,386
-Huh, a feeble ploy.

346
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:28,919
Truly.

347
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,252
Akane Tendo.

348
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,552
Was there no other way you
could think of to get me alone?

349
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:34,319
-Excuse me?

350
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,386
He's only staying here 'cause
he was so depressed in the park

351
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:38,252
yesterday.

352
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:39,152
-What's this?

353
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:40,886
Depressed in the
park, did you say?

354
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:42,752
-That's right!

355
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:44,019
Huh?

356
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,986
KUNO (VOICEOVER): So that's it.

357
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:49,786
Fearing my displeasure, he
ran trembling into the night.

358
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:50,686
KUNO: Sasuke!

359
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:51,952
Sasuke, forgive me.

360
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,719
I was wrong!

361
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,086
Please come home, Sasuke.

362
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:58,586
Sasuke!

363
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,386
-M-- Master Kuno.

364
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:02,586
-Please come back!

365
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:03,552
Sasuke.

366
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:06,286
Please, I'm begging you.

367
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:08,352
You can scold me to
your heart's content.

368
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:09,252
I've changed!

369
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:10,586
I swear I have!

370
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,619
You can have anything you want.

371
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,486
You just name it.

372
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:15,452
I swear!

373
00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:16,786
How about French cuisine.

374
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:17,886
My treat?

375
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:18,686
Ah, strike that.

376
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:19,952
You don't like French.

377
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,652
You like Ramen, right?

378
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,919
Or maybe we can have Chinese.

379
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,286
Sasuke!

380
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:27,552
-Master Kuno.

381
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:28,986
KUNO: Sasuke!

382
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:31,086
-Master Kuno!

383
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,586
-Sasuke!

384
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:33,452
-Master Kuno!

385
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,219
-Oh, Sasuke!

386
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,986
You'll come home, won't you?

387
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,752
Oh, it's so good to see you.

388
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:40,652
You can have anything
you like, just name it.

389
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:41,786
Anything at all.

390
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,052
-Please, Master Kuno.

391
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:44,952
You don't have to
give me anything.

392
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,586
All I ever wanted was to
know that you need me.

393
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:48,486
That's all.

394
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:50,052
That's more than enough.

395
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:51,419
-Sasuke.

396
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,319
Sasuke, mon chere, I'll never
take you for granted again.

397
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,252
-Oh, Master Kuno!

398
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:57,219
-Sasuke!

399
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,186
-Master Kuno!

400
00:20:58,286 --> 00:20:59,152
-Sasuke!

401
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:00,152
-Master Kuno!

402
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,052
-Sasuke!

403
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:01,586
-Master Kuno!

404
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:08,019
-Brother dear?

405
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,786
You dare to consume
once more the cookies I

406
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,886
hand made for my darling Ranma?

407
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:15,586
-Pardon, I thought them a gift
from my chere, Akane Tendo.

408
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:16,919
-Think again, mon frere!

409
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:18,719
-Speak you the truth?

410
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,852
-Of course I speak
the truth, you idiot!

411
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,086
-Dare you, then,
to criticize me?

412
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:25,419
-Behave yourselves!

413
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,752
Both of you!

414
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:27,719
-You there!

415
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,452
Whose side are you on, anyway?

416
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:31,352
-That's right, Sasuke.

417
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:34,552
Whose side are you on?

418
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:36,519
-Whose side are you on, anyway?

419
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,547
[theme music]

420
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:16,762
NARRATOR: What's that?

421
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,429
There's a ghost
at Furinkan High?

422
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,262
The ghost busting
part I can understand,

423
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:22,762
but why does he
have to come along?

424
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:25,829
Next time on Ranma
1/2, Ghost Story, Ranma

425
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,229
and the Magic Sword.

426
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:30,829
We'll see ya there.
