(VOICEOVER) I've got to
completely master the Lion Roar

00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:45,821
Shot before Ranma does.

5
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:46,654
Hurry up.

00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,687
(VOICEOVER) Let's see what
the secret writings here say.

8
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:53,087
Anyone can do the
Lion Roar Shot.

9
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:57,154
First, think an unhappy
thought and make your Ki heavy.

10
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:00,621
There.

11
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,921
You did it.

12
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:05,087
However, this is merely
the basic technique.

13
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,221
The following is how the
Lion Roar Shot should

14
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:09,054
look once completely mastered.

15
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,887
Huh, an arrow.

16
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:18,187
Now I just have to
figure out what it means.

17
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,321
Huh?

If you lose this match,
will you be my slave?

I had no idea you could
make yourself so gloomy.

00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,687
Ranma, have you already
forgotten your decision

00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,854
to cut out all food,
drink, and sleep in order

64
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,354
to make yourself miserable?

00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:19,021
Oh, no.

66
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:21,621
What have I done?

67
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,054
Look, Ranma.

68
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,121
Some people have certain
talents that make it easier

69
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:26,854
for them to master a technique.

Huh?

71
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:29,387
From what I understand,
unhappy people

72
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:31,554
can make themselves even
more miserable in order

73
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:33,254
to use the Lion Roar Shot.

74
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:35,687
It increases the power
of the move, they say.

75
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,054
Yeah.

76
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:38,054
Why do you think I'm
going to all this trouble?

takes to master this move.

trying to tell me?

00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,054
I see his point.

83
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,021
He should know Ranma
better than anyone.

84
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:53,054
He's been his dad for 16
years, after all, right?

85
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:54,421
And that's
certainly long enough

own son's downfalls.

to even bother trying?

you a technique that

You won't get anywhere if

to distract your training.

What?

149
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:27,421
(VOICEOVER) Since the Lion Roar
Shot is based on depression,

150
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:31,887
maybe I can find an emotion more
suited to me to come up with

His Ki is getting big

If I can't figure
this out, then I'll

never be able to perfect
the Lion Roar Shot.

00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:33,421
Ah.

172
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:40,736
I wonder.

173
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:57,354
It sank.

174
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,221
Now I've got it!

175
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:12,687
The secret of the
elusive Lion Roar Shot!

176

[laughter]

177
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,254
I figured it out!

[laughter]

00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:28,821
Ryoga!

00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:29,821
Huh?

181
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:30,787
Hi, Akane.

182
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,354
Out for a bath?

183
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:33,954
Uh, yeah.

184
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:37,354
Ryoga, are you seriously
going to fight Ranma?

185
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:38,721
Um.

186
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:41,387
They say the better you
get at it, the more unhappy

187
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:44,421
the Lion Roar Shot will
make you feel, you know?

188
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:45,321
[sigh]

189
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:48,554
Akane, I've got a favor to ask.

190
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,887
Yes?

191
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,987
Look me in the eye and
yell as loud as you can.

192
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:53,921
Yell what?

193
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,721
Tell me how much you hate me!

194
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:01,687
If you don't mind.

195
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:02,554
What?

196
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:04,387
Ryoga, why would I--

197
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:05,354
Please, Akane!

198
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,487
You're the only one
who can help me.

199
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:09,387
(VOICEOVER) If you
say you hate me, then

200
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:12,687
I can perfect the
Lion Roar Shot.

201
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,254
You really want me to?

202
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:14,754
I'm sure.

203
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:19,121
[sigh]

204
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,821
I can't stand your guts, Ryoga.

Goldfish for sale!

Oh, no.

209
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:33,787
She said she hates me.

210
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,321
Ryoga, are you all right?

[scream]

212
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:44,154
That's the last thing on
earth I wanted to hear!

213
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:45,187
Where are you going?

214
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,254
Don't try and stop me!

215
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,621
I knew you were going
to say you hated me,

216
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:53,787
but I had no idea it was
going to hurt as much as this!

[scream]

one who made me say it.

Wait, wait, wait.

That's Ryoga.

232
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:40,487
I did it.

233
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:45,587
I finally mastered
the Lion Roar Shot.

00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:20,976
I made it.

Ha.

00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:29,709
And here I was sure that you
were trying to run away, Ryoga.

[groan]

246
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:40,243
Has Ryoga mastered
the technique

247
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,609
of the Lion Roar Shot?

248
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:42,443
Yes.

249
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:43,709
And it's incredibly powerful.

250
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:44,676
But poor Ranma.

251
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,243
[music playing]

252
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:52,243
No prob.

253
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:54,709
I got this match in the bag.

254
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:57,709
I don't know why he
feels so confident.

255
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,143
Maybe he's got some new
defense moves or something.

256
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:02,709
What's the matter, Ryoga?

257
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:05,209
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think the world was ending.

258
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,809
Huh, good eye.

259
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:09,809
I've sacrificed everything that
made me happy to have this mach

260
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:11,143
and win.

261
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:12,376
So without delay.

262
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:16,809
[grunt]

263
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,576
I'll finish you
once and for all.

264
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:25,576
The Lion Roar Shot can only
be used with a heavy Ki.

265
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:31,243
Only someone as unhappy as Ryoga
can master that move, though.

266
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,009
Oh.

267
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,076
Not that stance.

268
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,976
I'll fight him in this way.

269
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:36,243
Hm.

270
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:37,909
He's looking pretty confident.

271
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,109
What's he doing?

What a performance.

00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:58,443
Bride of the Fierce Tiger?

279
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:00,409
I've never even heard of it.

280
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:11,176
The way you fight
someone with a heavy Ki

281
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,609
is with a confident
Ki like mine.

282
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,843
You're in trouble now, Ryoga.

283
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:15,909
Confident Ki?

284
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:18,676
That's why he was so cocky.

[rumble]

286
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:23,443

Thanks for making
me more miserable.

00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:26,576
Huh?

289
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:29,343
You should have given up
while you had your chance.

290
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:32,276
Then I wouldn't need to do this.

291
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,243
But now I have to use my
perfected Lion Roar Shot

292
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:37,643
and wipe you out for good!

It's just like before.

It's enormous!

How depressing.

The Lion Roar Shot is
to be revered by all.

318
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:45,009
The Ki is emitted from Ryoga,
rises up, then drops down

319
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,409
lower than before.

320
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,843
It's easy to continue
the vicious cycle.

321
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,609
But I don't understand
why Ryoga is so

322
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:54,143
depressed in the first place.

323
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:56,609
I think I might know why.

324
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:59,276
I can't stand your guts, Ryoga.

325
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,876
(VOICEOVER) Those
horrifying words.

326
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:06,376
It's enough to keep
me miserable forever.

327
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:09,076
And now you're going to
pay for this misery, Ranma.

00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:13,809
(VOICEOVER) Oh, no!

329
00:16:13,843 --> 00:16:16,876
If I'm the reason Ryoga became
so depressed-- oh, then I've

330
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,809
got to do something
to stop this fight.

331
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:22,309
Because any way it turns
out, they'll both lose.

332

Ryoga, wait!

00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:23,976
Huh?

00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,143
Akane, is that you?

335
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,609
Are you worried
about what I said?

What's she talking about?

337
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:32,009
You're the one who
forced me to say it.

338
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:33,909
You made me say I hated you.

339
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:35,543
Please don't try to comfort me.

340
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:37,676
But Ryoga, it wasn't right.

341
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,576
Because I actually--
I like you, Ryoga!

342
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,943
Huh?

343
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:48,776
You do?

344
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,376
Really?

345
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,543
[music playing]

346
00:16:58,343 --> 00:16:59,876
I really do, Ryoga.

347
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,276
You're a good friend.

348
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,243
Let's be friends forever.

349
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:06,209
Huh?

350
00:17:06,243 --> 00:17:08,776
Huh?

351
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:09,543
Oh.

352
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,009
Let's be friends forever.

353
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:19,076
(VOICEOVER) Thanks for
finishing me off, Akane.

354
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,776
So that's where you're
getting all your misery from.

355
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,676
You used Akane so you
could get all depressed

356
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,243
and then turn your
feelings against me.

357
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:28,443
It's over.

358
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:31,576
I really have
nothing left to lose.

359
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:33,076
But Ranma!

360
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:35,676
You're going down with me!

361
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:36,509
Oh, Ryoga.

362
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:38,076
Why are you still so miserable?

363
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,109
Hang on.

364
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:40,909
Just what did you say to him?

365
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,409
[explosion]

366
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:46,776
I won't get away with this.

367
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:47,876
[groan]

368
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:50,243
It's never going to
turn out differently.

369
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:52,709
Let's do ourselves
a favor and end it.

370
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:54,509
(VOICEOVER) It
doesn't make sense.

371
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:57,276
The Lion Roar Shot should
have crushed Ryoga, too,

372
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,576
on its way down.

373
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,809
But it doesn't seem
to have affected him.

374
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:01,676
Shishi Hokodan!

375
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:09,043
What's with that strange
look on his face?

376
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:10,643
[groan]

377
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,209
Wait a minute.

378
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,343
Maybe--

379
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:21,276
I win again.

380
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,576
I'm just getting warmed up.

381
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:26,576
Let's see you try
it one more time.

382
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,376
Huh.

383
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:28,943
Aren't you the slow learner.

384
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:34,676
[grunt]

385
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,409
(VOICEOVER) If I'm
right about this,

386
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:40,076
I just might win the match.

387
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:42,809
It's all or nothing.

388
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:43,809
[yelling]

389
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,743
Now's my chance.

390
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:48,509
Whoa!

391
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,143
I can see Akane's panties!

392
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:53,109
What?

393
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:54,676
[scream]

394
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:56,643
[scream]

395
00:18:58,076 --> 00:18:58,776
[groans]

396
00:18:58,809 --> 00:18:59,543
Uh-huh.

397
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,076
It's just what I thought.

398
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,343
When you use the Lion Roar
Shot, you go completely empty

399
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,976
of all emotion.

400
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:11,409
And after that, the Ki
passes right through you.

401
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,709
Loses his Ki?

402
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:15,776
He was so out of his
mind, he lost his Ki.

403
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:19,109
So if I can distract you
at exactly the right moment,

404
00:19:19,143 --> 00:19:20,909
you'll destroy yourself.

405
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:22,109
Huh.

406
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:23,143
How many times do
you think I'd fall

407
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:24,909
for that lame trick of yours?

408
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,109
We'll see.

409
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:28,376
This is where the
real match starts.

410
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:31,376
The end's near for
you, I'm afraid.

411
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:35,009
(VOICEOVER) This is
the only way I can win.

412
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:36,043
Hey, Ryoga.

413
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,909
I gave Akane a kiss, you know?

414
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:38,543
Huh?

415
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:39,509
[gasp]

416
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,076
You did what?

417
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,276
That-- that's a lie!

418
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,576
He's just joking around!

419
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:46,109
We never did anything like that!

420
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,409
It's a lie!

421
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:49,009
(VOICEOVER) What on
earth is Ranma thinking?

422
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:52,809
The heavier Ryoga's Ki becomes,
the stronger the Lion Roar Shot

423
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,009
will be.

424
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:58,276
Why would he try to make
Ryoga even more depressed?

425
00:19:58,309 --> 00:19:59,443
[grunts]

426
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,343
Ultimate shishi hokodan!

427
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:17,676
[gasp]

428
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,009
Now's my chance.

429
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:22,609
[grunt]

430
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:27,943
I'm coming, Ryoga.

431
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,943
Ryoga!

432
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:33,509
I didn't kiss Akane!

433
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:34,076
Huh?

434
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,943
Are you serious?

435
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:37,643
Of course I didn't!

436
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:42,976
[scream]

437
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,576
[scream]

438
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:52,409
[coughing]

439
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,843
I finally beat
Ryoga's Lion Roar Shot.

440
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:02,209
Ranma!

441
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:05,643
A distraction just when Ryoga's
Ki was at its all time low.

442
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:08,409
He didn't stand a chance
against that strategy.

443
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:12,509
But it's amazing that Ranma
came out unscathed, too.

444
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:13,443
[groan]

445
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:16,743
I spoke too soon.

446
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,776
Guess he was just
holding on by a thread.

447
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:36,743
Like I said-- Ranma just made
all that up about us kissing.

448
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:38,009
Glad to hear it.

449
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:47,157
[music playing]

450
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,426
GIRL (VOICEOVER):
Honestly, what in the world

451
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,592
does the Ghost Cat
Maomolin getting married

452
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:24,026
have to do with Ranma having
to kiss Shampoo, anyway?

453
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,426
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
Shampoo's Cursed Kiss.

454
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,459
We'll see you there.
