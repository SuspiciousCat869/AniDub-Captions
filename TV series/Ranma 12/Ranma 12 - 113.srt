-(BOTH) Oh!

00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:48,366
Huh?

5
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:49,800
What a hunk.

6
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,500
Ah!

7
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,700
-Isn't he the principal?

NARRATOR: "Dear
Daddy, Love Kodachi."

00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,400
-Check out the gifts.

11
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,600
-Hm!

12
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,700
Excuse me, but I was
wondering if next Sunday you

13
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,733
would do me the honor of coming
to St. Hebereke's Girl's School

14
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,300
for my parent's day, father.

15
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,100
-Huh, what?

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
-Did you hear that, Saotome?

17
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,133
She called you "father."

18
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,533
-Yes, but what's with that?

19
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,833
-I suspect she must have
some kind of hidden motive

20
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,100
to call you that.

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,700
-Maybe because of my good looks.

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,300
-It's like I've
always said, Saotome--

23
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,500
-(TOGETHER) We've still got it.

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,700
-And right after our
visit to my school,

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,833
I'll treat you all to a
gourmet French dinner.

26
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,533
-Well, seeing as
you insist, sure.

27
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:59,400
-You can't be serious!

28
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,666
-So what's the deal
about asking him?

29
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,100
Why don't you ask your own dad?

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,266
-Huh?

31
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,900
-Come to think of
it, isn't your father

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
the principle of Furinkan High?

33
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:19,966
-Not ornate enough.

34
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:23,407
Uh!

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,900
-We need to talk.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,233
-How dare you.

37
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,800
I had that very tuxedo tailor
made by PR Gardain himself

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,133
for teacher-parent's
day at school!

39
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,233
But you, as always, have
demonstrated your lack

40
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,133
of respect for your older and
much more handsome sibling.

41
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,900
I suppose in some
crude fashion that

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,033
is your way of expressing
a jealous outburst.

43
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:51,366
Yet I grant you forgiveness.

44
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:54,400
-Brother dear, I want you
to explain why you never

45
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,266
told me about our father.

46
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,000
-Our father?

47
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,866
Your babble baffles me.

48
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,766
-Would you stop playing dumb!

49
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:05,100
I just heard that the
principal at Furinkan High

50
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,066
is in fact our father.

51
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,000
-I, too, have heard
that rumor, sister.

52
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,466
However, I have chosen
simply to ignore it.

53
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:15,033
-I never knew I had a father.

54
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:17,366
KODACHI (VOICEOVER): And from
what everyone has told me,

55
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,900
he's a very handsome man.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,900
Is that true, brother dear?

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,233
Is it?

58
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,666
-Don't be absurd.

59
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,533
-Oh, I want to meet
him so very much.

60
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:32,066
-Master Kuno, there's
someone here to see you.

61
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,000
-Who is it?

62
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Can't you see I'm busy?

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
-Someone claiming
to be your father.

64
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,933
-Curses!

65
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,566
I never expected him to
admit to such a thing,

66
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,133
and then to show up here!

67
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,000
Kodachi, stay put.

68
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,066
Hm?

69
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,766
-She already left to
go answer the door.

70
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:50,533
Oh!

71
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,166
-You imbecile.

72
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:52,707
-Sorry!

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,533
TATEWAKI (VOICEOVER): I
can't let the two meet.

74
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,500
I won't!

75
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,400
-I can't believe it.

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,366
I've met my father.

77
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:13,600
-Oh, Kodachi, my little Kochi.

78
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,566
-Father, dearest!

79
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,066
-Hm?

80
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,633
Kodachi!

81
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,866
-I never thought
I'd see the when

82
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:24,033
all three would be
united as a family.

leave us again, father.

00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,766
-Don't you worry one
little bit, Kochi.

86
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,833
Big daddy won't ever be
leaving you again, no way.

87
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:35,900
-Ah!

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,500
How dare you show
your face here!

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,400
Yah!

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:39,941
-Huh?

00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,100
-Uh--

92
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,100
-Please stay a while.

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,600
We have so much to talk about.

94
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
-Yeah, you be so right, girl.

95
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
OK, I stay for a while.

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
-Give me a minute, and
I'll go make us some tea.

97
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,400
Oh, it's so good to see
you, my dear old father.

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,366

-How dare you defile my room!

102
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:18,400
-Me don't think you be
needing this no more.

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,100
-Ah!

104
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,166
Stop it!

105
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:21,266
-Calm down!

106
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,766
-So whose side are
you on, anyway?

107
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:24,766
-Good question.

108
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm not sure.

109
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,300
[laughs]

110
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,266
-Is only natural that the
father be in charge, no?

111
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:34,033
Which means I decide
whether you stay or you go.

112
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:35,400
-Sorry for interrupting.

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,100
-The nerve of you challenging
my authority in this house!

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,266
-It's time you learned the
Japanese tradition of respect.

115
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,800
And to respect the
father, the son

116
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,700
must shave all the
hair off his head!

117
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,666
-Never!

118

KODACHI: Oh, father dearest!

120
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,233
The tea's ready.

121
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:53,933
-Ahem.

122
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,400
I'll be right there.

123
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:55,941
-Huh?

[giggles]

125
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:01,807
-Hm.

126
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,100
TATEWAKI (VOICEOVER):
That's strange.

127
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,833
I can't recall when I've
seen Kodachi so happy.

128
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:12,700
-Master Kuno!

129
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,700
Master Kuno!

130
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Why don't you join
them at the table?

131
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,733
-As the master of this house,
I have decided to let them be.

132
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,700
[sighs]

133
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,800
-So, what kind of books you
be liking to read, Kochi?

134
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,766
Whoo, you be
reading [inaudible].

135
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,000
Why don't you read a little
bit for your father, Kochi?

136
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,366
-Of course.

137
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,400
"The distant, setting sun
was a sight to behold,

138
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,900
yet the light I saw in your
eye was by far more engaging."

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,633
-Oh, that be the most
beautiful poem I ever heard!

140
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,900
[birds chirping]

141
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:53,033
-So, I've heard you lived
in Hawaii all these years.

142
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,633
-For a long time,
I was professor

143
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,433
at a small university.

144
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:00,400
At first, island life was
like living in a paradise.

145
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,833
But every time I wanted to take
a leave of absence and see you,

146
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:06,700
they refused to
let me go because

147
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,833
of a shortage of
the teaching staff.

148
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,266
-Uh!

149
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,633
-Hm?

150
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:14,174
Ahhh!

151
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,033
Oh Kodachi!

152
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,900
How I long to see you!

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,933
-But no matter how many times
I tried to escape there,

154
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,266
they would always find me.

155
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:37,533
I tried 3,000 times before I
be successful and make my way

156
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:40,366
safely home to the motherland.

157
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,433
-You went through
all that for me?

158
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:47,366
-I would have done anything to
see you again, my little Kochi.

159
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:50,600
-Father, how would you
like to go for a boat ride?

160
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,066
-Me like that.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,033
TATEWAKI (VOICEOVER): Maybe
Kodachi needs her father now.

162
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:08,533
Huh?

163
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,600
You, sir, are
sitting in my chair!

164
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,866
-Correct.

165
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,300
I am sitting where the master
of the house should sit.

166
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,300
That be because I am the master.

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,266
-I daresay your sheer effrontery
and lack of respect towards me

168
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:24,766
is unacceptably appalling!

169
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,533
-Oh, brother, dear.

170
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,566
You're just jealous, that's all.

171
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,266
-Excuse me?

172
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:30,566
That's absurd!

173
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,366
-Now that father's
home again, it's

174
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,000
his rightful place to take
on the position as master

175
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,033
of the house.

176
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,000
Why can't you just
be happy he's home?

177
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,700
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Oh, no!

178
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,066
[growling]

179
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,133
-Control yourself!

180
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,233
Please, Master Kuno, you must!

181
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,800
TATEWAKI: Forgive me.

182
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,633
-Master Kuno!

183
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,266
[laughs]

184
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,100
Oh, I must admit he is good.

185
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,733
His masterful use of sympathy
to deceive Kodachi and take over

186
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,433
the house of Kuno
may work on her,

187
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:10,066
but I will never succumb to
his little game of trickery.

188
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,166
Because I too have got a plan.

189
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:36,866
-What?

190
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:39,166
Something's going
on at Kuno's house?

191
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,233
-Yes.

192
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,466
I don't know all of
the details, but it

193
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:45,266
seems there's a huge battle
brewing between Master Kuno

194
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:48,833
and Mistress Kodachi over
the return of their father.

195
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:51,500
-Well, Kuno baby
should get over it.

196
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
-Yeah, Nibiki's right.

197
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,100
He's a little too
dramatic for me.

198
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,400
-Ranma!

199
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,733
-What I can't figure out is
why is the principal only

200
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,100
showing up now?

201
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,933
-Saotome, just
because he's returned,

202
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,800
are you shirking your
promise to take Kodachi

203
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,433
to the parent-teacher's
day at school?

204
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,900
-That's ridiculous.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,633
When she asked me to take her,
I didn't know she had a father.

206
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,166
-Don't take this
the wrong way, but I

207
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:15,166
think all you really wanted was
the French dinner she promised.

208
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,266
-Put a lid on it, Tendo!

209
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,300
-I'm so sorry.

210
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,733
I'll just leave now.

211
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,200
-Wait.

212
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,333
-Hm!

213
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,266
So are you saying you'll
help me resolve this?

214
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:34,000
-Would you like
another cup of tea?

215
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,541
-Thanks.

216
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,600
I've worked in that
house for over 10 years,

217
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,400
and since then many
things have changed.

218
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,133
-Hey, that's my melon!

219
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,733
-No, it's mine!

220
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,166
[gasps]

221
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:56,100
-Why don't you take
it, brother dear?

222
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,766
-No, you.

223
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:57,866
It's yours, Kodachi.

224
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:58,733
-I insist.

225
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,000
It's all yours.

226
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,800
-No, I said it's yours!

227
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,966
Now take it!

228
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,533
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
People say they turned out

229
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:08,600
the way they did because
they didn't have parents.

230
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,966
But I for one believe deep down
that Master Kuno and Mistress

231
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,333
Kodachi really and
truly love each other.

232
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,800
-Yeah, but I heard the principal
only left them three years ago.

233
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,866
Huh?

234
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:22,066
-I never knew that
Kuno's life was so hard.

235
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,000
-Wha--

236
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,466
[crying]

237
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:27,133
-How sad.

[laughing nervously]

239
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,566
-I don't like this.

240
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,400
This blows!

241
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,466
-So how can we help you, Sasuke?

242
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,933
I mean, well, do you
have any ideas, Ranma?

243
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,933
-I wouldn't have asked if I did.

244
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,633
-Hm?

245
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,366
-Maybe we can help you
stop them from fighting.

246
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:50,500
-Yes!

247
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,033
I want the whole family
to live together happily

248
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,133
for ever and ever.

249
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,033
That will make my
job so much easier.

250
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,066
-That's totally impossible!

251
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:57,607
-Ranma!

252
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,007
-Uh!

253
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:01,507
Uh!

254
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:02,266
Uh!

255
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,366
-How does this feel, father?

256
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:03,907
-Uh!

257
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:04,407
Uh!

258
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,333
Uh!

259
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,333
It's wonderful.

260
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,966
-I've always dreamed
of doing this.

[laughs]

262
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,666
TAILOR: Hello?

263
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:11,833
Anybody home?

264
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,033
-Oh!

265
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,166
-I brought the tuxedo
over from my tailor shop.

266
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,000
-Now that was quick.

267
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,066
Thank you.

268
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,500
TAILOR: Tell Mister Kuno we
really appreciate his business.

269
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,566
-Oh, good.

270
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,066
I see my new tuxedo
has finally arrived,

271
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,100
and the timing is impeccable.

272
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,400
-Just wait until you see it.

273
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,000
PRINCIPAL KUNO: Well, what
do you two Kochis think

274
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,233
of my new threads?

275
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:38,033
So then, how do I look?

276
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,100
-You look marvelous!

277
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,633
-Ahhh!

278
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,900
And you asked him to
parent-teacher day?

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,366
-Don't be silly, brother dear.

280
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:48,866
Of course I did.

281
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:52,866
-Ahhhh-- oh.

-I'll tell her.

286
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,666
I won't tell her.

287
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:07,600
I'll tell her.

288
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,533
I won't tell her.

289
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:09,566
I'll tell her.

290
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,300
I won't tell her.

291
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,433
I'll tell her.

TATEWAKI (VOICEOVER):
I must at last

293
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:21,266
admit a brother can never truly
replace the role of a father.

294
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:21,866
-Sasuke!

295
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,733
Where are you?

296
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,000
-You called, Master Kuno?

-I'm moving out.

00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,533
You must help me.

-Huh?

300
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,600
-But why do you have
to move, Master?

301
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,266
-There is only room here for
one head of the household.

302
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,833
I just hope they
realize how generous I'm

-You're doing this
for Mistress Kodachi?

-There can never be two
masters in one household.

Ah, but I will make
that sacrifice!

Why are you here?

by to see you

between your legs.
