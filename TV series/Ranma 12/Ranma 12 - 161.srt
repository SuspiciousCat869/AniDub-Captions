00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,062
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
"Boy Meets Mom, Part 2.

3
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:51,128
Someday, Somehow."

4
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,695
Stupid old man, making
that kind of promise

5
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:54,962
without even asking me.

6
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:55,562
Come on.

7
00:01:58,195 --> 00:02:01,028
I'm saying it right
now, you furry jerk.

8
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:03,062
You got me into this
mess, so now it's

9
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,195
your turn to get
me out of it, OK?

10
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:13,228
I thought you'd say that.

11
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:21,162
I'll take you out
with Mom's own sword.

12
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:22,295
Think quick, Pop.

13
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,662
What do you want
on your tombstone?

14
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:39,228
Take it like a man!

15
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:42,028
KASUMI: It's so
nice of you to help.

16
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,728
Oh, it's the least I could do.

17
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:50,962
And where do you think
you're going, huh?

18
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:51,962
Uh-oh.

19
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:52,562
Huh?

20
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:57,528
Lanko, look out.

21
00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:58,295
It's hot!

22
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,895
SOUN (VOICEOVER): Oh, no!

23
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:02,195
AKANE (VOICEOVER): If he gets
hit with that hot soup, he'll--

24
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:03,728
NABIKI (VOICEOVER):
Ranma's toast.

25
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:08,928
Nice catch, Lanko.

26
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,062
I'm very impressed.

27
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:15,662
SOUN: Any spicy cod roe left?

28
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,795
KASUMI: I'll get it, Father.

29
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:18,795
NABIKI: It's good.

30
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:22,162
AKANE: Sure is.

31
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:25,862
So, Akane, they tell me
that you're Ranma's fiancee.

32
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:26,962
Is that true?

33
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,228
Yes, but I--

34
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:28,728
Oh, hey.

35
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:30,228
My favorite.

36
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:31,662
NODOKA: Ranma, he--

37
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:32,528
Here, Father.

38
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:33,095
Your rice.

39
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,228
Ah, thanks.

40
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:39,528
So, as his fiancee, would
you say that he's manly?

41
00:03:39,562 --> 00:03:41,728
What?

42
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:42,895
Uh-huh.

43
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:45,528
Is he cool?

44
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:46,195
Uh-huh.

45
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:48,928
How about handsome?

46
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:49,795
Uh-huh.

47
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,228
Is he?

48
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,695
Think you could've stretched
that pause any longer?

49
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,962
You know something?

50
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:56,528
Ranma looks exactly like you.

51
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:57,128
Really?

52
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:04,695
Oh, you're right, now
that you mention it.

53
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:05,495
Oh, well.

54
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,028
So what?

55
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:08,328
You're right.

56
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:10,995
More important, what
hobbies does he have?

57
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:13,095
Yes, hobbies are nice.

58
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,128
I guess he likes martial arts.

59
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:17,628
Isn't it more like
girls' clothes?

60
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:18,728
Girls' clothes?

61
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:20,428
My son likes girls' clothes?

62
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,862
Oh, so he's a
horticulturist, then?

63
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:28,828
Oh, good.

64
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:33,795
OK.

65
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:36,228
Now what did I do
to tick you off?

66
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:37,062
Dear me.

67
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:38,828
Was it something that I said?

68
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,395
Oh, come on.

69
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:43,462
Maybe you should just confess,
Ranma, and get it over with?

70
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:44,462
Why?

71
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,695
Cause even blackmail
by Nabiki's better

72
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:49,495
than having to commit seppuku.

73
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:51,328
Blackmail?

74
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:52,095
Come on.

75
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:53,928
Are you saying you won't?

76
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:55,595
You're missing
the point, Ranma.

77
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,262
What?

78
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:01,662
Me and Akane, we-- we'd
like to see our mom,

79
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:03,695
but-- but she's gone now.

80
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,995
So, Ranma.

81
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:16,062
Wha-- what is it?

82
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:24,262
I'll stay quiet for
5,000 this one time only.

83
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:25,928
Oh, man.

84
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,628
For a while, I thought
she was serious.

85
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:35,862
Hello, Lanko.

86
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:39,228
I'm sorry, but it seems I'll
be sleeping in here with you

87
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:40,028
tonight.

88
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:41,795
I do hope that's all right.

89
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:43,562
Uh.

90
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:44,595
Of course it is.

91
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:45,828
Uh, but--

92
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,795
The confession
part's up to you,

93
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:49,395
but she's still your mother.

94
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:53,762
You can at least spend one
night together as a family.

95
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:55,828
Mrs. Saotome's going home.

96
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:56,995
Going home?

97
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,495
First thing tomorrow.

98
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,362
I just thought you
should know, Ranma.

99
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,062
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Leaving, huh?

100
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:17,195
So soon too.

101
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:19,462
I mean, she just got here.

102
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,062
Ranma.

103
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:23,128
Ranma.

104
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:28,595
She's just dreaming.

105
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:32,495
Ranma.

106
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:40,628
Even when she's sleeping,
she looks for me.

107
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:45,262
Mom, I just--

108
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:50,662
Ranma.

109
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,862
Ranma!

110
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:55,595
Why, oh, why aren't
you the manly son

111
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:56,762
I've dreamed of having?

112
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:02,795
Oh, that poor woman.

113
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:04,395
She must've had a nightmare.

114
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:09,128
AKANE (VOICEOVER): For
her sake and Ranma's, this

115
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,328
can't go on much longer.

116
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:21,562
Well then, I'll be off.

117
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:25,228
It's really a shame Ranma and
my husband couldn't be here.

118
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:27,795
You're welcome here any time.

119
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:28,695
Bye.

120
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,428
We'll see you later, OK?

121
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:31,262
Goodbye.

122
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:32,228
Goodbye.

123
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:35,595
It was nice meeting you, Lanko.

124
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:36,695
Bye.

125
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:38,362
Take care of yourself, Lanko.

126
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:51,462
Doesn't this feel good?

127
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:54,628
Makes you wonder what all the
fuss back there was all about,

128
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:55,962
don't it, boy?

129
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:56,828
Something wrong?

130
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:03,395
Pop, didn't she seem
kinda sad to you?

131
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:04,362
Ranma?

132
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:06,595
You treated your
own wife like a bum,

133
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:09,995
and now you're acting
all proud about it.

134
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:12,562
You outta be ashamed, old man.

135
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:15,295
Need I remind you, boy,
how your mother expects

136
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,262
us to commit ritual
seppuku if you

137
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:20,562
don't become a man among men?

138
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:21,495
Oh.

139
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,162
Oh, yeah.

140
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:24,928
That hurt, by the way.

141
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,995
None of this would've
happened if you hadn't

142
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,195
made that stupid promise.

143
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:32,195
Just get over it
already, will you?

144
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,795
I can't believe I forgot this.

145
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:36,362
[splash]

146
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:36,928
Hey, look.

147
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:38,928
It's that lady.

148
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:41,595
Why, it's Lanko and Mr. Panda.

149
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:42,828
Fishing, are we?

150
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,662
You're welcome any time.

151
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:51,728
Bye.

152
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:53,462
Yeah, we'll see you next time.

153
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:54,295
Goodbye.

154
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:55,562
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Mrs. Saotome.

155
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:00,595
Mrs. Saotome.

156
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:05,028
Oh, Akane?

157
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:07,828
Mrs. Saotome.

158
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:08,728
What is it, dear?

159
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:13,695
You said I'd meet her?

160
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:15,062
What made you do that?

161
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:15,995
I had to.

162
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,328
I promised.

163
00:09:17,362 --> 00:09:20,295
She's expecting you in
the park this Sunday.

164
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:22,728
You don't really want your
mom to leave without knowing

165
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,428
who you are, do you, Ranma?

166
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:27,428
Uh.

167
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:29,495
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Mom, be honest.

168
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,328
Am I the kind of guy
you wanted me to be?

169
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:33,562
Oh, Ranma.

170
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:38,062
You're more than I dreamed--
handsome, kind, a man

171
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:39,695
among men.

172
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:40,995
True.

173
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:43,095
As long as she doesn't
find out I change--

174
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:46,495
Just try not to build
it up too much, OK?

175
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:49,462
Also, you probably
better not tell your dad.

176
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:50,462
Um, OK.

177
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:56,962
OK.

178
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:58,662
I guess I'll be heading out now.

179
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:01,428
Ranma, wait.

180
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,595
Um, here.

181
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:10,828
There were so many left
over, I-- it's for your mom.

182
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:11,862
Thanks, Akane.

183
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:12,462
Really.

184
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,828
Why are you looking that way?

185
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:21,228
Sorry.

186
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,928
I just-- I just now
realized that I-- that I do

187
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:25,828
have a mom after all.

188
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:26,862
Well, of course.

189
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:29,562
We all do.

190
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,695
He's agreed?

191
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:31,828
Uh-huh.

192
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:33,962
But um, you should
know that he--

193
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:34,862
No, no.

194
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,362
Please don't tell me.

195
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:37,928
I haven't seen him in so long.

196
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:43,095
But still, he is my own son,
and that's all I need to know.

197
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:49,328
AKANE: It'll be perfect.

198
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:51,362
Your mom can't wait to meet you.

199
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,162
Not so fast.

200
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:01,528
Where are you going?

201
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,395
Back off.

202
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:08,428
If you wanna get by, first,
you gotta go through me.

203
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:26,603
If you wanna go to your
mother, boy, first,

204
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,403
go through your father.

205
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:29,003
Done.

206
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:32,369
Aw, come on.

207
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:33,469
Wait up, boy.

208
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,503
Can't you see?

209
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:35,803
I only do it for your own good.

210
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,636
I only want you to
be a great martial--

211
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,636
Be quiet!

212
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,836
OK, boy, then how about this?

213
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,769
You seem to think
you'd be safe so long

214
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,803
as you don't change right
there in front of her.

215
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:49,503
What if somebody splashed
you or something?

216
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:52,069
You're worrying over nothing.

217
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,503
OK, let's say
you're on the street.

218
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:56,436
What if a water main breaks?

219
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:57,636
Oh, yeah.

220
00:11:57,669 --> 00:11:59,736
As if.

221
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,969
Then how about this scenario?

222
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:05,469
You get tripped by a
door-to-door goldfish salesman.

223
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,503
Yeah, right.

224
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:07,336
Come on.

225
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:11,936
Why can't you accept
I'm trying to save you

226
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:13,269
from ritual seppuku?

227
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:22,836
And you actually have the
gall to call yourself a father?

228
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:44,836
Mr. Saotome.

229
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,203
I knew you'd try to pull
something like this.

230
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:51,803
Ranma?

231
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:55,236
Ranma.

232
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,503
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
He's finally here.

233
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:01,803
You look just like your father.

234
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:06,669
That's not Ranma.

235
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,503
Is that you, Akane?

236
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:09,836
Why are you here?

237
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:13,303
Please pay no attention
to what Mr. Saotome--

238
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,203
No, no.

239
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:15,503
Don't tell me.

240
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:17,169
I haven't seen him in so long.

241
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:20,703
But still, he is my
own son, and what else

242
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:23,203
does a mother need to know?

243
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,469
You have no idea.

244
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:32,069
Ranma.

245
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:32,536
Ranma?

246
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,836
Where?

247
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:34,803
Ranma, over here.

248
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:36,503
We've been waiting for you.

249
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:37,603
Akane.

250
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:39,469
I told you he'd--

251
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,069
Huh?

252
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:48,903
Your father must've taken her.

253
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:52,336
OK, Pop, if that's
how you want it, fine.

254
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:55,936
Cause someway, somehow,
wherever he's got you,

255
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,703
Mom, I will find you.

256
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:01,069
They're over there, stupid.

257
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:02,169
Over there.

258
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:02,636
Where?

259
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,136
Where?

260
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,469
If he thinks he's
getting away with this.

261
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:13,503
Mrs. Saotome.

262
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,236
He's not coming?

263
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:22,103
Why not?

264
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,469
WAITRESS: Come on in.

265
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:28,869
AKANE (VOICEOVER): She's here.

266
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:38,036
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
So let her find out.

267
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:43,069
I'll show her a me more
manly than she thought.

268
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:43,551
Ranma?

269
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:56,236
I-- is that a boy's hand?

270
00:14:59,169 --> 00:14:59,618
Ranma?

271
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,003
Mom, I--

272
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:04,769
Ranma.

273
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:05,936
Oh, Ranma.

274
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:06,503
Oh!

275
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:07,203
I'm so sorry!

276
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:14,903
Lanko?

277
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,503
What are you doing?

278
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,836
I thought you
were someone else.

279
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:30,003
Of course.

280
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,403
Right here if I could.

281
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:42,236
Something to say, Mr. Panda?

282
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:53,803
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

283
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:55,369
That's our cue to go.

284
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:56,403
Come on.

285
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,503
What's going on?

286
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:00,469
RANMA: Take that.

287
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,069
Akane, be honest.

288
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:02,869
It's me.

289
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,669
Rama doesn't want to see me.

290
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:05,503
No.

291
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:06,669
I mean, he does.

292
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:08,703
He mustn't,
otherwise, why would he

293
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:11,269
keep me waiting all this time?

294
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,403
Well, maybe he's busy.

295
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:14,836
Why, you coward.

296
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:15,836
Yeah, right.

297
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,403
Get a load of who's talking.

298
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:20,303
You're the one who's afraid
of committing seppuku, Ranma.

299
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:21,469
I am not.

300
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,936
Oh, so you're
ready to die, huh?

301
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:27,551
Anyway.

302
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:33,869
The important thing here is
to show mom that I'm a man.

303
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:35,269
You wait here.

304
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:38,669
But then again, perhaps
we shouldn't meet.

305
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:50,103
After all, if he were
somehow-- unmanly,

306
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:56,003
then I might have to do
something I'd regret.

307
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:58,836
But we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it, won't we?

308
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:04,536
Hey, aren't you
going to tell her?

309
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:08,603
I'm not sure.

310
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,336
Do I have the right?

311
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,969
Can I be so cruel?

312
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:16,036
A mom's got a right
to dream, hasn't she?

313
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,369
Well, I'll take that
to mean the answer's no.

314
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:21,736
Akane.

315
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:25,136
I think that I'll
be going home now.

316
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,603
I know my son, and I'm sure
he's become a fine young man.

317
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,136
That'll have to be enough.

318
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:38,103
Goodbye.

319
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:49,069
Ranma.

320
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:50,869
Now what?

321
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,369
I see now I shouldn't
have done it.

322
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:57,669
I guess I just couldn't bear
for your mom to be so sad.

323
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:58,703
I'm sorry.

324
00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:01,869
I had no right to do what I did.

325
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:04,769
Seppuku is kind of
scary, and please

326
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:07,169
don't think that I blame you.

327
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,469
That's exactly
what you're doing.

328
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:13,303
Ranma.

329
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:17,869
I do miss you.

330
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:30,636
MAN: The hot spring's a burst!

331
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:33,236
MAN: Some kinda gusher!

332
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,236
Help!

333
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:36,236
It's my mom!

334
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,203
Mom!

335
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:40,803
Ranma!

336
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:46,236
Mom!

337
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:47,569
Ranma, it's you.

338
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:06,269
Ranma.

339
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:11,103
It's me, Mom.

340
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:11,585
Ranma.

341
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:25,903
Well, I guess she knows.

342
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:28,736
I hope she's not
too disappointed.

343
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:30,469
Not at all.

344
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,069
You are wonderful.

345
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:32,551
Really.

346
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:37,769
I'm right here.

347
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,936
[thunder]

348
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:40,418
No.

349
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:01,836
Lanko.

350
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,403
Tell me, was it you who
saved me back there?

351
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,303
I-- I, uh--

352
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:10,636
Ah.

353
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,969
So then it was just a dream.

354
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:14,736
A dream?

355
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:17,936
I dreamed Ranma saved me.

356
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:22,103
Dreamed he was a man among men.

357
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:23,803
Ranma!

358
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:28,603
That we found each
other at last.

359
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:31,369
Well, actually, you really did.

360
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:33,236
But she--

361
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,503
It's OK.

362
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:35,636
Let her keep dreaming.

363
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,469
Goodbye.

364
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,203
See you soon.

365
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:43,269
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Someday,
I'll be just a guy.

366
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:49,503
But until then, keep
dreaming for both of us.

367
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:50,369
KASUMI: Father.

368
00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:51,669
Mr. Saotome.

369
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:52,969
I've made you some tea.

370
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,469
GENMA: Why, thank you, Kasumi.

371
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,103
You're too good to us.

372
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:56,869
SOUN: Gotcha.

373
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:57,703
GENMA: No fair.

374
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,303
I wasn't looking.

375
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:00,536
SOUN: Now, Saotome, there's no
need for that kind of attitude.

376
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:01,669
HAPPOSAI: You're still playing?

377
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,036
Sweet sassy molassy,
I thought you

378
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,436
finished that game a week ago.

379
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:05,569
SOUN: You know your problem?

380
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:06,469
GENMA: What?

381
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:07,503
SOUN: You want to know?

382
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:08,403
HAPPOSAI: Oh, not this again.

383
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:09,303
GENMA: OK, now you're--

384
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,136
SOUN: You're hilarious.

385
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,436
GENMA: You never change, Tendo.

386
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:12,936
I'm off.

387
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,269
KASUMI: Have a nice day.

388
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,203
Ranma, come on.

389
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:17,136
We'll be late.

390
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:17,636
Yeah, yeah.

391
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:20,103
I know.

392
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:20,836
HAPPOSAI: Akane!

393
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:36,036
We waiting for
something, Akane?

394
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:36,603
Nope.

395
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:37,203
We're done.

396
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:43,669
Shall we?

397
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,503
Yep.

398
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:47,838
BOTH: See ya!

399
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:03,025
