so Dr. Tofu could have some.

Take it to him, OK?

-Akane, I could have taken this
to Dr. Tofu myself, you know.

Why do you have to
tag along anyway?

-Whoa.

MRS. TOFU: Oh, big hips bear
strong and healthy children.

75
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,235
And strong children
create strong bloodlines,

For good luck, big
hips on a bride

Oh, did you hear that, father?

is-- her name is--

-May I come in?

99
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:28,635
That dish I made for you
earlier, I made a mistake.

100
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:30,802
I accidentally used
sugar instead of salt,

101
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:32,168
so I brought you some more.

102
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:35,902
-Oh, you shouldn't have.

103
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:41,068
But I-- I like Chinese
pork and tofu with sugar.

104
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:43,002
Please, won't you come in?

105
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:46,335
-Akane's here already,
and I need to-- uh--

106
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,368
-You need to?

107
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:49,035
Yes, I'm listening.

108

to return your container.

-Oh my.

113
00:05:58,435 --> 00:05:59,968
That's not where the door is.

114

You're so silly.

are you to my son?

00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:17,468
-This is Dr. Tofu's mother.

-Oh.

How do you do?

I am Kasumi Tendo.

say, special friends?

00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:39,568
-Hmm.

130
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:41,602
You don't say.

131
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,468
-Dr. Tofu's been love
with Kasumi for as long

132
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:45,768
as I can remember.

133
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:47,468
It's just not fair.

134
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:48,835
-Oh, I agree.

135
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:53,868
I bet he's got quite a nice
egg laid aside for himself too.

136

-Nabiki, you'd better
not be thinking

137
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,602
what I think you're thinking.

138
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:00,068
Don't you dare try to
extort money from him.

139
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:01,268
-Extort?

140
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:03,035
How can you even
say such a thing?

141
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,268
Do I look like an
extorter to you?

142
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:06,402
-Well, actually--

143
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:08,202
-I'm so insulted.

144
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:10,868

Go fetch me some
water, will you?

149
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:32,302
-All right.

150
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:36,235
Uh-- mother, about our
discussion last night.

151
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:38,435
-I knew you would see it my way.

152
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:39,435
-I'm sorry.

153
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:42,035
I'm just not ready
to get married yet.

154
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:44,868
-Father, did you hear that?

155
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:47,202
Your son thinks only of himself.

156
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:49,935
-Uh-- ah-- calm down, mother.

157
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:56,935
-All righty then, guess
I'll join your father now.

00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:57,902
-Hmm.

159
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,668
What on Earth?

00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:03,968
-Look out!

161
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:06,568
Uh-oh.

162
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:11,835

-Hello.

Oh hello, Dr. Tofu.

167

Are you home, doctor?

-Oh.

00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:30,402
Hi, Nabiki.

170
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:34,868
-Doctor, have I
got a deal for you.

171
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:36,202
-Poor thing.

172
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,702
You must sweltering
in this heat.

173
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:40,868
[speaking panda]

174
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:42,668
-So that's when I
thought to myself, hey

175
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,268
if I pretend to
be his sweetheart,

176
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:47,002
I can set his poor
mother's mind at ease.

177
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:49,102
How does 600 yen an
hour sound to you?

178
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:51,835
-You mean you're gonna
charge me for this?

179
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:55,168
-Akane tells me your mother's
a real tough nut to crack.

180
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,302
-But, really, 600 yen an hour?

181
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:00,735
-Well, that includes the tax.

182
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:03,302
Well, in that case--

183
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,502
-Then it's a done deal.

184
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,768
Uh-- excuse me.

185
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,902
I'd like some pudding a la
mode, a chocolate parfait,

186
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:12,302
some cheesecake, a strawberry
tart, some pumpkin pie and uh--

187
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:17,602
-Oh, I'll just have some
more water, I guess.

188
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:19,735
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Dr.
Tofu belongs with Kasumi.

189
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:28,735
-Ranma, why don't
you go on ahead?

190
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,802
-But why should I, Akane?

191
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,135
-Ah-- I've gotta go
and do something.

192
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:34,268
-Huh?

193
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:34,768
Hey.

194
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:40,702
Hm?

195
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,002
OK.

196
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:45,335
-Didn't you hear what I said?

197
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,768
Don't you follow me!

198
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:47,268
-OK.

199
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:51,202
-Hm.

200
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:53,702
It must be pretty
hard times at the zoo,

201
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:56,735
if you have to
take outside work.

202
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:57,735
[speaking panda]

203
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:58,768
AKANE: Excuse me.

204
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,735
Would you tell
Dr. Tofu I'm here?

205
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:01,602
MRS. TOFU: I'm sorry.

206
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,068
He's out on a house call.

207
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:09,135
-Oh, well-- um-- the truth
is we're seeing each other.

208
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:10,335
[gasp]

209
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:11,468
-Seeing each other?

210
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:16,135
Does that mean you're
the one that he loves?

211
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:17,102
-Yup.

212
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:18,002
That's me.

213
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,035
I'll be Mrs. Tofu someday.

214
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,302
-I see.

215
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,235
Hm.

216
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:24,735
Hm.

217
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:26,635
Mhm.

218
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,868
-Huh?

219
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:30,068
Agh!

220
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:31,068
-Oh, not bad.

221
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,068
Not bad at all.

222
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:34,902
You got a nice set of hips here.

223
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,368
i think you're bigger
than the all Japan winner.

224
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:40,768
OK, you pass.

225
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:44,535
You can be bridal
candidate number two.

226
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:48,368
Father, our son is
are real ladies' man.

227
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:54,802
[praying]

228
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:56,302
-I thought you
said this was only

229
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:58,768
gonna cost me 600 yen an hour.

230
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:01,435
-Hey, you wanna show me off
to your mother, don't you?

231
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:07,702
-Your what?

232
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,668
Did you just say

233
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:10,735
-My br--bride?

234
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:11,835
Oh.

235
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,568
Let's just say she's
a very special friend.

236
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:18,002
Nabiki, come out here.

237
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:18,468
-Coming.

238
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:21,935
Hello, mother.

239
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,435
My name is Nabiki.

240
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:26,302
-Mother, this is the
woman I plan to wed.

241
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,068
Na-- Nabiki.

242
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:29,702
-Yes, my darling?

243
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:32,602

00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:34,802
-Oh.

246
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:36,602
They're not much, but oh.

247
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:38,068
They'll do.

248
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:38,602
OK.

249
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:39,668

-But what's number three mean?

252
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:45,835
-You sly fox, you.

253
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:48,635
You're the spitting image
of your father, you know?

254
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:49,935
Oh, father.

255
00:11:49,968 --> 00:11:51,602
Oh, father, you hear that?

256
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:55,402
Please help me choose the
best bride for our boy.

257
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:56,002
Oh.

258
00:11:56,035 --> 00:12:08,268
[praying]

259
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:08,768
-Ranma.

260
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:14,790
-Yah!

261
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:27,323
-I got those great
big hips blues.

262
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,390
Nothing fits but your shoes.

263
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:31,790
Oh, the big hips blues.

264
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:32,990
Yeah.

265
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:33,657
What the?

266
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,323
Hey you, could
you use the shower

267
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:41,157
at least before you get in here?

268
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,523
You could at least change out
of your panda form first, you--

269
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,890
-Ranma.

270
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:46,923
-Now what do you want?

271
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:00,723
-Huh?

272
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:01,857
Oh, Ranma.

273
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,457
-The old man told
me the whole story.

274
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,757
-Uh.

275
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,890
-So you volunteered
to be Dr. Tofu's wife.

276
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,657
-Oh, well I-- uh--

277
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,590
-Akane, congratulations!

278
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:16,857
You can't cook.

279
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,490
You're not much of a looker.

280
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:21,223
The one thing you do
have is brute strength.

281
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:26,457
Plus you have got the biggest
pair of hips in all Japan.

282
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,423
Oh, you're built like a brick.

283
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:31,857
Your legs are too thick.

284
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,057
You're singing
the big hip blues.

285
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,890
Oh yeah.

286
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:37,357
-Thanks for nothing, you jerk!

287
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:40,723
-Ow.

288
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,390
-You're such an idiot!

289
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:45,023
Hmph.

290
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,257
[oinking]

291
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,423
-Oink, oink to you too.

292
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:51,323
[oinking]

293
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:52,623
-Coward? you take that back.

294
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,557
-Yes, it's true.

295
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,857
Wanananana.

296
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,590
It's nothing new.

297
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,890
Wanananana.

298
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:03,723
Oh the big hip blues.

299
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,057
Oh yeah.

300
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,823
MRS. TOFU (VOICEOVER): We're
having a party at the clinic

301
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:10,023
today, and we'd like it
very much if you would come.

302
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,590
Signed Dr. Tofu and
his mother, Kin.

303
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,790
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Anything to help Kasumi.

304
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:19,690
Hey, Kasumi.

305
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,523
I'm going out for a while, OK?

306
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:31,823
-Hm, what's this?

307
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:32,323
Akane?

308
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:38,290
-Uh-- Nabiki?

309
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:39,223
-Akane?

310
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:40,890
-What are you doing here?

311
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,257
-It was me.

312
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,123
I invited you so we could talk.

313
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:46,123
You're sisters.

314
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,023
Why I had no idea.

315
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:50,457
Oh, it makes no difference.

316
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,290
-A-- Akane?

317
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:53,390
You too?

318
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:55,257
-This girl here says
that she intends

319
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,623
to become your wife, son.

320
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,157
Isn't that right?

321
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,957
-Akane, what's up?

322
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,490
-I could ask you the same thing.

323
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:05,357
-Hey, well-- I just-- you know.

324
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,757
-Now I will make my
decision on which one of you

325
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,890
will carry on our name.

326
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,957
Let us begin the ancient ritual.

327
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,957
-Ritual?

328
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,223
-Prepare the podium!

329
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:29,457
This ritual will help me
to decide which one of you

330
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,857
will make the better bride.

331
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,123
Begin the ritual!

332
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:37,190
When you choose a bride,
the pelvis must decide.

333
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:41,123
First you dance a little jig,
and then your hips collide.

334
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,057
Ready!

335
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,890
Set!

336
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,290
OK!

337
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:44,757
Go!

338
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:49,857
OK, girls.

339
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,423
Your turn.

340
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,490
-Uh-oh.

341
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:57,857
Akane's gonna win this for sure.

342
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,690
-That's why you're
going in there.

343
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:06,323
-What'd you do that for?

344
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:08,357
-Ranma, don't you
think you'd make

345
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,957
a much better
bride for Dr. Tofu?

346
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,290
-Hey!

347
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,357
-So cute.

348
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,623
-Nobody asked you!

349
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,923
-Good luck now.

350
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:25,523
-When you choose a bride,
the pelvis must decide.

351
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:29,823
First you dance a little jig,
and then your hips collide.

352
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:30,490
Ready!

353
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,390
Set!

354
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,990
-Wait just a minute!

355
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,390
Don't forget me!

356
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:34,857
-Huh?

357
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,590
-Ranma!

358
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:38,057
-Who's that girl there?

359
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,757
-Oh, mother Tofu, it is I,
your future daughter-in-law.

360
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,257
I've come to stand by my man.

361
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:49,457
Tofu and I were engaged
long before these two tried

362
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,323
to sink their claws into him.

363
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:53,657
Isn't that right, darling?

364
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,190
-You-- you-- you lunatic!

365
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,557
-Huh?

366
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,723
Hey, what are you doing?

367
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:00,357
You stop that!

368
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,490
-Oh, here they are.

369
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,823
The hips I've been
looking for all this time!

370
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,023
Perfect.

371
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,557
Strong like a man, but
gentle enough for a woman.

372
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,090
Tofu dear, I've decided.

373
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:12,123
This is your new bride.

374
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,090
-Ranma is Dr. Tofu's bride?

375
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:15,857
-Ooh.

376
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,523
What an interesting idea.

377
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:19,790
-Hello?

378
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,523
My, you look like
you're all having fun.

379
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,957
-Hi, Kasumi.

380
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,090
-A costume party?

381
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:27,790
Why didn't you tell me?

382
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:30,290
You know I love costume parties.

383
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:31,290
-No, Kasumi.

384
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:36,023
We didn't-- uh--
come on. in Kasumi.

385
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:40,490
Mother, uh-- I'll
tell you which one I--

386
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:43,323
which-- which one I want.

387
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:43,823
-Hm?

388
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:50,523
-Hm?

389
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,890
-To-- To-- Tofu!

390
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:58,423
What's wrong?

391
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,557
-I-- I love you.

392
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,357
My sweet Betty.

393
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,557
-Oh, Dr. Tofu.

394
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,957
You're such a kidder.

395
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,090
[singing]

396
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,190
-Oh, father.

397
00:19:11,223 --> 00:19:13,823
Looking at him
today, he was just

398
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:16,890
like you all those years ago.

399
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,290
I'm no fool, father.

400
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:22,223
I knew from the very beginning,
which one of those girls

401
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:24,923
he was interested in.

402
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:27,223
He should fess up
and get it over with.

403
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:28,923
Oh, I can't stand this waiting.

404
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:32,590
But I guess in that way,
he's just like you, dear.

405
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:34,923
They're all so kind
to him, father.

406
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,523
They all try so
hard for his sake.

407
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:40,190
You know, I think I can
finally go home in peace.

408
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,157
He will choose to marry
when the time is right.

409
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,023
You won't repeat any of
this, will you, Mr. Panda?

410
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:51,057
Oh, silly me.

411
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,823
Of course, you won't.

412
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,423
Pandas can't talk, now can they?

413
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:58,957
Well then, Father, I
suppose I'll be leaving.

414
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,390
[praying]

415
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:08,857
[singing]

416
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,523
-What?

417
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:22,223
Mother, are you leaving so soon?

418
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:24,023
What'd you do that for?

419
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,257
-You can stop now.

420
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,090
The mother knows
everything, Ranma, my boy.

421
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:30,357
-What?

422
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,923
-You must be, Kasumi, right?

423
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:34,057
-Yes, I am.

424
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,523
-Would you walk with me
to the train station?

425
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:37,757
-Of course.

426
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,123
-You go on ahead with her, son.

427
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,190
-Sorry to be so
much trouble to you.

428
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:44,890
-Oh no.

429
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:47,323
It's no trouble at all.

430
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:50,290
-Doctor, the station's that way.

431
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:51,890
-Oh, you're right.

432
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:57,723
[laughter]

433
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,923
-Akane, dear.

434
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,957
If he should happen to
propose to her anytime soon,

435
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,890
you'll look after things
for me, won't you?

436
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:10,523
-Of course.

437
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:11,423
-Hm?

438
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:12,823
Hey, Tofu!

439
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,123
Wait for me.

440
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:15,057
Oh.

441
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,023
Are you trying to
leave me behind?

442
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:18,957
Oh-- oh.

443
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,723
Say goodbye to the nice
panda for me, will you?

444
00:21:25,957 --> 00:21:28,823
-What an incredible old lady.

445
00:21:28,857 --> 00:21:30,423
-Oh, I'll say.

446
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,923
And she's a wonderful mother.

447
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:35,890
-Sure is.

448
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:37,523
-Oh yeah, Ranma.

449
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:41,690
Why did you volunteer yourself
as one of Dr. Tofu's fiancees?

450
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:42,790
-Huh?

451
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:45,790
Well, I-- uh-- because
I'm cuter they you.

452
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,323
That's why.

453
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:48,690
-Oh yeah?

454
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:49,590
Who told you that?

455
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:51,323
-Oh, it's so obvious.

456
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:54,457
You're not fit to be
anybody's bride anyway.

457
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,257
AKANE: Look who's talking!

458
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,757
RANMA: You are so uncute.

459
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,723
AKANE: Bleh!

460
00:21:58,757 --> 00:21:59,223
RANMA: Bleh!

461
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:03,723
-Ranma.

462
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:10,751
[theme music]

463
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:41,306
AKANE (VOICEOVER): What
is it with this girl?

464
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
Showing up suddenly
like this saying she's

465
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:46,740
going to kill Ranma, just
what happened between you

466
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,240
two in China anyway?

467
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:50,806
And what's this about
you two kissing?

468
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,206
Next time on Ranma 1/2-- "Enter
Shampoo The Gung-ho Girl."

469
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,206
See you there.
