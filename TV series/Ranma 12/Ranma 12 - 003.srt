-Kuno, what is it?

-It's about your

Never, Ranma Saotome.

look like Saotome just shrunk?

KUNO (VOICEOVER): I'm
almost positive that person

46
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:51,735
was a female.

47
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,135
Which could only mean one thing.

Saotome you wretch!

49
00:05:57,602 --> 00:05:59,702
Do you think you can leave
someone else in your place

50
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,935
and escape that easily?

51

-Geez, Kuno didn't have
to squeeze me so hard.

52

That ticks me right off.

Well, I guess the jig is up.

54
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:31,368
He must know my secret by now.

AKANE: Hey, dummy.

Just how stupid
can you be, Ranma?

You talking to me, Akane?

-Throwing yourself into
the pool like that?

Blah.

Lest too light winning make
the prize light, I accept.

71
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,202
If you defeat me, I shall
allow you to date me.

72
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:46,268
But beware, I am
prepared to lose.

73
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,502
-You say it like I want
to date you or something.

AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma,
change back into a boy

80
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:32,535
OK, first thing to do is
to get my balance back.

81
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,935
Then I can use this to
turn back into a guy.

82
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:35,435
-Ugh.

83

You're still a girl.

-It's not like it's my fault.

88

-Tell me, have you seen a
strange man with a pig tail?

Cowards die so many times
before their deaths,

00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:02,968
no doubt he feared my prowess.

He is not a man!

That hurt, you know.

around and listen to this.

you on anytime, Kuno.

-Very well, my fiery one.

98
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,268
Beauty itself doth persuade.

99
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:25,668
If you can defeat me, I
shall allow you to date me.

100
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:26,868
-Ah!

-Guess what, Kuno?

105

Ranma Saotome's
even better than me.

Come on, Akane, let's go home.

But who is she?

I never asked for this.

114

-From what I understand, Akane
really looked out for you

in school today, boy.

-You wound me Ranma.

122
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,640
I taught you better manners
than to ignore a debt of honor.

123
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:24,740
Ah, 16 years I tried to give
you the benefit of my wisdom.

Ranma-- I-- your
father has-- Oh.

What good are these hands
of mine if they cannot teach

126

my only heir how to walk the
path of martial righteousness.

127

Oh, my son!

My only son!

Son, your father has failed!

We're getting that fixed soon.

-Hm.

140
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,840
Guess you don't want this.

141
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:41,606
[chuckles] Catch!

142
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,606
-Lest too light winning make
the prize light, I accept.

143
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,206
-All right, Kuno,
I challenge you.

144
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:07,873
-Guess I should go thank her.

NABIKI: [grunting] What's
the big deal, Akane?

146
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:20,506
I think it's cool he
can change into a girl.

147

[pencil snaps] Huh?

-Cool?

149
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:27,206
That's easy for
you to say, Nabiki.

150
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,473
My life may as well
be over if I have

151
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:31,506
to marry a stupid jerk like him.

152
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,473
Why don't you marry
him if he's so cool?

153
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:38,473
Think about it, I'm engaged
to my worst nightmare.

-And the old man calls me rude.

-Mister Saotome, did you
spend the night like that?

-Not worth the effort of
changing back, he said.

-Uh, you want me to help
you with those guys, Akane?

-Excuse me, we don't know
each other, remember?

-But you know that they're
all waiting for you.

-I'm fine on my own, thanks.

00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,640
-Here.

168
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:19,106
-It's your serve, Akane,
and the game is love.

169
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,006
[fight sounds]

170
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:33,473
-It's the 100 meter
dash of the heart.

171
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,773
-Push me out of the
ring with your love.

172
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:53,740
Oh.

173
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:55,706
She is immovable.

174
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm in love.

175
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:01,106
-This happens every morning?

176
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,906
-Allow me this dance,
oh graceful one.

177
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,406
Uh.

178
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,640
-I wish these guys for once
would just give it a rest.

179
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:30,640
-Hey, I wonder where
that Kuno guy is today.

180
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,906
-Wither the pigtailed
treeborn kettle girl?

181
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:50,406
-Are you looking for her?

182
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,373
-Hm.

183
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:52,773
You know her?

184
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:53,440
-Yeah.

185
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,673
She's like a sister.

186
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,073
She has a pigtail and wears
Chinese clothes, right?

187
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:00,773
-Trifle not with me, Nabiki.

188
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,573
-Moi?

189
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:04,640
-Am I not Blue Thunder?

190
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:07,506
The rising new star of
Furinkan High School?

191
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,240
If the pigtailed one thinks she
can humiliate Kuno and simply

192
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:15,373
walk away, methinks she
thinks wrongly indeed.

193
00:18:15,406 --> 00:18:19,240
[maniacal laughter]

194
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:34,106
-[yawn]

195
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,473
-Akane, don't you get sick
of fighting those guys

196
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:37,140
every morning?

197
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:39,006
-Uh, uh, I sure do.

198
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,506
-When you're cranky, you don't
look that cute, you know.

199
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,640
-[growl]

200
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:48,206
-Hey.

201
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,140
Is training, OK?

202
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:56,840
-Here you go.

203
00:18:56,873 --> 00:18:58,540
RANMA: For me?

204
00:18:58,573 --> 00:18:59,306
From Kuno?

205
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,440
NABIKI: To your girl half.

206
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,273
He hasn't a clue that
you're one and the same.

207
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:04,040
-Hurry up and read it.

208
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:06,406
-To the treeborn kettle girl.

209
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,473
Please come to the second
field of Furinkan High School

210
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:12,506
this evening at 5:36 PM.

211
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,273
-Sounds like a duel.

212
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:18,273
-You know, Kuno's
a real sore loser.

213
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,140
He's out for blood.

214
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:21,906
-Maybe it's best you didn't go.

215
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:28,340
-Hm.

216
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:29,306
I think not.

217
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,240
-He's late.

218
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:15,340
And he's the one that picked
the time and everything.

219
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:16,140
What a loser.

220
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,906
KUNO: For it so
falls out, that what

221
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,906
we have we prize not the
worth whiles we enjoy it.

222
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,673
But being lacked and lost,
why then we rack the value.

223
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:35,240
Then we find the virtue
that possession would not

224
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:37,706
show us whiles it was ours.

225
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,206
-Hm.

226
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,506
-It is now exactly 536 PM.

227
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:51,106
The moment when the sunset
is at its most beautiful.

228
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,540
For it is the rising young star
of the high school kendo world

229
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:56,373
who shines before you.

230
00:20:56,406 --> 00:21:01,440
They call me the Blue
Thunder of Furinkan High.

231
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:06,906
It is I, Tatewaki Kuno who
has beckoned you to me.

232
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,540
-You still don't
get it, do you pal?

233
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:12,873
Hey, where's that stick
you're always waving around.

234
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,706
-I have no need of it.

235
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,773
-RANMA: Ha, pretty
confident, ain't ya?

236
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:25,006
-Confident enough
to give you this.

237
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,973
-Ha.

238
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:28,473
Huh?

239
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:42,473
-Pigtailed girl, I love you.

240
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:53,440
I love you.

241
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:12,534
[theme music]

242
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:42,863
NARRATOR: Kuno still
hasn't figured out

243
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:44,663
that that pigtailed
girl of his dreams

244
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:46,896
is actually that bossy Ranma.

245
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,696
And then Nabiki just
has to go and get

246
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:50,896
Kuno all riled up
all over again.

247
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,129
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Ranma versus Ranma?

248
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:56,763
If it's not one
thing, it's another.

249
00:23:56,796 --> 00:24:00,296
See you there.
