00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,740
NARRATOR: Meet Ranma
Saotome of the anything

2
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:11,907
goes school of martial arts.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,507
And here's Akane of
Tendo Training Hall.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,707
AKANE: What are you doing?

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,940
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

6
00:00:16,974 --> 00:00:18,540
to marry by they're
loving parents.

7
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:19,707
RANMA: I didn't ask for this.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,207
AKANE: Who asked you?

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,207
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,974
RANMA: What'd you do that for?

11
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:27,974
NARRATOR: When Ranma's
splashed with cold water,

12
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,474
he becomes a she.

13
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:45,616
[thunder]

14
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:46,316
Sleep.

15
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:47,349
Yes.

16
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:49,849
Sleep on good people of Japan.

17
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:54,016
For a greater evil than you have
ever known is about to awake.

18
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:28,516
[menacing laughter]

19
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,682
Enter Happosai,
the lustful lecher.

20
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:39,682
-Nothing like spring
cleaning, eh Saotome?

21
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:40,249
There.

22
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:41,416
Spic and span.

23
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:42,749
-Oh if we could
only straighten out

24
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:44,716
our children as
easy as this, eh?

25
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:47,282
-We'd end their bickering
once and for all, wouldn't we?

26
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,316
-You bet.

27
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,482
Let this dojo be our witness.

28
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:54,149
Everything we do, we
do for their sake.

29
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:54,749
[crash]

30
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:00,049
-The alter.

31
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:02,649
An omen.

32
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:06,082
-Alter goes smack,
demon comes back.

33
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:07,716
-Demon?

34
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:10,082
Ah, you mean that
sleeping demon, don't you?

35
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:13,882
[laughter]

36
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,316
-Don't tempt fate.

37
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,382
-Just a little humor, Tendo.

38
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,349
-I don't find it funny.

39
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:20,849
-What could happen?

40
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:24,882
[uneasy laughter]

41
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,216

00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:34,516
[noisy eating]

43
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:37,582
-More rice father?

44
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,849
Oops.

45
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:39,916
Oh, I'm so sorry.

46
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,049
-It's just a bowl, Kasumi.

47
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,349
-Saotome.

48
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:50,082
Bad luck.

49
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:51,382
-Please.

50
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,716
Rice bowl goes
crack, demon attacks.

51
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:55,849
You don't believe
those old wives tales?

52
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,916
RANMA: Did you hear
those two last night?

53
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,816
Were they weirder
than usual or what?

54
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:09,916
-You're right.

55
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:11,482
Dad's eyes were all
bloodshot this morning.

56
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,782
I don't think you
slept a wink all night.

57
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:15,916
I wonder what's
got him so worried.

58
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,882
RANMA: Ahhh.

59
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:18,849
AKANE: I'm going ahead.

60
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:24,216
-Jeez.

61
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:25,516
TV didn't say
nothing about rain.

62
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:30,982
-Here's your pork cutlet again.

63
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:34,782
-Marvelous.

64
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:42,982
-Hey, hey come back here!

65
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,282
Thief!

66
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:48,382
-Hey he left a note.

67
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,616
Calm down.

68
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:51,882
WAITRESS: Send the
bill to the Tendo Dojo?

69
00:03:55,649 --> 00:04:00,182
-One, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two.

70
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:01,749
-Akane!

71
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,149
-Achoo!

72
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:04,282
Am I catching a cold?

73
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,316
I guess I'd better
take a hot bath.

74
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:06,916
-What's that thing on her?

75
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:07,390
-Ew.

76
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:08,216
Gross!

77
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:08,982
-That's disgusting!

78
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,216
What do we do?

79
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:14,016
-I can't get it off me.

80
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:14,782
-Go away.

81
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:15,749
Leave me alone.

82
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:16,216
Shoo!

83
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:17,216
Go away!

84
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:18,216
-Hey whachoo guys doing?

85
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:19,749
-Oh, Akane.

86
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:20,216
-Go away!

87
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:20,782
-Akane?

88
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,282
-You know this creep, Akane?

89
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:26,016
-I don't know.

90
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,916
Do I?

91
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:28,982
-It's me Akane.

92
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,016
You don't remember me?

93
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,649
How cold hearted of you.

94
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:37,116
[crying]

95
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:37,949
-Come on.

96
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:38,682
Give me a minute.

97
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:39,182
Maybe I'll--

98
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:39,882
-Too late.

99
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:40,682
Too late.

100
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:43,849
I know when I'm not wanted.

101
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:49,116
Just allow me to have a good
cleansing cry-- in your bosom!

102
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,149
-Yuck.

103
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,516
Hey, where'd the
freak come from?

104
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:57,949
-Akane!

105
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,416
-You dirty old man.

106
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:05,682
What do you think you're doing?

107
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:06,749
-Oh, yeah.

108
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:08,082
You're Soun Tendo's
daughter, all right.

109
00:05:08,116 --> 00:05:10,382
You're so high spirited.

110
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,382
-Hey, how do you know my father?

111
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,849
-Then you mean you
really are Akane?

112
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,416
-Hey you didn't know who
I was at all, did you?

113
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,916
-No, life sure is
funny that way.

114
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:20,782
Now ain't it, girlie?

115
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:27,394
AKANE: I'm home!

116
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:30,361
RANMA: Yo, Mr. Tendo, the
old goat says he knows you.

117
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,394
Is he lying?

118
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:34,594
-Heya, nice to see ya.

119
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:42,194
-Master, thank
heaven you're safe.

120
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:43,894
-Fit as a fiddle as you can see.

121
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:46,894
-Did he say master?

122
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:50,028
-Master I was beginning
to hope-- I mean lose

123
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:53,094
hope that I'd ever again see
your blessed smiling face.

124
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:01,494
-Oh, it's great to see you
looking so spry Soun, old boy.

125
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,928
Ho ho, if it isn't
Genma Saotome.

126
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:13,728
You haven't changed a
bit, now have you Genma?

127
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:18,894
I'd recognize those beady
little eyes of yours anywhere.

128
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:22,161
-If I'm going down, I'm
not going alone, you know.

129
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:25,594
-Just like always.

130
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:29,428
One for all, and all for one.

131
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:30,761
-What's wrong here?

132
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:34,028
-They've been replaced by pods.

133
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,228
SOUN: It all started
10 years or so ago

134
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:40,128
when we were training
under master Happosai.

135
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:40,594
- Stop!

136
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:41,528
Thief!

137
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,794
-You know what to do boys!

138
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:47,028
-Master, no!

139
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,128
SOUN: We'd wash dishes
for three days and nights

140
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,894
after he'd eat a meal
and leave without paying.

141
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,494
-Oh no you don't!

142
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:54,461
-Soun, Genma!

143
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:55,861
Do your stuff!

144
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,661
-Master, please!

145
00:06:57,694 --> 00:07:00,228
SOUN: Sometimes we'd have to
clean dress dummies to pay

146
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,461
for the-- uh-- ladies
unmentionables the master would

147
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:04,361
borrow .

148
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:05,761
And then other times--

149
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:06,694
-Hey!

150
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:07,494
-Run, boys!

151
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,094
Run!

152
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,509
Run!

153
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,661
All in all, it was
extremely rigorous training.

154
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:23,261
Until one night.

155
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:24,928
SOUN: Master, here's
the sake we stole

156
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:26,861
for you from the villagers.

157
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:28,028
-Ah, well done!

158
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:32,461
-Ah, that's it.

159
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,361
Drink hearty .

160
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:34,361
Drink deep, master.

161
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:35,961
-Hey, keep your snoots
out of my hooch.

162
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:36,761
-Yes, master.

163
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:46,828
[snoring]

164
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:53,194
[snoring]

165
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:57,094
-Heave ho heave ho heave ho
heave ho heave ho heave ho

166
00:07:57,128 --> 00:08:01,461
heave ho heave ho heave
ho heave ho heave ho.

167
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,394
Yes.

168
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:16,928
-Saotome!

169
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:17,594
-Yes, Tendo?

170
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:23,928
GENMA: As of tonight,
master, we forgive you.

171
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,394
SOUN: May you rest in peace.

172
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:47,528
-I'd almost forgotten
all about that.

173
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,894
-Oh Kasumi!

174
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,661
More sake for our guest.

175
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:54,528
-Maybe you should've used a
little more plastic explosives.

176
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:56,961
-Well it ain't human, I tell ya.

177
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,928
-Yes, right here.

178
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,361
-It's your own fault
for not finishing me off

179
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:04,094
when you had the chance.

180
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:09,561
-He's got a point.

181
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:10,861
-Quite right.

182
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:13,128
-But again it's still
not too late, is it?

183
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:19,728
-I've got the sake.

184
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:20,728
-Just kidding, master.

185
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,461
It was-- it was all a joke.

186
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:24,694
-Yes, but of course it was!

187
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:32,628
HAPPOSAI: Come on.

188
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:33,661
I was young once.

189
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:34,694
I know what it's like.

190
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:41,328
But I didn't come here for
revenge, so you two can relax.

191
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,028
The truth is, boys, I'm
not getting any younger,

192
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,994
and it's high time I
pick myself an heir.

193
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:49,994
It's about time one of you
two volunteer to take over

194
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:53,494
the anything goes school
of martial arts and then--

195
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:55,994
and just where do you
think you two are going?

196
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,694
-I just recalled
I'm moving to China.

197
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,028
-Yeah, I'm with him.

198
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:01,494
-You guys are so pathetic.

199
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,661
I can't believe you're letting
this old fool scare you

200
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:04,861
like that.

201
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:06,128
-Here master.

202
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,494
Why don't you take
this one for your heir?

203
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:11,228
I'll sign all my parental
rights over to you.

204
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:16,294
I know he's not much to look
at, but he cleans up nice.

205
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,428
-How could you?

206
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:18,361
My goodness.

207
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:20,394
A beautiful young
girl like that?

208
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:22,661
She'd never survive
the training.

209
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,928
Ahh that's hot!

210
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:32,294
-Don't worry master.

211
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:34,328
As you can see, he's
also a healthy young man.

212
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:35,061
-He's what?

213
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:39,928
-You dirty old man!

214
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:49,528
-Well now, if he's boy
that's a whole other story.

215
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,628
OK, I suppose he'll have
to do, at least for now.

216
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:12,579
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
That old pervert.

217
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:14,345
Take over as his heir?

218
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,512
Yeah, right.

219
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:17,312
I'd rather take up
gardening or basket weaving,

220
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:24,179
or-- [gargles] he
can find a new--

221
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,379
-Good morning!

222
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,579
-And what's so good
about it, you old freak?

223
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:31,745
Hey!

224
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,245
Where'd he?

225
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,879
OK.

226
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:34,612
You want a fight?

227
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:37,712
You got one.

228
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:39,279
-Ah, how round.

229
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:40,412
How firm.

230
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:41,179
How fully packed.

231
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,012
RANMA: Do you know how
disgusting you are?

232
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:52,379
-My this tea is very fine today.

233
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,945
-It's the best I've had
in at least 10 years.

234
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,779
-And we owe it all to Ranma.

235
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:00,045
-Get off of me I said!

236
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,945
-I've got to admit
the boy's really

237
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:04,279
come through for me this time.

238
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:09,545
I guess I'm not such poor
father after all, eh Tendo?

239
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:14,612
-Wild animals could've raised
me better than you did.

240
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,612
AKANE: More rice please.

241
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:17,645
KESUMI: Here you go.

242
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,945
Would you pass the soy sauce?

243
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:20,945
-I like you so much
better as a girl.

244
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,945
The world is full
of too many boys.

245
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:25,079
Who needs 'em.

246
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,745
-That's my fried egg.

247
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,745
-If you don't change
back soon, things

248
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,212
could get ugly around here.

249
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:35,945
-Look you, tell us what you
came for and then get out.

250
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,079
-Ah what is that?

251
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:38,512
-It's you're
reward, sugar cakes.

252
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:41,245
My heir can't be seen in
some ratty old training bra,

253
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,945
now can she?

254
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:45,645
-Who do you think
you're talking to, huh?

255
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,745
-You mean you don't like it?

256
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:52,112
Do you know how much
that thing cost?

257
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:55,012
The sales girl even
modeled it for me.

258
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:58,112
Akane couldn't even hope
to fill those laces.

259
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,745
-Well aren't you lucky, son.

260
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,279
It appears that the
master has taken

261
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:05,679
a personal interest
in your welfare.

262
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:06,679
-Com one, Ranma.

263
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,479
Don't be such a poor sport.

264
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:10,312
He's perfectly harmless.

265
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:11,745
-Right, you think so.

266
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:13,345
Let's see how
harmless you think he

267
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:15,712
is when he's grabbing
at your chest.

268
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:16,945
[screams]

269
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:18,945
-Ranma, where are you?

270
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,879
You forgot your bra.

271
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,312
-That's it.

272
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,812
Somebody's got to put a stop
to that crazy old freak.

273
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,412
-Ranma!

274
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:29,345
Ranma!

275
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,279
Ni hao, I ran.

276
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:32,745
-I ran.

277
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,279
I ran.

278
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:40,879
-How dare you touch
chest of amazon girl.

279
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,045
Only fiance have
permission to do that.

280
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:48,379
My grandmother!

281
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,045
-Shampoo, you best
leave this one to me.

282
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,645
An old goat like you
chasing after young girls.

283
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,379
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

284
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:01,979
-Whoa, it's the
ghoul of the Amazons

285
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:03,745
versus the freak of
nature in an anything

286
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:04,912
goes fight to the finish.

287
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,179
This I gotta see.

288
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,945
-You get him, great grandmother.

289
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:21,579
-Oh, doesn't that
look sweet on you.

290
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,679
Those super bras are really
something, aren't they?

291
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:27,612
They even make an old crone
like you look like a teenager.

292
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:28,312
Good luck.

293
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:28,879
Good luck.

294
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:37,345
-I tell you that freak
just ain't human.

295
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,579
-He is good.

296
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:45,545
Son-in-law, I would not tangle
with that one if I were you.

297
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:47,645
Come along, Shampoo.

298
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,545
-Bye bye.

299
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:51,245
See you later.

300
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,612
-That old ghoul, she's just
trying to scare me, that's all.

301
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,679
Look you.

302
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:57,712
-Hey there, sexy.

303
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:58,879
Aren't you forgetting something?

304
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:01,579
-Shut up!

305
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:04,779
-Why can't you be reasonable?

306
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:05,945
-Shut up!

307
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:08,379
Now you're really making me mad.

308
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:10,112
-Aha, this a challenge?

309
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:11,745
-Yeah, you got it old man.

310
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:12,379
-I'm waiting.

311
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,045
-Here's the deal, freak.

312
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,479
If you lose, you quit
bothering me, OK?

313
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:22,179
-And if you lose, you give
me a little fashion show.

314
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,145
What do you say?

315
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:23,845
-Come on.

316
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,812
Don't you ever give up?

317
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:28,412
-Hold your horses , sonny boy.

318
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,812
I'll let you know when
it's time for us to fight.

319
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,379
-I'll be looking forward to it.

320
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,312
-So where's the freak?

321
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:47,145
Do you think he got
scared and ran off?

322
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,379
-You sure about this, Ranma?

323
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:50,612
-What?

324
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:52,512
-This is the guy who trained
our fathers, remember?

325
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:56,012
Even Shampoo's great grandma
was no match for him.

326
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:58,845
-I can handle that
old freak, got it?

327
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,379
-Hey what's that?

328
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:01,845
-Stop!

329
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:02,679
Thief!

330
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,579
Somebody catch him!

331
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:05,345
RANMA: It's him!

332
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:08,645
The old freak!

333
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:17,512
What do you think-- Gym shorts?

334
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:37,979
-What's the big idea?

335
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:39,279
You set me up, you freak.

336
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:42,045
-Is that any way for you
to talk to your master.

337
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,345
We had a deal, and
you're not my master.

338
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:47,845
-Let's see.

339
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,779
I don't remember an actual deal.

340
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:52,245
Something about the terms.

341
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,579
-Oh well maybe I can
refresh your memory.

342
00:16:58,545 --> 00:16:59,912
-Ah I remember.

343
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:01,545
You challenged me.

344
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,045
OK, now you've done it.

345
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:10,712
-Come on, Ranma!

346
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,112
Come and get me!

347
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,812
-Fight me like a man,
you little freak.

348
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:16,812
-What's in it for me?

349
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:17,679
-Excuse me?

350
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:19,112
-Is it so unreasonable?

351
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:22,745
All I ask is that you change
into a girl a wear this?

352
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,812
-You give me that!

353
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:26,312
-Ah you're no fun.

354
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,079
-Get back here.

355
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,712
-Catch me if you can, Ranma.

356
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:29,579
-You little, coward.

357
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:38,845
-Wait up, you little--

358
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:40,812
-What do you think you're doing?

359
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:43,412
-Is enjoying a duel so wrong?

360
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,712
-You call this a duel?

361
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:45,579
-It's not my fault.

362
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,045
Don't look at me.

363
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,645
If Ranma would just be
reasonable and put the bra on,

364
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,545
then I'd be--

365
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,979
-Do you have to say it so loud?

366
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:54,879
-Is it really such
a big deal, Ranma?

367
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,745
Why don't you just
give him what he wants?

368
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:57,745
-What?

369
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,245
-After all, it's just a bra.

370
00:17:59,279 --> 00:17:59,879
-See?

371
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,845
What'd I tell ya?

372
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:04,412
-Listen you, I'm
a guy, and I ain't

373
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:07,312
wearing no stupid bra
for you, understand?

374
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:09,512
-Aye, but you're just
afraid you'll lose.

375
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:10,812
-What did you say?

376
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:12,612
-If you're not afraid,
then why not agree?

377
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:18,879
-I'll probably regret
it, but you got a deal.

378
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:28,912
-So do you promise?

379
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:30,512
Cross your heart
and hope to die.

380
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,245
If you trip me, I'll cry.

381
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,979
-Will you just shut up and
fight me, you old freak?

382
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,545
Hey, where'd he go?

383
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:03,679
-Thought I was a goner.

384
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:05,212
Guess I'll have to get serious.

385
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,279
-Yeah right.

386
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,479
Like you haven't been
serious until now.

387
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,012
-Of course not.

388
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:12,479
How much fun would it be without
a little dramatic buildup?

389
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:13,579
-He we appreciate it.

390
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,112
-Oh, you're gonna pay.

391
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:18,245
-Behold, you are about to
witness one of the world's most

392
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,479
powerful forces, the founding
school of the anything

393
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,445
goes martial arts.

394
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,945
-Wow what a battle aura.

395
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:37,312
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
I-- I can't move.

396
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,479
-Something wrong, Ranma?

397
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,712
AKANE (VOICEOVER): He's
frozen like a deer caught

398
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:45,545
in the headlights
of an incoming car.

399
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,145
-Ranma, you can do it!

400
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,245
-Do you want it over or under
your clothes, my pretty?

401
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,012
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I would
rather die than wear that.

402
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:13,712
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I can't
get through his defense

403
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,179
with the chestnut fist.

404
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:17,045
GRANDMA (VOICEOVER):
Son-in-law, I would not

405
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,045
tangle with that
one if I were you.

406
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,745
-Despite my impressive
battle aura attack,

407
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,479
you're still ready to fight, eh?

408
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:30,645
Maybe you're worthy of
fighting me after all.

409
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,279
Ranma!

410
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:33,245
Prepare yourself!

411
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:46,812
-One, two, one, two, one,
two, one, two, one, two, one,

412
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,012
two, one, two.

413
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:52,379
-He-- he disappeared.

414
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:52,912
-Ranma!

415
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:55,279
Are you OK?

416
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:59,145
-Well he's not your
average dirty old man.

417
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,045
-But why did he
run off like that?

418
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,845
I thought you wanted to see
you in that bra so badly.

419
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,279
I don't understand it.

420
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:08,379
-Like I said, he ain't your
ordinary dirty old man.

421
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:13,612
[screams]

422
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:15,112
-Get off me you-- you pervert.

423
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:17,312
-Hey, I threw a challenge
match to follow you in here.

424
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:19,745
The least you could do is
show me a little gratitude.

425
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,345
Now come one girls.

426
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:25,912
-He's an extraordinary
dirty old man.

427
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:27,345
-He's something else all right.

428
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:49,243
[theme music]

429
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:11,676
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Oh gross, Ranma.

430
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,343
I thought only your
body was perverted.

431
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:15,009
You mean your mind is sick too?

432
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,576
What do you mean there's spring
of drown man beneath locker

433
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,109
room?

434
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:21,476
Next time on Ranma 1/2, assault
on the girls locker room.

435
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,711
See you there.
