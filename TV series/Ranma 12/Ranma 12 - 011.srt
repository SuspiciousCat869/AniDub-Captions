from Furinkan High.

I'm so looking

I'm certain you'll
master it soon.

166
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,420
-D-- do you really think so?

167
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,253
-Aw, man.

168
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:33,753
He's lying through his teeth.

169
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:34,586
-Shut up, Ranma.

170
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,186
Only one more week until
the Martial Arts Rhythmic

171
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Gymnastics Tournament.

172
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,653
I should never have
volunteered for this.

173
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:54,020
-You know, she's so
hopeless, it hurts to watch.

174
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,086
I guess you're pretty
proud of yourself, huh?

175
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,486
You're not helping.

176
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,486
I wouldn't keep buttering her
up so much if I was you, Ryoga.

177
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,853
-Hmph.

178
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:15,886
Male jealousy is a pitiful
thing to see, Ranma.

179
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,420
-What?

180
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,253
J-- jealous?

181
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:19,320
Who's jealous of-- huh?

182
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,586
Oh no, you don't.

183
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,320
Think you're going to sleep
in Akane's bed again, do you?

184
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,753
-Oh.

185
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:50,553
I could sleep for a week.

186
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:00,620
Oh.

187
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:01,120
Huh?

188
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,720
-Akane Tendo, prepare to die!

189
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,520
-Who are you?

190
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:23,053
-I'm from the St. Hebereke
rhythmic gymnastics

191
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:24,220
team, of course.

192
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,353
I'm Kodachi, the Black Rose.

193
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:28,520
-Kodachi who?

194
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:31,420
-There's only one
more week before we

195
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:32,886
face each other
in the gymnastics

196
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,320
tournament next week.

197
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:36,520
So let's both fight fair, OK?

198
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:40,786
-Fair?

199
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,020
Compared to what?

200
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,686
I didn't ask you to
sneak into my room.

201
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:50,486
And I never asked you to
attack me in the dark.

202
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,120
-In the dark?

203
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:54,820
Utterly ridiculous.

204
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:58,220
I came merely to size up my
opponent before the big match

205
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:58,986
next week.

206
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,820
That's all.

207
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:02,453
-Don't you give me that.

208
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,386
-You're finished, dear.

209
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:17,453
Die!

210
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,120
-Come here, you little runt.

211
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:21,020
Get-- Come here.

212
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:25,253
Get back-- Come-- come here.

213
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:25,786
Hey!

214
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,686
Get off.

215
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:35,753
-Hey, wait a minute, you guys.

216
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:38,586
Ranma, leave him alone.

217
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,086
Hiya!

218
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,386
-So you really do
have some skill.

219
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:58,053
I shall return.

220
00:14:58,086 --> 00:14:59,020
-What?

221
00:14:59,053 --> 00:14:59,520
Rose petals?

222
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:12,420
And who's going to clean
up the mess you made, huh?

223
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,820
You wait, Black Rose.

224
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,953
Next week at the match,
I'll give you the same.

225
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,886
KODACHI (VOICEOVER): Just
you wait, Miss Tendo.

226
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,586
This time next week, you'll
be begging me for mercy.

227
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:40,353
A pig?

228
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,286
RANMA: Come here, Ryoga!

229
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:49,853
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

230
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:52,186
It felt like the kettle
just smacked into something.

231
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,653
Whoa!

232
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,453
Are-- are you OK?

233
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:26,153
KODACHI (VOICEOVER): What a man.

234
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,353
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Uh oh.

235
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,453
It's what's her face--
Black Petunia or whatever.

236
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,420
-Ah, I--

237
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:40,420
-Huh?

238
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:41,386
-Hold me.

239
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,620
-Um, hey.

240
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:44,720
What's going on here?

241
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,786
I mean, uh-- oh man.

242
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,653
-Honestly, I don't believe him.

243
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:55,886
Here I am, being attacked
by some crazy girl,

244
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,986
and all he cares about
is chasing after P-Chan

245
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,486
so he can pick on him some more.

246
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,420
That's it.

247
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,986
It's over.

248
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,553
Huh?

249
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,986
Oh, no.

250
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,586
-Well, since you're not hurt,
guess I'll be taking off.

251
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,453
I'll see you around maybe, OK?

252
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:12,986
Bye bye.

253
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,886
-Oh!

254
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,253
Oh, my head.

255
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:18,653
The blow, it-- it was more
dreadful than I thought.

256
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,120
KODACHI (VOICEOVER):
And here I was

257
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:22,886
beginning to think I'd
never meet any eligible men.

258
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,886
Guess an all-girls school
was the wrong place

259
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,453
to look for Mr. Right.

260
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:29,220
And now that I've met him--

261
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:33,120
-I'll, uh-- I'll go get you
some aspirin or something.

262
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:33,620
Oh!

263
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:40,120
-Don't go.

264
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:41,486
[creak]

265
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,886
-Huh?

266
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,453
An earthquake?

267
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,453
-How could I have known that
when I came here tonight,

268
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,553
I'd meet the man of my dreams.

269
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:57,053
Your name, kind sir.

270
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:57,886
-Hm?

271
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,986
Ranma, Ranma Saotome.

272
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,153
-Ran-- ma Saotome.

273
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:07,720
Dearest Ranma, take these.

274
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,220
-Huh?

275
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:19,453
-I put a bit of paralysis
powder into the flowers.

276
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,086
-What'd you do that for?

277
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,920
I never did anything to--

278
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:25,753
-Now, my darling.

279
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:28,920
Be brave and take that
which you most desire.

280
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:33,853
Seize these ruby lips of mine.

281
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,886
I-- I mustn't.

282
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,953
This one sweet kiss puts an
end to my colorless school girl

283
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,053
life.

284
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,853
But before I close that
chapter of my life--

285
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:53,820
[grunting]

286
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:18,086
Ranma, darling, thank
you for waiting.

287
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,220
-I'm not waiting.

288
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:22,486
I'm paralyzed.

289
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,853
-And now, my darling.

290
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:26,353
make me your own.

291
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:32,853
-Akane.

292
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:40,820
-Right over my
bedroom of all places.

293
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,820
-How unsporting of you.

294
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:47,820
-I wouldn't talk if I were
you, you-- you-- you cheater!

295
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,420
-Hm.

296
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:53,153
I know when I'm not wanted.

297
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:56,553
Ranma darling, I'll
make this up to you.

298
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:58,753
Farewell, my sweetums.

299
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,153
Until we meet again.

300
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:02,420
[maniacal laughter]

301
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,586
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Honestly.

302
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,920
Looks like the party's
over for tonight.

303
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,453
Good night.

304
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:18,420
-W-- wait.

305
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:26,853
KODACHI (VOICEOVER):
Yes, darling, yes.

306
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,853
Draw the sweet nectar
from these honeyed lips.

307
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:44,753
-Now she's done it.

308
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,686
I don't care what I
have to do to beat her.

309
00:20:57,186 --> 00:21:00,153
[snoring]

310
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,553
[dog barking]

311
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,501
-Somebody help me!

312
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:06,367
--La la.

313
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:11,849
[theme music]

314
00:23:38,716 --> 00:23:40,816
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Even
though I kept telling myself

315
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:43,816
I won't lose, I messed
up and hurt myself.

316
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:45,983
So now he has to
fight in my place.

317
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:48,249
Ranma, you better not lose.

318
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:51,983
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
"A Woman's Love is War.

319
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,816
The Martial Arts Rhythmic
Gymnastic Challenge!"

320
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:56,949
See you there.
