[theme music]

2
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,454
Hey, Ranma.

3
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:10,221
Let's go watch the
girls' volleyball game.

4
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:11,654
Think I'll pass.

5
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:13,121
Akane's out there playing.

6
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:16,054
Well, if she's playing, our
team will win hands down.

7
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:19,087
What's the point in watching
when the sides are so uneven.

8
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:22,387
Don't you wanna see Akane
in those hot gym shorts?

9
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:24,321
Not really.

10
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:26,721
This is terrible.

11
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:28,721
We're losing the big game.

12
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,287
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Bring It On.

13
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,954
Love as a Cheerleader, Part 1.

14
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,821
What the heck's going on here?

15
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:57,021
Akane's the only one on
our team left standing.

16
00:02:57,054 --> 00:03:00,021
Is the Seishun High
team really that good?

17
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,687
As for their volleyball
team, they're pretty average.

18
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:23,654
That was very impressive.

19
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,187
Nice dodge, girly.

20
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,587
Who rocks the house?

21
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,421
I say Seishun rocks the house.

22
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:30,287
And when Seishun
rocks the house,

23
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:31,754
they rock it right
to the ground!

24
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:37,687
S-E-I-S-H-U-N. S-E-I-S-H-U-N.
One, two, three, four--

25
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,254
we're declaring volleyball war.

26
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:42,887
S-E-I-- huh?

27
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:43,621
She's cute.

28
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:44,821
Yeah, she's hot.

29
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:46,387
You should be
rooting for our team.

30
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,721
You said it.

31
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:49,221
That one cheerleader's
baton has practically

32
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:52,054
knocked out all our players.

33
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,987
Let's go Seishun.

34
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:54,954
Go, go, Seishun!

35
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,554
What do you think you're doing?

36
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:03,787
Explain yourself!

37
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:04,262
Who?

38
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:05,428
Me?

39
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:08,428
C-H-E-E-R.

40
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:10,995
C-H--

41
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:13,528
Cheerleading!

42
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,862
By the way, I noticed
your gym shirt.

43
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:19,028
It spells out F-U-R-I-N,
meaning floozy.

44
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:20,828
Girls in high school
shouldn't walk around

45
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,728
with things like
that on their shirts,

46
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,228
no matter what their
lifestyle choices are--

47
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:25,995
Hmm?

48
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,762
Flooz-- Furin!

49
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,128
As in Furinkan High!

50
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:31,495
How dare you insult
my high school name!

51
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:33,195
If you call yourself
a cheerleader,

52
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,962
why don't you just
stick to cheerleading.

53
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,428
You twinkies are
kidding yourself

54
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:38,895
if you think these mind
games are gonna psych us out.

55
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:39,728
Oh yeah?

56
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,828
Well, let's just see about that.

57
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,362
CHEERLEADERS: Give me an E. E!

58
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,695
Give me an I. I!

59
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:47,228
Give me an S. S!

60
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,962
Give me an H. H!

61
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:51,728
Give me a U. U!

62
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,128
You're a cheater.

63
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,695
Sports are supposed to be
played fair and square,

64
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,562
not by knocking
the other team out.

65
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:58,428
In that case, maybe
you better stop talking

66
00:04:58,462 --> 00:04:59,695
and get back to the court.

67
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,362
REFEREE: Game and set.

68
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:06,962
Seishun wins.

69
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:07,444
Yay!

70
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:12,295
Seishun rocks.

71
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,695
We're the best.

72
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,295
We will put you to the test!

73
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,662
Seishun rocks.

74
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:17,695
Go Seishun!

75
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:18,995
Hey, look at that cheerleader.

76
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,362
Doesn't she look kind
of familiar to you?

77
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:22,395
Yeah, that's Mariko
Konjo, isn't it?

78
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:26,862
So that's what that cute
little hottie's name is, huh?

79
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,062
She's considered the
goddess of Seishun High.

80
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,928
They win every single
game she cheers for.

81
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:35,495
I heard somewhere they're
called the Martial Arts

82
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:36,528
Cheerleading Team.

83
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:37,695
Martial Arts Cheerleading Team?

84
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,428
Over here, Mariko.

85
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:40,428
I'm so famous.

86
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:48,377
Hm?

87
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,462
I can't believe we lost.

88
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:58,462
Don't cry, Akane.

89
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:00,495
You played great.

90
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,362
Yeah, you have
nothing to cry about.

91
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,195
But it's so unfair!

92
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,595
Come on, Ranma.

93
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,328
Can't you do something to
try and cheer Akane up?

94
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:10,862
March right over there,
and take her in your arms,

95
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:12,628
and tell her there, there.

96
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:13,828
I'm here for you.

97
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:17,362
Yeah, like that's
ever gonna happen!

98
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:19,528
There, there, Akane Tendo.

99
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,395
Kuno's here for you, girl.

100
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:22,395
Tell it to the foot!

101
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:26,362
Man, what a jerk.

102
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,862
Ranma?

103
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:28,562
Come on.

104
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:29,162
That's enough crying.

105
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,695
I wonder what's the
matter with Mariko.

106
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,762
You'd think she'd
be happy that we won.

107
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:48,495
Hmm.

108
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:51,695
Feels like something's missing.

109
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:52,895
It figures.

110
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:55,328
Mariko's always
depressed after we win.

111
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:56,828
Why's that?

112
00:06:56,862 --> 00:07:02,128
Seishun cheerleaders, our
victory is my own F-A-T-E--

113
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,228
my fate.

114
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:10,228
But girls, I still feel there's
something missing from my life.

115
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,928
That's L-O-V-E-- love.

116
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:14,695
A life without love
is like a cheerleader

117
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,095
with half a pom-pom.

118
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:23,795
Oh, Mariko!

119
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:25,928
Ugh.

120
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:26,495
Uh-oh.

121
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:28,728
That'll hurt.

122
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,328
Here you are.

123
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:34,228
Please, forgive my intrusion and
good luck with your welt. Beg

124
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:36,362
your pardon.

125
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:38,462
No, wait!

126
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,128
Won't you tell me who you are?

127
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:45,062
Tatewake Kuno, the captain
of the Furinkan Kendo Team,

128
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:45,962
age 17.

129
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:52,195
MARIKO (VOICEOVER)::
K-U-N-O-- Kuno.

130
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:55,895
It's the first time any boy
has ever been this nice to me.

131
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:04,662
F-I-R-S-T L-O-V-E-- first love.

132
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:13,328
Man, a makeup test in
the morning really blows.

133
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,095
Things just get better.

134
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:26,128
How I've longed for
you, my pigtailed girl.

135
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:30,328
It's too early in the
morning for your bull, doofus.

136
00:08:30,362 --> 00:08:32,695
Please, I need
to speak with you.

137
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,895
One, two, one, two, one, two.

138
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,628
Next week, we will be
having a kendo tournament

139
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:39,695
at Furinkan High School.

140
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,995
Am I supposed to care?

141
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:44,128
Of course I can count on
you cheer for me, right,

142
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:45,362
my pigtailed girl?

143
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:48,128
Yeah.

144
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,428
Huh?

145
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:52,095
Who are you?

146
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:54,095
I'll T-E-LL you.

147
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:59,028
I'm Kuno's personal cheerleader,
and the name is M-A-R-I-K-O--

148
00:08:59,062 --> 00:08:59,728
Mariko.

149
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:01,495
Got a problem with that?

150
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:03,662
Wow, cheerleaders!

151
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:04,428
Kendo Team!

152
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:11,528
RANMA (VOICEOVER): She's the one
that made Akane cry yesterday.

153
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:15,395
What's the deal
with you and Kuno?

154
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:16,528
We're lovers.

155
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:19,428
I don't think so.

156
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,128
What happened to you, Kuno?

157
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,495
Just a love tap.

158
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,495
So if I were to
cheer for Kuno, then

159
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:26,962
what would you do about it?

160
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:30,328
If so, then you and I
would become enemies.

161
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,528
Suits me fine.

162
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:33,362
Oh, Kuno?

163
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:33,928
When's the match?

164
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:49,862
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y.
Mean V-I-C-T-O-R-Y--

165
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:51,795
that's V for victory.

166
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:57,495
My, wonderful.

167
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,162
Think you can
outdo me with that?

168
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:01,028
I know I can beat you.

169
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,495
I guarantee it.

170
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:04,462
Ranma?

171
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:06,362
So what'll it be, huh?

172
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:07,395
What else?

173
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:09,928
Martial arts cheerleading, OK?

174
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:10,762
Fine.

175
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:12,495
See you a little later, Kuno.

176
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,262
Wish me luck.

177
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:16,595
Good luck then.

178
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,528
Wait for us, Mariko!

179
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,495
M-A-R-I-K-O-- Mariko!

180
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:23,162
I'm so happy, my
pigtailed girl,

181
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:26,662
you'll be cheering for my
victory at the upcoming--

182
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:29,862
W-R-O-N-G-- wrong.

183
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,162
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma's
challenged Mariko Konjo?

184
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,537
MAN: I heard the pigtailed girl
is going up against the Seishun

185
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,370
cheerleader.

186
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:52,237
What?

187
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,004
A cheerleader competition?

188
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:56,270
Cheerleader competition?

189
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:57,804
Cheerleader competition?

190
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,204
Cheerleader competition?

191
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:01,437
Cheerleader competition?

192
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:08,970
Cheerleader competition?

193
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,770
Cheerleaders?

194
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,437
Cheerleaders?

195
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,037
Yes.

196
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,704
One, two, three, four.

197
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:29,537
Pigtailed girl!

198
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,204
The pom-poms of my heart
quiver with excitement

199
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:33,970
that you should
practice so hard for me.

200
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,604
Nice shot.

201
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:39,904
Great baton attack.

202
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:41,770
All in a day's work, friends.

203
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:43,004
OK, Kuno.

204
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:46,004
Up on your feet!

205
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,870
K-U-N-O-- Kuno!

206
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:52,404
The stars are lovely.

207
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:53,837
MARIKO: Kuno, snap to!

208
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,304
Hello, who are you?

209
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:56,904
I'm Mariko Konjo.

210
00:11:56,937 --> 00:12:00,170
I'm a sophomore and a captain of
the Seishun Cheerleading Team.

211
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,104
You must remember who I am.

212
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:04,004
It's coming back to me now.

213
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,237
I'm so glad, Kuno.

214
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,304
Get a life.

215
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:09,937
You don't stand a
chance against me.

216
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:20,104
Cheering is L-O-V-E.
If you care for someone,

217
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:23,337
a smile is all you
need to cheer them on.

218
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,837
Are you saying my cheerleading
is all style and no love?

219
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,737
That's right.

220
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,104
Finally, you've got it.

221
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:31,670
I'll do anything you
tell me to, Kuno.

222
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:39,970
Kuno.

223
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:41,870
Do what you will with me.

224
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:42,670
Oh man.

225
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:43,737
Lucky guy.

226
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,970
What's he got over us?

227
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:46,704
I'm not gonna take this.

228
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:49,204
I'll teach him a lesson.

229
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:52,204
Would you seriously do
anything for me, Mariko?

230
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:52,870
Yes, I would.

231
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:58,237
Then close your eyes.

232
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,837
[heart beating]

233
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,437
Uhh, Kuno, baby?

234
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,919
Huh?

235
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,370
[humming]

236
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:50,952
Hmm?

237
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:57,237
Oh, Kuno, you big silly.

238
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,770
Just kidding!

239
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,637
He wrote all over her face
and she didn't even get angry.

240
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,637
[grumbling]

241
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,304
I'm truly impressed.

242
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:10,870
And now the kiss.

243
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:40,104
Don't worry, Kuno.

244
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:40,704
Watch this!

245
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,004
L-O-V-E-- I love you, Kuno!

246
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,004
Let's go, Kuno.

247
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:57,004
Let's go.

248
00:14:57,037 --> 00:14:58,270
She's strong.

249
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:01,870
She took out all the
school sports teams.

250
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:03,170
Sure, I did.

251
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:04,604
The Seishun Martial
Arts Cheerleading Team

252
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,870
does what's necessary
to support our side.

253
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:09,804
Let me explain.

254
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:13,204
We root for our team
like this and like this.

255
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,537
Our martial arts cheerleading
Team is the best there is.

256
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,437
RANMA (VOICEOVER): She won't
get away with this, not

257
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,770
after what she did to Akane.

258
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:30,170
Ranmaa, don't compete with
Mariko, I'm begging you.

259
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:32,404
Just power isn't enough.

260
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,770
In order to beat the Martial
Arts Cheerleading Team,

261
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:38,137
you need to prove your skills
by undergoing a horrible test!

262
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,670
What do you mean "test?"

263
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:41,604
There.

264
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:44,504
Take a look at Kuno.

265
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:47,270
I truly feel encouraged
by her cheers.

266
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:50,504
K-U-N-O-- Kuno!

267
00:15:50,537 --> 00:15:56,404
Mariko, I've come to see how
deep your love runs for me.

268
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:59,170
Is it my imagination or is
he getting more competent?

269
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:02,537
I think Mariko's cheering
is doing it to him.

270
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,470
Yeah, right.

271
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,237
Go, go, Kuno.

272
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,537
That's it, girl.

273
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,470
Keep it coming.

274
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,270
Why you presumptuous little--

275
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,604
Well, there goes
his confidence.

276
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:24,504
'Cause nobody's
cheering for him.

277
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:25,904
Cheer up, Kuno.

278
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:27,504
Go get 'em, Kuno.

279
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:30,304
Yes, I'm back!

280
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:33,304
His confidence is back.

281
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,270
If you wanna beat
me, you'll have

282
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:38,070
to prove that you care
for Kuno more than I do.

283
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:39,937
Oh, Kuno, I love you.

284
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,704
Oh yeah.

285
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:41,837
Who's the man?

286
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,804
Who's the man?

287
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,404
Oh no!

288
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,337
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
The only way to beat

289
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,570
Mariko is to prove I care
for Kuno more than her.

290
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:56,804
Right.

291
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:58,704
That must be the nasty test
Akane was talking about.

292
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,704
Can I muster up the strength
somehow to love Kuno?

293
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:10,004
Oh, Kuno, wait for me!

294
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:12,537
Oh, my pigtailed girl.

295
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,019
Kuno?

296
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,737
Pigtailed girl.

297
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,037
No, I can't do it.

298
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,637
Imagining it was
more than enough.

299
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,237
Ranma.

300
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:33,137
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Must be strong.

301
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,770
Must have guts.

302
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:38,104
She's getting up.

303
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:40,904
OK, I'll prove that I
love him more than you.

304
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,237
But be warned.

305
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,370
I've never lost a single
fight in my entire life.

306
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:47,537
And I don't plan
to lose this one.

307
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,604
Even better.

308
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:50,837
Don't forget to bring
your crying towel.

309
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,004
Say what?

310
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,737
You heard.

311
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,504
I'm so loved.

312
00:17:55,537 --> 00:17:57,837
The winner gets Kuno's
love, and the loser

313
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,337
ends up with nothing.

314
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,537
That's way too harsh.

315
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,370
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Ranma, what
are you getting yourself into?

316
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,870
This is crazy.

317
00:18:18,904 --> 00:18:20,704
Tell Mariko you're backing out.

318
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:21,970
Cork it.

319
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:24,370
You don't stand a
chance against her.

320
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,037
There's less than a week left
to get ready before Kuno's kendo

321
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,170
match, you know?

322
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:32,104
How do you expect to
fall deeply in love

323
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:35,470
with Kuno in such a short time?

324
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:36,437
Hmph.

325
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,137
You don't need time
to fall in love.

326
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,637
Ranma?

327
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,337
Huh?

328
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,837
Ranma, how dare you turn your
back on my lovely daughter

329
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,304
here and give yourself to
another man, of all things.

330
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:53,837
Can you leave us
alone for once?

331
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,837
Here.

332
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,437
But Akane!

333
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:02,604
Hmph.

334
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:09,537
Ranma, what are
you planning to do?

335
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,137
I'm not really sure, but I
don't want you to question me

336
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,070
on this one, Akane.

337
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:20,937
I can't afford to lose this
competition with Mariko Konjo.

338
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,270
This is crazy.

339
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,304
So what if you win?

340
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:25,004
Why is this so important to you?

341
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:25,904
Huh?

342
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:27,304
You moron!

343
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:31,070
Who do you think I went
into this competition for?

344
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:36,104
You mean it's for me?

345
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:37,837
You're doing all this for me?

346
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,004
You would go that
far for me, Ranma?

347
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:47,470
Well, it's nothing like that.

348
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:48,837
Huh?

349
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,070
In the name of the Anything
Goes School of Martial Arts--

350
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:55,470
What's going on?

351
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,970
I'll prove I can love
Kuno with the best of them.

352
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:58,970
And you'll see.

353
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:01,104
I'll win this competition.

354
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,637
Give him all your love, Ranma.

355
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,504
Oh my.

356
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,637
I'll beat him.

357
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,104
I'll bust him, 'cause
that's Ranma's custom.

358
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:10,404
Go Ranma!

359
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:12,670
That's what I wanted
to hear, pigtailed girl.

360
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:15,204
Good luck, my little
pigtailed girl.

361
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:21,770
I love you!

362
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,204
Man, that guy gives
me the heebie-jeebies.

363
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:28,370
Ranma.

364
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:41,770
G-O-O-D-N-I-G-H-T-- good
night, my sweet Kuno.

365
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:46,837
No one will ever love
you more than I do.

366
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,337
Ranma.

367
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:46,859
[theme music]

368
00:23:16,336 --> 00:23:18,070
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Oh, Ranma, please stop

369
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:19,936
trying to love Kuno.

370
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,203
That's It.

371
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:23,236
If you have to love
someone, why not me?

372
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,170
Next time on "Ranma
1/2," Bring It On.

373
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:27,770
Love as Cheerleader Part 2.

374
00:23:27,803 --> 00:23:29,136
We'll see you there.
