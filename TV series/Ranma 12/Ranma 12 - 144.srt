Gyoko!

00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:59,315
Huh?

13
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:27,082
I had that same
nightmare again.

14
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:29,248
I can't take this much longer.

15
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,315
Oh, man.

16
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:34,182
This is starting
to freak me out.

17
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:34,748
Huh?

18
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,682

[groan]

20
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:51,382
You look totally
wiped out, Ranma.

21
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:53,882
Didn't you have a
good sleep last night?

22
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:55,815
No, not really.

23
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:56,782
[yawn]

24
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:01,948
TEACHER: And in this
manner, the event

25
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:05,248
affected the development of
our country, which had just

26
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:06,915
employed its new system.

27
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:10,982
Now if you'll turn to the
diagram at the top of page 63,

28
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:13,615
you'll see some of the
developments and innovations

29
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,982
which transformed
Japan in this era.

30
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:17,748
One-- gas light bulbs.

31
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,748
Two-- trains for public
transportation and cargo

32
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:21,448
shipment.

33
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:22,315
Three-- the telegraph.

34
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:23,582
Four--

35
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:24,815
(VOICEOVER) Wonder
what Ranma's problem is.

36
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,348
I guess I'll ask
him after school.

37
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,982
TEACHER: Is everybody
following this?

38
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:32,315
AKANE: So this is
the new ice cream

39
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:34,482
place I keep hearing about.

40
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,382
You sure know all the hot
spots, don't you, Ranma?

41
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:39,715
Yeah, well, gotta do
what it takes to get

42
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:42,448
my fill of fruit sundaes.

43
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:44,482
But eating these girly
things is embarrassing.

44
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,915
That's why I can't be
seen here as a guy.

45
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:47,682
[snore]

46
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:48,315
Hey!

47
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:49,382
Wake up, will you?

48
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:50,182
Huh?

49
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:50,948
Uh oh.

50
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,348
I did it again.

51
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:53,882
I almost had a dream that time.

52
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:56,315
You've been acting really
weird this last little while.

53
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:59,748
If you're that tired, then just
stop fighting it and sleep.

54
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,082
Mhm.

55
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,315
Today you stayed awake during
that whole boring Japanese

56
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,048
history class, am I right?

57
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:08,148
You've never managed
to stay awake before.

58
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,515
Wait.

59
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,948
Did that sound like a
camera going off just now?

60
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:13,215
I don't know.

61
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:14,448
Creepy.

62
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:18,048
I get the feeling
we're being watched.

63
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,415
Whatever.

64
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:20,148
Hey, Akane?

65
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:21,148
What is it?

66
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:22,682
Are you going to eat that?

67
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:23,882
Listen.

68
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:27,082
Listen to what?

69
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:29,315
Nighttime again.

70
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:30,882
Oh.

71
00:04:30,915 --> 00:04:32,248
[snoring]

72
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:40,848
I can't take this much longer.

HARUMAKI: (VOICEOVER) Her
name is pronounced Gyoko, not

78
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:07,182
Gyoza as in the potstickers.

79
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:18,982
Gyoko!

80
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:19,948
[gasp]

81
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:25,882
GYOKO: Harumaki.

82
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:31,882
Look, Gyoko.

83
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,648
The cherry blossoms
are in full bloom.

84
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:35,782
I know.

85
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,882
It's as if the blossoms
are falling all around

86
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,882
to bless our love.

87
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:43,615
Do you remember the promise
we made to each other?

88
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:45,948
Harumaki, of course I remember.

89
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:51,115
If only the beautiful flowers
had been blooming then, too.

90
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:52,948
If only they had.

91
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:55,248
If only they had.

92
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:58,182
Then, Harumaki--

93
00:05:58,215 --> 00:05:58,782
Gyoko.

94
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:07,848

[grunt]

102
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:44,148
You have the same
nightmare every night?

103
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,115
Yeah.

104
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:46,348
And it's getting old fast.

105
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:47,682
So what's it about?

106
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:48,815
Tell me.

107
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:50,782
It's so gross, I don't
even want to tell you.

108
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:54,215
Just thinking about it--
I think I'm going to hurl.

109
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,015
Ranma.

110
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:55,882

BOY: Uh, excuse me, miss.

113
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:06,348
Uh?

114
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,282
Tell me, do you have
a dream every night

115
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:09,948
about the old man in this photo?

116
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:10,815
[gasp]

117
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:15,648
(VOICEOVER) This is him.

118
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,348
I take it from
your reaction then

119
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,948
that you do dream about him.

120
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:20,048
[gasp]

121
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:21,748
That means I found you
in the nick of time.

122
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:24,115
Would you come
with me for a date?

123
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:25,715
[groan]

124
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:28,182
What makes you think I'd date
a person I've never even seen

125
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:28,982
before?

126
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,382
My apologies.

127
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,815
It's not me I want you to date.

128
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:35,115
Why don't you just tell
us what this is all about?

129
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:40,882
[beeping]

130
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:43,815
[heavy breathing]

131
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:46,582
[gasp]

132
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:48,548
The old man in my dream.

133
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,282
This is my grandfather.

134
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:51,815
And I am his wife.

135
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,615
I'm the doctor.

136
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,415
And I fit into
this picture how?

137
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,048
Time will tell
whether he'll make it

138
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,315
through the next few days.

139
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:01,248
Darling!

140
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,182
Oh, Grandpa.

141
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,515
[crying]

142
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:05,048
Oh, the poor man.

143
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,015
Yeah, I guess.

144
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:09,848
[gasp]

145
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:15,815
Gyoko, my love!

146
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:16,715
[scream]

147
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:19,082
A ghost!

148
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:22,948
Gyoko, how I've longed
for you these many years.

149
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,148
He's-- he's a ghost!

150
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:26,882
It's not as bad as it looks.

151
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,248
He's just doing a little
bit of soul travelling.

152
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:30,515
Soul travelling?

153
00:08:30,548 --> 00:08:33,382
How I've longed for
your sweet embrace.

154
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:35,282
Allow me to explain it.

155
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,715
[clearing throat]

156
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:39,082
Soul travel is when the
soul of a living human being

157
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:43,782
separates from the body and
travels independently of it.

158
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,748
Ah.

159
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:45,548
Wow.

160
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:47,515
So it's not a ghost at all.

161
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:49,682
This is no time for applause.

162
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:52,348
Oh, my precious Gyoko, darling.

163
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:53,682
Get away from me!

164
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:56,648
You're playing coy
with me, sweet Gyoko.

165
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,415
I'm not your Gyoko!

166
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:03,382
Do something about
this freaky old guy!

167
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:04,348
No!

168
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:05,682
Not that!

169
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:08,115
Maybe my grandfather's
diary will help you out.

170
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:08,882
No!

171
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,382
That's private!

172
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:12,415
Let me see.

173
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,915
Don't read that!

174
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:15,248
It's private!

175
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:17,615
Leave a man's privates alone!

176
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,248
Oh, shut up!

177
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:22,148
[groan]

178
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:25,315
"I first glimpsed
her lovely visage

179
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:26,948
in front of the hospital.

180
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:32,482
She looks remarkably similar
to Gyoko, my first love.

181
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:34,315
She went into the
ice cream parlor

182
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,248
in front of the hospital.

183
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:39,582
She seems to love sundaes.

184
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:43,348
The next day, she went into the
ice cream parlor once again.

185
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,148
She must have a fast metabolism.

186
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:47,015
She's so slim and pretty.

187
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:49,448
That sweet smile of
hers-- how it brings

188
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,948
to mind my precious Gyoko"?

189
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:52,915
Mm.

190
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:56,182
Now smile at the birdie.

191
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:57,182
[groan]

192
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:58,148
You're just a soul!

193
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,815
How can you use a camera?

194
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:01,548
[groan]

195
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:03,948
Calm down now, Ranma.

196
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:06,082
You'd better keep
reading the diary.

197
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,315
Old coot.

198
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:14,148
"Ah, my darling, my final wish
is to have a date with you."

199
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:14,915
What?

200
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,115
A date with me?

201
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,815
Won't you please honor the
last wish of a dying man

202
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:20,882
and go on a date
with my grandfather?

203
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:23,082
I beg of you.

204
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:24,548
[crying]

205
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,848
Did they mention that
you'll keep dreaming about me

206
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:27,682
if you say no?

207
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:29,248
Why don't you just go, Ranma?

208
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:30,382
It's only one date.

209
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:31,215
That's right.

210
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,415
One date.

211
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,048
I hear you, but--

212
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:35,715
Don't worry about me.

213
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,648
Just go and have an enjoyable
time with my poor husband.

214
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:41,082
Oh, please, you've
got to help us.

215
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:42,148
I don't know about this.

216
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:48,648
All right already!

217
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,748
But I'm going on one
date, and that's it!

218
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,482
Dealing with spirits is
a martial artist's duty.

219
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:55,915
Enough with this soul business.

220
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,315
Now how about
calling me Harumaki?

221
00:10:58,348 --> 00:10:59,415
Everything's working out.

222
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:00,815
Isn't that nice, Grandma?

223
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,515
It's more than I
could have hoped for.

224
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:05,215
I've got a hot date!

225
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,248
Hot date with a redhead!

226
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:09,815
[animal sounds]

227
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,877
[animal sounds]

228
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,812
Wait, Gyoko!

229
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:24,512
Wait up, darling.

230
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:25,379
What's the hurry?

231
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,179
Can't we slow down a little?

232
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,712
I always walk fast,
so try to keep up.

233
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:30,846
Now lose the wrist thing.

234
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,146
You look like a freaky ghost.

235
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:34,346
Oh, these wrists have
a mind of their own.

236
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:36,179
I just don't know what
to do with them when

237
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:39,379
I'm floating around in
the air doing soul travel.

238
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:40,446
[laughter]

239
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,212
Oh, what an
amusing conversation

240
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:45,412
we're having, considering
this is our first date.

241
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,879
Isn't this nice, Gyoko, dear?

242
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:48,646
No.

243
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,912
[chatter]

244
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,212
What a relief.

245
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:53,379
It looks like they're
having a good time.

246
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,346
[groan]

247
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,946
Hands off, buddy.

248
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:58,079
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:58,112 --> 00:11:59,646
Please forgive me.

250
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,246
I just got caught up in the
mood watching those two lovers.

251
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,446
What do you mean
by those two lovers?

252
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,246
[music playing]

253
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,779
Here you go.

254
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:16,846
Ah, well, I guess it's true.

255
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,612
Love isn't just
for young people.

256
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:25,646
You might be an old man, but you
still think about your old love

257
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,646
from--

258
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,246
[slurping]

259
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:29,612
[scream]

260
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,112
[scream]

261
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:36,612
[laughter]

262
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:39,512
Ow!

263
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:40,346
You idiot!

264
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:42,912
Why can't you control yourself?

265
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:43,779
Here's another!

266
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:45,412
Maybe that'll help!

267
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:47,546
Well, this date
is something, but I

268
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,312
must admit I can't help feeling
like somehow I'm forgetting

269
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:54,179
an important promise I made.

270
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:56,079
What important promise?

271
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:57,912
Grandpa seems to be
having second thoughts

272
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:58,879
about this whole thing.

273
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,912
Is that you, Akane?

274
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,746
Now what was it?

275
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,346
Uh, hm, let's see.

276
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,712
Uh.

277
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,312
[laughter]

278
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:12,579
Ow!

279
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:15,612
Time for the soul train to
hit its final destination.

280
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:18,646
My poor old grandfather.

281
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,412
Hm?

282
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,812
Wait a sec.

283
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:27,412
Come to think of it, when I had
this dream before-- Harumaki.

284
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:27,894
Gyoko.

285
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:34,361
Uh.

286
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:36,728
Uh, let's forget the past and
have ourselves a good time!

287
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,094
Wow.

288
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,861
Ranma's sure acting nice to
your grandpa all of a sudden.

289
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,294
Yes, she's too kind.

290
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:46,494
This'll be good
for the old soul.

291
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:47,894
[laughter]

292
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,728
Harumaki!

293
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:55,828
See if you can try and
catch me before I get away!

294
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:57,794
One, two, three, four.

295
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:00,194
Left, right, left, right.

296
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:01,361
That's the way.

297
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,228
Something bothering
you, Harumaki?

298
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,394
[sigh]

299
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:14,161
We've gone to many places and
done all kinds of things today.

300
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:16,094
But there's still
something missing.

301
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:17,561
[sigh]

302
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:18,828
You creep!

303
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,694
After all the trouble I've
gone to to make you happy.

304
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,361
Hey, calm down, Ranma.

305
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,628
Get a hold of yourself.

306
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:24,828
But this creep--

307
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:26,394
[sigh]

308
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,794
It's just that this date wasn't
exactly what I had in mind,

309
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:30,394
you see.

310
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,394
Well, I think maybe you need to
remember that important promise

311
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:35,194
that you were talking to
us about earlier today.

312
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:37,394
Don't get me in any deeper.

313
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:40,728
Uh, according to my
grandpa's diary here--

314
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:41,394
No!

315
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:43,394
Don't read my diary!

316
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:44,094
No!

317
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:46,061
Don't read his diary!

318
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,761
"This was a very special day.

319
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:50,628
Gyoko and I vowed to
elope with one another."

320
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:51,428
[scream]

321
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:52,761
No, you mustn't read-- you--

322
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:53,661
What?

323
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:54,428
Are you sure about that?

324
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,128
Yeah.

325
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,694
I'm not making it up.

326
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:57,561
Oh, yes.

327
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:58,428
Now I remember.

328
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,961
We promised to elope.

329
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,294
I don't believe you.

330
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:03,528
The promise was to kiss
each other, wasn't it?

331
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:06,094
And if that's the case, then
why couldn't you have at least

332
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:08,128
remembered it earlier?

333
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,394
Are you trying to
get a kiss out of me?

334
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:11,361
[growl]

335
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:13,328
Old man, you're
the one who roped me

336
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:14,894
into this in the first place.

337
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,961
I think this would be
the perfect time for you

338
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:21,294
to go into the light, old man.

339
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:22,861
Tell us what happened.

340
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:26,128
Why'd you promised to elope
with Gyoko in the first place?

341
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:28,694
Hm.

342
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,961
It's like this.

343
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:32,328
[laughter]

344
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:35,361
(VOICEOVER) We knew each
other from childhood,

345
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,794
and our parents consented
to our becoming engaged.

346
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:42,694
Had everything gone smoothly,
we would have married happily.

347
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:46,628
Unfortunately, Gyoko's
father had invested heavily

348
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:50,528
in a beans company, and it
collapsed in the stock market

349
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,228
crash.

350
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,428
He lost all his money.

351
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:55,328
And because he
couldn't pay his debts,

352
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:59,261
he had to get Gyoko married
off to get her dowry.

353
00:15:59,294 --> 00:16:01,828
In order for Gyoko
and I to get married

354
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:06,428
as we originally planned, our
only hope was to run away.

355
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:06,994
[sigh]

356
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:08,228
The poor things.

357
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,528
Are you serious?

358
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:11,728
[train whistle]

359
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,328
HARUMAKI: (VOICEOVER) Yes,
that's the way it was.

360
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,461
So we made a promise.

361
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:17,794
I promised her we'd elope.

362
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,628
Hold it.

363
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,194
Your promise was to be
if the flowers blossomed.

364
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:23,661
So what happened to the flowers?

365
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:24,894
Did they blossom?

366
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:25,828
Flowers?

367
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,494
What flowers were those?

368
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,228
[groan]

369
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:29,461
Don't ask me!

370
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:31,861
You're the one who
said it in my dream!

371
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:35,128
In the diary it says something
about if the cherry trees are

372
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,594
still in bloom late in spring--

373
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:39,294
HARUMAKI: If the
cherry trees are still

374
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:43,528
in bloom late in spring,
then let's elope together.

375
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:44,928
Please, Gyoko.

376
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,228
I will.

377
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:48,894
If the cherry trees
are still in blossom.

378
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:49,894
[gasp]

379
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:55,161
HARUMAKI: But the cherry
blossoms did not last for long.

380
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:55,794
[crying]

381
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:56,761
Goodbye.

382
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:57,361
Gyoko!

383
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,494
So, like, that was it?

384
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:07,728
What a tragic way to
end your very first love.

385
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,794
If I could just see the
cherry trees flowering late

386
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:13,994
in the season, I could
die a happy old man.

387
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,328
OK then.

388
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:18,794
Let's go see them.

389
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:19,994
Ranma.

390
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:21,961
We'll see those
blossoms, don't worry.

391
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:22,728
[sigh]

392
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:28,428
If they're in blossom,
will you elope with me?

393
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,494
RANMA: Don't push it.

394

AKANE: They tore
down all the trees.

Gone.

My trees.

401
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,261
My cherry trees are gone.

402
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,194
My youth has vanished.

403
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:03,461
All my youthful memories
have gone forever.

404
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,261
What are you talking
about, old man?

405
00:18:10,294 --> 00:18:12,594
Your cherry trees
are right there.

406
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:13,828
Huh?

407
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,394
Huh?

408
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,128
The cherry blossoms are in full
bloom right in front of you.

409
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:20,528
Those are your cherry trees.

410
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:29,394
Huh?

411
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:34,694
[gasp]

412
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:36,461
I see them!

413
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:39,494
My beautiful cherry
trees are in full bloom.

414

Huh?

419
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:19,194
The dreams I had
long ago in my youth

420
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:23,394
have finally come to
a natural conclusion.

421
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,528
Thank you for everything, miss.

422
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:26,394
It was nothing.

423
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:31,894
I enjoyed our time together.

424
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:34,994
Uh, hey.

00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:35,894
No, wait.

00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:39,028
Hang on.

00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,794
Thank you again, miss.

Don't go!

Wait!

00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:07,861
No!

Poor Grandpa.

437

Hey!

438
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:10,094
Can you hear me?

439
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:10,728
Say something.

440
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:11,428
Old man!

441
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,694
Please, keep it down.

442
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,128
No amount of noise
will save him now.

443
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:18,094
Otherwise, I'd be
calling him, too.

444
00:20:18,128 --> 00:20:19,928
Making noise could
save his life.

Look at her.

463
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:52,294
She doesn't look
anything like me.

464
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:54,594
Don't you think so?

465

Gyoko.

466

You're a real looker
compared to her.

No, that's him.

He can't even tell a
woman from a man anymore.
