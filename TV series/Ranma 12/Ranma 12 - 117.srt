THEME SONG: (SINGING
IN JAPANESE)

2
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,733
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Back to
the way we were, please!

3
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
[groaning]

4
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,400
Ah!

5
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,400
Hey, Mousse, are you OK?

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,833
It's still a long way,
so do you want to rest?

7
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,966
I'm sorry, you two.

8
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,066
Go on ahead.

9
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,666
No point in me slowing you down.

10
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:19,300
I'll catch up with you.

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,466
Hey, don't worry about it.

12
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,000
It's just us guys, remember?

13
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah, let's not stop and
maybe we'll make it to the top

14
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,233
by morning.

15
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,066
All right?

16
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:26,733
BOTH: All right!

17
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:33,466
You're probably wondering
what the three of us

18
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:37,266
are doing carrying old oil
drums on our backs, right?

19
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,566
Well, it's a long story that
all started three days ago.

20
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:46,966
ALL: What the?

21
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,133
The powder of the spring
of the drowned men?

22
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,400
Hey, why would I
lie to you guys?

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,533
I'm a salesman.

24
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:54,433
Then that means--

25
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:55,366
If we use it--

26
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,100
We'll be cured.

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,266
MOUSSE: No more duck.

28
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,666
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
No more P-chan.

29
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,466
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I
will be a girl again.

30
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,733
So are you interested?

31
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,666
Need a few minutes to decide?

32
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,066
Wait a second.

33
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,033
I remember one time I took this
stuff that was supposed to cure

34
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,033
me, and it only worked once.

35
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:12,866
[giggling]

36
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:13,700
I remember.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,266
That was bad medicine.

38
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,333
Trust me.

39
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,600
I guarantee you this
is completely safe.

40
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,833
You don't have to
worry about a thing.

41
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,166
Are you sure?

42
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,366
I'll take one.

43
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:27,200
That's everything I have.

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,033
One?

45
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,900
That's only 30 yen.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,133
RANMA: That should be
enough for all three bags.

47
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,733
I'll give you
everything I've got.

48
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,366
Me too.

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,233
You're all incredibly
poor, aren't you?

50
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,400
Well, you boys drive
a hard bargain,

51
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,100
so here's what I'm going to.

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,433
Now, I know I'm losing my shirt
here, but they're all yours.

53
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,366
[laughter]

54
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,033
All mine!

55
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,666
I so happy for you.

56
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,866
SALESMAN: it was a
pleasure with you boys.

57
00:03:58,966 --> 00:03:59,666
Thanks a lot.

58
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:02,066
You too!

59
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:06,300
SALESMAN: Oh, and
just one more thing.

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
What is it?

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,200
I suppose you want more money.

62
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,800
Not that it's important, but
I should tell you only one

63
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,033
of the three bags
contains the real powder.

64
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:17,600
I have no idea what's
in the other bags.

65
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,466
ALL: Say what?

66
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:21,233
[strangling]

67
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,166
RANMA: Why, you dirty--

68
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:23,100
RYOGA: You cheated us.

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,766
We our money.

70
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,366
Wait, I can explain.

71
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,633
Just let me go, and I'll
tell you everything.

72
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,833
Come back here,
you stupid old man!

73
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:41,533
Ah!

74
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:42,074
Hiyah!

75
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,633
So as you can see, because
of that idiotic panda

76
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,233
and the psycho young
girl, all the labels

77
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,966
for my spring of
drowned man powder

78
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:01,400
with some of my other powders
washed off in the river.

79
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,466
And I hope that explains why
I sold them to you so cheap.

80
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:09,633
What I gave you for 30 yen
is worth at least 3,000 yen.

81
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,533
Uh, well I guess
a deal's a deal.

82
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,366
Ranma!

83
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:15,466
This is your fault!

84
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,233
Uh-oh.

85
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,600
Ah!

86
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,666
This is important.

87
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,300
Just dissolve the powder
into a tub of hot water

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
and jump in right away.

89
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,700
You three stop
fighting right now!

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,633
[groaning]

91
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,500
At least we know one of the
bags has the real powder in it.

92
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Well, yeah, but we
don't know which one.

93
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,400
All three bags look
exactly the same.

94
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,933
There is no reason to be angry.

95
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,933
You should share the
powder, then nobody loses.

96
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah, I guess so.

97
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,633
At least that way, it
would be fair to everybody.

98
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,766
Yeah, what else can we do?

99
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,066
Just count me out.

100
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,233
What's your problem?

101
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,966
What, do you have
a better idea?

102
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,000
MOUSSE: I don't need you too
because my bag is the one

103
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,300
containing the real powder.

104
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,133
I'm outta here.

105
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,766
Well, what do we do now?

106
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,600
The only thing we
can do, and that's

107
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,600
to see if one of our bags works.

108
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,633
And if that doesn't
work, what do we do then?

109
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,500
Let's not worry about that now.

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,266
Let's see if just
maybe Mousse was wrong.

111
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:22,807
Later.

112
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,333
What now, Ranma?

113
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,500
Well, my powder I
guess, because there's

114
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,100
nothing else I can do.

115
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,641
Ranma.

116
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:41,266
MOUSSE (VOICEOVER): I'm
sure this is the right bag.

117
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:42,633
SHAMPOO: Mousse!

118
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,066
Shampoo!

119
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,633
That is the real one?

120
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,700
If you're sure, why don't you
come with Shampoo and try it?

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,566
Sh-- Shampoo!

122
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,033
I didn't know that
you cared about me.

123
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:53,966
[laughter]

124
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:56,366
[crash]

125
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
Why, thank you, Mousse.

126
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,766
Yeah, that's perfect.

127
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:09,533
Now let's see if it works.

128
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:16,100
What if he's right?

129
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:27,866
My sweet Akane
would never love me

130
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:31,233
if I turned into a
hideous hippopotamus.

131
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,633
SHAMPOO: Ryoga!

132
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,600
Huh?

133
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,000
[crash]

134
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,133
[groan]

135
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,166
Just for me, Ryoga.

136
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,266
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I wonder
what the chances are that this

137
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,633
will make me normal again.

138
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,166
It's no use.

139
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,200
I can't take the chance.

140
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,966
Let's not worry about that now.

141
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:02,233
Let's see if just
maybe Mousse was wrong.

142
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,433
I don't think I
even have a choice.

143
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,766
Pops?

144
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:11,366
If this powder turns me into a
panda, I'll be even worse off.

145
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:16,300
I quit.

146
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,933
SOUN: So this is spring
of the drowned man powder?

147
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,666
That or some kind
of powder that'll

148
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,700
turn me into something else.

149
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,700
I've always dreamed of taking a
bath like that once in my life.

150
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,700
Maybe we could all do it.

151
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,933
Are you OK?

152
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,000
But

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Kasumi, if we all
did that, we wouldn't

154
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,666
know what we might turn into.

155
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:42,033
Oh, I realize that,
but wouldn't it

156
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,166
be fun just to throw caution to
the wind and see what happens?

157
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:52,366
I think you've lost it, Kasumi.

158
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:56,266
Ranma, why don't you try being
a man for once and test it out?

159
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:58,433
Yeah, I mean it couldn't
get any worse, could it?

160
00:08:58,533 --> 00:08:59,833
There's no way.

161
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,966
Come on, would you please stop
your complaining and go for it?

162
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:06,300
I mean really Ranma, what
do you have to lose anyway?

163
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Oh man, would you all
just get off my back?

164
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,266
Why can't I just make
up my mind and do it?

165
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:20,800
AKANE: Ranma.

166
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,133
Hm?

167
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:22,800
Yeah?

168
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,066
So what do you want?

169
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,333
Have you decided?

170
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,300
Well, you see, I'm not even
sure I'm confident enough

171
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,700
to take the risk.

172
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,400
On the other hand, I guess I'm
tired of changing into a girl

173
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,966
all the time.

174
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:39,066
It really doesn't matter.

175
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,733
Even if you turn into
a pig or a duck, that's

176
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,100
OK, because deep down inside
you'll always be Ranma.

177
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
Yeah, you're right.

178
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,466
And no matter what happens,
I'll always be your--

179
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:52,266
SHAMPOO: Ranma!

180
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,166
Shampoo?

181
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,833
Ranma, Shampoo has the
other two bags for you.

182
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,900
Come and I show you.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,633
You're kidding.

184
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,600
Way to go, Shampoo!

185
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,141
Ranma!

186
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:06,807
Honestly.

187
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,933
Well, here they are.

188
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:16,200
Man, it sure was nice of Ryoga
and Mousse to them to you.

189
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,566
I told them that Shampoo
wanted Ranma to try it first,

190
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:24,233
and without saying a word,
they each gave me their pack.

191
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,100
Wow, this is the best
news I've had all day.

192
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,666
Now it's just a
matter of finding out

193
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:31,566
which one is the real one.

194
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,000
Huh?

195
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,933
Huh?

196
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,833
Ah!

197
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:37,374
Ah!

198
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:45,000
Now you lose, Ranma!

199
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,433
What did you do that for?

200
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:47,800
They no belong to you.

201
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,700
Huh?

202
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,241
Hiyah!

203
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,266
Ryoga, now what?

204
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,266
You're a coward, Ranma.

205
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:04,100
Using Shampoo to do your
dirty work makes me sick.

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I have never seen
anything so low.

207
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,933
Wha-- what do you mean?

208
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,200
[giggling]

209
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,666
Shampoo would really love
to stay and chat with you,

210
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,400
but Shampoo still
have deliveries left.

211
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,941
Bye!

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,600
Shampoo!

213
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,000
Listen, I've got no idea
what's going on here.

214
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,700
Would somebody please tell me?

215
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,533
Yeah right.

216
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,133
You're a liar!

217
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,333
Wait a sec.

218
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,800
After all this mess,
we're back to square one

219
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,533
because we still don't
know which pack it is.

220
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:29,166
[gasp]

221
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,266
Yeah, that's true.

222
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:35,633
OK, I say it's time we all work
together and try and figure out

223
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,200
what powder is in which pack.

224
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,433
I guess so.

225
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,966
All right, that's great.

226
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,433
Now let's all be buds again.

227
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,566
I think we should
do our experiment

228
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,266
where no one can bother us.

229
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:57,266
I agree.

230
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,900
Like up in the mountains.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,448
Yeah.

232
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,400
It sure is great to be out here
and spend time with you guys.

233
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,200
We've known each
other for a long time,

234
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,800
but we've never really
hung out together.

235
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,341
Yeah.

236
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,966
Come to think of
it, I never really

237
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:41,600
had any close friends to
hang around with before.

238
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,833
Most of my life
I've always been too

239
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:48,600
busy training and stuff to ever
go out and meet any new people.

240
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,033
I'm kind of like that too.

241
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:53,033
As a kid, my family spent a
lot of time away from home,

242
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,800
and I ended up
playing by myself.

243
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:04,233
Oh man, I never really
realized how pathetic you were.

244
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,900
So why don't you
tell us about you?

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,833
Were you happy traveling
around when you were a kid.

246
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,033
I don't know.

247
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,166
We just did a lot
of traveling around.

248
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,100
That's all.

249
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,133
It was really pretty boring.

250
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,400
I wish I remembered something
exciting that happened,

251
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,600
but I can't.

252
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:27,200
Well, I'm turning in.

253
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,900
BOTH: Good night.

254
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,466
[snoring]

255
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:50,300
ALL: Which pack holds
the real powder?

256
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,200
[groaning]

257
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,600
Let's wait till morning.

258
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,266
Good idea.

259
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,900
I'm a little tired.

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,566
ALL: Good night.

261
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,700
Hey, what's the deal here?

262
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,333
Get these ropes off of me.

263
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:09,900
We voted you to
be our guinea pig.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,900
Let's see what happens.

265
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,500
BOTH: So, now we know
which is the real pack.

266
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,233
We did it.

267
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,033
We did.

268
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:27,574
Ah!

269
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,833
[heavy breathing]

270
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:34,733
Huh?

271
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,633
Just a dream.

272
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,766
Come on, you guys.

273
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:46,966
Will you untie these ropes.

274
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,466
We voted you to
be our guinea pig.

275
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:50,466
Let's see what happens.

276
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,600
BOTH: So, now we know
which is the real pack.

277
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,366
We did it.

278
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:07,266
We did.

279
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:07,807
Ah!

280
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,600
Huh?

281
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,400
Just a dream.

282
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,833
Come on, you guys.

283
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,566
Would you untie these ropes?

284
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,033
We voted you to
be our guinea pig.

285
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,033
Let's see what happens.

286
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,333
BOTH: So, now we know
which is the real pack.

287
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:45,266
We did it.

288
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:47,566
We did.

289
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,400
Ah!

[heavy breathing]

291
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,333
Huh?

292
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,266
What a dream.

293
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,000
[chirping]

294
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,733
MOUSSE (VOICEOVER): I'm
starting to get the feeling

295
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,033
that mine isn't the real power.

296
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,100
RANMA: All right
guys, let's do it.

297
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,766
RYOGA: Yeah.

298
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:00,566
Look!

00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,533
A UFO!

Huh?

00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:02,574
Huh?

302
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,000
Wait.

303
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Huh?

304
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,700
Hey, what do you think
you're doing, Ryoga?

305
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,333
Ah, you thought you'd
try and pull a fast one.

306
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:13,366
But I didn't!

307
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,500
I saw you.

308
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,333
What are you doing?

309
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:18,200
I saw you.

310
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,566
MOUSSE (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

311
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,066
Now I get a feeling that my
original drum was the real one.

312
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,933
Which one is it?

313
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:28,200
I see it again.

314
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,766
BOTH: Huh?

315
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:30,900
What are you doing?

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,333
Would you leave them
where they were, Mousse?

317
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:34,874
Hey!

318
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:38,707
Hey.

319
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:44,300
[heavy breathing]

320
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,833
OK, this is getting us
nowhere, and after all that,

321
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,033
we still don't know which one
has the real powder in it.

322
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,066
You are right.

Let's do it.

This is it, men.

00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,000
Let's begin.

326
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,733
Ready.

327
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,933
Set.

328
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,366
Go.

329
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,866
Huh?

00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:05,866
Oh.

00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:06,407
Ah!

[whimpering]

335
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,266
Hey guys, I guess that
means mine's the real one.

336
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:45,866
You don't have to be so smug.

337
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:49,033
And with all that switching
around, who says that's yours?

338
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,600
How could you!

339
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,166
Hey!

340
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:52,166
Let me at it!

341
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,433
Come on, you guys.

342
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,333
Would you cut it out?

343
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:00,466
[gasps]

344
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:01,266
My drum!

345
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:02,466
What do you mean your drum?

346
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:03,166
Wait up!

347
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:09,100
Oh no you don't!

348
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,641
Ah!

349
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,533
I got it.

350
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,033
Ah!

351
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,466
Oh no you don't.

352
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:18,966
What do you think you're doing?

353
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:22,900
Hey pal, I don't
see your name on it.

354
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,900
There's no way you're
getting away from me now.

355
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,441
Ah!

356
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:33,133
Would you two give
me some room here?

357
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,333
I was here first, jerk.

358
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:37,466
Would you two cut it out?

359
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:38,966
Ah!

360
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,466
Hey, I was here first.

361
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:41,500
All right, you jerks?

362
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,966
Give me some room,
'cause this is mine.

363
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,066
I don't know what you're--

364
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,933
ALL: Ah!

365
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:49,933
[screaming]

366
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,900
[laughter]

367
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,900
All right!

368
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,366
I'll never turn
into a pig again!

369
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,366
Shampoo, I'm coming home!

370
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,866
[splash]

371
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,833
Ah, this is just great.

372
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:33,966
That idiot ripped us off.

373
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,433

Cheater!

376
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,866
Cheater!

377
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:41,833
Cheater, cheater, cheater!

378
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:49,633
Ugh, it didn't work.

379
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:50,533
[quacking]

380
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,066
I so sorry to hear that.

381
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,666
I didn't know we were supposed
to get in the water right

382
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,566
after the powder went in.

383
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,000
That creep who sold
it to us should

384
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,133
have explained it better.

385
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:02,300
Ranma, you no worry about it.

386
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
Besides, everything
is back to normal.

387
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:10,066
Would anyone like a cup of tea?

388
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,266
What's that?

389
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:14,200
Now with the latest on
that biological discovery

390
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,933
we go live via satellite.

391
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:19,033
It's hard to describe
the mayhem, but up here

392
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,400
in the mountains,
there have been

393
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,600
various sightings of
a saber toothed tiger

394
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,966
and, yes, an actual pterodactyl.

395
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,733
Now-- ah!

396
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,133
Ah!

397
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,233
Oh my.

398
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,733
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV):
This is studio calling.

399
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,033
Are-- are you still there?

400
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:33,800
Hello?

401
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,700
Can you-- can you hear me.

402
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,500
[gulp]

403
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,041
Oh boy.

404
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:20,115
RANMA (VOICEOVER): May I
have the envelope please.

405
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:24,415
The one to carry on the
Saotome school is Ryoga.

406
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:28,448
Next time on "Ranma 1/2," Ryoga
inherits the Saotome school.

407
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:30,315
We'll see you there.
