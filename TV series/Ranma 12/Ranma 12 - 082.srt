00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,796
You're the swords chosen one?

171
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:16,396
-That's right.

172
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,529
-No way.

173
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:19,796
-So you're sure that
it's not a mistake?

174
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:20,496
-Hm.

175
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:22,496
Oh ye of little faith.

176
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:25,629
I have the certificate of
authenticity right here.

177
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,229
-You're kidding.

178
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:28,463
-I never kid, Nabiki Tendo.

179
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:29,696
You know that.

180
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:32,596
What that is proof
positive Manganmaru

181
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,663
chose me to draw
that from a stone.

182
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:35,863
-Is it?

183
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:37,763
[gasping]

184
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:42,463
Th-- this is-- I'm sorry.

185
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,929
What was it again?

186
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,763
-You know.

187
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:48,896
[celebratory sounds]

188
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:49,529
[cheering]

189
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,896
-Hey, you made it!

190
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,363
You're the 1 millionth guy
to draw and pull it out.

191
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:54,863
[laughing]

192
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:56,363
-Oh happy day!

193
00:08:58,463 --> 00:08:59,896
I shall never forget it.

194
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,929
Not for the rest of my life.

195
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:05,296
-So you won it in some kind
of lottery, is that it?

196
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:07,629
-If he started
with three wishes--

197
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:08,796
-There's only two left.

198
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,063
-My dear classmates.

199
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:16,429
What you fail to realize is
that with Manganmaru at my side,

200
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,596
nothing is beyond my reach.

201
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:20,829
Not even world domination.

202
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:21,696
[crazed laugh]

203
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,429
-Somebody stop him.

204
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,663
-I hereby make my second wish.

205
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,063
[chatter]

206
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:34,296
My second wish is for a date
with the pigtailed girl.

207
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:36,129
MANGANMARU: Your
wish is my command.

208
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:37,963
[groaning]

209
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:38,896
-We're saved.

210
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,796
-It's a good thing
he's an idiot.

211
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:42,337
-Hm.

212
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:44,796
What, an arrow?

213
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,663
RANMA (VOICEOVER): My
darling, dearest Kuno.

214
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,629
Date me this Sunday, won't you?

215
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:53,829
Signed, your every
loving pigtailed girl.

216
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:54,529
[excited panting]

217
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,996
-Oh, can it be?

218
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,929
[high pitched squeal]

219
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:03,696
What can I say but
it's great to be alive?

220
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:06,537
-Hmpf.

221
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,196
-Ranma, you're not really
going to date him, are you?

222
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:12,963
-What's its to you?

223
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:16,063
-OK, listen up.

224
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,829
He's already blown two wishes.

225
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,129
So if we're going to use
one, we're going to have to--

226
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:21,929
-Yeah, yeah.

227
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,263
-Don't you yeah, yeah me, boy.

228
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:25,696
If we don't get that sword--

229
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:27,363
-Then we're both doomed.

230
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:31,829
Listen, if it means never
having to be a girl again

231
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,363
then I'm totally ready
to go the distance.

232
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:35,229
[giggles]

233
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:37,196
-And then when he's distracted--

234
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:41,563
-That's when we get our
hands on that magic sword.

235
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:43,196
-You know it!

236
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:45,163
-You're forgetting
something, you know.

237
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:45,863
-Hm?

238
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:47,696
-This is Kuno, remember?

239
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:50,696
What if he can't
control himself?

240
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,563
-Aw, she's right.

241
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:53,363
What if he--

242
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:58,496
-Magic swords, make me one
with the pigtailed girl?

243
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,463
-You want it, baby?

244
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,429
You got it.

245
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,396
Mm.

246
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,863
-Here I come!

247
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:09,996
[screaming]

248
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:10,963
-Hey!

249
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:13,896
Don't even joke about that, OK?

250
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:15,896
Do you think I should shave?

251
00:11:15,996 --> 00:11:17,896
-You want, I should help
you with your makeup?

252
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:19,504
-Ranma.

253
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:23,296
[music playing]

254
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,263
[waves splashing]

[yawns]

256
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,313
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Stupid jerk, dragging me

257
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,647
out here first thing
in the morning.

258
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,913
Still, there's
nothing I wouldn't

259
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,147
do to get that last wish.

260
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:51,813
-Pigtailed girl.

261
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,313
The sunrise.

262
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,213
Tell me, have you
ever seen the like?

263
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:58,047
-Oh, you're right.

264
00:11:58,147 --> 00:11:59,347
Oh, wow.

265
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:00,580
(MUTTERING) Somebody shoot me.

266
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,547
-That's right, boy.

267
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:05,180
Keep up the good work.

268
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,780
-What kind of date is it?

269
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,647
-Pigtailed girl.

270
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:09,347
-Huh?

271
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,713
-Have you a wish ready?

272
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,513
-Who, me?

273
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:14,780
[giggles]

274
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,280
Actually, I'm just happy to
be spending the day with you.

275
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,380
-Truly?

276
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,180
If so, then allow me
to make it a reality.

277
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,113
Ugh!

278
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,580
-Oh no you don't!

279
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,713
-Uh, jeez, he almost wasted it!

280
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:32,913
-Well, all right then, my dear.

281
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,380
Race me to that hilltop.

282
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,880
[laughing]

283
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,380
-Wait up, silly!

284
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,347
-Ha, ha.

285
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:40,347
Slowpoke!

286
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:40,888
Ha, ha.

287
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,347
-(BREATHY VOICE) Wait up.

288
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:46,513
Oh!

289
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:48,180
I twisted my ankle!

290
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,747
[gasp]

291
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,013
-Pigtailed girl!

292
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:51,480
-It hurts.

293
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,947
-What can I do to help you?

294
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:54,913
-Ow, ow.

295
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:56,413
Ow.

296
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:57,213
-Oh.

297
00:12:57,313 --> 00:12:59,013
-Now I've got you.

298
00:12:59,113 --> 00:12:59,913
And that--

299
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,280
-No, no, no, my Darling.

300
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,747
I know that you're eager, but we
mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

301
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:09,047
We barely know each other.

302
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,313
-Eh?

303
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:13,013
-Which is why I'd like you
to start keeping a diary.

304
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:14,313
[chuckles]

305
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,247
-I think I like him
better when he's crazy.

306
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,480
-Let's have breakfast, shall we?

307
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,747
Do you like it?

308
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,447
I made it myself
late last night.

309
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:28,613
-Oh!

310
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:30,047
Oh!

311
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,880
-Please eat anything you like.

312
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,380
-I will!

313
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,313
[chuckles]

314
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,947
RANMA (VOICEOVER): While you'll
be eating some sleeping powder.

315
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:40,013
-OK.

316
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:41,280
Say, Ah.

317
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,821
-Ah!

318
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:45,213
-Down the hatch!

319
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:45,780
-Mm.

320
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,913
-It's good?

321
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:48,147
-Mm, you minx.

322
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:49,247
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Ha, ha.

323
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:50,647
Go to sleep, stupid.

324
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,113
-Mm, mm.

325
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:04,180
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

326
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,747
It's not working?

327
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:06,288
Oh.

328
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:11,713
[snoring]

329
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,380
[gurgling]

330
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,047
RANMA (VOICE OVER):
Geeze, what a freak.

331
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:17,947
Still--

332
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,413
-Got it!

333
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:20,080
-Pop!

334
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,347
What are you doing?

335
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:22,480
-Sorry, boy.

336
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,247
But a man's got to do
what a man's go to do.

337
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,413
This sword can only
cure one of us.

338
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:30,347
And it sure as heck
ain't gonna be you.

339
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:32,747
-Why you dirty cheat!

340
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:34,680
[laughing]

341
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,221
-Ah!

342
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,247
-So, pop.

343
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,047
What was that you were saying?

344
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,013
[nervous chuckle]

345
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:45,647
-Eh, not-- not so fast boy.

346
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:46,947
I-- I got an idea.

347
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,580
Hear me, oh sword.

348
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,113
My wish is to have more wishes.

349
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,613
-Hey, why didn't I think of it.

350
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:04,080
MANGANMARU: I'm sorry, that wish
cannot be granted at this time.

351
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,347
Please try again or ask an
operator for assistance.

352
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:11,313
-Cannot be granted?

353
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:17,380
RANMA (VOICE OVER):
Oh, I get it.

354
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,580
The voice.

355
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,613
It only knows Kuno's voice.

356
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:25,680
In other words, I got to
get Kuno to ask for me.

357
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,380
-I was just dreaming of you.

358
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,147
-You're awake!

359
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,413
-Akane Tendo, what a surprise.

360
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:35,780
Driven mad with jealousy over
my date with the pigtailed girl,

361
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,580
no doubt.

362
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,580
-I am not!

363
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,847
-Now, now.

364
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:39,680
Don't be upset.

365
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:43,313
I wish for Akane Tendo
and I to-- blargh!

366
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:44,647
BOTH: Oh no you don't!

367
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:47,647
-Come on, you.

368
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,547
We've got a date to finish.

369
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,713
[sighs]

370
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,813
-For all the good it'll do him.

371
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,747
TATEWAKI: Come out, come
out wherever you are.

372
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:59,147
RANMA: (GIGGLING)
Try and catch me.

373
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:00,080
TATEWAKI: OK!

374
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,013
[laughing]

375
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,480
-How's Ranma going to
bring up the subject?

376
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,747
-Pretty please help
me cure my problem?

377
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:12,113
-OK pigtailed girl.

378
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:14,113
Your wish is my command.

379
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:15,447
-Yay!

380
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,247
-Well, then again, who knows.

381
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:18,913
I could be wrong.

382
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:20,513
[laughing]

383
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,180
RANMA (VOICE OVER):
Keep chasing, chump.

384
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,047
I'm halfway to being cured.

385
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,513
-Come here, you!

386
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,613
Oh, playing hard to get, huh?

387
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:32,280
OK, then.

388
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,513
I guess I'll have to
wish to catch you!

389
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,547
-Will you quit it with
the dumb wishes already?

390
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,580
-Just kidding.

391
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
-Please don't, OK?

392
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:46,347
It's just that you only
have one wish left now.

393
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:49,080
And I just don't want
you to go wasting it, k?

394
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,480
-Course not.

395
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,380
I'd be you'd like some
tea after that run.

396
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,513
-Well, y-yeah.

397
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:57,480
-Perhaps if I wished for some.

398
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,880
-Cut that out, I said!

399
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,613
-Now say ah.

400
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:05,154
-Ah.

401
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,313
-Is it good?

402
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:09,047
-Mm, mm, mm.

403
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,713
RANMA (VOICE OVER):
Ugh, I'm gonna puke.

404
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,980
Guess I gotta use the big guns.

405
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,180
-What shall we eat next?

406
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,013
-Um, can I ask a favor?

407
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:19,813
[speechless noises]

408
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,280
I've got this problem.

409
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,047
Wha-- What problem?

410
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:28,180
-It's uh, problem of the body.

411
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,313
-Da-- da-- the body?

412
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:34,480
-If you use your sword
to grant my wish then

413
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,447
I'll do anything
that you ask me to.

414
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:37,847
[gulping gasp]

415
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:43,613
-Uh, duh, duh-- Anything?

416
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:44,280
-Uh-huh.

417
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,680
-Ranma!

418
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,947
Don't you have any shame?

419
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:47,713
[crying]

420
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:48,947
-Uh, Akane Tendo.

421
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,180
-And what are you doing here?

422
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,013
TATEWAKI (VOICE OVER):
She's she's jealous

423
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,080
of the pigtailed girl.

424
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,813
Which means--

425
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:58,180
-You do love me!

426
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,080
-I do not!

427
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,447
-Butt out, Akane!

428
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:05,280
-Do you want to be
a guy that badly?

429
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,513
-Duh, stupid.

430
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:08,247
Come on Kuno, got to go!

431
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:09,047
[groaning]

432
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:10,680
-Can't we talk about it?

433
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,713
-Forgive me, Akane Tendo!

434
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:13,688
-Ranma.

435
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:18,847
-(GIGGLING) Come on, over here.

436
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:20,980
-(LAUGHING) I won't
let you go to his time.

437
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,447
Wait up!

438
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:24,847
[laughing]

439
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:25,813
Oh, look out!

440
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:30,647
Pigtailed girl,
are you all right?

441
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:31,447
-Oh, Kuno.

442
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,113
RANMA (VOICE OVER):
Almost there.

443
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,380
-What you said earlier.

444
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,580
Were you serious?

445
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,213
-Mhm.

446
00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:39,613
Anything you want.

447
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:41,080
Just say it, Kuno.

448
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,947
[gulps]

449
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,313
-Uh, very well.

450
00:18:45,113 --> 00:18:46,813
Cl-- close your eyes.

451
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:48,747
-[gasps] I-- what?

452
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,380
-The first date
and the first kiss.

453
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,313
[hysterical laughing]

454
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,180
What an auspicious occasion.

455
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:04,380
-Ranma, my boy.

456
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,180
I know I can't
talk you out of it.

457
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,247
So I won't even try.

458
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,613
But if you're going do a
thing, do it right, dammit.

459
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:13,047
-Meaning what?

460
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:14,880
-I won't bother
you either, Ranma.

461
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,647
I Do what you want.

462
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:17,188
-Akane!

463
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,047
-Weep not, Akane Tendo.

464
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:21,680
Your turn is next.

465
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,247
-(SCORNFUL) I'd
rather not, thanks.

466
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:30,713
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Just one
minute and that'll be it.

467
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:33,313
I'll never have to
be a girl again.

468
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,280
[strained kissing noises]

469
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,213
[gasping]

470
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,580
AKANE (VOICE OVER):
Ranma, you idiot.

471
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:55,513
-I can't do it!

472
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:56,054
Ah!

473
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:00,488
-Ah!

474
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:04,713
Aw.

475
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:06,580
Why so cold, my love?

476
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,847
-Um, Ranma.

477
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,847
-Stay back!

478
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:18,747
Leave me alone.

479
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:19,847
I couldn't do it.

480
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:21,880
It's over.

481
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,080
All of it, it's over!

482
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,621
-Ranma!

483
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:26,713
-Wait.

484
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:27,254
-Huh?

485
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,313
-Pigtailed girl.

486
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,713
Our date today was wonderful.

487
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:37,947
-Huh?

488
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:38,680
-The third wish.

489
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,313
I was planning on giving
it to you all along.

490
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:43,180
-What?

491
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,947
Really?

492
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:44,580
-Huh?

493
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,347
-Oh, K-Kuno.

494
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:51,480
-Manganmaru, my
third wish is this.

495
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:56,813
RANMA (VOICE OVER): Here it is.

496
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:57,780
This is it!

497
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:03,780
At last, my real body!

498
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:07,947
-Whoa!

499
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,413
RANMA (VOICE OVER):
Or, uh, maybe not.

500
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:11,013
-What's going on?

501
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:12,980
[laughter]

502
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:17,380
[yelling]

503
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,713
-Behold, pigtailed girl.

504
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,780
May we never forget!

505
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:32,788
Ha, ha, ha!

506
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:39,180
[sighing groans]

507
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:48,041
[music - yawmin, "friends"]

508
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:16,131
-Shampoo?

509
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:17,864
Oh, what's the meaning
of that red thread?

510
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,497
You don't mean it's finding
you and Ranma together?

511
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:27,464
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
"Shampoo's Red Thread."

512
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:31,064
We'll see you there!
