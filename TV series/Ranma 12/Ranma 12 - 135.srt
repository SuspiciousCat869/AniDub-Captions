NARRATOR: A Teenage Ghost Story.

3
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:47,066
It all began years ago, when
a team from Furinkan High

4
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,366
went to Europe to
challenge them in a match.

5
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:51,566
Together with Russia,
Britain, and Austria,

6
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,333
we formed an
anti-French alliance

7
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:56,366
to defeat the
all-powerful Napoleon.

8
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:59,033
There we were at the
Battle of Waterloo,

9
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,133
face to face with the
great French army.

10
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,700
The baggle raged
savagely on for days,

11
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,700
but finally, when
the smoke cleared,

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,700
we emerged as the victors.

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,066
Years later, after
his exile to Elba,

14
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,900
the mighty Napoleon said
the boys of Furinkan

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,366
were my greatest and most
fierce opponents I've ever

16
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:18,700
had the displeasure to meet.

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,966
If only the sword of
Kuno had been there.

18
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:24,533
I would have singlehandedly
defeated Napoleon myself!

19
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:27,700
Why must my fate be so cruel?

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,900
I have never met anyone
so full of it as you two.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,133
Seriously.

22
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,033
Oh, Toramasa?

23
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:37,033
Is your shop open or not?

24
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:40,800
I haven't been feeling
very good, so I'm closed.

25
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,766
Then you'd better
just open up again.

26
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:45,500
Look at this
notebook I've bought.

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
It's useless.

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,033
And I'd have to say, it's
probably over 100 years old.

29
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:54,400
I wonder how old
this thing really is?

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,233
Hey!

31
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,633
Where do you think you're going?

32
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:59,366
Old doesn't necessarily
mean it's worthless.

33
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,800
Its value lies in its
artistic depth and innate

34
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,666
beauty-- just like me!

35
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:07,566
The sheer depth of your
words fills my soul, oh great

36
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,766
advisor.

37
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,800
[laughter]

38
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,866
You con artist!

39
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:14,066
You insulent cretin!

40
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,666
You wanna make
something out of it?

41
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,933
Would you two quit
acting like children?

42
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,166
Or take it outside.

43
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,166
I wonder what it says.

44
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,800
Looking at the sky.

45
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,533
So take a peek inside.

46
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,566
It can't be denied.

47
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,533
It's here where the
crane and turtle meet.

48
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:35,000
It sounds like a song.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,800
FEMALE VOICE: (SINGING)
On a lonely street,

50
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,566
on a dark, lonely night, a
thousand needles circling

51
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,033
a burning night.

52
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:43,733
A thousand--

53
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,866
Behind you!

54
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:47,233
(SINGING) --hand that
holds the chopsticks.

55
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,800
Beware, there may be
a few scary tricks.

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,633
I am but a messenger--

57
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,633
Begone, evil spirits!

58
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:58,833
(SINGING) Heed my words, you
who try to steal my treasure.

59
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,033
Where did she--

60
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,233
(SINGING) For I will
haunt you forever and ever.

61
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,400
Do not toy with me!

62
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:08,607
That's it!

63
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,600
Huh?

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,141
Huh?

65
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:17,233
Man.

66
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,700
Is this freaky, or what?

67
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,666
Where did you go?

68
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,000
Or do you fear the mighty
sword of Tatewaki Kuno?

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,541
Huh?

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Huh?

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,166
Ah ha ha!

72
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:33,566
She just vanished.

73
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,866
I think we'd better
get Kuno to a shrink.

74
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,900
Huh?

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,966
It looks like he
fainted standing up.

76
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,966
That must have been pretty
exciting, seeing a ghost.

77
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:51,900
Uh-huh.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,100
Well, I hope he
at least gave you

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,166
a refund on that old notebook.

80
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,400
Toramasa couldn't
after he fainted.

81
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,100
Besides, that old
creep's a swindler.

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,400
A teenage ghost wearing
a school uniform, you say?

83
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,233
How come when I was
young, nothing like that

84
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,300
ever happened to me?

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
FEMALE VOICE: (SINGING)
The young raccoon

86
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,633
cried, looking at the sky.

87
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:15,233
Up in Kokkuri Mountain.

88
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,833
So take a peek inside,
it can't be denied.

89
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,333
She's so cute.

90
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,433
Akane, why don't you tell
your nice little friend

91
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,133
to go on home?

92
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,966
She's not my friend.

93
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,800
Is she following us?

94
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,600
So, have you got a name?

95
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,533
And what do you
want here, anyway?

96
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,433
The raccoon from Kokkuri.

97
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,300
Don't change the
subject, and answer me.

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
Nibiki, would you please
stop scaring the ghost?

99
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,566
She came here for a reason.

100
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,700
But what is it, huh?

101
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Why don't we ask her?

102
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,366
I forgot something in this
world, and until I find it,

103
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:50,633
I must remain here.

104
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,733
Can you tell us
what you forgot?

105
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,466
I can't remember!

106
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,666
Please don't cry.

107
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,800
You can stay here until you do.

108
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,033
Now I've got to
live with a ghost.

109
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:04,266
You brought here here, Akane,
so she can stay in your room.

110
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:06,500
Am I crazy, or am I
the only one here who

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,533
realizes she's a ghost?

112
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:09,866
Oh.

113
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:13,400
So you allow a panda in your
house, but not a ghost, huh?

114
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:13,941
Hm?

115
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,266
[mumbling]

116
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,333
Akane, why don't you
ask your young guest

117
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,800
if she'd like something to eat?

118
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,033
Thank you.

119
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,866
Well, how many
people can say they've

120
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,933
actually had a ghost
over for dinner?

121
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:44,474
Hm?

122
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,541
Right.

123
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,000
[humming]

124
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:57,366
Huh?

125
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:58,833
[gasp]

126
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,033
I see you.

127
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,166
Oh, no!

128
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,100
He must have fainted!

129
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,966
C-come on!

130
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:12,866
Wake up!

131
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,233
It's my fault.

132
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,200
I thought I would take
a bath without asking.

133
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,266
You can't blame
yourself for this.

134
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:22,966
The next time you take a
bath, just turn the light on.

135
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,066
Kay, let's see
what I've got here.

136
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,833
I think any of these
pajamas will fit you.

137
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:31,066
If you don't mind, I'd
prefer to sleep in here.

138
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,800
I like the dark.

139
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,633
Gee.

140
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:34,700
It kind of looks like a morgue.

141
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,541
Thanks.

142
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,166
I hope you don't feel that
you have to stay invisible.

143
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:02,533
She's right.

144
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,500
There's no reason you should
feel like the weird one here.

145
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,666
That job's already filled.

146
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,166
Hey, Ranma?

147
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,400
Hm?

148
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,200
I appreciate that.

149
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,433
Oh.

150
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:16,266
By the way, I quite enjoyed
your little serenade.

151
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:17,300
Huh?

152
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,200
You've heard that
song before, Kasumi?

153
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,566
Yes.

154
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,733
When I was young, I used to
sing that verse about raccoon

155
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,600
who cried, looking at the
sky up in Kokkuri Mountain.

156
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,633
Because Kokkuri
Mountain is right behind

157
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,766
for Furinkan High School.

158
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:33,033
I kind of remember that.

159
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,100
Isn't there a legend
about a fox and a raccoon?

160
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
They played a game,
and the raccoon

161
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,900
lost when it fell down the
side of Kokkuri Mountain.

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,633
That's a pretty stupid story.

163
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,166
Actually, Ranma,
the other day I

164
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:47,100
heard there was a shrine to a
raccoon on that very mountain,

165
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
so maybe that tale is true.

166
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,133
Wait a minute.

167
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:52,633
There might be a clue
to what she's looking

168
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,266
for in that song of hers.

169
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,900
Hm?

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,700
There's the possibility that
if we learned all the lyrics,

171
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,666
we might be able to help
solve the mystery for her.

172
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:03,600
Would you get real?

173
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,066
And once she's found what
she's looking for, then

174
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,666
maybe she can pass
over to the other side.

175
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,766
Isn't all this talk
of ghosts and passing

176
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,800
to the other side exciting?

177
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:18,333
I feel just terrible being
such a burden on all of you.

178
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,866
You know what?

179
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,433
Heading up to Kokkuri
Mountain sounds like a hoot.

180
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,166
Anyone want to come with me?

181
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:24,733
Wait!

182
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,633
I'm coming, too!

183
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:30,407
Mm-hm.

184
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,266
I'm back, master.

185
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:39,033
Well, tell me--
anything to report?

186
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,000
[whispering]

187
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,566
Hm?

188
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,866
Are you serious?

189
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:45,833
A mystery within the
lyrics of a song.

190
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:46,533
[shrugging]

191
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,466
I believe the answer
to that mystery

192
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:51,633
lies in the raccoon shrine.

193
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:55,400
I seem to recall
reading about it.

194
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,233
FEMALE VOICE: (SINGING)
On a lonely street--

195
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,366
Ah, here we are.

196
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,966
FEMALE VOICE: (SINGING)
On a dark, lonely night,

197
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:04,066
a thousand needles
circling a burning light.

198
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,600
A flower's in the hand
that holds the chopsticks.

199
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,333
Beware, there may be
a few scary tricks.

200
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:15,333
I am but a messenger who
brings the tragic tale.

201
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,566
Heed my words, you who
try to steal my treasure.

202
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,733
This must be it!

203
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,233
I wonder what happened here?

204
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,533
FEMALE VOICE: (SINGING) Or
I will haunt you forever

205
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,466
and ever.

206
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,554
I sure hope Ranma and
Akane are able to find what

207
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:45,621
you're looking for, young lady.

208
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:48,787
Looks like I win.

209
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,087
Huh?

210
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,754
So now what?

211
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:56,087
Cheater.

212
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,254
I must have been
lucky, that's all.

213
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:01,387
How about another game?

214
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:05,454
And to show you what a
good sport I am, you start.

215
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,221
Hm.

216
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:08,721
RANMA: Hey, Akane,
you figure this

217
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,121
is the place where the raccoon
is supposed to have been

218
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:14,787
when he cried up to the sky?

219
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,821
The place where the
crane and turtle meet.

220
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:25,454
So what are we supposed
to be looking for?

221
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,687
Stand aside.

222
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,121
Huh?

223
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,287
Wha-- Kuno?

224
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:33,787
My apologies, Akane
Tendo, however I

225
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:37,087
am much too busy
to date with you.

226
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:37,821
Oh, well.

227
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,987
Maybe some other time.

228
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:43,954
Ranma Saotome, I cannot in
good conscience let you pilfer

229
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:47,387
the hidden treasure of
Furinkan High School

230
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:48,654
Treasure?

231
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:50,321
What treasure?

232
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:51,321
Hmph.

233
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,054
Do not attempt to
play dumb with me.

234
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:54,721
I am much too smart.

235
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:58,354
Can you stop being a jerk
for five minutes, and listen?

236
00:11:58,454 --> 00:11:59,787
We came up here
to find something

237
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,087
that that little ghost
girl says she lost.

238
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,454
Do not take me for a fool.

239
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:07,554
It is all here in black and
white, in the Furinkan High

240
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:09,954
School archives.

241
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,721
Our beloved
educational institution

242
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:15,087
sought to consolidate
the world, but the war

243
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:18,021
put our dreams of
purity to an end.

244
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,721
The future of Furinkan
rests upon my shoulders,

245
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:23,721
and I shall carry out
what fate has dealt me.

246
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:24,754
Oh, man.

247
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:27,221
Is he spreading it
thick or what, huh?

248
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:29,387
In the song, she
says heed my words

249
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:30,887
if you try to take the treasure.

250
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:34,721
Well, she's referring
to the hidden gold.

251
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,121
Whoa.

252
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:40,087
Maybe he's right, and there are
a few nuggers hidden up here.

253
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:42,121
It is time the
mighty sword of Kuno

254
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,121
ensures the fate
of Furinkan High,

255
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,221
that it may come to its
preordained fruition!

256
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:49,887
You must not interfere with
destiny, Ranma Saotome!

257
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:56,487
What do you think you're doing?

258
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:59,354
I told you, we don't care
about your stupid treasure.

259
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:01,454
Then I shall continue
my incessant pursuit.

260
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:09,587
For the honor of
Furinkan High School!

261
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:12,254
OK, Ranma, let's find
the crane and turtle.

262
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:20,087
Where the crane and
the turtle-- they meet?

263
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:24,854
OK.

264
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,421
Hey, Akane-- look!

265
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:26,962
Huh?

266
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:30,295
What?

267
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,521
Where the shadows
come together.

268
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,521
It's the place where the
crane and the turtle--

269
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,062
Meet!

270
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:46,795
Hm?

271
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:52,554
Wait for me!

272
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:56,421
I wonder where
this cave leads to?

273
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,521
OK.

274
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,787
On a lonely street and
a thousand needles.

275
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,421
So, you think the lonely
street could be this cave?

276
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:06,521
Then you'd better watch
out for the 1,000 needles.

277
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:10,121
Quit joking around, Ranma.

278
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:11,587
Huh?

279
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:13,054
Ah!

280
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,521
I think we found the needles!

281
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,321
A barrier such as this proves
the hidden treasure truly

282
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:19,187
exists!

283
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:22,154
And I shall find it!

284
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,621
[laughter]

285
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:26,621
Well, we'd better follow him.

286
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,087
Mm-hm.

287
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:30,087
I can sense I'm getting close!

288
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:39,954
Oh, no!

289
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:40,787
Aw, man!

290
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,354
How many more needles are there?

291
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,187
Boy, this is starting
to get serious.

292
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,187
Hm?

293
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:54,154
Look!

294
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:55,621
Look at what?

295
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,162
Huh?

296
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:01,087
Oh, man.

297
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:04,587
Don't tell me your reflection's
starting to spook you, Akane.

298
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,254
Huh?

299
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:09,387
FEMALE VOICE: (SINGING)
I will haunt you.

300
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:13,287
What the-- Why in
the world are you

301
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:15,621
saying you're going to haunt us?

302
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,154
Especially after
we told you we were

303
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:19,521
going to help you find
what you're looking for.

304
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:21,087
I'm sorry about
frightening you,

305
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,321
but it's what we ghosts
are supposed to say.

306
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:27,987
And I just thought maybe
I could help you look.

307
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:29,287
I guess.

308
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,687
Sure you can.

309
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:31,228
Let's go.

310
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:36,121
Ghosts are so lucky.

311
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:37,554
They don't have to walk.

312
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,887
Would you zip it?

313
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:42,021
Excuse me-- where
exactly are we going?

314
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:42,587
This way.

315
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:47,987
Now which way?

316
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:48,521
Right.

317
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:49,621
How come?

318
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:51,621
Well, the song has a
line about chopsticks,

319
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:54,354
and you hold chopsticks
with your right hand.

320
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,121
Right?

321
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:55,662
OK.

322
00:15:58,221 --> 00:15:59,121
Wait.

323
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:01,321
I think I remember
I was left handed.

324
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:03,987
So are you saying left?

325
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:06,521
But maybe I used my
right hand to eat.

326
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,454
Would you make up
your mind, already?

327
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:11,921
Excuse me!

328
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:12,821
Coming through!

329
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:16,787
Where's he going?

330
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:20,954
I don't think he knows, either.

331
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:22,987
I can almost smell my destiny!

332
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:23,528
Huh?

333
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:29,854
Huh?

334
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:31,554
This isn't a dead end.

335
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:33,554
This must be the
flowers in the hand that

336
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:35,154
holds the chopsticks part.

337
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:44,854
Oh, I'm getting angry!

338
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:49,662
Huh?

339
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:57,954
Huh?

340
00:16:58,054 --> 00:16:59,121
Just as I thought!

341
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:01,521
I'm on the right track.

342
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,854
I amaze even myself.

343
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:13,954
[screaming]

344
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:20,221
Hey, look.

345
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:22,154
Can you see that flower there?

346
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:23,187
You're right.

347
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:24,821
And the song mentions a flower.

348
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:29,654
Yeah.

349
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:31,321
But what does it mean?

350
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:37,021
It means-- we fall into a pit!

351
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:38,854
Oh, please, you can't
leave me here alone.

352
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:42,121
I'm too scared!

353
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:42,887
[shouting]

354
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,387
Would you get off of me?

355
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:47,654
Gee, I'm sorry.

356
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:49,154
Man!

357
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:49,695
Huh?

358
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:54,121
Save me!

359
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:59,621
Huh?

360
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,121
Ranma!

361
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:01,687
Akane!

362
00:18:01,787 --> 00:18:03,087
I'll save you!

363
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:20,654
Oh, boy, is that good.

364
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:24,054
Ah, yes, there's nothing like
a little peace and quiet.

365
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:25,787
[rumbling]

366
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,021
Where are we?

367
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:33,654
I think we're in
Toramasa's place.

368
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:34,621
Cretin!

369
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:36,854
It is all so clear to me now.

370
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:39,087
I know who stole the treasure.

371
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:40,854
It seems all the
clues have led us

372
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,987
to the real culprit who filched
the great Furinkan treasure,

373
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:47,721
and that felon can only be
Toramasa Kobayakawa himself.

374
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:50,054
Have you completely
lost your mind, Kuno?

375
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:52,321
All I have is pocket change.

376
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,821
Impossible.

377
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:59,087
Well, I guess that
means we still don't

378
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:00,787
know what the ghost forgot.

379
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,187
What we have to figure out
is what made the raccoon

380
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,287
on Kokkuri Mountain cry.

381
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:07,021
FEMALE VOICE: (SINGING)
On a lonely street

382
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,721
on a dark, lonely night,
a thousand needles

383
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:13,221
circling a burning light.

384
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:17,654
A flower's in the hand
that holds the chopsticks.

385
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:20,954
Beware, there may be
a few scary tricks.

386
00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:25,054
I am but a messenger who
brings the tragic tale.

387
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:29,654
Heed my words, you who
try to steal my treasure.

388
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:30,721
A raccoon.

389
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,721
A raccoon cried.

390
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:33,487
Whoa!

391
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:35,354
I got it!

392
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:36,554
Yes!

393
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,954
I just knew you would
solve it, oh wise master.

394
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:39,887
Hm.

395
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:41,354
Now, let me see.

396
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:43,654
I'm pretty sure
I saw it in here.

397
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:44,387
No, that's not it.

398
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:45,754
Wait a second.

399
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:46,621
Ah-ha!

400
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:47,721
I've found it!

401
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,787
Oh, my raccoon teddy!

402
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,821
Oh, thank you so much.

403
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:57,754
I missed you so.

404
00:19:57,854 --> 00:19:58,754
Ha ha ha!

405
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:00,454
Aw, it was nothing.

406
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:06,721
How-- how did
you figure it out?

407
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:08,021
Hm.

408
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:09,421
Yes.

409
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:12,521
It goes back to the first day
I started working in the store.

410
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:15,387
I was having a special
sale on notebooks.

411
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,821
The deal was buy one and
get a free stuffed raccoon.

412
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:20,954
Well, they all
sold like hotcakes,

413
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,854
except for this one
particular little girl

414
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:25,254
who bought a
notebook, but forgot

415
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,687
to take her free raccoon.

416
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,054
Ha ha!

417
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:32,421
So the raccoon was
just a stuffed toy?

418
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,487
But then explain
how the song ends.

419
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,921
You who try to steal
my treasure, for I

420
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,821
will haunt you forever.

421
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:39,821
Oh, right.

422
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:42,754
I can explain it.

423
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:45,654
My name is Kogane, which
translates to treasure,

424
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:47,387
and I wanted to work
that into my song,

425
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,487
as it rhymes with forever.

426
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,421
What?

427
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,521
Well, it is time.

428
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:54,987
I must go.

429
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,254
And thank you so much.

430
00:20:57,354 --> 00:20:58,387
Until we meet again.

431
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:02,721
Now I can rest in peace.

432
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:10,721
You solved that, and
now she's gone for good.

433
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:15,887
Well, I gotta tell ya, I'm sure
glad we finally got rid of her.

434
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:18,821
Then does this mean there was
never any Furinkan High School

435
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:19,954
treasure?

436
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:21,754
Oh, if it's treasures
you want to hear about,

437
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:23,887
have I got stories for you.

438
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:25,221
What do you mean?

439
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:27,921
Once upon a time, King
Solomon and me were--

440
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:28,954
For Pete's sake.

441
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:29,887
Jeez.

442
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:30,954
TORAMASA: When he
asked if I could

443
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:32,587
hide his treasure for him.

444
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:33,554
At first I tried--

445
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:34,095
Enough!

446
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:45,921
[theme music]

447
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:17,921
NARRATOR: One
morning, Ranma woke up

448
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,854
to find Happosai
literally stuck on him!

449
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,087
Huh?

450
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:24,054
What do you mean, they
could be like that forever?

451
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:28,254
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Master and Student-- Forever?

452
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:31,854
We'll see ya there!
