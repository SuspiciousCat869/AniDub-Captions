00:00:18,833 --> 00:01:30,433
THEME SONG: [sung in japanese]

2
00:01:39,068 --> 00:01:40,468
NABIKI (VOICEOVER):
This is a record

3
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:41,968
of a girl who has
devoted her life

4
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,202
to the cooking of okonomiyaki.

5
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:46,902
A secret sauce which she
had been aging for 10 years

6
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:48,302
turned out badly.

7
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,135
But in fact, it
was Ranma's fault

8
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,968
as he had replaced her
sauce with one of his own.

9
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:01,435
So to recover from the anguish
of ruining what she thought

10
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,068
was a sauce of her
own making, Ukyo

11
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:08,102
began to stay at
the Tendo residence.

12
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:10,635
I am starting to smell a rat.

13
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:12,335
Are you sure there
isn't something

14
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:13,668
you're not telling me?

15
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,135
It's kind of hard to explain
the relationship between me

16
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:16,902
and Ukyo.

17
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,268
You wouldn't understand.

18
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,268
NABIKI (VOICEOVER): But there
was still one more surprise

19
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:21,668
to come for Ranma and Akane.

20
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:22,768
OK.

21
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:26,102
If it tastes good, then
you have to promise

22
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:29,168
that you will look after
me for the rest of my life.

23
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:30,668
Yeah, OK!

24
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:32,602
NABIKI (VOICEOVER): When
Akane found this out,

25
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,135
she was infuriated.

26
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:36,302
Not only had Ukyo
moved in, but now she

27
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:38,535
realized Ranma had
pledged himself to her.

28
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:42,268
It was up to me to
diffuse the situation.

29
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:45,802
Our happy couple
are in fact married!

30
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:49,368
Well, we're just
your average couple,

31
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:50,602
and we had a little argument.

32
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:52,535
Oh, darling, would you stop it.

33
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:53,502
[laughing]

34
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:59,968
NABIKI (VOICEOVER): "Ukyo's
Secret Sauce, Part Two."

35
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,068
RANMA: Finally, lunchtime.

36
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:01,635
I'm starving.

37
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:06,002
Hey, want to grab something?

38
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:06,668
Yeah, OK.

39
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:07,735
Sounds great.

40
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:09,235
AKANE: Ranma!

41
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,935
I brought your lunch.

42
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:13,868
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Oh
yeah, that's right.

43
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:17,235
Akane and me are
supposed to be married.

44
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:20,035
Sorry, uh, I brought lunch.

45
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:21,335
Too bad.

46
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:25,102
Akane, I'm so happy
you brought me lunch.

47
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:26,102
Has he gone nuts?

48
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:28,102
It's like he's under her spell.

49
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,035
Made it just for you.

50
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:31,268
Here you go.

51
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,902
You made it?

52
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:35,368
[laughs nervously]

53
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:38,868
Excuse me, we're married!

54
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:39,802
[groans]

55
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:44,268
Or did you forget, darling?

56
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:45,035
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,202
What did she say?

58
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:47,668
Sounded like married.

59
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:49,102
Yeah, that's what I heard too.

60
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:51,035
Man, you gotta feel for Ranma.

61
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:52,735
Wait a sec.

62
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:54,735
Come on, you guys,
you gotta believe me.

63
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,902
This is not what
you think it is.

64
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:00,468
[whimpers]

65
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:01,568
[laughs nervously]

66
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:03,402
We're married, right?

67
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,135
RANMA: Yeah.

68
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:04,702
Right.

69
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:05,243
Sure.

70
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:05,902
[laughs]

71
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,368
I don't believe this.

72
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:09,835
Could somebody please pinch me?

73
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:12,102
AKANE: Doesn't it
look delicious?

74
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:13,302
Ah!

75
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:14,868
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Oh well, gotta eat.

76
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:15,802
So, how is it?

77
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:16,935
Putrid.

78
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:19,102
What was that, hon?

79
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:21,002
Why, it's delicious!

80
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:22,435
Then have another bite.

81
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:24,468
Thanks, but I think I'm full.

82
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:25,502
So?

83
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:27,702
Your love alone has
filled me up, OK?

84
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:28,768
[sighs]

85
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,935
Why, thank you.

86
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:33,268
[laughs]

87
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:36,468
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Man, you look good.

88
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,235
Don't they seem
a little awkward?

89
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:39,702
Ranma looks strained.

90
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:42,535
Happy couples fight
a lot, so they say.

91
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:44,368
Everybody's different, I guess.

92
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,535
Or that they really
don't get along.

93
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:47,076
Hmph.

94
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:52,535
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
The whole world

95
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:54,368
might think we're just engaged.

96
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:57,302
RANMA (VOICEOVER): But the
truth is we're hitched.

97
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,402
UKYO (VOICEOVER): I'm
sure the only reason Ranma

98
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:02,868
honey is putting up this act
is because Akane's forcing him.

99
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,635
I'm not going to give
up without a fight.

100
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,102
RANMA: But I don't get it.

101
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:11,368
You're really giving up
okonomiyaki for good?

102
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:12,202
Why?

103
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,035
Is there something bugging you?

104
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,468
UKYO: This is my
battle as a woman.

105
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:18,868
I'm shutting down
my okonomiyaki shop

106
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:23,935
because a real woman
only cooks for her man.

107
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:27,835
Catch my drift, Akane?

108
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,302
[groans]

109
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:32,302
Ah!

110
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:40,235
[grunting]

111
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,702
[laughs nervously]

112
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:45,668
[bell rings]

113
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,135
AKANE: Oh, darling!

114
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:53,602
Ranma, honey!

115
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:56,602
Open wide, sweetheart.

116
00:05:56,702 --> 00:05:58,568
Come on, hon, try mine first.

117
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:00,168
She doesn't give up, does she?

118
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:03,802
Oh, Ranma looks so happy.

119
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:06,302
And isn't this all because
you made an arrangement

120
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:10,168
with Ukyo's father to betroth
Ranma to Ukyo, eh, Saotome?

121
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,135
Uh?

122
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:12,168
I thought so.

123
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:19,068
AKANE: Nabiki, what
are you doing here?

124
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:20,202
OK.

125
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,968
If you're going to play
the married couple bit,

126
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:24,068
you two are going to have
to share the same room.

127
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,002
Huh?

128
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:27,968
You're out of
your mind, Nabiki!

129
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,368
Yeah, come on!

130
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:31,435
Why the heck would I
want to room with her?

131
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:33,635
Back off, jerk.

132
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:35,268
Are you two splitting up?

133
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:36,468
Hm?

134
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,802
Oh, honey, don't you
think it's time we turn in?

135
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:41,002
Why, yes, of course, darling.

136
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:42,802
Good night.

137
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,135
They're joking.

138
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,668
Well, I suppose there's really
only one way to find out,

139
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:47,368
isn't there?

140
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:49,568
Huh?

141
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:50,668
1,000 yen, please.

142
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:51,802
AKANE: Where are you going?

143
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:54,268
Oh, I'm gonna
sleep on the roof.

144
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:56,335
That's what you want, isn't it?

145
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:57,602
You don't have to.

146
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:59,568
Huh?

147
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,402
What?

148
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:01,335
Were you hoping for something?

149
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:02,968
Give me a break.

150
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:03,868
Heh.

151
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,002
So you say.

152
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:06,135
AKANE: You idiot!

153
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:07,002
Come on, you two.

154
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:08,368
You're married, remember?

155
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:10,735
You'll blow everything
if you're not careful.

156
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,535
That's why I brought this.

157
00:07:12,635 --> 00:07:14,002
Only 500 yen a bucket.

158
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:14,902
RANMA: That's it.

159
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,102
If I'm a girl, problem solved.

160
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:23,202
I still don't believe
they're married.

161
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:23,768
[gasps]

162
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:25,702
Take a look.

163
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:28,435
Nabiki, whose side
are you on anyway?

164
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,535
The side with cash.

165
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,102
[gulps]

166
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:36,168
Oh, man that was refreshing.

167
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:37,235

00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,768
This is ridiculous.

174
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,068
Let's turn in.

175
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:16,102
You're right.

00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:17,035
I mean, really.

Hey, Akane, you don't have to
worry about me trying anything

180
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:30,202
'cause you're not even my type.

00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,202
Oh please, Ranma
like you scare me.

Go for it.

Oh, you are really starting
to get on my nerves.

185
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:41,468
And you're getting on mine.

Oh man, will you look at her?

192
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:15,635
Sleeping like a little baby.

Where have you been?

You've got the wrong--

Oh man, I can't take this.

203
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:55,368
I've gotta get Ukyo to
leave before I go crazy.

204
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,835
Morning!

205
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:57,802
Huh?

206
00:09:57,902 --> 00:09:59,735
Good morning, dear.

207
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,368
Breakfast is all ready.

00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,702
Wha?

00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:06,835
UKYO: Come and get it
before it gets cold.

Uh, um, Ukyo?

211
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,435
Can I get you some rice, dear?

212
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,235
Wait, we gotta talk.

213
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:15,268
Don't you worry about that.

214
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:18,035
If it's about last night,
every man has an affair or two.

Huh?

216
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,135
Last night?

217
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,068
No, no, wait!

218
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,102
Nothing happened!

219
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:23,568
But I do understand.

220
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:25,835
I don't want to hear
your excuses, Ranma.

221
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,035
Huh?

222
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:29,468
But don't you think I'm
not hurt by your actions.

223
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,602
I'm nobody's fool!

Hey, wait!

226
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:35,402
You got to let me explain!

227
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,035
I-- I never thought
you were a fool.

228
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,802
And to think I trusted you.

[cries]

230
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:49,902
And it's because of you I
closed down my okonomiyaki shop.

231
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:52,335
I thought you were going
to look after me forever.

RANMA (VOICEOVER): Oh, man.

233
00:10:56,835 --> 00:11:01,868
I've got to get myself
out of this mess.

234
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:02,668
Ukyo?

235
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:04,335
Huh?

236
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:05,302
Don't worry.

237
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:07,235
I'll keep my promise
no matter what.

238
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:09,368
Do you really mean that?

239
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,102
Mm-hmm.

Almost free and clear.

00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:55,835
I better finish my shopping.

I don't have much time to
make Ranma honey's dinner.

I'm almost done.

Sure, take your time.

00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:28,468
I do this for a living.

00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:29,935

00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:38,835
I retired.

[crowd chatters]

270
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:44,702
UKYO (VOICEOVER):
I gave up my career

271
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:47,502
so that I could spend the
rest of my life with Ranma.

272
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:55,268
RANMA (VOICEOVER): I'm gonna
get Ukyo to dump me, and dump me

273
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:57,635
right away.

274
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,002
I'll look after
you forever, Ukyo.

UKYO (VOICEOVER): I'm so happy.

276
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,335
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
And then I'll be

277
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,168
the worst husband in the world.

278
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:08,268
UKYO (VOICEOVER): I
can't take it anymore.

279
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:11,968
I'm leaving, you Ranma.

Yeah, the perfect plan.

So what are you making, Ukyo?

00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:25,168
Oh, hey there, Kasumi.

286
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:27,602
Mm, a little bit of everything.

287
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:29,568
Everything is so
uniquely shaped, isn't it?

288
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:30,109
Huh?

289
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:39,602
I guess I'll fix it.

290
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:44,135
NABIKI: Akane, aren't you even
going to try to stop Ranma?

291
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:45,835
I don't think so.

292
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,602
Honestly, I don't
think he's worth it.

293
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,502
Are you sure you won't
regret it later, Akane?

294
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:52,635
I, uh--

295
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:55,268
Well, sure, Ranma may
be stupid, wishy-washy,

296
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,102
inconsiderate, and a real jerk.

297
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:01,668
Huh?

298
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:03,435
You know, maybe
it's best this way.

Dinner's ready!

302
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,168
Wow, who whipped
up all this grub?

303
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:16,568
You know, Ranma, Ukyo
is a really good cook.

304
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:17,968
Hm.

305
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:19,102
OK.

306
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:21,502
This is a bit extreme,
but I have to do this.

307
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:22,835
Here goes.

308

309
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:24,768
I can't eat this crud!

What do you think you're doing?

What in the--

313
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:29,868
Ranma?

316
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:34,468
I did it.

318
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,902
AKANE: What do you
think you're doing?

319
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,035
Huh?

320
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:39,002
Uh, uh.

321
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:40,202
[chuckles nervously]

322
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:42,602
It's a good thing we
managed to save the dinner.

323
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:46,235
I don't have any idea why you
did what you just did, Ranma.

324
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:51,235
But in my house, I
won't stand for it!

[munching]

326
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:58,735
Could either of you
please pass me the sauce?

327
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:00,535
Huh?

328
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:01,202
Sure.

329
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:03,068
Here you go, father.

330
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:03,902

Ahh!

00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:26,235
KASUMI: Ukyo?

337
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:27,002
Huh?

338
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:27,543
Huh?

339
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:32,902
[pants]

340
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,535
Where are my manners?

341
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:35,668
Sorry.

342
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,002
[groans]

343
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,968
Well, I guess it's
time I try plan B.

344
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:42,935
[stomach rumbles]

345
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:47,335
Hey, what's up?

346
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:49,935
I'm going to go for the big
score at the horse tracks.

347
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:52,768
I'm selling this
stuff for seed money.

348
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,735
I know you'll probably
want to dump me now

349
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:57,268
that you know about my
gambling problem, won't you?

350
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,802
(LAUGHING) Oh, if it's money
you need, I'll give it to you,

351
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:01,035
Ranma.

352
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:01,902
How much do you need?

353
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:02,435
[gasps]

354
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:02,968
[sighs]

355
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,168
I'll go next time.

356
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,168
Well, time for plan C. Mwah.

357
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,835
First, the evidence
of infidelity.

358
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,568
Ranma, what are doing out here?

359
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:15,202
[screams]

360
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:17,102
You'll catch cold.

361
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:18,868
I won't be home tonight.

362
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,668
Where are you going?

363
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,702
Duh, I'm gonna go
see my mistress.

364
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:24,835
AKANE: (ANGRILY) Who are
you calling your mistress?

365
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:25,468
[bang]

366
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,002
Ahh!

367
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:27,635
Hear me out!

368
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:28,435
You're despicable.

369
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:33,802
You're trying to get
Ukyo to hate you?

370
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:37,035
Yeah, and here I thought it
was the perfect plan, too.

371
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:38,502
You're so stupid.

372
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:39,835
Hm?

373
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,702
Why don't you just act the
same way as you do around me?

374
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:43,968
Hm?

375
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:48,702
You're uncute, unsexy, clumsy,
and built like a brick!

376
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,402
Hold on a minute, Akane.

377
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:51,902
Have I been hurting
your feelings?

378
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:53,068
Hm.

379
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,068
Are you saying you
don't like me at all?

380
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,235
Uh, don't be silly.

381
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:59,002
I was just using
it as an example.

382
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,235
I'm fine, really.

383
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,335
Hm, I thought so.

384
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,568
After all, a dimwit
girl like you--

385
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:07,502
(ANGRILY) Now go act
that way in front of Ukyo!

386
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:11,002
[screams]

387
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:13,802
UKYO (VOICEOVER): If he
thinks he can leave me,

388
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,135
he's got another thing coming.

389
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,835
Hmph!

390
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:18,902
RANMA (VOICEOVER): OK.

391
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:22,902
All I gotta do is
pretend Ukyo is Akane.

392
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:24,202
Yo, Ukyo!

393
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:25,602
Huh?

394
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:27,968
Ah!

395
00:17:28,068 --> 00:17:28,802
[grunts]

396
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:30,602
She must have eaten her sauce.

397
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:32,502
What you do that for?

398
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:37,735
Because it's what brought us
together, and together forever.

399
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:41,068
But why in the world
were you eating it?

400
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:44,035
Don't you remember when I
told you I spilled your sauce

401
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:46,435
and made the replacement
with whatever?

402
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:48,702
It doesn't matter, Ranma.

403
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,235
Ukyo, I never knew that
you felt so strongly--

404
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:51,935
[screams]

405
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:54,035
Get on with it, Ranma!

406
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:55,935
Why are you so
darned wishy-washy?

407
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,668
Um, uh, well, you know.

408
00:17:58,768 --> 00:17:59,535
She's right.

409
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:00,635
(IN UNISON) Huh?

410
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:04,202
Who do you want to be with?

411
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:19,135
Well, uh-- OK, then.

412
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:21,002
I'll settle this matter.

413
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:22,402
(IN UNISON) Huh?

414
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,568
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Everything
started with this stupid sauce,

415
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,102
and that's how it's gonna end.

416
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,702
R-- Ranma, does this mean--

417
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,235
This is how I'm gonna
make up for this sauce.

418
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,702
[grunts]

419
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:43,135

00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:44,235
[clears throat]

421
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:45,135
Ranma.

422
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:46,602
Oh my, no.

423
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:48,568
[gulps]

424
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:50,035

00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:06,702
[crash]

427
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:07,702
Ranma!

428
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:09,035
Is he dead?

429
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,535
[growls]

430
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:15,668
[groans]

431
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:17,635
Are those?

432
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:19,335
They're noodles.

433
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:22,968
[grunts]

434
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:23,902
Now what?

435
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,902
Seaweed and bonito.

436
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:26,902
[grunts]

437
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,368
[whimpers]

438
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:45,568
Why is she grilling
him like that?

439
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,068
This is a--

440
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:49,202
Yes, it's a
conditioned response.

441
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:53,468
KASUMI: Then that means--

442
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,668
That the sauce
is triggering it.

443
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:58,502
So now that Ranma drank
all that okonomiyaki sauce,

444
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,635
he's like batter
ready to be cooked.

445
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,468
That's not okonomiyaki
you're frying.

446
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:07,135
Can't you see it's Ranma?

447
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:08,135
Huh?

448
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:09,868
Wha-- What am I doing?

449
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:17,168
She brought out all of
her okonomiyaki utensils.

450
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:19,868
She even went as far as to
put on her okonomiyaki uniform.

451
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,768
Well, I think she's loopy.

452
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:25,968
She sure likes to make
okonomiyaki, doesn't she?

453
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:28,302
I tried to quit
making okonomiyaki,

454
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:31,502
but I always had this
empty feeling inside.

455
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:32,084
RANMA: Ukyo.

456
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:34,068
Huh?

457
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,235
It's OK.

458
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,602
UKYO: Ranma.

459
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,335
When you're making okonomiyaki,
you look the happiest, Ukyo.

460
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:42,135
[whimpers]

461
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:43,535
Ukyo?

462
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:48,035
I'm so sorry, Ranma, for
being a cook before a woman.

463
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,435
Some day, when I'm the
best okonomiyaki chef,

464
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:56,635
I'll come back for you.

465
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:57,802
OK, Ramna?

466
00:20:57,902 --> 00:20:59,402
(WEAKLY) OK.

467
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:00,668
[growls]

468
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:03,868
And when that time comes,
Akane, we'll settle this.

469
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:07,068
You can try, but Ranma's
not going anywhere.

470
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:10,535
Well, until that time,
I'll see you all later.

471
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,235
NABIKI (VOICEOVER):
And so the woman

472
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:16,002
who devotes her life to making
okonomiyaki, Ukyo Kuonji,

473
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:19,802
left to continue her training
to become the best okonomiyaki

474
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:21,235
chef in all of Japan.

475
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:22,535
[groans]

476
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:25,202
If anyone else drank that
much sauce, they'd be dead.

477
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,068
NABIKI (VOICEOVER):
Ranma, on the other hand,

478
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,868
is far from recovery.

479
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:32,202
But he's a tough boy, and it'd
take a lot more than bad sauce

480
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:33,435
to put him down for long.

481
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:36,835
[whimpers]

482
00:22:02,302 --> 00:23:15,868
THEME SONG: [sung in japanese]

483
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:18,943
ANNOUNCER: The matriarch of
the School of Martial Arts Tea

484
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:20,676
Ceremony has been kidnapped.

485
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,043
What's Santaro going to do?

486
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:25,843
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
the missing matriarch

487
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,409
of martial arts tea.

488
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:29,243
We'll see you there.
