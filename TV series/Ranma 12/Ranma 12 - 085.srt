[theme song in japanese]

2
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,000
-There must be a storm coming.

3
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,633
Just look at sky.

4
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,066
I don't like to close
early, but, oh, well.

5
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,833
And there we go.

6
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,266
Who's there?

7
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:06,400
Playing cards?

8
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,966
-You lose, Ukyo.

9
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,800
-Who are you?

10
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,366
Show yourself.

11
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,733
-Ah, you have one pair, where
as I hold a Royal Straight.

12
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,633
-It's you, isn't it?

13
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,266
ANNOUNCER: The Dumbest
Bet in History.

14
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:32,600
-You sure it was
the Gambling King?

15
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,700
-Of course, I am.

16
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,066
-What king?

17
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,166
How would you guys
know someone like that?

18
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,000
-Me and Ranma first met
him about 10 years ago.

19
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,866
He's probably here because
he wants to pay us back.

20
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,533
GAMBLING KING: I call
that a good match.

21
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,933
You all lose.

22
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:49,766
Ah, Ranma Saotome.

23
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,666
You, sir, are
definitely no gentleman.

24
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:57,733
If you were, you would not
have made me come all this way

25
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,700
to collect on a debt you,
yourself, made 10 years ago.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,100
I have one thing to say to you.

27
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:04,933
-Whatever is he
talking about, huh?

28
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,966
-Come now, Son.

29
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,333
That's no way for
you to treat a guest.

30
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,566
-I don't know him.

31
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,600
-Ah, then perhaps
you'll remember

32
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,933
a written IOU in
your own handwriting?

33
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,766
-A debt is a debt, Son.

34
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:21,033
And the word of a martial
artist must never be broken.

35
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:24,466
Give him what he wants,
and I'm sure he'll go away.

36
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:27,366
-Maybe you'd better tell
us what you promised him.

37
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,533
-Ah, who knows?

38
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,900
Whatever it was, I'm
sure it wasn't that much.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,233
-Well, then, why don't
we just give it to him.

40
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,800
As you can see, as
published in writing,

41
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,100
I'm here to claim
the Tendo Dojo.

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,100
-Aaah.

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,641
-Hmm?

44
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,533
Ranma, cut it out!

45
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:52,500
I want you to take a look at
that, and tell me if it's true.

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,500
-Well, is this your handwriting?

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,533
Yes or no.

48
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,333
-I wish I could say
it wasn't, but yeah.

49
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,033
-So then, you have
until tomorrow

50
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,133
to remove your belongings.

51
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:09,874
Goodnight.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,766
-I-- uh, I-- I, uh--

53
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,466
-A debt is a debt, Son.

54
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:20,833
There's no escaping that.

55
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:24,733
That is until you go and
get it back from him.

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,241
-Ranma.

57
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:31,200
UKYO: Kicked you out, huh?

58
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,400
Guess there's no going back.

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,633
-Stupid, lousy Gambling King.

60
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,400
-Hey, I've got an idea.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,733
Did you hear me?

62
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,566
-Hmm?

63
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,100
-Why not stay with me a while.

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
It'll be fun.

65
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,566
-Gee, is that convenient?

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,033
-You're kidding.

67
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,433
Ranma actually lost the
Dojo to a con artist?

68
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:54,366
-Yes.

69
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,000
Father seems a bit miffed.

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,833
-Geez, I wonder why?

71
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,033
-I don't believe it.

72
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,833
Ukyo's got him right
where she wants him.

73
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:06,200
Ranma's so stupid, he's
liable to fall for anything.

74
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,166
-What will Ranma
do, do you think?

75
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,466
-What do you think?

76
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,166
Switch over to Ukyo, of course.

77
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:12,866
-Huh?

78
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:13,966
What makes you say that?

79
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,433
-Remember, they are
fiances, you know.

80
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,233
-That's true, and he
does so love to eat.

81
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:24,900
Akane, here.

82
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,566
-And what's this?

83
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,500
-It's a change of clothes.

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,033
-And why does he need these?

85
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,066
-Won't he be needing
them since he'll

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,900
be staying with Ukyo a while?

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:37,841
-Hmm.

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,666
It's unlocked.

89
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,066
How careless of them.

90
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,066
Is anyone--

91
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,533
UKYO: Geez, will you make
up your mind already?

92
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:55,866
What's the big deal?

93
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,800
Just pick the one you want
and throw the other one away.

94
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,166
RANMA: It's just I
can't make up my mind.

95
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:05,233
UKYO: How long do I
have to wait, huh?

96
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,033
RANMA: I don't know, maybe--

97
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,800
-I don't believe it.

98
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,933
RANMA: I choose here then.

99
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:10,733
UKYO: You musn't.

100
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,641
-Ranma.

101
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:19,533
-Hey, there's, Akane.

102
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:20,966
What's up?

103
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:21,633
-Nothing.

104
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,233
So what's all this?

105
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:23,774
-Training.

106
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,200
My only hope is
to get good enough

107
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
to win the Dojo back from him.

108
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,633
-Oh, wow, what a good idea.

109
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:31,966
Mind if I help, too?

110
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,166
-Sure, no prob.

111
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,966
Don't think I'll
need you, though.

112
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,233
-Oh, good.

113
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,500
I know Dad will be relieved.

114
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,900
UKYO: Sorry, you lose.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,533
RANMA: Again.

116
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:42,866
UKYO: Yea, we won.

117
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:43,433
RANMA: Again.

118
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:44,900
UKYO: Beat you.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,866
RANMA: Again.

120
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:47,800
UKYO: Ah, too bad.

121
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,333
RANMA: Again.

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,166
So why are guys so
good at this anyway?

123
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:55,233
-We're not, stupid.

124
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:55,774
-Duh.

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,300
-Casino King.

126
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,433
-Maybe it's an arcade.

127
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:08,366
Let's go.

128
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,366
-Go to the Tendo Dojo, then--

129
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:12,333
-Wow, here it is.

130
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:12,874
Come on.

131
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,766
-You lose.

132
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:19,666
-Come on, kids, place your bets.

133
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:20,900
Let's get ready.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,666
-Nabiki, what are you--

135
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:23,207
-Working.

136
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:26,666
OK, who's in?

137
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:27,207
You?

138
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,000
You, too?

139
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,300
What about you, kid?

140
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,666
Ah, too bad.

141
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:31,433
-Oh, dear.

142
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,233
-I hereby challenge you.

143
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,633
-Bet accepted.

144
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,566
But you'll have to offer me some
sort of worthwhile collateral.

145
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,300
-I'll give you the Tendo
House Tea Room if I lose.

146
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,400
-Too bad, you lose.

147
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,466
-Oh, dear.

148
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,300
-Daddy.

149
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,500
-I challenge you again.

150
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,033
RANMA: Not so fast.

151
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:49,766
He's mine.

152
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:55,100
Let's see how well you
do now that I'm prepared.

153
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,666
-And your collateral?

154
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,600
-I bet the Tendo entryway.

155
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,500
Well, what do you say?

156
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,533
Are you ready to play me or not?

157
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,533
-Oh, so sorry.

158
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,633
-Oh, you idiot.

159
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,933
I should have known
better than to trust him.

160
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:11,566
Fine.

161
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,033
I'll do it myself.

162
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,833
I bet the Tendo kitchen.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,366
UKYO: You loose.

164
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,800
SOUN: The Tendo hallway.

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,733
GAMBLING KING: You lose again.

166
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,300
SOUN: The stairs.

167
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,766
GAMBLING KING: And
you lose again.

168
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,000
SOUN: The bathroom.

169
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,233
GAMBLING KING: You lose.

170
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,966
SOUN: Akane's room.

171
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,633
GAMBLING KING: You lose again.

172
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:33,900
SOUN: Nabiki's room.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,566
-OK, that does it.

174
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,900
-I can't take it anymore.

175
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:40,666
-Deal.

176
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:42,900
-The odds are the
same either way.

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,100
Don't you know the
House always wins?

178
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,633
-What was that you said?

179
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,900
-Nabiki, you beat him.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,833
-That's our Nabiki.

181
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,866
-I'm ready whenever you are.

182
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:58,800
-She's good.

183
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,333
In all my long
years on the road,

184
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:02,833
I've never had such
a dangerous opponent.

185
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:06,166
Then, again, she
is in high school.

186
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:11,633
-You don't suppose he's
only able to beat children?

187
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:12,866
-Could be.

188
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,833
-Does that mean my own
daughter thinks I'm stupid?

189
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:16,374
-Yes.

190
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:16,874
-Ranma.

191
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,600
-And the tea room, too.

192
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,133
All that's left now
is the Dojo itself.

193
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,133
-I may never live this down.

194
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,633
-Pick a card.

195
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,100
-It all comes down to this.

196
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,266
-Come on in.

197
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,300
Sit wherever you want.

198
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,666
-Wow, who's the
new waitress, huh?

199
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,166
-She's not too bad, huh?

200
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,900
Don't forget those
IOUs you wrote to me.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,133
-Oh.

202
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:52,033
Why don't I know when to quit?

203
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,500
-So shall we train
tonight as well, Ranma?

204
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:15,066
Unless, well, maybe you'd
rather go back to Akane instead.

205
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,866
-Don't be stupid.

206
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,800
Besides, it's not
like I can go back

207
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,133
until I figure out how to
beat the Gambling King.

208
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:23,674
-Really?

209
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,133
-Uh-hmm.

210
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,866
-That is so wonderful.

211
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,000
That means you won't
ever go back then.

212
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,466
-What was that supposed to mean?

213
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,733
-At this rate, we've
got plenty of time.

214
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,800
And the best part is, I'll
have you all to myself.

215
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,200
Uh, ah.

216
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,266
So much for our privacy.

217
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:50,933
-We're so sorry, but
we've no place else to go.

218
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,133
-How could you?

219
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,466
-I told you he was
cheating, Daddy.

220
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,266
Now do you believe me?

221
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
UKYO: It must've been
more than 10 years ago.

222
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,566
The King was gambling as usual.

223
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,033
-Ah, too bad, you lose.

224
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:18,933
-What?

225
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,366
You big bully.

226
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,766
Stealing allowances
from little kids.

227
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,533
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

228
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,800
Has about you try
me, instead, huh?

229
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,166
-And what's your game?

230
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,300
-Old Maid.

231
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,933
-I accept.

232
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:34,774
-Aaah.

233
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,433
-Oh, you lose.

234
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:38,400
UKYO: Play me again.

235
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,400
GAMBLING KING: You lose.

236
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,941
UKYO: Again.

237
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,100
GAMBLING KING: You lose.

238
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,233
-And then?

239
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,166
-We were down to the last bet.

240
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,500
The only thing left was the
family okonomiyaki cart.

241
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,933
Ranma, I want revenge.

242
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,133
-Sure, OK.

243
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,466
Listen up, you.

244
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,233
Now you've got to play me.

245
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,700
-Aaah.

246
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,033
-Just too bad.

247
00:11:59,133 --> 00:11:59,900
RANMA: Play me again.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,900
GAMBLING KING: You lose.

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,900
RANMA: Again.

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,900
GAMBLING KING: You lose.

251
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,700
Why don't you move
it along, kid.

252
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,966
You've got nothing
left to gamble.

253
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:09,866
-Oh, yeah?

254
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,900
Then take a look at this.

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,866
-Ah, and what is this
supposed to be then.

256
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,533
-It's an IOU for the Tendo Dojo.

257
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,966
It belongs to my
dad's friend, but I'm

258
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,766
supposed to get
it when I'm older.

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,366
-Kid, it's a pleasure
doing business with you.

260
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:26,733
-Why you dirty little--

261
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,000
-Listen, I was just a kid.

262
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,033
I didn't know what
I was getting into.

263
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,866
-What did you say?

264
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:36,600
-I'm sorry, OK?

265
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,966
-Yeah, I'll bet you are.

266
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:42,166
-Wait, Akane, you still
haven't heard the whole story.

267
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,966
-Take that, jerk.

268
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,100
-Now who's sorry?

269
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,166
-I'll get you for this.

270
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,666
-So we rolled him up and
dumped him in the river.

271
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:55,166
-No, ah, no wonder he's come
after you two seeking revenge.

272
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,500
-Hold on, OK?

273
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,066
The story's not over.

274
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,000
-Hey, the Gambling King left
all his cards here on the lawn.

275
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,866
-Ukyo, look, they're all jokers.

276
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,666
-He set us up.

277
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:08,433
-And that's why this is
all the King's fault.

278
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,433
OK, let's train for tomorrow.

279
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:13,466
-That's what I got.

280
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:14,133
-Here's mine.

281
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
-Oh, man.

282
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,833
-I'm guessing he can't
play at all, can he?

283
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,100
-He's going to have to.

284
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,066
There's not much time.

285
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,200
We just can't keep imposing
on you forever, right, Ukyo?

286
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,933
-You know, I wouldn't mind
if it were just Ranma.

287
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,366
-No, I'm sure you wouldn't.

288
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,366
-It won't be for
much longer, Akane.

289
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,333
I'll get the Dojo
and the house back.

290
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:37,866
I swear.

291
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,500
-Oh, and how do you
plan to do that, huh?

292
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,566
-So would you like me to tell
you how you can beat him?

293
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,107
-Nabiki.

294
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,733
-As the only woman
ever to beat him,

295
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,000
I know what I'm talking about.

296
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,000
While it's true he
cheated at the end,

297
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,200
I did notice something.

298
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,700
He has one extremely
important bad habit.

299
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
-A bad habit.

300
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,333
-Such as?

301
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,066
-Observe.

302
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,600
Let's say I put the
cards out like this.

303
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,866
If I move one a little higher,
he'll always go for it.

304
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,633
-Are you sure?

305
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:12,900
-Gimme a break, you guys.

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,033
What kind of loser would
fall for a trick like that?

307
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,633
-Gee, Ranma, you tell us.

308
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,433
-Now there's one
other thing you should

309
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,166
look for to help you beat him.

310
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,500
-And what's that?

311
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,566
-Watch his face closely
as you're about to draw.

312
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,966
If the card you pick is the
Old Main, he gets really happy.

313
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,333
That's how you know to
draw a different card.

314
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:43,666
And then, if he
gets really sad--

315
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:46,033
He hasn't got a chance has he?

316
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,133
-He never did.

317
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,200
-Show yourself.

318
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:55,500
Don't you think we should
have someone else do this?

319
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,666
I hope so for our sakes.

320
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,833
-Oh, come on now.

321
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,433
Don't you know not to
quit while you're ahead?

322
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,233
I swear, not only will
I win back our house,

323
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,466
but I'll get the
Dojo back as well.

324
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:08,533
-Say, shouldn't Ranma be here?

325
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,500
-He should, but--

326
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,700
-I don't think there's any
point in facing him yet.

327
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,300
I still have to work
on my training a bit.

328
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,366
-Or so he said.

329
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:19,400
-Draw.

330
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,266
-Look, I'll still
beat you, you know.

331
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,466
-Ow.

332
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:31,800
-Don't you have any control
of your face at all?

333
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,400
You're never going
to win at this rate.

334
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,433
-Then I'll just have
to keep practicing,

335
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,633
because I ain't stopping
until I'm a complete blank.

336
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:40,766
-I win.

337
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,233
I'm taking my room back.

338
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,300
-I win.

339
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,066
I'll take the
kitchen, thank you.

340
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,500
-And I'll be taking
back my room.

341
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,533
-He'll think twice messing
with us, right girls?

342
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:54,966
-Oh, so sorry.

343
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:55,966
-Oh, honestly.

344
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,800
Just one more game.

345
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,733
That's better.

346
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,133
Tea room, please.

347
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,066
VOICEOVERS: And
I've got the hall.

348
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,266
GAMBLING KING: Hey, give me
another chance, will you?

349
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:05,600
VOICEOVERS: Aha, got the stairs.

350
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,600
VOICEOVERS: The bathroom,
if you don't mind.

351
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,433
VOICEOVERS: And
the garden for me.

352
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,600
VOICEOVERS: The hall, please.

353
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,866
-Well, I guess that
pretty much does it.

354
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,400
Shall we call it quits then?

355
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,400
-True.

356
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,200
I ought to be
starting dinner soon.

357
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,866
-All that's left
now is the Dojo.

358
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,633
I stake the tea
room as collateral.

359
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,733
Huh?

360
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,266
-Well, I've got a thing
or two to say about that.

361
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,700
-Enough is enough.

362
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,366
-But, girls.

363
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,966
-Don't worry Dad, I can
take over from here.

364
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,100
-Akane?

365
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,866
-Too bad you couldn't
make it in time, Ranma.

366
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:39,666
I'll have to do it on my own.

367
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,833
Deal 'em out.

368
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,733
-Not so fast.

369
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:45,400
He's mine.

370
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,500
-Aye, yi, yi.

371
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,533
This again?

372
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,074
-Ranma.

373
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
He hasn't gotten
any better, has he?

374
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,841
-Nope.

375
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,266
-For real?

376
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:57,400
-Yep.

377
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,333
-Thanks to my training,
though, my expression

378
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,133
is now totally unreadable.

379
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,766
-This way the King--

380
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:06,833
-With his face
completely hidden.

381
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:07,933
-Can't read his expression.

382
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,700
-Don't be a fool.

383
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,833
You understand, I don't
need to see your face

384
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:12,933
to beat you at gambling.

385
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:13,633
-Huh?

386
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,300
That's what you think.

387
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,333
-Or maybe he knows that Ranma,
being naturally more stupid

388
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,566
than Akane doesn't
stand a chance.

389
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,433
-Hmm?

390
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,900
-So what'll you bet?

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,100
-Here it is, an IOU
for my family business.

392
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:30,633
-Are you sure, Ukyo?

393
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,900
What if you lose?

394
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,066
-It is a risk, but that's, OK.

395
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,700
Ranma made me a promise.

396
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,933
-A promise?

397
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,666
What kind of a promise?

398
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,800
-Let's get this over
with, shall we, King?

399
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,600
-If you lose, you
give us the Dojo back.

400
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
-Ah, that's assuming I lose.

401
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,566
Ranma must stake
Ukyo's business.

402
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,107
-Hmph.

403
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,700
How's this for a poker face?

404
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,966
-Look, he's laughing.

405
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,200
-Hey, you're right.

406
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,066
GAMBLING KING: Begin.

407
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,133
-Ranma's agreed to be your what?

408
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:05,066
-My partner in the new
business I'm going to run.

409
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,733
-I'm so sorry.

410
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,400
This is all my fault.

411
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,933
-Hey, I thought we
agreed you'd quit that.

412
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:16,700
We're in it together, aren't we?

413
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,166
-I'll write her a
love letter in sauce.

414
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,200
-Does this mean that--

415
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,666
-Please, can you forgive me?

416
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:29,566
-For what?

417
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,966
For loving me?

418
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,266
-Never.

419
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,033
-It's like a dream come true.

420
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,566
-It'll be rough, but--

421
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,666
-OK.

422
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:43,033
VOICEOVERS: Wow,
you're mean to the max.

423
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:43,574
-Ranma.

424
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:47,233
-Take it, jerk.

425
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:49,200
-Rats!

426
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,900
Joker again.

427
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,233
Take it, take it.

428
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:55,774
Aha.

429
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,700
-Oh, no.

430
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,133
-Take that.

431
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,400
-Hey, that's no fun.

432
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,533
They're just trading
it back and forth.

433
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,666
-The two opponents are
equally matched in strength.

434
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:09,166
-A less flattering way to say
it is they're equally stupid.

435
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:14,166
-Oh, wait a second.

436
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:18,100
Why's that one card so beat up?

437
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,333
That's it.

438
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,266
We can trade the same
one back and forth.

439
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:22,733
Now I can tell
which one is which.

440
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,833
You got to get up pretty early
in the morning to fool-- aha.

441
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:33,533
-No fair.

442
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:35,233
Ranma was so intent
on choosing his card,

443
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,600
that the King slipped it in.

444
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,600
Cheater.

445
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,366
-So that's it.

446
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:43,533
-Sneaky.

447
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,233
-Drop it, Akane.

448
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,066
Well, we going to play?

449
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,766
-As you know, I'm
always up for gambling.

450
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm game if your game.

451
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,633
-I pick.

452
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:55,366
Oh, rats!

453
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:56,633
-My turn.

454
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,166
Oh, man.

455
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,033
-This could take all day.

456
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:09,600
Tell me, what would you say to
one final game of sudden death?

457
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,966
I have here two cards.

458
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,766
Choose the Joker and you lose.

459
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,033
Win, and you get it all back.

460
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:19,966
-It's fine by me.

461
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,366
Here goes.

462
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,766
-He's laughing.

463
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,200
What if--what if
they're both jokers?

464
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,133
Ranma, he's cheating.

465
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:39,600
Don't do it.

466
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,141
Ranma!

467
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,541
-Ranma.

468
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,366
-Sorry, but you lose.

469
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:51,600
-Huh?

470
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,000
-He did it.

471
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,933
He did it.

472
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,366
It's all ours again.

473
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:55,907
Hooray.

474
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:02,800
-I don't understand.

475
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,066
Given that there were two Jokers
in the deck, how did he-- Why,

476
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,033
that sneaky little--

477
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,566
-Wow, you really
lucked out, huh?

478
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,115
-Yeah.

479
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,100
You mean skilled.

480
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,533
-Hey, when did
those-- you cheated?

481
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:22,500
-Wow, I didn't think
he had it in him.

482
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,833
-I just beat him at his
own game, that's all.

483
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:28,200
Guess we won't be
seeing him again.

484
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,966
-While it's true I
didn't lose the business,

485
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:35,233
I've still got this
other stack of IOUs. so--

486
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,366
-Nag, nag, nag, nag.

487
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:48,155
[theme song in japanese]

488
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:19,444
-Why Kuno, a new girlfriend?

489
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:21,377
That's great, but
I don't think you

490
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:22,877
