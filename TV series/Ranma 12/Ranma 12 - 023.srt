00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,066
NARRATOR: Meet Ranma
Saotome of the Anything

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,500
Goes School of Martial Arts.

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,200
-Hey, let go.

4
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,700
NARRATOR: And here's Akane
of the Tendo Training Hall.

5
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:15,700
-What are you doing?

6
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:16,966
NARRATOR: The two
have been engaged

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,766
to marry by their
loving parents.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,733
-I didn't ask for this.

9
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,333
-Who asked you?

10
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:24,766
NARRATOR: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,400
-What'd you do that for?

12
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,366
NARRATOR: When Ranma's
splashed with cold water,

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,900
he becomes a she.

14

AKANE (VOICEOVER): "You
Really Do Hate Cats!"

[dog barking]

16
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:09,356
-Ranma Saotome, prepare to die!

17
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:26,030
Ranma Saotome of the Anything
Goes School of Martial Arts.

18
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:28,930
I had hoped you'd be
made of sterner stuff.

19
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:29,830
[rustling]

20
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:32,064
Hm?

21
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:32,830
Sasuke?

22
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:33,330
-Ha.

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,797
May I say that you're
in especially fine form

24
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,164
this evening, Master Kuno.

25
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:43,397
The wretched Ranma
is no match for you.

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,897
-I, the noble heir of
the Kuno School of Kendo?

27
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,364
Of course he isn't.

28
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:50,664
Surely, I shall smite
the cretinous Saotome.

29
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:53,197
And then I shall double
date with the virtuous Akane

30
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,630
Tendo and the high-spirited
pigtailed girl.

31
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:59,430
[laughter]

32
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,097
Right.

33
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,197
One more time.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,464
-Yes, Master.

35
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:06,397
I come.

36
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:15,064
-And you, you're not better
than that sack of sawdust

37
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,064
back there.

38
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:16,664
-Yes, Master.

39
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:26,297
-Faster, boy.

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,697
You're too slow.

41
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,130
-Come on.

42
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:31,497
Quit it.

43
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:31,997
No fair.

44
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:42,830
It ain't fair, I tell you.

45
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:45,197
Hey, wait up.

46
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,997
-Ranma, quit your whining.

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,997
If you can't handle a
little training exercise,

48
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,697
how do you expect
to someday carry

49
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,964
on the Saotome School
of Martial oh--

50
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,330
[grunting]

51
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:01,797
-You got a head start.

52
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,697
No fair.

53
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,264
MAN: Hello, Cold Black Cat
International Delivery.

54
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:09,430
KASUMI: Thank you very much.

55
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:13,530
-Oh, a present.

56
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:14,197
For me?

57
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,664
-No, it's for Ranma.

58
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,864
Oh my, it's from
Shampoo in China.

59
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:19,697
-What?

60
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,764
-Not the queen of the Amazons.

61
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:23,297
-Nihao.

62
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:32,064
-Ah, well now, come
to think of it, it

63
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:34,864
has been awfully quiet around
here lately, hasn't it?

64
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:35,397
-Ah!

65
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,264
It's moving.

66
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:38,664
-Whoa, check it out.

67
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:43,964
[meow]

68
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:50,064
-Oh, how cute.

69
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,697
-Here, kitty, kitty.

70
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,897
-Oh, let me hold it.

71
00:03:59,197 --> 00:03:59,897
-What's wrong?

72
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,030
Why is it so angry?

73
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,397
-It's from Shampoo,
there's no doubt about it.

74
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,664
It's not happy to see Akane.

75
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:06,164
-Hm?

76
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,930
-Why are you mad
at me, stupid cat?

77
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:13,464
RANMA: Stupid old man.

78
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:16,297
-Oh my, sounds like Ranma
and his father are home.

79
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,730
-That is the last
time I ever listen

80
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:23,230
to any of your dumb ideas.

81
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,564
You ain't got
nothing to teach me.

82
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,364
[meow]

83
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,397
-Hm?

84
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,164
[scream]

85
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,564
-Ranma.

86
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:35,897
Hey, what are you
doing to that poor cat?

87
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:43,430
Ailurophobia?

88
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:53,064
-I'm so ashamed.

89
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:55,397
My son is a sniveling coward.

90
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,797
-Who are you to talk?

91
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,430
You're the one who
did this to me, pop.

92
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,430
You!

93
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,164
-Uh, I-- I'm sorry, Ranma.

94
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:05,864
But I'm just not that way.

95
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,230
-Such an ingrate.

96
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,697
-So who would've thought,
Ranma does have a weak spot

97
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,964
after all.

98
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:12,064
-Yes.

99
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:13,264
Cat Fu.

100
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:16,530
It was the Cat Fu training
that did this to Ranma.

101
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:18,664
-Cat Fu?

102
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:20,730
-Freestyle Cat Fist Fighting.

103
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:22,664
It's known as Cat Fu.

104
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,597
Training is deceptively easy.

105
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,197
Wrap the trainee from
head to toe in chikuwa--

106
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,897
Japanese fish
sausage-- and toss him

107
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,497
into a pit of starving cats.

108
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,964
-Cut it out, pop.

109
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,397
Don't remind me.

110
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,564
-It happened in the spring
of Ranma's sixth year.

111
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:42,264
And here is the
tome of ancient lore

112
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:43,697
which describes this technique.

113
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,264
-Let me see.

114
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:48,197
Incredible.

Anything Goes School of Martial
Arts Final Attack Cat Fist.

116
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:56,097
How to master Cat Fu.

117
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,230
Let's see.

118
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,597
Wrap the trainee in fish
sausage from head to toe

119
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,464
and throw into a
pit of hungry cats.

120
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:04,930
-You see, the technique
seems so simple,

121
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,097
I should have known
there was a catch.

122
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,897
Turn the page, Tendo,
and see for yourself.

123
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,697
-This method has been
banned for causing

124
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,997
severe psychological distress.

125
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,097
-Oh.

126
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,030
-Too bad I never read the page.

127
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:25,664
-You idiot.

128
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:27,297
This is all your
fault, you know?

129
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,330
I ought to-- Huh?

130
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:29,830
Ah!

131
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:30,797
Quit it!

132
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,730
Cut it out!

133
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:35,464
-There they go again.

134
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:37,130
-So he's got a little weak spot.

135
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,397
That's no big deal.

136
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,464
-Hey, why are you defending him?

137
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:42,230
-Don't be ridiculous.

138
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:43,397
-Quit it!

139
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,564
-Look at this!

140
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:47,964
-But Mr. Saotome, if
Ranma got used to them,

141
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:49,897
maybe he wouldn't be
afraid of them anymore.

142
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,730
Here, kitty, kitty.

143
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:57,564
[screaming]

GENMA: Here I come.

145
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,530
-Ah, Sasuke.

146
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,497
SASUKE: Master.

147
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,297
-You may enter.

148
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,230
SASUKE: Yes, Master Kuno.

149
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:20,164
-I meant through the door,
you blithering idiot!

150
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:21,930
-Yes, of course, Master Kuno.

151
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:22,730
-Right then.

152
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:25,930
What is it?

153
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:26,964
-Great news, Master.

154
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:29,630
I, Sasuke, your own
humble manservant,

155
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:31,930
have discovered
Saotome's weak spot.

156
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:34,597
Armed with this knowledge,
your defeat of him is assured.

157
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:41,064
Allow me to share
that secret with you--

158
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,330
-Imbecile!

159
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:44,630
How dare you try and mock me?

160
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,464
I, the great Tatewaki Kuno,
could never strike secretly

161
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:49,830
at an opponent's weakness.

162
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:54,964
And?

163
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,230
-What?

164
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,097
-His weak spot is?

165
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,697
-But?

166
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,064
-Man, spit it out.

167
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:03,264
There is no dishonor in knowing
an opponent's weak spot.

168
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:05,764
So come on, tell me, tell me,
tell me right now you idiot!

169
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,430
-What the?

170
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,230
It's a note.

171
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:20,597
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Help me, Ranma.

172
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,997
It's me, Akane.

173
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,630
I've been kidnapped by villains.

174
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:27,664
Please come to the school
gym as soon as possible.

175
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:28,964
-Yo.

176
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:30,530
-What?

177
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:32,464
-You're Akane, right?

178
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:34,364
-Huh?

179
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:36,397
It's a practical joke, Ranma.

180
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,530
Just ignore it.

181
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:38,764
-Hey, you never know.

182
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,030
-Oh, honestly.

183
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:40,664
See?

184
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:43,264
There's nobody here.

185
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:45,964
SASUKE (HIGH PITCHED
VOICE): Oh, here I am.

186
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:48,497
Oh, Ranma, I knew
you'd come to save me.

187
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,430
I'm so happy.

188
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:51,164
It's me.

189
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,364
-What on earth is that?

190
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,197
SASUKE (HIGH PITCHED
VOICE): Oh, save me, Ranma.

191
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,430
-Hey, what do you think you're
doing pretending to be me?

192
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:58,030
-Help!

193
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:58,964
Save me, Ranma.

194
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,930
My life is in danger, Ranma.

195
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:01,897
Oh, help me, help me.

196
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,864
I'm going to die!

197
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:04,130
Oh, please save me.

198
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:04,630
Help!

199
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:05,164
Help!

200
00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:06,097
Oh, save me.

201
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,364
-So die.

202
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:08,264
-Who the heck are you?

203
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:13,497
-A loyal servant to the
great and noble house

204
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,630
of Kuno, Sasuke Sarugakure.

205
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,097
I have you now, Ranma.

206
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,897
-You and me should talk.

207
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,630
-Too late to beg.

208
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:22,097
Your fate is sealed.

209
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,964
RANMA: Whoopsie.

210
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,297
[scream]

211
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,597
-Hm, that's odd.

212
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,797
I thought it was
more to the front.

213
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,464
-Yo, Akane, you OK?

214
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,897
AKANE: What'd he do that for?

215
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,664
-That wasn't supposed to happen.

216
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:38,464
-And just who were you
trying to drop in there?

217
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:39,797
-Eh, no one.

218
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:52,630
-Hey, you OK down there?

219
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,064
Hey, who were you trying to hit?

220
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:56,864
-I-- I have something.

221
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,497
Here, take this.

222
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,997
-What's that?

223
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,764
-Fish sausage?

224
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:10,764
[meow]

[meowing]

226
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:42,360
-What the--?

227
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,827
-Ranma, welcome.

228
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,360
Welcome to cat hell.

229
00:10:56,393 --> 00:11:00,793
Poor wittle Wanma,
afraid of the kitty cats?

230
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:05,693
I'd say you were
ch-- ch-- chicken.

231
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:13,427
-You're a-- you--
you're such a-- twit!

232
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,793
-Huh?

233
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:17,060
-D-- did you really think you
could scare me with a couple

234
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,460
of crummy cats?

235
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:19,560
-Uh, well yeah.

236
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:21,427
-Well, you're wrong.

237
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,127
-Aren't you just
a little scared?

238
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,060
-Mm mm.

239
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,993
-Not even a teensy
weensy scared?

240
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:27,893
-Mm mm.

241
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,893
-You must be a little scared.

242
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:31,427
-No way!

243
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,560
-Don't yell at me.

244
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,960
Now what am I going to do?

245
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:38,227
[laughter]

246
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,193
-C-- come on, Akane.

247
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:45,127
Let's get out of here.

248
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:51,260
-Listen, you, don't think
you're off the hook yet.

249
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,493
-I'm sorry.

250
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:54,727
-Take that dress off now!

251
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,293
-Here, in front of everyone?

252
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:57,860
[giggling]

253
00:11:57,893 --> 00:12:00,327
-Hey, what are you laughing at?

254
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,960
Great, Ranma, just great.

255
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:05,593
Get me dropped into a pit while
you start acting like a baby.

256
00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:06,460
Honestly.

257
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,060
-Akane, don't go in there.

258
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:09,927
-Why not?

259
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,393
-I wouldn't open that if I--

260
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:12,460
-Oh, just be quiet.

261
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:14,927
I've had enough of
you and your tricks.

262
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,427
[scream]

263
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,827
-Mr. Saotome, is there really no
way poor Ranma's fears of cats

264
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,093
can be cured?

265
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:34,660
-Believe me, I've tried
everything, Kasumi.

266
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:36,993
I once plastered him with
packets of dried sardines,

267
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,427
but that didn't work.

268
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,393
And then I tried
strapping him with smelt,

269
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,793
but that was no good.

270
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,160
Finally, in desperation, I tried
covering him with kamaboko fish

271
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:47,860
cake, but it was useless.

272
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,060
Ah, the lengths to
which a man will

273
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:52,527
go in order to save
his one and only son.

274
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,027
-How clever to have
thought of those things.

275
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,993
Would you like some more tea?

276
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,793
-You know, the
really ironic thing,

277
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:02,327
no matter how much
you love him, you just

278
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,060
can't save a child from himself.

279
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:11,160
-How did a tiger get in here?

280
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:13,093
-I thought maybe it
might scare Ranma.

281
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:14,793
-I'd say you went
a little overboard.

282
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,427
[roaring]

283
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,393
[scream]

284
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:21,093
-Oh, great.

285
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:24,160
You guys, will you stop
using me as your shield?

286
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:25,927
Nice kitty.

287
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,860
There, there.

288
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:27,927
You don't want to
eat me, do you?

289
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:37,027
-And then, when Ranma's
trapped completely in the jaws

290
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,527
of terror--

291
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,260
[gasp]

292
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:40,660
-And then what?

293
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,893
-He meows.

294
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:49,293

GENMA: And then there's
no turning back.

297
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:01,860
KASUMI: Oh my, how dreadful.

298
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:02,693
-Hm.

299
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:04,960
-Oh, what is it, Mr. Saotome?

300
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:07,060
-It's a bad omen.

301
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:10,360
Something must be
wrong with the boy.

302
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:11,493
-Little bird so high.

303
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,060
Leaves that flutter by.

304
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:16,460
Sweeping clean, the street
clean enough to eat.

305
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:17,727
I still got it.

306
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Heh.

307
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,693
The old man hasn't
lost his touch yet.

308
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:24,627
Now where's he going?

309
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,460
What's the rush?

310
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,027
Hm?

311
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,527
Hm?

-I'm sure my good Sasuke's
mission was a success.

316
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:25,793
Soon that Ranma Saotome will
be in the palm of my hand.

317
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:28,493
And then I'll have
Akane Tendo too.

318
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:32,027
Not to mention the
pigtailed girl.

-What is that?

322

-It's a pillar of cats.

323
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:47,360
-Look there.

324
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:48,093
It's Akane Tendo.

325
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,460
Here, my love.

326
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:55,227
-Oh, this is so sudden, Master.

327
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,360
-Not you, fool.

328
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,560
My darling Akane.

Oh, my love.

330
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:14,760
Oof-- Get off me, you beast.

331
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:16,260
Have you gone mad?

332
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:25,860
-Hah!

333
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:27,827
He fell for it.

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,327
-Ranma!

335
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:32,260
Oh no.

336
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:46,060
[chattering]

337
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,560
-Ranma, what is it?

338
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:48,527
What's wrong?

339
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,527
Come down from there.

340
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,493
Why won't you talk to me?

341
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,393
Please come down here.

342
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:54,327
Huh?

343
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,527
-Words can't reach
Ranma right now.

344
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,593
-How come?

345
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:58,160
Why?

346
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,460
What can we do?

347
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:02,393
-So it was an omen after all.

348
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:04,060
-What do you mean
words can't reach him.

349
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,060
What's wrong with him?

350
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:06,627
Is he sick or something?

351
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,893
-When Ranma's acute fear of cats
goes beyond a certain point,

352
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,127
the only way for him
to deal with that fear

353
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,793
is to become a cat himself.

354
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,327
[meow]

355
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,260
Only one person
can reach him when

356
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:22,793
he's like this-- a
kindly old lady who

357
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:25,027
used to live in our
old neighborhood.

358
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,760
She was the only one
who could bring him

359
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:29,060
back from over the edge.

360
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:31,760
AKANE: Let's hurry
up and call her then.

361
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:33,660
GENMA: Unfortunately,
she's dead.

362
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:35,027
-She's dead?

363
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,760
-But I will take care of him.

364
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:41,060
For my only son, there's no
humiliation I will not bear.

365
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,493
Don't worry, my son.

366
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:43,493
I'm on my way!

367
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,960
-Come here, come on.

368
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,027
Come and get it.

369
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,727
Nice kitty.

370
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,960
-OK, so maybe it's not
one of his better ideas.

371
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,660
Catnip?

372
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,260
-Don't worry, Ranma.

373
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:09,660
I forgive you.

374
00:18:21,993 --> 00:18:24,293
-It looks like he's
getting worse, dad.

375
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:25,860
What are we going to do?

376
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:26,560
-Don't worry.

377
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:27,793
Leave everything to me.

378
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:28,760
-You?

379
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,960
-All cats love
catnip, don't they?

380
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:34,860
If we can get Ranma to eat
some, I'm sure he'll calm down.

381
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:37,827
-That's a good idea, but how
are we going to get it to him?

382
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
-I'm, uh, still working on that.

383
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,560
-Oh, some help you are.

384
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:43,627
Now we're back where we started.

385
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,793
Huh?

386
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:46,727
Here, let me borrow
that for a sec.

387
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:52,593
Here it comes.

388
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:06,360
Oh no.

389
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:17,560
[purring]

390
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,493
-You did it, Akane.

391
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm so very proud of you.

392
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:26,693
-But I didn't
really do anything.

393
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:27,193
-Ah!

394
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,560
Ranma Saotome, you fiend.

395
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:33,527
-Calm down, Master.

396
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,860
You'll aggravate your injury.

397
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:36,660
-I won't.

398
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:37,160
I won't.

399
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:37,760
I won't.

400
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:38,660
I won't allow it.

401
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:40,993
It's unforgivable.

402
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:42,493
STUDENT: He is her
fiance after all.

403
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,260
AKANE: I told you,
it's not like that.

404
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:45,627
STUDENT: Whatever
you say, Akane.

405
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:55,160
-Come on, you're embarrassing
me in front of the whole school.

406
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,493
Come on, get off.

407
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:58,493
Huh?

408
00:19:58,527 --> 00:19:58,993
What?

409
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:08,293
STUDENT: He kissed her
in front of everyone.

410
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:08,893
-Aw.

411
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:09,927
-Right on.

412
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,327
-He kissed her.

413
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,260
Oh.

414
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:13,827
Guy's like a cat
and he kissed her.

415

STUDENT: Guy's purring, aw man.

416
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,027
STUDENT: Unbelievable.

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
I'm sure of it.

420
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,793
That's the cat Shampoo
sent from China.

[meowing]

422

-How did I end up in
that swimming pool?

423
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:50,293
I remember the cats,
but not much after that.

AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Who's that old lady?

430
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:14,530
What do you mean 3,000
years of Chinese history?

431
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:16,530
She's 300 years old?

432
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,230
She's really
something all right.
