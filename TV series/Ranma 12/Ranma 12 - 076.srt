Did I get me a haul or what?

-Incredible.

May I remind you
that some of us still

have to live in
this neighborhood?

-How could you?

11
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,894
How could you be so cruel as
to take away the one and only

pleasure of a lonely,
feeble, dying invalid?

Take me now, I
don't want to live.

00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:16,661
-Huh?

132
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,894
Well, I-- I, uh--

133
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:20,827
-With all the
perverts around here,

134
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:23,694
we could sure use more
like you at this school.

135
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:26,294
-You should come here as
transfer student or something.

136
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:27,594
-Huh?

137
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:30,127
-Akane, I'm guessing that he
must be a friend of yours,

138
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:31,127
right?

139
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:33,027
You should try and
talk him into it.

140
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:34,161
-O-- OK.

141

-Akane, I--

-Hey, why not?

143
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:38,294
You never did tell me
why you quit school.

144
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:39,727
But you know it's
never too late.

145
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,294
You can come back.

146
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,994
Why don't you try to take
the placement test for here

147
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:45,327
and see if you can get in?

148
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:48,727
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Me, going
to the same school as Akane?

AKANE: Uh-huh.

156
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:06,127
I'll tutor him myself.

157
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:08,161
I figure he can stay over for
a while in order to get ready.

-What's one more freeloader
at this point, right?

Although, I suppose that--

160
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:18,994
-It's the least we can do
for a fellow martial artist.

161
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,827
Besides, hospitality is
practically our motto.

162
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:24,261
-If there's anything
you need, let me know.

163
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:24,994
-Thank you.

164
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,061
I appreciate it.

165
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:30,427
-I've been living here is
P-chan a long time now.

166
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:34,294
Finally, I'll be under one
roof with Akane as a man.

167
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,827
-Well, you know, I gotta
hand it to you, man.

168
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,727
Figures you gotta pick
our school, right?

169
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:42,794
Of all the places for
dropout to drop back in,

170
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:44,594
you want the one where
the principal's nut

171
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:48,527
job and the girls either dress
like boys or act like them.

172
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:51,761
[laughs]

173
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,461
-So I take it this
means you'll be

174
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:55,827
studying for that
test on your own?

175
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:59,127
So Ryoga, you ready to
go upstairs to my room?

176
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:00,827
-Oh, OK.

177
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,927
I'm leaving now.

178
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,627
-[groaning]

179
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:11,194
-Did you hear that, Ranma?

180
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:13,894
They're going upstairs
to be all alone.

181
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:14,435
Well?

182
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:16,461
Come on, admit it.

183
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:17,361
Aren't you jealous?

184
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,194
Not even a little bit?

185
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:19,861
Well?

186
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:20,427
Well?

187
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:20,968
Well?!

188
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:21,927
-Not even.

189
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:23,627
If you're so jealous,
why don't you

190
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,961
transfer and start
studying, huh?

191
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:27,361
-Don't mind if I do, actually.

192
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:34,935
Happy and Akane sitting
in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

193
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:38,094
-Why, you-- ain't you
never heard of shame?

194
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:38,927
-Apparently not.

195
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:43,527
-Come here before I--

196
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:45,961
-Can't you see
what's going on here?

197
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:48,327
That delinquent is
using this opportunity

198
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,561
to get close to your fiance.

199
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:53,094
Can't you see that
she's a danger?

200
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,594
-You're the only one who's
dangerous around here.

201
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,094
-Oh yeah?

202
00:09:59,194 --> 00:10:01,027
Then tell me what
those two are doing.

203
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:01,568
-What?

204
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:07,061
Excuse me, would you
mind getting off my lap?

205
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:09,494
[screams]

206
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:12,027
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Oh no,
I forgot I wasn't P-chan

207
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:13,961
and I did what I usually do.

208
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,161
-[screaming]

209
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:18,994
-Ryoga, you no good,
dirty little sneak.

210
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:21,961
-Ranma, cut it out!

211
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,461
He's trying to study, OK?

212
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:24,894
-He's trying to do what?

213
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:28,061
-Does this look
like he's studying?

214
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,027
-How sweet.

215
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,427
-Wh--where did you get those?

216
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:35,294
-You don't come across sparklies
like these every day, you know?

217
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:36,761
It must be a gift
from the heavens

218
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:38,561
on account of my good behavior.

219
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:39,761
-I'll give you good behavior.

220
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:43,394
-Gotta go!

221
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:45,127
-Oh no you don't.

222
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:45,994
Now will you be good?

223
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:52,761
-We should probably
just try to ignore them.

224
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,861
Is that OK?

225
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:54,402
-Sure.

226
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:54,902
Uh-huh.

227
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:59,627
RANMA: Get back here, you
little-- why you little freak.

228
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,761
HAPPOSAI: You gotta
move faster than that.

229
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:10,461
-[growls]

230
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,227
-You see?

231
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:12,761
Now she's locked the door.

232
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:15,261
[heart beating]

233
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:20,861
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
Alone, at last.

234
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,394
Here, with her.

235
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,227
In her own room.

236
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:27,694
-So you see, x plus y equals 4.

237
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:29,061
Easy, huh?

238
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:29,994
-What?

239
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:31,627
Oh, oh yeah.

240
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:32,627
I see.

241
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:34,394
-Then let's keep going.

242
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,694
-Akane?

243
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:36,927
-Yeah.

244
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:41,494
-Can I-- can I ask why
you're being so nice to me?

245
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:42,461
-Huh?

246
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:45,027
Well, because I like you, silly.

247
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:46,394
-You-- you-- you like me?

248
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:47,927
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): She does.

249
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,161
She really does.

250
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:55,461
-Oh, Ryoga.

251
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:58,994
-Ry-- Ryoga?

252
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,427
-Huh?

253
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:03,761
[screams]

254
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:05,561
-Would you sell
it somewhere else?

255
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:07,068
-Honestly?

256
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:22,438
AKANE: Morning.

257
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:23,438
MALE STUDENT: How's it going?

258
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:29,171
-Listen, I'm gonna
tell you one more time,

259
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:31,071
I'd better not catch
you interrupting Ryoga.

260
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:34,605
-You listen, because
I'm not you're problem.

261
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:37,005
The old freak's the one who
won't let them study, not me.

262
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,971
[growling]

263
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:46,005
-Kasumi?

264
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:46,838
-Yes?

265
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:48,771
-What's Ryoga up to?

266
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,805
-Well, when Akane's
in school, he

267
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,138
goes to the Dojo and studies.

268
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,071
-He does, does he?

269
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,871
Well, what an
admirable young man.

270
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:58,738
HAPPOSAI: What's that?

271
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:01,105
Hey, let me see.

272
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,071
Come on.

273
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,105
Where?

274
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:03,671
What's that?

275
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:08,471
Will you just let me-- hey!

276
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:09,838
-Would you mind
cutting that out?

277
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:11,538
I'm trying to get
some studying done.

278
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:12,079
-Well!

279
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,338
You won't mind if I
show it around then.

280
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,138
-Do it and you're dead.

281
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:20,205
-I am, am I?

282
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:23,738
Ready when you are, punk.

-[growling]

284
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:32,038
-What's the matter?

285
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:33,038
Don't you want to fight?

286
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:38,338
-What'd I say?

287
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:46,505
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): With
you beside me, Akane,

288
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:48,071
I can't seem to concentrate.

289
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:53,038
Oh, Akane, just put me in a
corner and forget about me.

290
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:55,371
Is that too much to ask?

291
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:56,671
-Uh, excuse me.

292
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:59,071
Which way is Furinkan
High School again?

293
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,071
-Well, first you go
straight this way.

294
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:01,605
-Thank you.

295
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:08,938
STUDENTS: Bye.

296
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:10,871
See you tomorrow.

297
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:13,305
Don't forget your homework-- oh!

298
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:17,238
-[groaning]

299
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:24,071
-Jeez, what's the
matter with you?

300
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:25,805
I finally made it.

301
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:30,838
--[chuckles] If it's Akane you're
looking for, then she's already

302
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,171
gone home.

303
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,738
Ironic, ain't it punk?

304
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:35,712
-Ranma!

305
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:39,805
Is it that much fun
for you to laugh at me?

306
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:41,471
-Yeah, bring it on, pal.

307
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:42,405
-[groaning]

308
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:42,946
-Hm?

309
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:51,471
-OK, listen.

310
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:53,338
I've got a great idea.

311
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,238
Just keep this on
your hand until you've

312
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:56,505
passed the placement exam.

313
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:00,071
And then you won't be
distracted by fighting anymore.

314
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:00,971
Promise, K?

315
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:04,771
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
She's so good to me.

316
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,638
How can I possibly go
back on my promise?

317
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:10,771
-Hey, hey, where'd you go?

318
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:11,771
Snap out of it.

319
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,371
I said, what's the
matter with you?

320
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:15,912
Huh?

321
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:24,305
-Aw man, you're grossing me out.

322
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:25,805
Suit yourself.

323
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:26,738
Huh?

324
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:27,971
-Hey-- hey, whe--
where you going?

325
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:28,512
Wait!

326
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:36,205
-If you want to fight,
then let's fight.

327
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,805
Otherwise, leave me alone.

328
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,538
-I-- I know you don't
like me, but please,

329
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:45,338
could you at least just
show me the way home?

330
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:45,879
-Huh?

331
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,571
[laughter]

332
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:51,138
-Seriously.

333
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:51,771
Just like a kid.

334
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,971
-So Ryoga, how are
your studies going?

335
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,671
-Uh, not so good.

336
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:02,705
-He'd be fine if it
weren't for certain people.

337
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:04,605
-I ain't bothering him, OK?

338
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:05,938
-I've got it.

339
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:09,771
Ryoga, why don't we just pull
an all-nighter in my room?

340
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,138
[gasping]

341
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,871
-Should I make you some
snacks for later then?

342
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:17,305
-A cute teacher and
room service to boot.

343
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:19,838
Ain't you got the life?

344
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,671
[chuckles]

345
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:25,805
AKANE: Ryoga, come on.

346
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:27,771
I'm waiting.

347
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:32,638
-Um, well-- I'll
be right there, OK?

348
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:35,238
Soon as I can remember
which way your room is.

349
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:40,038
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Just the
two of us alone 'til dawn.

350
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:41,771
I can't afford to
blow this chance.

351
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:42,312
-Huh?

352
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:46,546
OK.

353
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:49,038
There it is.

354
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,171
Akane, I--

355
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:01,038
Hey, this isn't Akane's room.

356
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,971
[crash]

357
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,005
[knocking]

358
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:08,938
AKANE: Come in.

359
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:09,905
It's you, right, Ryoga?

360
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:11,838
[door opens]

361
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:12,638
Don't be shy.

362
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:13,438
Come on over.

363
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:15,271
[door closes]

364
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:18,371
-Just a sec, K?

365
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,338
I'm making some quick
math problems for you.

366
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:22,705
Hm?

367
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:25,538
[screams]

368
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:26,871
-Huh?

369
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:27,412
Akane!

370
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:31,738
Are you OK?

371
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,371
Ryoga!

372
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,705
What'd you do to Ak-- huh?

373
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:39,246
Akane?

374
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:43,071
Akane, w-- what's wrong?

375
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:43,612
Huh?

376
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:44,946
Ryoga?

377
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,271
-[chuckles]

378
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,371
-The freak.

379
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:51,038
Why you-- what'd
you do to Akane?

380
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,671
-Just made sure she'd
sleep through the night.

381
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,638
-You what?

382
00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:58,071
-Listen, stupid.

383
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:01,405
Given the chance, anybody would
take advantage of a girl alone

384
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:03,705
at night, much less
what's-his-face.

385
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:04,938
That's why I'm here.

386
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:06,505
To make sure nothing happens.

387
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:09,905
Because if anything does, it's
gonna be me who does the doing.

388
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,405
Sayonara, sucker.

389
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:14,005
Hoo-hoo!

390
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,005
-Come back here!

391
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:25,671
I said, come here!

392
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,871
Where the heck do you think
you're taking her anyway?

393
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:29,338
-Jeez, you're stubborn.

394
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:33,771
-[screaming]

395
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:38,871
-Now that you're a girl, do
you want to come play too?

396
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:44,438
Here I come.

397
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:47,638
Admit it, isn't this
nice for a change?

398
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,171
-Think again.

399
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,005
-Now what?

400
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:54,171
You here to cause trouble?

401
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:05,538
-I hope you can
forgive me, Akane,

402
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:06,771
but I can't stand it anymore.

403
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:11,238
[yelling]

404
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:15,205
-Hey!

405
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:15,746
Ha ha!

406
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:19,171
-Come back.

407
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,671
Where are you taking her?

408
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:30,038
-The one to protect
Akane's gonna be me.

409
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,771
-She's mine!

410
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:36,705
-Come back, freak.

411
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:37,671
I said, come back.

412
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:45,371
-You'll have to do a lot better
than that, you little punk.

413
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:49,771
-Listen you, now you've
made me really mad.

414
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:52,771
I'm going to get her back
if it's the last thing I do.

415
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:56,771
[screaming]

416
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:02,205
-Hmm, gotcha.

417
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:02,971
-Goodnight, Akane.

418
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,738
I hope the bed bugs don't bite.

419
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:12,271
-Ranma, you're heavy.

420
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,738
-I can't help it, OK?

421
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,505
I think my legs
have stopped moving.

422
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:17,305
-How about it?

423
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:18,571
You jealous yet?

424
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:20,905
[chuckling]

425
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:21,538
-Why you--

426
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:27,205
-What are you doing?

427
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:28,171
No, don't.

428
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:30,071
I-- I wanted that there.

429
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,838
-Tell me something.

430
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:36,205
She usually this bad, or--

431
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:36,746
-Nope.

432
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,605
Usually she's a lot worse.

433
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,071
RYOGA (VOICEOVER): Oh, Akane.

434
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:47,038
I'm sorry I had to
break our promise.

435
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:48,505
Forgive me?

436
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:51,005
I should have realized that
defeating Ranma is always

437
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:52,238
gonna be my first priority.

438
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:55,638
-Oh, Ryoga.

439
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:56,705
-Whoa.

440
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,005
Hey, look at this.

441
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:00,005
He sent us a pineapple.

442
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,371
Coming from Ryoga,
that's pretty cool.

443
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,071
RYOGA (VOICEOVER):
Oh, and by the way,

444
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:05,805
I'm training in Hokkaido now.

445
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:07,705
The weather's real hot.

446
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:10,738
And I almost got bit
by a snake yesterday.

447
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:14,238
For a northern country,
this place sure is--

448
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:17,771
-It sounds more
like Okinawa to me.

449
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:19,271
KASUMI: Akane!

450
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:21,738
Would you mind going
out to the market?

451
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:22,471
-I don't mind.

452
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:27,438
-So how was the
weather in Hokkaido?

453
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:30,938
Look at you.

454
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:32,738
You got a tan, didn't you?

455
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:33,671
Didn't you?!

456
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,371
[squealing]

457
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,595
ANNOUNCER: [laughing]
You're kidding!

458
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,695
Happosai in love?

459
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:22,762
Well, who is she?

460
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:26,295
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"Happosai's Happy Heart."

461
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,495
We'll see you there.
