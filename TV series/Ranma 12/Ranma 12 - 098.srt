[theme music]

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,066
[church bells ringing]

3
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,574
-Exactly.

4
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,840
It was-- hmm?

5
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:13,107
-Why, in all the years I've been
with the St. Hebereke School

6
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:16,340
for Girls Martial
Arts Gymnastics team,

7
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,474
I've never heard
of such a thing.

8
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:19,907
[laughing]

9
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,407
AKANE: A leotard
is a girl's burden.

10
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:47,140
-Oh, come on,
Akane, help me out.

11
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,707
-Look, I've got my own homework.

12
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:50,040
-It'll just be this once.

13
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,840
I'll never ask again.

14
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,674
Pretty please?

15
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:55,074
-Don't you "pretty please" me.

16
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:55,907
-Doo-doo doo-doo.

17
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:03,540
Hmm?

18
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,007
-You stop that this instant!

19
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,640
-I'm sorry, but I
can't take it anymore.

20
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,040
I just can't take it anymore.

21
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,874
-All I gotta say
is, whoever it is

22
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,807
that did that, they must
have been pretty good.

23
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:27,474
-I think you'll feel better
with some dry clothes.

24
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,274
-I appreciate it, but all
the hot air in the world

25
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:32,674
won't dry these tears of mine.

26
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:35,640
At least, not until we can
get the Sphere of Fury back.

27
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,274
-You are going to
explain that, right?

28
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:41,274
-The St. Hebereke School for
Girls Martial Arts Gymnastic

29
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:45,474
Club has in its position one
of three sacred treasures.

30
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:47,774
By stealing our
Sphere of Fury, it's

31
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:51,307
as though the spirit of our
club itself has been stolen.

32
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:54,240
-Without it, we
may as well be one

33
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,974
of those sad little
public school clubs.

34
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:58,807
I swear that we'll never
go sphere-less again!

35
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:02,674
-Let me know how it
turns out, eh, Scarlet?

36
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:06,007
-Laugh all you want, but
I still need your help.

37
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:08,640
Part of being a couple is
being there for each other.

38
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,640
Not just when times are
good, but when they're bad.

39
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,574
And oh, this one's
very, very bad.

40
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:17,974
-Uh, far as that being there
for each other stuff goes,

41
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:19,907
we're not a couple, OK?

42
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:22,140
Besides, you're going
to an all girls school,

43
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
which means I don't fit in.

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,440
So, whoops.

45
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,374
My bad.

46
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,774
Well, I gotta go
study, so see ya.

47
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:30,774
Ugh.

48
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,607
-Obviously you
would be in costume.

49
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,140
-Been there, done that.

50
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,740
No thanks, all right?

51
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,440
-Excuse me?

52
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,440
-Oh, nothing.

53
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,107
Forget I said it.

54
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:41,207
-Look, do you mind?

55
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,407
I've still got homework to do.

56
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:46,207
-Oh, but of course you
do, dear. [inaudible].

57
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:46,740
-Ugh.

58
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,207
[cackling]

59
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:53,740
-I do not have time for this.

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,240
-Why don't you help her, Ranma?

61
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,440
I mean, maybe you don't
think you're a couple,

62
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,307
but she sure seems to.

63
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:04,607
-She can think
whatever she wants.

64
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:06,840
It takes two to tango, you know.

65
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,207
-Really?

66
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,607
-Akane, please!

67
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:10,874
You gotta come quick.

68
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:14,007
There's this guy at school
saying that he-- that he--

69
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:14,548
-Huh?

70
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:22,640
-We can do this the easy way.

71
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
RANMA: Hold it right there.

72
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,107
-Huh?

73
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,474
-So you're a guy after all, huh?

74
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:31,574
You must be the one who stole
that sacred whatchamacallit

75
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:33,174
from St. Hebereke.

76
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:37,474
-Who is he, anyway?

77
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:40,407
-Huh?

78
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,774
-Martial Men's Gymnastic
Team Captain at your service.

79
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:46,440
The name's Dido Kuji.

80
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,707
But that's not
important right now.

81
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,374
Once we acquire the
Club of Inscrutability

82
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,574
from Furinkan High,
we'll possess all

83
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:54,807
three sacred treasures.

84
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:57,007
And with that, martial
arts gymnastics

85
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,107
shall once again become
the sole province

86
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:01,774
of men, which is
how it should be.

87
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,540
-Why don't you just
let the girls--

88
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,240
-Ha.

89
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,707
You don't know, do ya?

90
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:08,874
True women may think they
own martial arts gymnastics,

91
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:12,107
but once we show the world
how well-suited men are to it,

92
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:13,274
they'll know better.

93
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,840
See what I mean?

94
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,274
-Now I've positive that
you're better off leaving it

95
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:31,140
to the girls.

96
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,340
-Shut up!

97
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,107
You only say that because
you're jealous and don't

98
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,674
know how hard it's been.

99
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:38,274
I'm telling ya, it's
pure discrimination.

100
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:39,707
(GIRLS BULLYING): Ha-ha-ha!

101
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:42,640
Gymnastics is for
girls, [inaudible].

102
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,607
Go find your own sport.

103
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:46,040
Get outta here!

104
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,940
-But now we've sworn to prove
that Martial Men's Gymnastics

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,640
is a manly sport, with manly
grace for manly men-like men.

106
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,007
[sobbing]

107
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:57,440
-You poor deluded fool.

108
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,107
Real men don't wear tights.

109
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,907
That's just for girls.

110
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:04,474
The only true sport
for manly men is kendo.

111
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,407
-Ha!

112
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,574
Sure it is, if you
count grown men

113
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:10,207
hitting each other
with sticks manly.

114
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,540
-You have spirit.

115
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Good.

116
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,340
But can you hold your
own in a fair fight?

117
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,740
-If you call three to one fair.

118
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,640
-So now are you convinced?

119
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Hand it over.

120
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,940
-Akane, do something.

121
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,674
-If they get their
hands on this,

122
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:49,640
Girl's Martial Arts
Gymnastics will be over.

123
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,274
-Look, maybe you'd
better let me--

124
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:56,974
-How far do we have to go
before you take us seriously?

125
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,907
-How's this for serious?

126
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:01,340
-Hmm?

127
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,940
I've been doing
hasty judging you.

128
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,307
Perhaps you're worthy of
joining Martial Men's Gymnastics

129
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,674
after all.

130
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:09,940
-Lucky me.

131
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,140
-Suit yourself.

132
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,774
Either way, we'll--

133
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:14,107
-Perhaps this will.

134
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,074
-Good thinking.

135
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:21,140
This ought to get the job
done in no time at all.

136
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,374
-So this is it?

137
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:31,540
Your so-called special attack?

138
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,840
-Watch out!

139
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,307
It's called the Sphere of
Fury for a reason, you know.

140
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,407
-Oh yeah?

141
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:38,740
And what would that be?

142
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Ah!

143
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,707
-It explodes, obviously.

144
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:42,574
-Ranma!

145
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:44,374
Can you hear me?

146
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:46,607
-You see, Akane,
it's got to be you.

147
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:49,474
And if you get that
pigtailed girl from last time

148
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:52,240
to be your partner,
the entire future

149
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,607
of Furinkan High gymnastics
is in your hands.

150
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,840
-But why does it have to?

151
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,574
-Because you must, that's why.

152
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:03,607
I Only you can combat the
menace of the boys in tights.

153
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:05,474
And if it means seeing
a pigtailed girls

154
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:06,374
tights, as well--

155
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:07,874
-It's settled, then.

156
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:11,807
If you lose, you hand over the
final treasure without a fight.

157
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:15,207
As a sign of good faith, we
will leave you to your training.

158
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:15,748
Farewell.

159
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
-Look, Ranma.

160
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,340
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way,

161
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
but I think it's probably better
if you let me handle this.

162
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,374
After all, it's not
like I need you to-- uh.

163
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:40,207
Er-- uh.

164
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:41,140
Oh.

165
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,507
-Tell me again how
you don't need--

166
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:44,307
-Ranma!

167
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:45,640
Shame on you!

168
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,007
How dare you abandon Akane
in her greatest hour of need?

169
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:52,407
-When I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you, OK?

170
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,307
-Is that any way to
treat your elders?

171
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:56,340
Here I'm trying to make
you do the right thing

172
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,940
and maybe catch a little
scenery along the way.

173
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,707
Especially if you were to wear
this cute little number that I

174
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,274
just happen to have right here.

175
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:03,907
I just--

176
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,974
-OK, that does it!

177
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:07,607
-Cut it out, you guys.

178
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,807
Happosai!

179
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,007
Ranma!

180
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:11,540
If you're not gonna help,
I'll just do it myself.

181
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,740
-Whatever you say.

182
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,574
-[grumbles]

183
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:21,940
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Stupid Akane.

184
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,407
It was a bad idea the first
time, and it's even dumber now.

185
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:28,574
Still, I can't leave her to
fight those guys on her own,

186
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:30,540
even if I do have to
wear another leot--

187
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,474
KODACHI: Ranma.

188
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:32,440
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

189
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,840
Kodachi?

190
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,740
-Hey, about that ball
thing, me and Akane--

191
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,974
I mean, her and
the pigtailed girl,

192
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:40,440
they're gonna get
it back for sure.

193
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,574
So don't worry, OK?

194
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,840
Bye.

195
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,740
Ugh!

196
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,907
Hey, what are you
doing this for?

197
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:47,974
-This is a fight that
neither you nor I

198
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,507
have any business
interfering with.

199
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:53,340
Let the pigtailed girl
and Akane handle it.

200
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,974
We've better ways
to spend our time.

201
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:56,440
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
That's not true.

202
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,140
If I don't get out there and
help her, Akane will be--

203
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
-Par-- a-- ly-- sis.

204
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:08,374
-I knew you'd see it my way.

205
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:10,340
[cackling]

206
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,807
ANNOUNCER: Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,

207
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:22,807
to the Martial Arts Gymnastics
Sacred Treasure Challenge.

208
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:25,540
In this corner, captain
of the Martial Arts Men's

209
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,774
Team, [inaudible].

210
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:31,740
And in this corner, Furinkan
High School's Akane Tendo!

211
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,640
-The pigtailed girl.

212
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,940
Where oh where can she be?

213
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,674
If she fails to appear, to
Akane Tendo go the spoils.

214
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:40,807
AKANE (VOICEOVER): It's OK.

215
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,207
I can do this.

216
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:46,174
Even if Ranma doesn't show.

217
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:47,174
-(VOICEOVER) This is it.

218
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,274
The moment we've
been waiting for.

219
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,907
Soon the treasure will be ours.

220
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:54,407
ANNOUNCER: The battle for
the third and final treasure

221
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,907
is about to begin.

222
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:12,274
RANMA: OK, that's enough.

223
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:13,707
Get me down!

224
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,240
You've proved your point.

225
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,440
What are you trying
to do, kill me?

226
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,740
Uh-oh.

227
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,340
Ah!

228
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,274
I-- I-- I get it.

229
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:24,540
It's a joke, right?

230
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,074
Ha-ha-ha!

231
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:25,774
It's funny.

232
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:26,840
Ha-ha-ha!

233
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,540
You're gonna get me
down though, right?

234
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,440
-Just look at how happy Mr.
Scaly Green is, darling.

235
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,374
Why, he could
practically eat you up.

236
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:35,307
[laughing]

237
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:38,240
[crowd cheering]

238
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:47,074
-He-he-he.

239
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:50,240
Is this the best that
you girls can do?

240
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,107
This is way too easy.

241
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,540
-It seems challenger
Tendo is having

242
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,174
a really tough time out there.

243
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:58,007
As explained
earlier, the winner's

244
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:00,107
the one who holds
out the longest.

245
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,740
Leaving the ring calls for
automatic disqualification.

246
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,774
-What kind of a coward picks on
a girl and calls himself a man?

247
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:11,140
Is that what you call
chivalry where you come from?

248
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,140
-Huh?

249
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,107
Upperclassman Kuno, no!

250
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,574
Akane's our only help.

251
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:17,307
If you help her
and she forfeits,

252
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:18,874
girls gymnastics is finished.

253
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:22,174
-But you can't just
stand here and--

254
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:24,607
-What she needs
right now is support.

255
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:26,540
Akane, you can do it!

256
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:31,374
-Ah!

257
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:31,915
Ugh.

258
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:41,074
-But what about getting
your treasure back?

259
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:43,807
-I'm working on that, darling.

260
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,740
Why should I trouble myself with
the pigtailed girl and Akane

261
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Tendo when the burly
boy will do it for me?

262
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,407
Amusing as this is,
you didn't think

263
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,707
it was for Mr. Scaly
Green's sake, did you?

264
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,040
[cackling]

265
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,574
-You do know you're
crazy, don't you?

00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:07,240
[screaming]

267
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:12,674
-Oh dear, I can't look.

268
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:15,340
-Sorry, but I ain't
giving up nearly so easy.

269
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,774
See ya!

270
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,740
-But Ranma, darling!

271
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,574
-Time to finish this.

272
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:29,174
Martial Men's super special
attack-- Ring of no Return!

[screaming]

274
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:42,674
ANNOUNCER: Is this her one-way
ticket to being disqualified?

275
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:48,107
-Akane!

276
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,074
Let's take turns.

277
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:51,674
-Ranma, you're here!

278
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:54,707
-Did you think I wouldn't come?

279
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,640
[inaudible]

280
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,974
-I knew it!

281
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,307
Here comes the pigtailed girl.

282
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:02,640
-No fair!

283
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,840
I object.

284
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,640
-Refusing the substitution,
challenger Dido Kuji

285
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,407
calls for a ruling in the ring.

286
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:11,240
-I'll allow it.

287
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,874
CROWD: He allows it!

288
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:14,807
ANNOUNCER: And the
crowd goes wild.

289
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:17,174
It's obvious who
their favorite is.

290
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,874
Meanwhile, the pigtailed
girl takes over.

291
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:21,007
-Sucks, don't it?

292
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,474
-It's just as well.

293
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:31,974
Our victory will be
that much the sweeter

294
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:33,607
for the extra effort.

295
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:38,474
This attack I'm about to unleash
may not look like very much.

296
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:42,640
But I assure you, you're
about to be bowled over.

297
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,540
Hi-ya!

298
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,874
Sphere of Fury holds all
the anger and frustration

299
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,274
that come from being in a club
that's such a joke, that's

300
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:54,974
so uncool that all the
girls think you're a dweeb.

301
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:56,940
-That is pretty mad, all right.

302
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,074
-Boy, I'll say.

303
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,440
Even the Debate Team's
cooler than them.

304
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:08,307
-Treasure Two,
Ribbon of Solitude!

305
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:10,840
Ribbon of Solitude
holds all the sadness

306
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,507
that comes from not having
a date on Friday night.

307
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,307
So powerful a weapon
is it, a single strike

308
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:20,074
brings forth the bitter tears
of four years of high school.

309
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:23,407
Or six, depending on if you're
counting junior higher or not.

310
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,174
-What the-- ugh.

311
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:39,640
Ah!

312
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,040
Do I get the dumb
treasure now or what?

313
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,774
-Oh yeah, that's right.

314
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:45,174
I forgot.

315
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:47,907
Furinkan High has still got a
treasure of its own we can use.

316
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,207
-Now this is more like it.

317
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,874
Payback's hell, ain't it?

318
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,074
-Ah!

319
00:16:58,174 --> 00:16:59,207
No, not--

320
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:01,507
-And what kind of power
do those things have?

321
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,574
-Club of Inscrutability.

322
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:06,840
Comes from trying to use a
really, really cool weapon,

323
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,107
but failing and having to
cause a distraction instead.

324
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,140
-Sorry I asked.

325
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:17,674
-Ah!

326
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:19,574
What the heck are those?

327
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,307
-The distraction.

328
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,174
-I hope you don't
take this wrong way,

329
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:25,440
but couldn't you have
been more creative?

330
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,774
-I know you're doing
us a favor, Akane,

331
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:30,140
but you don't have
to be so critical!

332
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,107
-Oh, don't be so sensitive!

333
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:34,840
-Time to finish it for good!

334
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:42,640
Think of this as a
token of my affection.

335
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:47,940
-Ah!

336
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,940
Now what do I do?

337
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,481
Ranma!

338
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:57,448
Ah!

339
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:04,974
[screaming]

340
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,340
ANNOUNCER:
[inaudible] challenger

341
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,840
Dido Kuji left the ring.

342
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,307
Either way, it's been an
exciting match, hasn't it?

343
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:18,907
-I-- I've got you.

344
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,607
ANNOUNCER: Uh-oh.

345
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:20,540
Uh-oh!

346
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,240
The pigtailed girl
is on the ropes.

347
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,074
-Pigtailed girl, over here!

348
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,440
Jump into my arms.

349
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,340
-Thanks, I'd rather
kiss a-- whoa.

350
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,107
If it's gonna take a
mid-air battle to beat you,

351
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:40,607
well then so be it!

352
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:44,607
I've got some chestnuts and
a fire I'd like you to meet.

353
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,107
-Yeah, Upward Spiral
Ribbon Defense!

354
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,074
ANNOUNCER: Hello, what's this?

355
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,407
The pigtailed girl's
attempting a breakthrough

356
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:57,574
of what seems an
impenetrable defense.

357
00:18:57,674 --> 00:19:01,040
RANMA: Come out, come
out wherever you are.

358
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,040
-What an incredible fight.

359
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,540
It's also an incredible
mess if you ask me, but--

360
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,540
[crowd screaming]

361
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:12,640
-Come on!

362
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,007
Come on, open up!

363
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:21,556
Gotcha!

364
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:29,474
-Don't do it!

365
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:30,474
You can't.

366
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,940
ANNOUNCER: That's it.

367
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,940
That's all she wrote.

368
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,440
The pigtailed girl wins.

369
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,940
-Woo-hoo, yeah!

370
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,940
-Ranma!

371
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,007
-So, uh, what?

372
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:44,907
You're expecting anything less?

373
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,374
-Oh, no you don't!

374
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:47,915
-Kodachi?

375
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
-Ranma!

376
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,540
-All that's left for
me to do is step down

377
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
and collect the Sphere of Fury.

378
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,307
Then, all three
treasures will be mine,

379
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,740
making me the queen of
martial arts gymnastics!

380
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,281
A-ha-ha!

381
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:23,674
-At last, the three
treasures are ours!

382
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:25,274
-Hey now, I object.

383
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:26,540
ANNOUNCER: Is this it?

384
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,140
Have the Martial Arts Men
Team triumphed after all?

385
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,440
With all three treasures
now in their possession,

386
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,707
it would seem to be so!

387
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,540
-Now, wait a sec.

388
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,607
I remember reading
something about this.

389
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,907
It says it's very
important for neither boys

390
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,874
nor girls to own all three.

391
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:43,974
-But why not?

392
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:45,440
What's supposed to happen?

393
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,940
-Hey, look up there.

394
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,640
-Martial Arts Men's
Gymnastics rules!

395
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:54,774
Wha-- wha-- what
are those things?

396
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:55,315
Hey!

397
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
-The Spirits of Girls
Upset because they've

398
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,274
wasted their entire youth
on nothing but martial arts

399
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:06,674
gymnastics.

400
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:09,074
-Oh, well now I know
that you're making it up.

401
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:10,674
-But I'm not.

402
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:12,240
-That's it, I'm
quitting the club

403
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,874
and getting myself a boyfriend.

404
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,240
-Hey, me too.

405
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,707
-Somebody help me!

406
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,440
-Don't you see?

407
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,074
It's their way of telling
us that life without romance

408
00:21:24,174 --> 00:21:25,540
is hardly worth living!

409
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,174
And that it's our
duty, Ranma-- yours

410
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,074
and mine-- to be happy for them.

411
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,074
[sighing]

412
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:33,115
-What?

413
00:21:33,174 --> 00:21:33,615
-I dunno.

414
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,040
[ribbit]

415
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:48,869
[theme music]

416
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,300
What was thought
to be a relaxing

417
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,933
trip to the hot springs turns
into some kind of crazy scheme

418
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,466
to get men and women together
in the-- oh, wait, wait.

419
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:25,766
Let me try that again.

420
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:28,033
Next time, on Ranma--
