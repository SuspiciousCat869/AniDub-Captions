[gasps]

00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,066
-Behold these servants.

4
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,400
-I represent a certain clan
in the Koga ninja sect.

5
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
-And I represent a rival clan.

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,166
-I represent the Iga.

7
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,400
-And I represent their rivals.

8
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,766
-While my clan's opposed
to all of them at once.

9
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:20,800
[whimpering]

10
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,300
-And so, having now
seen these ninja,

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,200
what say you to their worth?

12
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,233
-M-- m-- master Kuno, I--

13
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,066
-As of today, my dear uncle
has asked them to join us.

14
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,833
-In-- in what way?

15
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,233
-It would seem that our
household defenses are sorely

16
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,666
lacking.

17
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,766
-Household defense?

18
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:43,333
That's my role.

19
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:47,433
-And so it was, but it
may not be so much longer.

20
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,800
-Oh no!

21
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,100
-It grieves me, Sasuke, but I
have no further use for you.

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,933
[gasps]

23
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:57,733
-Say it's not so.

24
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,000
-It has not escaped our
notice that you have served us

25
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,633
well these many years.

26
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,700
In recognition of
that service, I

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
extend to you this
one final chance.

28
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,733
-You do?

29
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,066
Oh, thank you.

30
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:14,966
-It so happens there is
a task in need of doing.

31
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:18,433
Acquit yourself honorably and
I may consider keeping you on.

32
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,900
However, should you
fail your mission,

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,800
your connection with this
household ends permanently.

34
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:30,700
Be off with you.

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,166
You'll receive the
details soon enough.

36
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,566
SASUKE: Yes, sir.

37
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,766
[grunting]

38
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,633
NARRATOR: Sasuke's
Mission Improbable.

39
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:46,100
[telephone ringing]

40
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,266
KUNO (ON PHONE): The
details of your mission

41
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,200
can be found in the
phone's receiver.

42
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:04,833
Inside, you will find
the name of your target.

43
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,800
SASUKE: B--b-- but that's--

44
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,833
KUNO (ON PHONE): Arrange
a meeting between us.

45
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,166
You have one week.

46
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,500
SASUKE: Yes sir, Master Kuno.

47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,833
KUNO (ON PHONE): Very well.

48
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,066
As always, should your mission
be uncovered or should you

49
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,333
be taken prisoner,
the Kuno family

50
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,300
will of course
disavow all knowledge.

51
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,233
This phone will
now self destruct.

52
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,500
-How best can I get close
to the pigtailed girl?

53
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,166
[screams]

54
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,366
AKANE: Wasn't it great
how the pool cleared out?

55
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:38,500
RANMA: Great for you maybe.

56
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,100
-So what is it now?

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,233
-I show up wearing the
girl's bathing suit

58
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,700
so no one gets freaked out,
but then they do anyway.

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,766
-Well, when you jump in as a
guy and climb out as a girl,

60
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:55,066
people are going to get
upset, hon, you know?

61
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,166
RANMA: And I didn't
even get to enjoy it.

62
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,466
SASUKE: I knew I'd find you.

63
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:03,300
The hottest time of
the year, and here I

64
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,200
am in an abandoned
mailbox full of my sweat

65
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,800
hoping you'd pass by.

66
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,466
Finally, though, my
gambit's paid off,

67
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:15,433
even if it did take three days,
five hours, and 47 minutes.

68
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:19,900
You can run, pigtailed
girl, but you can't hide.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,900
[grunting]

00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,033
-Whew.

72
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,966
That felt good.

73
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,333
Hey, watermelon.

74
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:49,600
-We've been waiting
for you to join us.

75
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,333
Shall we dig in?

-Oh yes, the humble watermelon.

take the heat right out

[chuckling]

82
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,366
-But the pigtailed
girl lived here

83
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,166
in this same house with Akane.

84
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:17,066
-Where are your
manners, greedy pig?

85
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,433
-Oh yeah?

86
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,366
-You little--

87
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:26,233
-Why, you--

88
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,466
-Here we go again.

89
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:28,733
-I don't think so.

90
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,933
Go fight outside.

91
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:31,000
It's too hot.

92
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,800
-Well?

93
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,341
-Hm.

94
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,841
Sure.

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,333
Why not?

96
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,066
-Thought you got me, eh, boy?

97
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,900
Well, wait 'til you
get a load of this.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,833
Anything goes.

99
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:49,733
Final attack.

-Try rapid fire.

00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:01,933
-What in the world's
going on out there?

103
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,000
-Serves you right.

104
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:08,366
-Hey!

105
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:09,300
That's the--

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,166
-OK, you jerk.

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,666
-Ah, fine dining,
don't you think?

108
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,833
-Yeah, I guess it's OK.

109
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,333
-What a family.

110
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,766
-What's that?

111
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:29,307
-Hey!

112
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
-Oh, this is so good.

113
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,100
Mm.

114
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,133
What's this called, anyway?

115
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,033
[grunting]

116
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,566
KASUMI: Some tea?

117
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,833
-Hm?

118
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:47,933
RANMA: OK, Pop, if
that's how you want it--

119
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,500
-Thank you.

120
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,066
-Admit say.

121
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,833
Say you lost.

122
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,766
Fine, then I'll get more ammo.

123
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,266
-Whoever it was,
they cleaned us out.

124
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:10,133
-I don't suppose
you ate it, Kasume.

125
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,066
-Oh, no.

126
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,566
It was Sasuke.

127
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,666
He was just here.

128
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:14,200
-What?

129
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,666
-Sasuke did?

130
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:17,400
-And why's he here?

131
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,533
Did you call him?

132
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,666
-Not me.

133
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,666
Mm-mm.

134
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,533
-Ooh.

135
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:22,666
That was good.

136
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,233
Who'd have ever thought
there was such a thing?

137
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,200
Hello.

138
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,766
Why, if it isn't
the pigtailed girl.

139
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,000
When'd she get here?

140
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:33,933
-Stupid jerk.

141
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,500
Now I've got to go take
a bath all over again.

142
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,800
-Aha.

143
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,866
She won't be able to
get away from me now.

144
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:49,433
Still, if I should
take my eyes off her.

145
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,466
I'll just have to make
sure that I don't.

146
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,233
It's kind of hard
to see, actually.

147
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,500
What am I doing?

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,933
I shouldn't be spying
on her like this.

149
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,933
Again, I am a spy.

150
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,833
No, I mustn't.

151
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:06,300
Than again it is professional.

152
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,500
Naughty, naughty, Sasuke.

153
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,300
Uh oh.

154
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Somebody's coming.

155
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,500
-Your turn.

156
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,866
-That sounded like Ranma.

157
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,866
How'd he get in here?

158
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:26,366
Does that mean the pigtailed
girl wasn't in the bathtub?

159
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,466
Hm.

160
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:29,933
Let's see.

161
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,033
No one can get past
me while I'm here,

162
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:35,566
so therefore, no one came in.

163
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,900
Ergo, Ranma Saotome, who
just left the bathroom,

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,100
was actually in here
the whole time, i.e.

165
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,300
the person I took to
be the pigtailed girl

166
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200

of every last detail,

335
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:57,677
haven't you, Master?

336
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,544
-Say, if it isn't
the pigtailed girl.

337
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:08,877
Right over there.

338
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:09,677
Here we go.

339
00:18:09,777 --> 00:18:10,577
Good girl.

340
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:12,844
Now, put the dress on, OK?

341
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:15,244
-OK.

342
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,177
[grunting, chuckling]

343
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:29,710
-Hallelujah!

344
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,477
[slurping]

345
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:36,244
RANMA: What are you doing?

346
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:44,444
So tell me, how did I
end up here, anyway?

347
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:45,210
-Oh no.

348
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,644
It's worn off.

349
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:48,210
-Worn off?

350
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,010
Oh, now I get it.

351
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,977
You and the freak went in
together on some kind of trick,

352
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:54,877
didn't you?

353
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:56,410
-I have an excuse, really.

354
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:56,951
-Really?

355
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:05,610
-Stay, please, just
a few minutes more.

356
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,077
-Forget it.

357
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:08,644
-But it's really
important to me.

358
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:10,210
All I need is 30 minutes.

359
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,610
No, make it 10 minutes.

360
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,110
Just 10 little
minutes, that's all.

361
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,610
-I said forget it.

362
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,277
-But my life's at stake.

363
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:18,310
-That's your problem.

364
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,110
Huh?

365
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,077
-Ranma!

366
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:22,110
-Jeez, Akane.

367
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,110
What's the matter?

368
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,644
-Well, you skipped
breakfast, Ranma.

369
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:26,744
You never do that.

370
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:29,877
-Dude over there and the freak
pulled some kind of weird trick

371
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:30,444
on me.

372
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:30,977
-Huh?

373
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,477
What trick?

374
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:33,744
-Pigtailed girl!

375
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:34,910
It is you!

376
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,277
And if it isn't
Akane Tendo, too!

377
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,744
You crazy girls.

378
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,310
You shouldn't have.

379
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,844
-M-- M-- Master Kuno, I
have something to tell you.

380
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,044
I--

381
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:51,110
For the two of you to
have come here to meet me,

382
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,010
I-- I'm touched.

383
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,710
[laughing]

384
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,577
-I guess it's too late.

385
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:05,277
-Touch this, you jerk!

386
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:06,744
-Master Kuno!

387
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:10,177
I'll be right there!

388
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,144
Master Kuno!

389
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,910
-Guess kicking just
comes kind of natural.

390
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,544
-To me, too.

391
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:17,977
So what say we go home?

392
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:19,110
-You betcha.

393
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,810
I'm starving.

394
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,744
-Master Kuno!

395
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,044
[crying]

396
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:31,010
Oh, Master Kuno.

397
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:37,944
KUNO (ON PHONE):
Sasuke, that you?

398
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:41,077
-I just called to say
I'm sorry, Master Kuno,

399
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:43,010
and I know I failed you.

400
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,177
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

401
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:49,477
KUNO (ON PHONE): Ha, ha,
Sasuke, you scamp, you.

402
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:53,610
Today, I met with the
pigtailed girl and Akane Tendo.

403
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,144
I'm happy, not angry.

404
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:59,744
You have proven yourself to me.

405
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:03,577
The job is yours if you want it.

406
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:04,110
-Oh.

407
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,877
Do you mean it?

408
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:06,144
Oh, Master Kuno.

409
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:07,444
Oh, thank you, thank you.

410
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:12,110
Oh, I know I'm worthy, but
I'll-- I swear I'll do my best.

411
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,577
KUNO (ON PHONE): Speaking of
which, you have a new mission.

412
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:15,477
-Huh?

413
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:16,344
Wh-- what?

414
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:16,885
Huh?

415
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:23,944
Master Kuno, I--

416
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:25,044
KUNO (ON PHONE): Good luck.

417
00:21:30,544 --> 00:21:31,910
[screaming]

418
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:19,094
NARRATOR: Picolet Chardin.

419
00:23:19,194 --> 00:23:21,961
What kind of name is that?

420
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:24,128
Did you say battle dining?

421
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:28,694
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"Hello, Bonjour, Goodbye."

422
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:30,461
We'll see you there.
