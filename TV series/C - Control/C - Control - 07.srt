1
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,708
Tell me, Soichiro. What is this?

2
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,416
Well, it's money, sir.

3
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,291
Choose your words carefully.
I'll ask again.

4
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,875
I don't know, Father.
It just looks like money.

5
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,000
Not "Father"!
Call me "Mr. Mikuni."

6
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,541
Yes, Mr. Mikuni. I'm sorry.

7
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,500
"My sincerest apologies, sir."

8
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,041
I told you to choose
your words carefully.

9
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,583
In business, people will
take advantage of you

10
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:13,333
if you make even
the slightest error.

11
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,250
As you observed, this is money.
That's clear enough.

12
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,875
But watch. When I
pile it up like this,

13
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,708
it becomes something
more than money.

14
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,291
Do you understand?
This is power.

15
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:32,458
Wherever you go, it is the only
thing that moves this world.

16
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,625
Pure power.

17
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,291
Right after I
graduated college.

18
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,666
I became my father's
executive assistant.

19
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,208
You don't have to do anything,
just sit back, observe,

20
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:59,458
and think very carefully about
what I'm doing. And learn.

21
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,958
I'm not going to
stop and explain

22
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,000
every little point to you.

23
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,500
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,500
My band in college
had a record deal,

25
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,791
but we had a fight and broke
up before we could sign it.

26
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,208
The whole experience ruined my
passion for music. In the end,

27
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:18,541
that's probably why I finally
gave in to my father's wishes.

28
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,708
In a nutshell, my father's job
was to build business networks.

29
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,833
He exchanged money upfront
and behind the scenes alike.

30
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:30,208
With money, he formed powerful
bonds with powerful men.

31
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,625
If one side collapsed,
both would go bust.

32
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,166
So in the midst of a crisis,

33
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,041
they'd rush
to each other's aid.

34
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,250
That is the meaning
of power. Of course,

35
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,208
my father isn't the one who
created the system. He simply

36
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,500
made a place for himself in a
world that'd existed for ages.

37
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,291
Well, how do you like your job?

38
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,208
I'm getting by.

39
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:59,416
You know, I'm not so sure you're
cut out for the business world.

40
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,000
You don't think so?

41
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:06,541
So, are you really
quitting music for good?

42
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,041
If you're a businessman
or a rock star.

43
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,083
You're still just working
to make a living.

44
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,916
I guess, but your music
wasn't all that bad,

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,875
if you ask me, at least.

46
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,375
I didn't think you'd give up
on it so soon, that's all.

47
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,333
Gimme a break. It may sound
harsh, but there aren't

48
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,750
many people who can actually
survive off of their dreams.

49
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,291
Frankly, I'm not one of them.

50
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,125
So, if my dreams
won't pay the bills,

51
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,833
I'll live off the shit
reality feeds me.

52
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,833
I see.

53
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,666
My father tried to hammer
everything he knew into my head.

54
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,500
He wanted to keep the business
in the family. The rest

55
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,791
of the office didn't care for
me, but that hardly mattered.

56
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,125
You told me she had stabilized!

57
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,291
That was true at the time,

58
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,458
but she's taken
a turn for the worse.

59
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,458
What? Don't give me that crap!

60
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,958
Then, would you rather I lie
to make you feel better?

61
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,708
There was no hospital in
Japan that could save

62
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,791
my little sister. She
needed to be taken to

63
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,000
a specialized
facility in America.

64
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,916
It was expensive and the
arrangements were complicated

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,666
but I tried to make it happen
as quickly as possible.

66
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,250
But then suddenly.

67
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,875
All of a sudden,
everyone is selling!

68
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,958
How am I supposed to
explain this to our clients?!

69
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,458
At this rate,
we're gonna go bankrupt!

70
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,291
Mr. Mikuni! Is there a plan?

71
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:51,916
The company was sinking.
It was a fragile system

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,083
The empire my father
had built hinged

73
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,000
on other networks' intervention.

74
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,250
We can sell some property,
if the situation's that bad.

75
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,916
I have an image to maintain-
who would want to do business

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,750
with a man who
had lost his house?

77
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,000
Just thought-

78
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,125
The only thing we need
right now is confidence.

79
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,625
No matter what others say
we must retain our composure.

80
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,416
We cannot panic.
We cannot be unnerved.

81
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,541
We must put on
a brave face at all times.

82
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,375
Lose your head
at a time like this

83
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,583
and your future
is soon to follow.

84
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,166
I understand.

85
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,458
I've canceled Takako's
visit to the U.S.

86
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,666
What did you say?!

87
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,291
I simply can't
afford it right now.

88
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,500
Can't afford it!? You're gonna
let your own daughter die

89
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,791
just to save a few yen?!

90
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,500
There's no guarantee that she'd
be saved in the first place

91
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,083
I don't need a guarantee! It's
still worth a shot, isn't it?!

92
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,250
Face it. The writing's been
on the wall for a long time.

93
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,583
What does that mean!?
You're just giving up!?

94
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,958
Even if Takako dies,
people won't

95
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,208
lose confidence in the company.

96
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,208
What kind of father are you!?

97
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:03,250
I may be your father, but before
that, I am a public figure!

98
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,708
There are certain
things I must uphold

99
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,750
even if it comes at
the cost of my own family!

100
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,500
Someday, you'll understand.

101
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,875
What makes you think I'll
end up like you?! If you're

102
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,041
not willing to save
your own daughter's life,

103
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll come up with
the money myself!

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,833
It didn't make any sense to me.
I didn't care if the business

105
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,750
was failing. What kind
of monster would sit back

106
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,291
and watch his own child die?!
I could never forgive him.

107
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,958
Go inside. Mr. Mikuni
gave me instructions

108
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,791
not to let you leave.

109
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,416
I don't give a damn; you have no
right to stop me! Now get lost!

110
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,083
Please forgive me.

111
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:54,250
After that, I was under house
arrest for days. Apparently,

112
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,166
if clients saw me running
around trying to raise money,

113
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,000
confidence in the company
would drop. If you ask me,

114
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:04,041
that would've been a small price
to pay. But what could I do?

115
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,916
I was powerless.

116
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,250
You had better
go see your sister.

117
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,916
What happened?

118
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,333
Would you please leave
the two of us alone?

119
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,333
It's been a while.
I've missed you.

120
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,875
I'm sorry

121
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,291
I thought that maybe I wouldn't
be able to see you again.

122
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,666
Takako.

123
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,708
They said with the way I am
now, I wouldn't be able

124
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,500
to get to America anyway.

125
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,291
But actually,
I'm a little relieved.

126
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,458
Because I didn't wanna
leave Japan.

127
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,708
Why not!?

128
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,125
I don't expect you to
understand what you probably

129
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,500
take for granted,
but when you go to sleep,

130
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,000
you know tomorrow will come.

131
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,041
And after this week,
the next will come.

132
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,458
After this month passes,
the next will come.

133
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:28,416
And after this year
will come the next.

134
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:33,125
But for me it's not like that.

135
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,833
When I go to sleep tonight.

136
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,708
I know I might not
wake up tomorrow.

137
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,625
So for me, the only thing
that matters is

138
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,583
this moment right now.

139
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,625
Instead of forcing me
to go to another country.

140
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,166
I'd rather stay here with you.

141
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,041
I know, you probably think
I'm silly for feeling this way.

142
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,708
It's alright.

143
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:07,041
I really wish today could last
forever. And I don't even care

144
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,750
if I never get better.

145
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:14,458
So long as tomorrow will be
the same as today.

146
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,000
That night,
Takako slipped into a coma.

147
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,833
To this day,
she hasn't woken up.

148
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,666
I closed my heart
and buried myself in work.

149
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,416
My relationship with my father

150
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,375
was limited strictly
to business.

151
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,791
Before long, I was visited
by a strange man.

152
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,916
Good evening.

153
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,458
I accepted his offer.

154
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,500
I asked him why
he hadn't shown up before

155
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,958
when I had needed help.

156
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,833
If only this had
happened sooner,

157
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,000
Takako might've gotten help.

158
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,541
Sorry, I wish I could help you,

159
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,291
but I'm in no position
to answer that.

160
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,416
It may not seem like it, but
this city has a will of its own.

161
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,375
It trifles with our fates.
It mocks each of us.

162
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,041
I can feel it looking down upon
me, and sneering, laughing.

163
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,958
Well, if it wants to toy with
me, then I'll be to return

164
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,541
the favor. I'll bend
its rules. I'll make it

165
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,833
play my game and use it
to protect the real world.

166
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,125
I don't care about being rich.
I don't care about their system.

167
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,708
All I care about
is getting my way.

168
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,958
Something troubling you?

169
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,041
Just lost in thought,
that's all.

170
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,708
It's nothing to do with us.

171
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,708
C.

172
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,333
C.

173
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:17,750
Kimimaro! Kimimaro!

174
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,416
My Entre's a real weirdo-
I can't figure him out.

175
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,916
I was disappointed
when I first met him.

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,750
He seemed kinda
slow in the head.

177
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,708
And when the deal started,
I think he got dumber

178
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,541
and more useless than before.

179
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,208
Also, when he has to do
one thing but wants to do

180
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,708
something else, he ends
up doing nothing at all.

181
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,416
And when he's
in trouble he doesn't

182
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,291
look at things logically,
he just follows his feelings

183
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,916
Angel.

184
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,708
You're the only thing
that matters to me.

185
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:12,250
I can't lose you. I won't lose
another person I care about.

186
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,250
C'mon, let's go.

187
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,000
Our last battle was
the toughest yet

188
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,041
but somehow we pulled through.

189
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,875
Thing is, when he saw what
happened to the guy we beat,

190
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,125
he got all depressed again.

191
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,625
I have no idea what
I'm supposed to do anymore.

192
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,833
Just fight.

193
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,666
Well yeah, I know that much.

194
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,000
Then why're you
still moping around for?

195
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,000
'Cause I feel like it.
Just give me some time. Man.

196
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,208
He never can make up his mind.
And when he does he wonders

197
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,333
if he made the right choice.

198
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,333
There isn't anyone else
like him in the whole city.

199
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,416
Assets are technically
their Entre's property.

200
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:11,791
So everyone tends to have kinda
a businesslike relationship.

201
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,375
But he's different.
He doesn't see it that way.

202
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,541
At first I figured it was
because I look like a human.

203
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,375
But I think it must
be something more than that.

204
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,458
So, you're supposed
to represent my future, right?

205
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,750
Yeah.

206
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,166
Then can you tell me
what's gonna happen to me?

207
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,083
I dunno.

208
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,875
They say when an Entre's future
is taken as collateral,

209
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,666
their Asset becomes
the embodiment of that future,

210
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,958
Well, that's what
everyone says, at least.

211
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:48,333
But I don't think anyone
really knows how it works.

212
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,375
When is it going to be
the future for him

213
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,500
and what does that mean
for me? Will I change?

214
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,666
It doesn't make sense.

215
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,666
We assets have nothing
to do with the future.

216
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,375
We only exist to fight in deals.
For us, there is no future.

217
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,916
I never had a problem with that,
but now I'm not so sure.

218
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Lately, whenever he's
worried about something,

219
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,875
it makes me worry, too.

220
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,000
Does it really
bug you that much?

221
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,958
The future.

222
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,958
Well yeah, I don't know
anything about it.

223
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sure the future's important,
but like Mr. Mikuni said,

224
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,125
so is the present. You don't
think about that stuff?

225
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,416
Not really.

226
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,916
It'd probably matter
more to you if you

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,833
lived in the real
world like me.

228
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,458
If all you do is worry,
I think I'm better off here.

229
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,125
Thanks to my weird partner,
things never get boring.

230
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,708
Is that right?

231
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,250
Even though it's more fun this
way, things would probably be

232
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,583
a lot easier on him if we
acted like other Entres.

233
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,250
Let's get some dinner!

234
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,166
I thought you said assets
don't need to eat anything.

235
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,750
Yeah, but I gotta see if those
are as good as your ramen!

236
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,791
Wait a second!

237
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,583
Evidently Humans need to take
in what they call "nutrients"

238
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,333
every day. Otherwise they'll
run out of energy and die.

239
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,416
Oh, hey, kid. I hear you've

240
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,833
been raking it in
since our last deal.

241
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,666
I keep trying to break even.

242
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,875
Oh, I joined the Starling
Guild a while back.

243
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,125
Did you?

244
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,416
I don't think I'm cut out
for that kinda stuff, myself.

245
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,791
It's a lot less trouble
working alone.

246
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,958
I know. It's tougher
than I thought.

247
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,208
If you know,
then why'd you join?

248
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,958
Well, 'cause at first, I didn't
think it would be all that hard.

249
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,250
Don't worry. 

250
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,416
Easier said than done.

251
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,458
You got Lady Luck
on your side, after all

252
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,833
Sure. Anyway. There's a question
I wanted to ask you.

253
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,166
Sure, shoot.

254
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,125
Assets are supposed to be
the physical embodiment

255
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,291
of their Entre's future,
aren't they?

256
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,291
But your asset is a giant
monster. Do you ever wonder

257
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,500
what that might mean
about your future?

258
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:02,125
Who knows? I've got no idea
why Gyiyg looks like that.

259
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,458
Lemme know if you figure it out.
I always wondered.

260
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,333
You too, huh?

261
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,583
I guess all Entres worry about
what their futures are like.

262
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,500
What's the big deal? I'm me.
Isn't that good enough?

263
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,916
Come on! It's good! Try it!
It might make you stronger

264
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,333
for your next deal! Look
how much that other asset

265
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,500
is eating!

266
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,666
Listen man, those things
are almost human.

267
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,291
Don't just feed it.
Think of it like a girlfriend.

268
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,750
You gotta do all kinds
of stuff to keep it happy.

269
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,208
Girlfriend, huh? More like
a pet. If you eat your food,

270
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,333
I'll give you a treat.

271
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,166
Don't let 'em get to you.

272
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,666
There's still a lot I don't
understand about him.

273
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,291
What's wrong?

274
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,333
Nothing.

275
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,958
Then stop staring.

276
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,916
But there is one thing that I
know for sure. Even if he gets

277
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,291
on my nerves sometimes,
I like being with him.

278
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,708
I mean, sure, he's always
doing stupid stuff,

279
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,583
but that's what
makes him so much fun.

280
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:04,791
I've had enough.
I can't keep running away.

281
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,000
I've never been able to
make decisions 'cause

282
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,833
I'm too afraid. I'm scared that
if I make the wrong choice

283
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,083
everyone'll be
disappointed in me.

284
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,916
But that's just an excuse, isn't
it? What I'm really afraid of

285
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,666
is getting hurt myself.
I'm a coward.

286
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,041
I keep running away
instead of taking action.

287
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,500
I waste my time
worrying about what to do

288
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,500
and I end up doing nothing.

289
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,958
That hurt. What the hell is your
problem, you little shit!?

290
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,791
How do you like it?!

291
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,416
Why'd you go back to hit him?

292
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,791
'Cause I didn't wanna
end up doing nothing.

293
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,333
The way those guys were
talking really pissed me off.

294
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,041
I wasn't sure fighting them
was the right choice.

295
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,250
But when I decided not
to do it. I felt ashamed.

296
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:05,000
At least fighting them is better
than doing nothing.

297
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,458
But starting a fight
with some thugs isn't smart.

298
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,750
So even though I finally made a
decision, there's still no way

299
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,875
to know for sure if
I made the right one.

300
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,666
I still don't get it.

301
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,708
Maybe Mr. Mikuni and that Sato
lady expect a lot outta him

302
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,666
because he's willing to do
crazy stuff sometimes.

303
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,000
Prepare yourself!

304
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,958
Wow! What a deal!

305
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,166
Cloudy skies with
a 10% chance of--

306
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,208
today's horoscope! 
If you're a Leo--

307
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,375
Go back a little.

308
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,500
Yeah! What are they doing?

309
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,000
They're kissing.

310
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,625
Kissing? What's that?

311
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,958
When two people like each other,
they put their lips together

312
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,625
and it's called a "kiss".

313
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,750
I wanna try it!

314
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,458
Whoa, not so fast!
You can't just kiss anybody!

315
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,916
You have to really
really like the person!

316
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,250
Is that how you do it?

317
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,666
Look, whatever you're
feeling, it has to be like

318
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,041
30 times stronger
or it won't work!

319
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,000
Man, what a let-down. Then,
can you at least tell me

320
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,208
what it feels like?

321
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,541
I, uh. I wouldn't know.
I've never done it.

322
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,958
I see.

323
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,625
So if you've never kissed
anybody, does that mean

324
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,791
you don't know
what it feels like?

325
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,375
Nope.

326
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:23,541
If you liked me, and I liked you
30 times more than I do now,

327
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,291
you and I could kiss?

328
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,166
Well, sure,
when you put it that way.

329
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,375
Okay! I'll try
to like you more, then.

330
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,708
All right. Be my guest.

331
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,125
There's a lot of things
I still don't understand,

332
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,958
but it's fun figuring them out.

333
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,541
I never know what
she's going to do next.

334
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,666
The future sure is full
of surprises, isn't it?

335
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,166
Maybe I've been
worrying too much.

336
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,875
The future will work
itself out somehow.

337
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,458
Hey.

338
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,708
Yes, sir?

339
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,708
There used to be five
skyscrapers over there,

340
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,625
but now there's only three.
Did they get torn down?

341
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,833
Beats me. I'm too old to keep up
with all that crap.

342
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,166
I don't know why. But everything
looks a little different

343
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,875
than it did before.

344
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:18,083
Sure it's not your imagination?
Not that it matters either way.

345
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,000
Whatever it is, it's gone.
Best off forgetting it

346
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,750
for our own sake.
