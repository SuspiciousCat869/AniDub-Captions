1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,666
According to Mr. Barkin of
the FRB, if the US dollar is

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,166
allowed to grow any weaker--

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,916
The American market's
finally started to move.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,750
If we get pressured
by a strong dollar,

5
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,291
foreign currencies are gonna
collapse across the board.

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,875
So America thinks they can stop
C's chain reaction if they can

7
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,250
throw enough of their money
into foreign economies?

8
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,000
In addition, the IMF will
be providing relief--

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,375
That guy is an American Entre.
The one on the left.

10
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,000
You kiddin' me?

11
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,708
America's entire history
has been shaped

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,958
by the Financial District.

13
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,625
While foreign investors from
around the world have rushed

14
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:49,291
to support them, entire nations
have disappeared as collateral.

15
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,750
Hell's bells! You may be
handsome, but you play dirty.

16
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,208
We can't help but throw cash
around. North America has lots

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,583
of super duper entrepreneurs!
But you can have this!

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,333
The North American Financial
District was able to repel C!

19
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,458
It's headed straight
back to Japan!

20
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,833
The one that took Singapore's
about to hit us again, huh?

21
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,458
Then it's time for round two.

22
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,083
You think we can
protect ourselves?

23
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,708
Well, look who it is!

24
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,333
Get the rotary press
moving again.

25
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,708
And make it snappy, alright?

26
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,208
But of course, sir! Though
I must warn you we'll be

27
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,333
taking additional collateral.
I trust you don't mind?

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mikuni.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,708
Due to America's
intervention in the market,

30
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,375
currencies all around the
world are collapsing.

31
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,041
To protect this country
from "C"s chain reaction,

32
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,333
Mikuni's used the rotary
press a second time.

33
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,833
The rotary press?

34
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,333
It prints all the Midas Money
in the Financial District,

35
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,041
using the country's
future as collateral.

36
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,000
Wait. Is that the reason
stuff keeps disappearing?

37
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,541
That idiot. I never thought
he'd use the damn thing twice.

38
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,250
Is there any way to stop it?

39
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,625
Not personally, since you
need a Darkness Card

40
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,166
to enter it in the first place.

41
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,125
Thanks to Kikuchi's
fight with Seizawa,

42
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,125
Mikuni's the only one left
in our District who has one.

43
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,708
So there's nothing we can do?

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,750
There's one thing we could try.

45
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,791
The last time Mikuni
used the rotary press,

46
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,125
there was a several hour
grace period between getting

47
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,083
the Midas money and
when the future was lost.

48
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,583
You saw it yourself.

49
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,666
Yeah.

50
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,458
That's our only chance
to make a stand.

51
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,708
We'll have to put in a bid for
a deal and then bankrupt him.

52
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,041
If that works, we'll get his
Darkness Card and have a chance

53
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,625
to run the rotary press in
reverse to put back the money

54
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,291
back to the bank before our
future is taken as collateral.

55
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,791
But do you think we can beat
Mr. Mikuni in a deal?

56
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,375
The source of his power is his
wealth; which means it has

57
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,416
the same weaknesses
as any other currency.

58
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,291
In other words, it can be worth
a lot or nothing at all.

59
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,750
When I'm done, it won't be worth
the paper it's printed on.

60
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,166
What are you gonna do?

61
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,750
That's the question, huh.
I'm gonna use every trick

62
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,958
in the book to make the value
of the yen hit rock bottom.

63
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,791
And since Mikuni's precious
Midas Money gets its strength

64
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,833
from the yen, if my plan works,
his mighty fortune

65
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,291
will be mighty useless
in no time flat.

66
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,583
It's a simple fact.
Money derives all its power

67
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,000
from confidence.

68
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,500
Get it? Undermine that
confidence, and the rest

69
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,500
takes care of itself.
You might say we're starting

70
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,500
an economic domino effect
with confidence as a catalyst.

71
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,041
The pieces will keep falling
down, one after another.

72
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,000
The final domino will be
the Financial District.

73
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,291
Everything depends on
what we can pull off

74
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,833
during our
"grace period". Yoga?

75
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,083
Yeah.

76
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,041
It'll all be over if the
guild members interfere.

77
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,791
I'm counting on you
to hold them up.

78
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,208
Okay.

79
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,208
It might sound dramatic,
but this deal is our chance

80
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,583
to win the future back.

81
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,083
If we do this, no one else
will disappear, right?

82
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,500
I'm just an asset, if I get
wiped out, it's no big deal.

83
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,916
So don't wuss out on this!

84
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,583
I know. If we sacrifice
the future,

85
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,500
then what are we living for?

86
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,958
Whatever! I get it! You don't
need to get all philosophical

87
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,333
on me all of a sudden.

88
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,250
I know what I want
to protect now.

89
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,708
I'm ready to fight for real.

90
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,666
Good, so no more
speeches, okay?

91
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,750
Hope this isn't
too much for him!

92
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,541
By the way, have you
caught the rat yet?

93
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,666
I've got him by the tail.
Little bastard's been trapped

94
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,125
by his own scheme.

95
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:22,375
Alley oop! The transfer
you requested is complete!

96
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,416
PIN code?

97
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,833
Confirmed.

98
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,333
Here it comes.

99
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,291
This is enough to buy a small
country! Mikuni and Sato are

100
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,583
too charitable for their own
good. Why waste all their

101
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,000
hard earned money on
the ignorant masses?

102
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,166
What the hell?

103
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,000
Give it up, You think
you're sly, but Mikuni's

104
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,208
been onto you for a long time.

105
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:56,166
You always got on my nerves.
You and your polka dot ties.

106
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,708
Nice doing business with you!

107
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,250
You were a red herring from
the start, Mr. Isurugi,

108
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,458
but you left a nice little
crack in Mikuni's defenses.

109
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,041
Alas, I can't say I'm
too sad to see you go.

110
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,041
Sinners who play saint leave
a bad taste in my mouth.

111
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,166
Helicopter money, drop!

112
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,208
Would you like
to choose an opponent?

113
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,208
Yes.

114
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,125
What! A hundred million yen!?

115
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,000
The yen is useless!
Exchange it for dollars!

116
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,875
Yes! Yes!

117
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,416
Mr. Mikuni?

118
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
What is it?

119
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,125
You have a request for a deal.

120
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,333
Tell 'em I pass. C's chain
reaction is closing in.

121
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,958
Very well. But I must remind
you, if you wish to pass,

122
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,958
you are required pay
half of your total fortune.

123
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,416
Is this a joke?

124
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,458
I'm sure you'd rather
our future trying

125
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,541
to fight that chain reaction,
but there's nothing you can do.

126
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,208
A dog from the IMF.

127
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,416
This must mean you're
trying to stall me,

128
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,166
what're you cooking up now?

129
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,916
The details don't matter. I want
a deal and I'm getting one.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,166
Isn't that right, Masakaki?

131
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,916
Indeed. Like it or not,
I'm afraid rules are rules.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,875
You say I'm just trying to
stall you, huh. Of course,

133
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,958
you automatically assume
that you're going to win.

134
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,250
What kind of arrogant ass thinks
he can save an entire country

135
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,708
on his own? You have no
right to spend our future-

136
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,541
it doesn't belong to you!

137
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,500
You think this is arrogance?

138
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,583
Your opponent, Mr. Horii,
is already waiting for you.

139
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,000
So you were just hanging out
with us for kicks, huh?

140
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,500
If Mr. Mikuni couldn't win you
over, I won't bother trying

141
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,500
to change your mind.
And besides, it's not like

142
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,083
I'm gonna turn down
a deal when it's staring me

143
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,125
right in the face.

144
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,125
I'll warn you, though.
I'm strong. This won't be easy.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,875
Hey, Masakaki.

146
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,083
What is it my boy?

147
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,250
Mashu's been
acting strange lately.

148
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,166
Never fear- it's quite normal
for an asset to experience pain

149
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,666
while the rotary
press is running.

150
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,833
But I thought assets
weren't able to get hurt!

151
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,583
As you know, an asset is the
future of the entrepreneur.

152
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,541
The very future that
is now being siphoned

153
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,166
and turned into money.

154
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,291
So. It's only logical that they
would be affected adversely.

155
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,125
Don't worry, I'm alright.
I'm ready to do this!

156
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,333
You really are tough,
aren't you?

157
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:11,291
You don't have to force
yourself, okay? Just relax.

158
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll handle this.

159
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,916
I'm your asset. If you're gonna
fight, then I'm fighting too!

160
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,541
As my asset, it's your job
to do what I say, Mashu.

161
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,166
I don't have to win.
All I have to do is hold out

162
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,000
'til Ms. Sato can get
the Darkness Card.

163
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,333
Don't be stupid!

164
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,750
Direct.

165
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,083
You're gonna fight me on your
own? It's your funeral, pal.

166
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,333
Open deal.

167
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,041
Insider!

168
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,041
Sucks to be you, traitor,
I'm gonna make this hurt!

169
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:55,958
Damn it.

170
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,083
You can't do this alone!

171
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,416
I'll be all right.

172
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,958
Kimimaro! You have to let
me out! You gotta let me

173
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,958
fight with you!

174
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,916
No way.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,291
Insider on! So long, sucker!

176
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,750
Let me help you, please!

177
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,083
Hold on, something's wrong!

178
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,583
Damn it! What happened!?
Don't bail out on me now,

179
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,541
you piece of junk!
Ah, that hurt!

180
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,833
Why do you care so much
about the future, anyway?!

181
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,416
You don't know if it'll
be good or bad or what.

182
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,083
It's not worth killing
yourself over! Is it?!

183
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,708
Mashu.

184
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,125
No matter what happens.
I'm glad I met you.

185
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,958
C'mon, pal.
Don't leave me hanging here!

186
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,125
Insider.

187
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,083
You know why
the future's important?

188
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,750
Because you are
my future, Mashu.

189
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,458
Damn it!

190
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,375
Insi-Insider.

191
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,333
I may not know what it holds
for me, and maybe it's silly

192
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,958
to risk my life
to protect something

193
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,666
I don't know anything about.

194
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,750
But even if I can't see the
future, I can still see you

195
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,208
and I want to protect you.
Isn't that the same thing?

196
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,375
Get up and move already!

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,291
Oh, so now you decide
to work? Blade!

198
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,125
Y'know, you can be
a real pain in the ass,

199
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,791
but there's nobody
in the world I like better.

200
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,083
What's that supposed to mean?

201
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,791
I'll protect you!

202
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:16,000
Ready for round two, huh?
I'm gonna rip you to shreds!

203
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,083
Let's hit him with a Macro!
Invest everything

204
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,708
and I'll barbeque him!

205
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:24,291
Micro, Mezzo, Macroflation.
Overheated Economy.

206
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,208
If this doesn't do it,
nothing will.

207
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,750
I don't believe it!
Why couldn't I see that coming?

208
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,083
Is it 'cause
my future's really dying?

209
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,500
This is nuts.

210
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,458
Closing. You are bankrupt.

211
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,291
You have gain.

212
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,541
Hey!

213
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,291
I guess using a Macro
takes a lot out of me.

214
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,958
We'll just have
to use 'em sparingly.

215
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,291
Why are you such a weirdo?

216
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,375
Excuse me for being concerned.

217
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,125
You okay?!

218
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,875
I don't wanna leave you
yet, Kimimaro. After all,

219
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,125
I know you're
hopeless without me.

220
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll buy it back. Our future.

221
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,541
C.

222
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:42,375
C.

223
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,500
Now, let's see here.
Might be time to put

224
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,416
the next step
into action, huh?

225
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,958
Hello, Takedazaki speaking.
This is the Fuji Times, right?

226
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:53,958
I've got some
exclusive information

227
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,250
if you're interested in buying.

228
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,416
This is gonna
rock your socks off.

229
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:06,083
Open deal. Micro,
Mezzo, Macroflation.

230
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,250
Mergers and Acquisitions.

231
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,166
You're gonna be flat broke
when I'm done with you!

232
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:13,833
What the hell?!

233
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,375
Kakazuzu, go!

234
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:20,750
As you wish.

235
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,208
Micro.

236
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,833
Aurora, go!

237
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,166
György! Hang in there!

238
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,458
Direct.

239
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,000
Direct.

240
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,458
Q. I dunno if I'm gonna make it.

241
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,208
Micro, Mezzo, Macroflation.
Mergers and Acquisitions.

242
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,208
You're mine!

243
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,833
Looks like twice is the limit.
I'm not finished yet!

244
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,916
EBO. Direct.

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,625
That's impossible! How can
your asset enter on its own?

246
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,125
Cannibalization.

247
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,708
Direct.

248
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,333
I know my hands are stained with
blood, but I chose this path.

249
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,375
I walk it without regret.

250
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
You smell like you'd make
a nice snack.

251
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,750
I hear the government
accidentally gave out

252
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,958
millions of yen 'cause
of some machine error.

253
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,125
That's why you
gotta spend it now!

254
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,000
That's right, spend
it all, 'cause soon,

255
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,250
you won't even wanna
wipe your ass with it!

256
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,833
Rapid inflation!
Hyper inflation!

257
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,500
--banning the exchange of yen
to foreign currencies.

258
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,166
Similarly, there is also
a ban on the depositing

259
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,791
of foreign currency as well
as sending cash or checks--

260
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,500
Alright. I wonder which is gonna
disappear first: this country,

261
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,708
or the Bank of Midas!

262
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,250
I guess that'll depend on how
well Ms. Sato's holding up.

263
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,166
Are you there?

264
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,375
Ms. Sato, are you okay?

265
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm sorry, but there's no
way I can turn this around.

266
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,916
Mikuni's stronger
than I thought.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,666
I don't stand a chance.

268
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,291
I did all I could do.

269
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,166
If you know there's
no way you're gonna win

270
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,125
why don't you
withdraw from the deal?

271
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,250
Sorry, asshole,
but that's too easy.

272
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,458
I'll be a thorn
in your side 'til I die.

273
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,583
You really are a bitch,
aren't you?

274
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,958
I guess I can't
disagree with you.

275
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:43,500
Yoga, I'm sorry
I got you wrapped up in this.

276
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,791
But I have to ask
for one more favor.

277
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,791
I can't look after
György anymore. Take him.

278
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:59,083
He's my future,
take good care of him.

279
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,875
Go!

280
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,000
György is yours.

281
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,750
Thank you, and good luck.

282
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,333
Watch, watch, watch.

283
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,375
Mine.

284
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,625
You are bankrupt.

285
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,666
I don't know what you planned
to do but Sato already failed

286
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,458
to take my Darkness card.

287
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,916
If you were trying to stop
the press, then give up.

288
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,583
One of my co-workers disappeared
right in front of my eyes.

289
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,291
What's your point?

290
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,125
And it isn't just him kids
are disappearing too.

291
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,333
'Cause of you! It's happening
'cause you started the press!

292
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,541
You can't tell me that's
right, sacrificing the future

293
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,958
to protect the present.

294
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,500
Don't you realize how much
the assets are suffering!?

295
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,750
Q is your future, isn't she!?
Don't you feel anything!?

296
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,208
Don't you care!?

297
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,041
If Q disappeared
because of what I did,

298
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,125
then I would disappear with her.
I can't concern myself

299
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,416
with the consequences.

300
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,916
I won't accept that. I was
wrong to ever believe in you.

301
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,500
There's no way
I'll let Mashu disappear.

302
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,500
I'm gonna protect my future!

303
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,625
Mikuni!

304
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,833
What's wrong?

305
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,416
Our account was emptied out
and given away.

306
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,208
So that's their plan?
Using my own money

307
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,666
to destroy the economy
with hyperinflation.

308
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,666
When the value of the yen
drops, then Midas Money,

309
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,708
and all of my assets,
will become weaker, as well.

310
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,625
We can't defend
against the chain reaction now.

311
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,083
Don't lose your head!
Go back to Japan

312
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,083
and contact
the defense fund recipients.

313
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,458
I'll prepare the money.

314
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,541
I'll get right on it, sir.

315
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,833
Hey, Masakaki!

316
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,583
How may I assist you?

317
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,875
Start up the rotary press
one more time!

318
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,125
Are you sure?
If you aren't careful,

319
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,083
you'll burn through
your entire future.

320
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,708
I don't care! Start it!

321
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,125
You've already
done enough damage!

322
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,416
If you destroy the future,
what's left to fight for!?

323
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,791
Scream all you want,
so long as you're weak,

324
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,083
it won't do any good.

325
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,958
To realize your ideals,
above all else, you need power.

326
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,166
You're going to
have to accept that.

327
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,333
I won't let you do it!

328
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,166
Won't let me? You're in no
position for threats, Yoga.

329
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:34,166
Please don't despair, Mr. Yoga.
Why, if I'm not mistaken,

330
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,750
you have a Darkness card
as well, don't you?

331
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,458
My goodness Mr. Mikuni,
do you see that?

332
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,166
Whatever shall we do now?

333
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,541
With that card, Mr. Yoga
can reverse the direction

334
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,125
of the rotary press.

335
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,166
You son of a bitch!
What the hell are

336
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,291
you' trying to pull?

337
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,000
Me? I'm innocent,
I assure you! I don't decide

338
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,750
on these sorts of things.
I follow my orders from above!

339
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,583
Do it! Spin the rotary press
in reverse!

340
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,500
You think I'll just sit back
and let you win this?

341
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,083
You're going to have
to get through me first.

342
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,750
So be it.

343
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,958
Then the deal is on, gents!
