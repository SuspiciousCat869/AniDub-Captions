1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,666
After the shock of the Southeast
Asian Financial crisis,

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,500
Economists speculated
that the stock market

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,583
might begin picking up.
Their hopes were dashed when

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,833
trillions of yen were
mysteriously deposited

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,375
into bank accounts
across the country

6
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,125
causing the value of the
yen to drop dramatically.

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,583
3,000 yen to the dollar?!

8
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,000
You're trying to
rob me blind, aren't you?

9
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,541
Go ahead and exchange it!

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,125
Stores won't
take anything else!

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:33,666
So the current decline of the
yen has nothing to do with "C"?

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,625
No sir. It's some sort
of conspiracy.

13
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,458
But, what about "C"?

14
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,125
Take a look at the screen.

15
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,625
Oh, honestly.
I can't believe that

16
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,291
the people of this world
can be so simple-minded.

17
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,666
I've had a feeling
this time would come.

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,625
And I did as well, Q.

19
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,166
It must be fate.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,083
No, it's necessity.
Deep down I've always known

21
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,541
I'd have to
face off against him.

22
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,791
Wouldn't you consider
that to be fate?

23
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,416
 I suppose you have a point.

24
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,166
You ready?

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,625
Yeah.

26
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,541
You've got one hour
until it's time to "settle up"!

27
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,291
Open deal!

28
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,500
Princess!

29
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,416
Sleeping Beauty Microflation.

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,625
'Kay Mashu. Micro, 50 million!

31
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:23,541
One billion!

32
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,208
Direct.

33
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:29,750
Direct.

34
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,708
Direct.

35
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,791
Watch out!

36
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,958
Let's switch out, Mashu!

37
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,666
Swap.

38
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:47,541
Let's try a mezzo.

39
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,958
EBO. Direct.

40
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,541
What do you mean I can't
exchange my money?!

41
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,083
Apparently every country
around the globe

42
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,125
has ceased trading in yen, sir.

43
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,750
I never thought I'd see
the day Japan's currency

44
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,375
would be null and void.

45
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,583
We're going to have to
prepare for the worst.

46
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,333
Direct. Direct.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,791
Shame it had to come to this.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,291
Q!

49
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,000
Now switch it up!

50
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,041
Swap.

51
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,625
Talk about playin' with fire!

52
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,208
When it's dicey
in the real world,

53
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,458
it's sure to be the same here!

54
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,791
Oh, it's dicey all right.

55
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,166
Unfortunately,
you were the one I chose

56
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,375
to carry the torch after me.

57
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,041
No matter what happens
to me or when,

58
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,625
I want to make
this moment last forever.

59
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,958
After getting to know you,

60
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,833
I'd thought we both
shared that belief.

61
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,333
You must not "know"
me that well.

62
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,958
Although we may not
be able to see eye to eye.

63
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:23,125
We want the same end result. I'm
afraid that doesn't matter now.

64
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,375
Kimimaro, you have to
use a Macro!

65
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,250
No. That's way too strong.
I don't want to.

66
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,375
You have to go all out!
I'm telling you,

67
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,458
that's the only way!

68
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,375
Micro, Mezzo, Macroflation.

69
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,250
Q.

70
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,458
Economic Blockade.

71
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,291
Here goes.

72
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,666
Overheated Economy.

73
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,750
I can't move!

74
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,041
The FSA has issued a nationwide
ban on currency exchange.

75
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,750
Financial institutions
have closed their doors

76
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,958
causing angry citizens
to start rioting.

77
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,875
If your little sister was
a victim of time like mine.

78
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,291
I'm sure you would want to stay
in the present as much as I do!

79
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,166
Direct.

80
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,875
That's not what your sister
wanted and you know it!

81
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,833
You're stuck in the present
'cause it's what you want!

82
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,500
You said you wanted to protect
the present to save the future,

83
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,458
but you were just satisfying
your own selfish desires!

84
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,916
You've never walked in my shoes
so how the hell would you know?!

85
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,958
What?!

86
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,291
You only take dollars?!
You can't be serious!

87
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,666
C'mon, that stuff about
the yen was just a rumor!

88
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry but that's
our store policy, ma'am.

89
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,416
We've received orders
from headquarters

90
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,916
not to accept any
Japanese yen whatsoever.

91
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:40,916
I can move again!

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,833
'Kay, then let's
charge one billion!

93
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,000
Micro, Mezzoflation.

94
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,208
Okay!

95
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,375
What's the matter with you?!
Why can't you understand?

96
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,583
We are our Entres' futures!

97
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,666
I thought I was the one
fighting for Kimimaro,

98
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,875
but it turns out, he's the one
putting his life on the line

99
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,250
for me!

100
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,083
Don't you think there's
something wrong with that?!

101
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,625
I couldn't care less.

102
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,416
Well, I think you should care!
Like I care about Kimimaro.

103
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
And I could lose him
because of you!

104
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,958
Do you know what my sister's
last words to me were?

105
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,166
She said, "I wish this day
would last forever". She said

106
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,083
"I wish these unchanging days
would last for eternity"!

107
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,791
So that's the way it's going
to be! My sister doesn't even

108
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,791
understand the concept
of "tomorrow"!

109
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,583
That's why it's so important for
me to keep the present alive!

110
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,333
As far as I'm concerned,
you should be taking care

111
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,666
of the people who are
right in front of you.

112
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,583
Not worrying about people
who may or may not

113
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,416
be a part of your future!

114
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,916
You bastard. This is all
'cause of you! Damn it!

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,875
I wanted to take care of the
"people right in front of me"

116
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,458
but they changed
because of you!

117
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,500
If I hadn't acted we would've
fallen victim to "C"!

118
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:55,208
Lives were spared because
of my actions! I saved them!

119
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,666
If they don't have a future,

120
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,166
then why did you
even bother saving them?

121
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,666
If she were here now,
your sister would be heartbroken

122
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,625
that her words caused this.

123
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,708
And she would tell you
that you're wrong!

124
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,833
He intends only his own gain,
and he is in this---

125
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,083
Did you see the Prime Minister's
press conference?

126
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,333
Yeah, it was amusing
watching the government

127
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,375
try to cover their tracks.
They've lost all credibility.

128
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,250
Are you planning
to leave Japan?

129
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,625
If I was smart I would've
left a long time ago.

130
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,041
Mr. Mikuni has a sister,
and he says she can't wake up!

131
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:31,750
Why, you! Scorched Earth!

132
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,625
Cannibalization.

133
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,083
Micro, Mezzo, Macroflation.

134
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,291
Scorched Earth!

135
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,333
Economic Blockade.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,208
Cannibalization.

137
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,708
What's wrong?

138
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,541
I just realized. You have
the same face as his sister!

139
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,708
Shut your mouth.

140
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,500
You are his sister, aren't
you? Does he know?!

141
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,791
You have to tell him!
He's sucking the life

142
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,333
out of everyone so he can
try to keep you alive!

143
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,625
Why should I listen
to what you have to say?

144
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,791
Because, I happen to care
about my Entre!

145
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,625
Are you still talking?!

146
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,750
I don't wanna be separated from
him but I keep fighting anyway.

147
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,875
I've chosen to do
it for his sake!

148
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,375
Why are you fighting?
For Mr. Mikuni's sake?

149
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,250
But why would you
when you can't be sure

150
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,916
he's doing the same for you?

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

152
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,166
What's the deal?!There's fake
money mixed in with my change!

153
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,250
No way.

154
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,333
You'd better take back
this black paper

155
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,708
and give me some
real change right now!

156
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,375
C.

157
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,333
C.

158
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,250
There isn't anything you can do!
Neither of us can stop it!

159
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,541
The fall of the human
race is inevitable!

160
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,708
You never know
which day may be your last.

161
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,250
That's why I choose to live
each one to the fullest!

162
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,125
I don't give a damn
about tomorrow because

163
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,166
the only thing you can
depend on is today!

164
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,208
But what happens when you
make it through another day

165
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,625
and it's worse
than the one before?!

166
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,708
Then that becomes
my new standard!

167
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:29,208
Q. Eat up! I want you
to devour this Entre!

168
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,500
Q?

169
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,083
Takako.

170
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,125
Direct.

171
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,375
Direct.

172
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,541
'Bout time to wake up
from the dream, gentlemen.

173
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,208
C's chain reaction.
It's headed straight for Japan!

174
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,833
What the?!

175
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll make you pay
for what you've done!

176
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,541
You feel okay, Big brother?

177
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,791
Yeah, I'm sorry sis,
I'm just a little tired.

178
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,541
I think you should
take a break.

179
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,208
You've been fighting
awfully hard.

180
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,458
I can't now--

181
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,916
The way you've
been acting lately reminds me

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,291
a lot of Father.

183
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,333
I'm sure that he had
something he wanted to protect.

184
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,958
Just like someone else I know.

185
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,208
I remind you
of our old man, huh?

186
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,125
Yeah, okay, I get the point.

187
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,125
It's crazy to think I've ended
up just like the one person

188
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,333
I didn't want to become.

189
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,750
Takako? Takako? Takako!

190
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,833
Takako.

191
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,166
The chain reaction passed
through without incident.

192
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,291
I didn't think
that was even possible!

193
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,541
Midas money is now as
worthless as the Japanese yen

194
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,458
it supports. Uninterested
in our valueless currency,

195
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,666
"C" passed us right by.

196
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,583
Soon this District
will cease to exist.

197
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,125
I know you're in
the middle of a deal

198
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,708
but I'm afraid we don't
have much time.

199
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,083
Kimimaro wins. He beat me.

200
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,458
Are you sure?

201
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,000
What would you
like to do, Mr. Yoga?

202
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,916
You know what I want. Spin
the Rotary Press in reverse!

203
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,208
You may regret doing this.

204
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,250
But I won't stop you.

205
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,125
Your wish is my command.

206
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,041
This is it. I'm gonna
buy back the future!

207
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,958
Here we go!

208
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,083
You have control.

209
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,250
I guess this is goodbye. Q.

210
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,541
I'm sorry I stopped fighting
so abruptly. But I realized

211
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,958
continuing would
not benefit you.

212
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,541
It's time for you to start
a new life without me.

213
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,500
I wish I could stay by your side
for all of eternity, Soichiro.

214
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,125
I know, I do too,
but you have to go, Q.

215
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,416
No, Takako.

216
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,625
This mean we won?

217
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,708
Sure does. Thanks, Mashu.

218
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,208
The big goodbye. Sucks, huh?

219
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,041
Yeah, it does.

220
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,666
30 times, right?

221
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,250
Say what?

222
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,791
That's what you told me.

223
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:40,208
Right now, I think I might love
you 40 times more than usual.

224
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,583
Really?

225
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:48,375
Oh, Kimimaro,
I'm so glad that I met you.

226
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,125
Mashu! Me too!

227
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,375
Take care of yourself.

228
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,333
We'll meet again
in the future.

229
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,750
I don't think so, kid.
I've decided to stay

230
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,916
in the present forever.

231
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,541
So pretty!

232
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,416
I know I may annoy people when
I rant about the importance

233
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,666
of consumer confidence.
But I'm pretty sure

234
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,541
what happened to the
Financial District today

235
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,375
helped me proved my point!

236
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,333
I don't wanna sound cocky
but I single-handedly

237
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,833
tore the place down and now
I'm riding off into the sunset.

238
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,500
I wouldn't start
celebrating just yet.

239
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,958
You're not ridin' off into the
sunset more like oblivion.

240
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,250
Guess you relied
on the District

241
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,958
more than
you thought ya did, huh?

242
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,041
Just when I think I'm out,
they pull me back in.

243
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:11,291
A lotta good all that "consumer
confidence" crap did for ya.

244
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,958
I can't keep up
with the capriciousness

245
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,916
of this country any longer!

246
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,791
Where am I?

247
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,083
You debated both options,
trying to decide which

248
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,958
was right and wrong, but there's
something I should tell you.

249
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,208
Both options are correct.
There is no single answer.

250
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,875
Your views of the future may
have differed but your goal

251
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,125
was the same. You fought to
make the world a better place.

252
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,916
Then what was the purpose
of the District?

253
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,458
It was created to bring you
all together and to help you

254
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,083
find that common goal.
It served its purpose.

255
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,625
I realize it may seem to
bring about evil and tragedy,

256
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,916
but in actuality it was designed
to help guide the human race.

257
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,833
Promise you won't forget
what you learned.

258
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,250
Who are you?

259
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,166
You're hardly going
to recognize the world

260
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,291
you're about to revisit.

261
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,166
Each of you will be returning
with something precious.

262
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,541
You're lucky to be able
to take it back.

263
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,375
You must never forget that.

264
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,541
That'll be seven dollars
and thirty cents.

265
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,541
Thank you very much,
ma'am. Have a nice day!

266
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:00,333
Let's go, hurry up!
C'mon, mom!

267
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,583
Calm down, Nori!

268
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,333
Don't run too far ahead.

269
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's try to stay
with the group.

270
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,666
No running off on your own.

271
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,291
Is everyone following me
like good boys and girls?

272
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,416
--Hey Hanabi-
--Teacher!

273
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,458
What is it?

274
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,958
Look! There's
a doggy over there!

275
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:31,833
A doggy! Where?
Oh, isn't it cute!

276
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,791
You see a nursery school
teacher who looks like

277
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,208
the girl you have feelings
for, and you can't help

278
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,416
but to ask yourself, "Could this
be my doing? Is it possible

279
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
she's living her felicitous
future because of my actions?!"

280
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,500
And just as you're filled
with emotion I show up

281
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,500
and burst your bubble.
Pardon me.

282
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,833
Is this a joke?

283
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm as serious
as a heart attack.

284
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,458
What are you doing here?!

285
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,333
Surely you didn't think
you'd get rid of me that easily.

286
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,375
As you know, this is the future
you took back. In our eyes,

287
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,875
it will always be collateral.

288
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,875
Therefore, wherever
the future exists so do we.

289
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,500
The Financial District
is eternal, my boy.

290
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,000
That can't be.

291
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,250
No need to worry.
I won't be bothering you.

292
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,791
There are plenty
of prime-quality futures here.

293
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,666
They'd be perfect
for collateral!

294
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,333
Of course, you're welcome to
give me a shout anytime. 'Kay?

295
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,875
'Til we meet again! 

296
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,666
I should've been smiling.

297
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,250
For the future.
