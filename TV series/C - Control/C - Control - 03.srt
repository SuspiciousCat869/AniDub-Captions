00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,708
[gasping]

159
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,791
What're you askin' me for?

160
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,875
How should I know where Masakaki
is? I don't keep tabs on him.

161
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,625
I need to get him to come
to this world and talk to me!

162
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,083
If I knew where he was
I'd tell you!

163
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,458
What's your problem?

164
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,666
I don't like your attitude.

165
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,375
You're acting like a big jerk!

166
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,625
[KIMIMARO]
Sorry, I'm just frustrated.

167
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,000
You're the only one I can ask.

168
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,541
[MASHU] Why don't you come
here and look for him?

169
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,041
[KIMIMARO]
Do what?

170
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,125
You're allowed to come to
the District whenever you want.

171
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,500
You don't have to have
a deal scheduled.

172
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,958
I didn't know that.
I'm on my way right now!

173
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,083
Okay what crawled up
your butt?

174
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,750
[KIMIMARO]
Ah, shut up!

175
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,583
C.

176
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,000
C.

177
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,333
[SATO] Deals are scheduled once
a week. I usually get

178
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,166
called in on Wednesdays.

179
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,166
Each week we have the option
of choosing our opponent.

180
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,583
A woman Entre?
Well, that's a new one.

181
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,208
I'm not interested
in small talk, pal.

182
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,416
But I never have.
They're all the same to me.

183
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,916
An Asset relies on its instincts
to defend its Entre.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,583
[SATO'S CARD]
Open deal.

185
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,416
[NAGAYAMA'S CARD]
Mezzo: freeze out.

186
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,541
[SATO]
But it's not able to attack

187
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:28,000
unless its Entre
gives the order.

188
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,875
Asset attacks are called
Flation and they fall into

189
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,250
one of three categories:
Micro, Mezzo and Macro.

190
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,458
Basically; small,
medium and large.

191
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,208
[TAKEDAZAKI gasping]
There she goes again.

192
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,125
Hey! What's goin' on here?

193
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,500
[GROO screaming]
[GEORGE growling]

194
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,458
[SATO] A Micro will run you
about a hundred thousand.

195
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,875
Mezzo's are one million
and Macro's will cost you

196
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,833
a whopping ten million.

197
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,416
[NAGAYAMA yelling]

198
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,250
[SATO] I haven't had to cough up
the cash for a Macroflation yet.

199
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,708
There you are!

200
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,583
[SATO] If an Entre goes bankrupt
during a deal,

201
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,250
they're banished
from the Financial District.

202
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,250
[NAGAYAMA]
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

203
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,833
[GEORGE growling]

204
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,916
[SATO] 
I try to play it safe

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,083
by keeping my wins and
losses minimal.

206
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,500
But I know it could all come
crashing down at any moment.

207
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,333
I've never chosen my opponents
because I've done fine with

208
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,500
the Entres Midas
sets me up with.

209
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,250
[SATO'S CARD]
Closing.

210
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,833
[TAKEDAZAKI annoyed]

211
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,291
I can't get a good
pic of her in action.

212
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,625
[SATO] I'm just like the new
kid. I wouldn't be able to

213
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,583
clinch a deal if it weren't
for the strength of my Asset.

214
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,791
Beats me.

215
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,625
[MASAKAKI] I don't know
why you would assume

216
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,125
we'd have that information.

217
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,208
Why won't you just admit
my dad's been here?

218
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,500
I know that much
from his journal.

219
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,875
Was he the reason
I was invited to this place?

220
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,000
[MASAKAKI] Of course not!
It's purely coincidence.

221
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,666
Coincidence, my ass!

222
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,375
[SOICHIRO] You've got
some guts there, kid.

223
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,666
You're brand new
to the District

224
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,083
and you're already
giving Masakaki a hard time.

225
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,333
[MASAKAKI]
What have we here?

226
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,708
Mr. Mikuni. To what
do I owe the pleasure

227
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,125
of this surprise visit,
good sir?

228
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,166
[SOICHIRO] I hate to break
it to you, Masakaki.

229
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,916
But I'm not here to see you.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,791
I need to have a word
with Kimimaro.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,583
[KIMIMARO]
Where are we going?

232
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,375
[SOICHIRO]
Don't worry, just follow me.

233
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,375
[TAKEDAZAKI]
Mr. Yoga?

234
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,500
Yeah. I remember that guy.

235
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,791
[KIMIMARO]
Seriously?

236
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,208
Can you tell me everything
you know about him?

237
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,333
Please, I'm begging you.

238
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,333
[TAKEDAZAKI] And how, may
I ask, do you know Mr. Yoga?

239
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,625
[KIMIMARO]
I'm his son.

240
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,500
[TAKEDAZAKI]
Get outta here. You're his boy?

241
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,166
Well, I'll be damned.

242
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,416
[KIMIMARO] Do you know what
happened to my dad? Tell me!

243
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,250
Maybe. Why should I tell you?

244
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, because I--I wanna know.

245
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,750
[chuckling]

246
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,000
Your dad was a powerful Entre
and he was crazy about deals!

247
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,833
He made some major money off
of 'em back in the day.

248
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,750
That is, until he lost big
and went bankrupt.

249
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,166
[KIMIMARO]
He lost it all?

250
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,333
The bank took possession
of all his collateral

251
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,583
and suddenly there was no record
of Mr. Yoga's existence.

252
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,333
He knew he wouldn't
be able to find a job.

253
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,083
He couldn't face his family.

254
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:24,000
So he decided to hang himself on
the horizontal bars at the park.

255
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,708
Since authorities
couldn't identify the body,

256
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,791
the corpse was disposed of
by the government.

257
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,750
I wish I could tell ya
there was a happy ending

258
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,166
but your dad's been
dead a long time now.

259
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,208
Sorry kid, that's all
the information I've got on him.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,041
Was there anything else
you wanted to ask?

261
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,791
What kinda person was he?

262
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,500
[TAKEDAZAKI] I never spoke to
the man so I couldn't tell ya

263
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,416
the intricacies of
his personality or anything.

264
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,750
But I know this--

265
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,875
The guy was completely
obsessed with money.

266
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,333
Judging by the way he played
his deals, the only thing

267
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,666
he cared about was getting
his hands on more of it.

268
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm tellin' ya,
our old man was a real miser.

269
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,541
But he was a hell of an Entre.
Kinda makes you wonder

270
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,583
if his son inherited his talent.
I guess we'll just have to

271
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,041
wait and see, eh little Yoga?

272
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,916
Just remember,
you gotta be careful.

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,250
You don't wanna end up
like your father did.

274
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,875
You gotta make your life
in this city your top priority.

275
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,041
You can't let what happens in
the "real world" affect you.

276
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,666
That's the trick to surviving
in the Financial District.

277
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,375
This is my
favorite place to escape.

278
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,958
Isn't it beautiful? You can see
the whole city from up here.

279
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,833
[SOICHIRO] So what now?
Are you gonna keep dealing?

280
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,833
I just don't wanna
end up like my dad.

281
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,791
[SOICHIRO] Aren't you glad
to finally know the truth?

282
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,625
It may be hard to swallow
but at least you know

283
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,041
he didn't abandon you.

284
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,666
[KIMIMARO] If he hadn't gotten
mixed up in this mess

285
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,625
he'd still be alive today.
We could've had

286
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,166
a normal life together.

287
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,750
He might not've abandoned me.

288
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,458
But it sure feels like it.

289
00:15:55,458 --> 00:16:00,500
I wonder why your father
was so desperate to earn money.

290
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,208
He had to have some reason,
some sort of motivation.

291
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,291
My father, for example,
was driven by greed.

292
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,500
He made money simply because
he wanted more of it.

293
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,500
[KIMIMARO] I'm sure it
was the same with my dad.

294
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,333
[SOICHIRO] When I was about
your age, my father's business

295
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,500
almost went under.

296
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,791
My little sister had
a life-threatening illness.

297
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,083
The only thing that could save
her was an expensive treatment.

298
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,333
Instead of forking over
the cash to save her life,

299
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,166
he threw his money
into the company.

300
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,375
And as a result, it flourished.

301
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,708
Do you know what
my first big purchase was

302
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,833
after I made
a ton of money here?

303
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:45,333
I bought the company out from
under him and I took it over.

304
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,958
I basically
stole everything from him.

305
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,416
If my dad were still alive,

306
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,541
I'd wanna do the exact
same thing to him.

307
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,750
[SOICHIRO chuckling]

308
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,500
Like it or not,
our parents influence

309
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,666
who we become as adults.

310
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,791
I bitch about my dad, but deep
down I know I'm just like him.

311
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,541
You? You're nothing like
the man Takedazaki described

312
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,875
back there.

313
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,875
Maybe it's 'cause he was
never around growing up.

314
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,583
Honestly, I don't really
have any memory of him.

315
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,833
[SOICHIRO]
Maybe that's it.

316
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,083
[KIMIMARO]
This is his journal.

317
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,291
There's nothing but numbers
in it. He never even mentioned

318
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,583
me or mom. So, that proves it
once and for all!

319
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,958
He didn't care about us!
He really was a miser and--

320
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,333
What if he was dealing
to support his family?s

321
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,458
Maybe you and your mom were
the reason he needed money.

322
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,708
You always talk about how you
want to live a "normal" life

323
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,625
with a guaranteed salary. But
that would only be enough money

324
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,958
to take care of yourself,
not a family.

325
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,416
Hate to say it,
but there isn't much difference

326
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,750
between you and your father.

327
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,916
It turns out
you're even lower than

328
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,916
the man you hold
in contempt, Kimimaro.

329
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,000
I happen to think money's
worthless unless it's used

330
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,416
for something other than
your own gain.

331
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,750
Can you think
of anything you'd want

332
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,916
to spend it on
other than yourself?

333
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,125
If not, then start
searching for your cause.

334
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,666
And you'd better
start saving now

335
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,666
because you're going to need
a good amount of money saved up

336
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,833
for whenever you do find it.

337
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,791
You've gotta keep dealing.
Make all the money you can

338
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,416
and then put it
towards your cause.

339
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,958
When you spend your money,
someone always profits.

340
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,625
If you save it up, you're
the only one who benefits.

341
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,208
That may make you
happy temporarily

342
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,458
but you'll never know the joy
of making those around you

343
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,666
feel happiness as well.

344
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,750
I'm not really
the man my father was.

345
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,500
I take the money I earn
in deals and invest it

346
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:44,125
in this country's future.
What will you do?

347
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,416
You've got time to kill
before your next deal.

348
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,833
Think about it. Q!

349
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,458
Hey are you all right,
Kimimaro?

350
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,333
[KIMIMARO]
Leave me alone.

351
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,000
Excuse me?

352
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,583
[KIMIMARO]
Go away!

353
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,208
What's with you? You're
acting like a jerk again!

354
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:25,500
[KIMIMARO crying]

355
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,125
The two of you talked for
such a long time, I'm surprised

356
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,500
you didn't invite him
to join the Guild.

357
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,333
[SATO] I make note of every
little thing that happens

358
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,708
in this city

359
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,750
and I share that information
with the organization.

360
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,416
They never briefed me on exactly
what I was supposed to report

361
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,833
so I tell them
everything I know.

362
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,750
The last time I went to
headquarters to report,

363
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,208
I just had to ask.

364
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,125
You're not gonna do anything?

365
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,583
But Midas money is flowing
into this nation's economy

366
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,166
as we speak.
We have to stop it, sir!

367
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,375
Believe me, I'm aware.

368
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,750
And I know the consequences
we could face.

369
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,250
[SATO'S BOSS] Midas money
has been seeping through

370
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,750
for some time now.

371
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,291
The higher ups are in the
process of calculating the risk

372
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,250
of stopping the flow.

373
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,000
There's a distinct possibility
that stopping it could cause

374
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,958
even bigger problems
for the nation.

375
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,000
You do understand that,
don't you?

376
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,750
You don't have to worry about
anything except

377
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,458
reporting to me. Okay, Sato?

378
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,000
[SATO] I can feel our world
being warped and twisted.

379
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,583
And it seems to
be getting worse every day.

380
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,208
I'm beginning to wonder if
we might've bit off

381
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,791
more than we can chew.

382
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,416
But I'm not the type
to give up.

383
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,166
Not when so many questions
still need answers.

384
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,000
What's the deal with
the black Midas money?

385
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,000
Is it serving
some kind of purpose?

386
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,000
Does it have the power
to save our economy?

387
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,291
What happens to your future when
it's being held as collateral?

388
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,083
Does the bank hold
onto it forever?

389
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,666
Or is there a way
to get it back?

390
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:05,875
[SOICHIRO]
He's here.

391
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,500
This should be
an entertaining deal.

392
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,125
[SATO] I'll be watching your
every move like a hawk, kid.

393
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,166
I can either be
your friend or your enemy.

394
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,000
The decision is yours.

395
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,833
Are you okay, Kimimaro?
Don't ignore me!

396
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,000
[EBARA]
I never thought I'd have

397
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,416
to face off against
one of my students.

398
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,916
You must be new here,
huh, Yoga?
