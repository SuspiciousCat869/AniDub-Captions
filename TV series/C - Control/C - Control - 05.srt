What? Is your guild
full of cowards?

3
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,958
Why don't you get over here
and fight me already! Curie!

4
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,291
I'm ready.

5
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,208
That's dangerous!

6
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,458
Lacking amount.

7
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,958
As usual,
I get horrible mileage.

8
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,583
Probably better to end this.

9
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,500
Mezzo! Insider-on!

10
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,708
Insider.

Microflation.

12
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,208
Move it!

13
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,041
Bastard!

14
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:17,916
Direct.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,625
Right on the shoulder, please.

16
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,000
That kinda hurt.

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,166
Closing. You have gain.

18
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,875
All according to plan.

19
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,708
Yeah, let me see what you got.

20
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,041
Trojan Horse.

21
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,333
That's one hell of a growth rate
you have there. Bel!

22
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,166
Mezzoflation.

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,291
As you wish.

Dead Man's Trigger.

25
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,083
21% Mezzo, got it?

26
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,041
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,458
Breyer!

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Closing. You have gain.

29
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,666
To minimize the effect
on reality, we win by

30
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,291
the slightest margin
possible. Our objective

31
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,708
is to control the deal so
we have to be acutely aware

32
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,500
of all the factors involved.

33
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,125
You mean like gathering
information on your opponent?

34
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,333
Well, everyone does that
sort of thing. But, for us,

35
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,375
it's more important to have
a grasp of our own strength,

36
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,833
over that of our opponent's.

37
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,333
That way we can more
accurately measure ourselves

38
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,708
against the other Entres.

39
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,875
Measuring my own strength?

40
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,333
Not just your
physical capabilities

41
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,458
but your intelligence,
wealth, and everything else.

42
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,791
The wider the criteria and
the wider your knowledge

43
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,875
the more accurate your
perception of your opponents

44
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,083
will be.

45
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,458
Their Assets too?

46
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,583
Absolutely. After all,
if we're measuring your strength

47
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,500
in a deal then your Assets
are the most important factor.

48
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,166
If that's the case, tell me more
about them before my next deal.

49
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,625
If you wanna know more
about Assets,

50
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,583
you have one
standing right here!

51
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,208
I didn't think of that.

52
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,708
You got a plan this time?

53
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,666
I hear this guy uses
a bunch of different attacks.

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,416
So I'm gonna try to
lay back until I figure out

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,875
everything he can do.

56
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,625
'Nother jackass from the guild?
This is gonna be a pain.

57
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,500
This would be a lot easier if
we just beat him down instead.

58
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,333
Work with me here.
I'm trying to figure out

59
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,666
how to control the deal.

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,166
Why'd I have to get stuck
with a weirdo like you?

61
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,041
Assets belong to their
Entres, you know?

62
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,041
So I can't put out a single
Micro without you're okay.

63
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,458
I know you're worried
but sometimes

64
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,041
you just gotta go
with your gut.

65
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,416
"Go with your gut"?

66
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,166
Open Deal.

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,750
Look at the time.
Today's membership dues

68
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,541
should come in any minute now.

69
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,291
Barbarossa!

70
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,375
Great Wall.

71
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,333
Microflation.

72
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,416
Micro.

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,625
Kimimaro!

74
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,333
What the hell is this?

75
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,458
Can you get out?

76
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,750
Hold on a sec!

77
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,375
This wall's not the Asset,
it's a flation?

78
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,833
Well aren't you clever!

79
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,125
So much for goin' with my gut.

80
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,833
What's going on?

81
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,083
Microflation.

82
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,750
All right, Barbarossa.
He's all yours.

83
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,583
Direct.

84
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,708
Take this!

85
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,958
You got out!

86
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,250
Get out of here!

87
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,041
Uh, 'kay!

88
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,875
Direct. Direct.

89
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,958
Damn it! Mashu!

90
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,291
Microflation.

91
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,291
Right!

92
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,583
Direct.

93
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,666
Barbarossa,
c'mere and protect me!

94
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,750
All we gotta do
is run down the clock!

95
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,541
2 million, 400 thousand!

96
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,000
Mashu, I need cover!

97
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,125
Direct.

98
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,000
No problem! You want
a flation, right?

99
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,708
No, just guard me!

100
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,291
You got balls, kid!
Bring it on!

101
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,500
Direct.

102
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,000
Direct.

103
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,083
I almost had you. Damn it!

104
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,375
Perfect! It's close,
but I'll win.

105
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,208
Oh no, she's gonna ruin it!

106
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,791
Back off, Mashu!

107
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,041
Aww man.

108
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,500
Closing. You lost.

109
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,625
Aww... This sucks.

110
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,416
Well, what do you expect
from me in return?

111
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,083
As Deputy Governor,
I want you to stop

112
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,375
all budget cuts
for the next fiscal year.

113
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,875
You think the economy
could still use a boost?

114
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,583
Heh. I can't disagree with that.
However, the nation's up to

115
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,833
its eyeballs in debt and
something has to budge.

116
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,666
Don't worry, I'll continue
to cover the deficit, myself.

117
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,208
So the debt of our entire nation
would rest on your shoulders.

118
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,541
Frankly, I don't know
if I should laugh or cry.

119
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,750
Surely that man wasn't
serious-- who was he?

120
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,666
Oh, he was serious. When he
says he can bear the burden

121
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,958
of our debt, then we would
do well to believe him.

122
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,250
Without his help, our economy
would be unsustainable.

123
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,791
Sir, is this a joke? Even if
he could shoulder the debt,

124
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,000
why would he bother?

125
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,625
To help the people, that's why.

126
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,250
All that money?
Just to keep a couple

127
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,958
of public service programs open

128
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,875
while the economy
is falling apart?

129
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,333
Is that foolish to you?
Sacrificing yourself

130
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,958
to help the public?

131
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,583
Uh no, of course not.

132
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,625
No longer somebody
else's problem, is it?

133
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,958
You worry about what'll happen
to the poor saps you beat,

134
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,916
then it happens to you!

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,250
I didn't lose by much,
it shouldn't be a big deal.

136
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,375
Maybe, but I've seen
people's houses burn down

137
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,625
over no big deal.

138
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,125
What? But why?

139
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,708
Who knows? Guess it depends
on the bank and how much

140
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,625
of your future they wanna cash
in. It's kind of a gray area,

141
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,166
if you ask me.

142
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,458
Well, it didn't burn down.

143
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,875
Hello?

144
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,333
Hey, it's me,
just calling to check on you.

145
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,416
Talk about impeccable timing.
I was just about to leave

146
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,375
for the hospital.

147
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,125
There's no need to worry,
it's just appendicitis.

148
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,083
I should be home in a week.
You don't have to come visit me.

149
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,083
I'd be embarrassed if everyone
made a big deal out of this.

150
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,791
Whatever you say,
Aunt Kyoko. You sure there's not

151
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,916
something else? Nothing
bad happened recently?

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,416
No, why? I know I'm about
to be hospitalized,

153
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,041
but I'm in great shape
for my age.

154
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,416
That's good.

155
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,625
Did you see that?
Somebody actually failed!

156
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,833
Are you serious? I skipped half
the lectures and still did fine!

157
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,500
What can I say,
some of those guys out there

158
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,125
are a lost cause.

159
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:17,166
This must be the effect.
Well, guess that's not so bad.

160
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,541
What about Hanabi?

161
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,333
What's up with you? You look
like you've seen a ghost.

162
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,458
I'm fine. Nothing bad has
happened to you lately, has it?

163
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,958
Like an injury or an illness
or something like that?

164
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,375
Calm down. Nothing's wrong,
okay? I'm doing fine.

165
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,416
Actually, something
good just came up!

166
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,375
Remember that student
teaching application I sent

167
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,250
to my alma mater? It got
approved! It seemed like

168
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,916
there were a lot
of applicants this year

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,625
so I was kinda worried
but I was really

170
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,791
hoping that I'd get to go
back to my old school.

171
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,041
I have a lot of nice memories of
the place. Oh that reminds me!

172
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,625
I bought a new suit for the job.
Maybe I'll wear it next time.

173
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,875
You won't even recognize me!

174
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,500
My bad luck must not
have any effect on her.

175
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,000
Why am I so depressed?
I should be happy.

176
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,875
Congratulations on
surviving another week.

177
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,833
Right back at you. I'm glad
to see you could make it here.

178
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,041
Sadly, reality is being
rewritten same way as usual.

179
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,750
Birth rates and
resources are down,

180
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,000
while crime and suicide are up.

181
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,833
Sure spoils your day,
doesn't it? Whole world

182
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,541
getting switched around
behind your back.

183
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,375
Are your people
gonna do anything about it?

184
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,125
We don't have a plan yet.
We're not even

185
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,250
an international organization.
But on the upside,

186
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,375
at least they believe the info
you leaked to us is credible.

187
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,875
Here's what I have on
the Financial District.

188
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,375
Might not be anything new,
but I felt guilty about

189
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,000
taking and never
giving anything back.

190
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,000
See ya.

191
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,541
What?

192
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,000
I was wondering how you were
doing, with the injury and all.

193
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,583
Injury? That was nothing.

194
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,208
I know, I know, you're
a really fast healer, right?

195
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,833
All of this is your fault.
We were totally winning

196
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,250
that fight! Why'd you
have to stop me? Huh?

197
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,458
I was trying to--

198
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,208
You can't just pull that
crap outta nowhere!

199
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,958
How would you like it
if you got punched

200
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,458
and couldn't fight back?

201
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,916
I may heal fast but that was
still painful! If you have

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,333
some complicated battle plan,
tell me about it first!

203
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,375
But you probably just made
it up as you went along,

204
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,541
didn't you? Assets can only do
what their Entres tell them.

205
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,916
Huh? What's that beeping?

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,291
Oh. Sorry, I just made
a cup of ramen.

207
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,791
Cup of "ramen"?

208
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,208
Guess you guys don't have it
in the District. It's food.

209
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,041
Okay? So what's food?

210
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,666
Uh. It's the stuff you eat.

211
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,000
What does that mean?

212
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,875
You can't be serious.
You've never eaten a meal?

213
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,625
"A meal"? Nope,
I've never heard of a meal.

214
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,791
Okay. Here, lemme show you.

215
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,541
Oh my gosh that's
gross! Why would you

216
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,583
do something
disgusting like that?

217
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,000
For nutrition.
It gives me energy.

218
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,583
That, and it tastes good.

219
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,000
What does that mean?

220
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,958
Huh. How can I say this?
It just puts me in a good mood.

221
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,833
Kinda like when I'm having fun
or I'm happy about something.

222
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,916
Let me try some.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,166
Come on. You said
it was fun, right?

224
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,208
Well, yeah.

225
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,500
Put it in my mouth. Here.

226
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,791
Nah, forget it.

227
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:08,791
Why not?

228
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,375
I'll bring some next time.

229
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:15,000
Hey! Stop that! Game over! Come
on you jerk! Save some for me!

230
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,416
C.

231
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,333
C.

232
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,416
That's the guy
Mr. Mikuni fought last time.

233
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,083
His opponent is
Seizawa Yasushi,

234
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,958
another incredibly
wealthy Entre.

235
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,208
With that much money
to throw around,

236
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,000
they're gonna rip
each other to shreds.

237
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,458
No matter which one
of them loses,

238
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,583
reality is going to suffer
tremendously for it.

239
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,750
If only Kikuchi would show

240
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,500
the same restraint
that Mikuni showed him.

241
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,791
The old man is too stubborn
to think that way.

242
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,958
This deal is gonna
be a massacre.

243
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,208
If the guild doesn't take over
soon, we're all screwed.

244
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,250
Why weren't you
able to persuade him?

245
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,916
Gimme a break, the guy
is filthy, stinkin', rich.

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,916
He's not exactly
easy to bribe, you know?

247
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,208
We can get you the money.
No matter what the cost,

248
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,333
we can't let
deals like this go on.

249
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,416
Roger.

250
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,416
Open deal.

251
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,666
Here we go!

252
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,375
Pac-Man Defense.

253
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,791
The old fool only knows one
trick! Now, Porte! Mezzoflation!

254
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,208
Gatekeeper.

255
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,041
Mezzo already?

256
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,166
I'm about to bleed you dry.
Do you hear me?

257
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,708
I won't finish him off
at this rate!

258
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,000
Direct.

259
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,083
Basho Pharmaceutical's
stock took a dive today

260
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:08,125
as the company was rocked by a
number of serious allegations.

261
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,875
Their president, Yoshiki
Kikuchi, is faced with

262
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,166
several charges of embezzlement
and illegal drug sale.

263
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,666
With consumer trust plummeting,

264
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,625
the future of the company
is anybody's guess.

265
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,625
It's hard to imagine
that one deal could have

266
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,458
such a negative
effect on reality.

267
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,208
What'll happen if
Basho Pharmaceuticals

268
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,583
goes out of business?

269
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,041
Good question. It'd likely
start a chain reaction

270
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,458
of bankruptcies. We'd be looking
at economic losses upwards of

271
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,791
100 billion yen.
The company's assets

272
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,958
and any drugs they have in
development would be sold

273
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,875
to the highest bidder
to alleviate the debt,

274
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,416
which would be a huge loss.

275
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,375
What worries me is everything
I've mentioned is just

276
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,875
the tip of the iceberg. If Basho
Pharmaceuticals goes under,

277
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,250
their entire workforce will

278
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,125
suddenly find themselves
without work.

279
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,333
They currently employ
about ten thousand people.

280
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,583
The bankruptcy wouldn't
just affect Kikuchi.

281
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:59,041
It would effectively ruin his
employees' futures as well.

282
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,416
10,000 people.

283
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,208
Finally sinking in, is it?

284
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:06,958
Yeah. So, I didn't see
your wife. How's she doing?

285
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,375
I wouldn't know. She left me.

286
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,083
You'd think I'd be
broken up about it

287
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,291
but I don't feel
anything anymore.

288
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,375
Every day it gets harder
to remember my wife and kids.

289
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,208
Guess my memories are fading.

290
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,666
 It won't work.

291
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,083
Why you say that?

292
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,916
'Cause there's no way
you can pull off these moves.

293
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,291
What does that mean?

294
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,166
It means your plan sucks
because you still don't know

295
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,583
how to measure
your own strength.

296
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,250
Back to the drawing board.

297
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,791
Like the guy said-- you
gotta know a bunch of stuff

298
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,458
if you wanna control a deal.
If you go in unprepared,

299
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,375
not only are you
gonna lose money,

300
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,750
I'm gonna get my ass whupped!

301
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,500
Fine, give it here.

302
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,625
Feeding your Asset, huh?
Now there's something

303
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,791
you don't see every day.

304
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,416
Is there
something wrong with that?

305
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,583
You can do
whatever you want, newb.

306
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,083
"Newb"? Did you come here
to make fun of me?

307
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,166
No, of course not.
I came here to sell you

308
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,708
some information
you might find interesting.

309
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,750
You know about
Basho Pharmaceuticals, right?

310
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,875
Of course I do.

311
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,416
You're worried about them,
aren't you?

312
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,916
How the hell do you know that?

313
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,916
I'm an information trafficker.
How about a cool million?

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,291
Isn't that kinda high?

315
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,666
Actually, that's
the minimum I charge

316
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,000
for my services
these days. So be grateful.

317
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,000
Besides, with the money
you're pulling in now,

318
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,125
that won't exactly
break the bank.

319
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,916
You'll probably hear about this
on the news in the other world

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,958
a few days from now. But FE
Pharma, a drug company formed

321
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,416
five years ago, just bought
out Basho Pharmaceuticals,

322
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,708
debts and all.

323
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,708
As far as the media
is concerned FE Pharma

324
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,375
is a foreign company but
in actuality the owner

325
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,875
is none other than
Soichiro Mikuni.

326
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,000
That means the damage
done to the real world

327
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,333
by Kikuchi's last deal
will be minimal.

328
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,833
That's the information
you wanted to hear, isn't it?

329
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,750
Did you need something?

330
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,416
Kind of.

331
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
That's Takedazaki for you.

332
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,375
But he's right.
FE Pharma does belong to me.

333
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,541
When Isurugi told me
that Kikuchi lost his deal

334
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,291
I took action right away.

335
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,291
Because you wanted to limit the
effect it would have on reality?

336
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,833
Exactly.

337
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,750
One of the Guild's purposes
is to combine our Midas money

338
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,083
to limit the damage the deals,
like that, might cause.

339
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,541
Eventually,
our guild will take over

340
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,916
the entire Financial District.
That'll make it easier

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,750
to control what happens
in and outside of the deals.

342
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,583
Why'd you take all this
on yourself?

343
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,583
Would you rather do it
instead of me?

344
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,041
What're you talking about?

345
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,333
So how do you like the city?
The Financial District, I mean.

346
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,416
What do you think?

347
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,458
Uh, I like it.
It's an amazing place.

348
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:50,166
Well, I can't argue with that.
I used to feel the same way.

349
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,875
But what's so amazing about it?

350
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,208
Uh, I don't know how to put it.
It's like this whole new world

351
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,166
with all these possibilities
that I never knew about before.

352
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,666
I suppose you could call it
a new world. But I always

353
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,125
thought of it as a mirror that
shows us a part of our world

354
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,541
that we never knew existed.
And that's pretty amazing, too.

355
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,333
It seems strange at first,
even frightening, the way

356
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,875
everyone spends Midas money. How
they can affect the real world

357
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,125
without even realizing it.

358
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,791
I thought, "Isn't there
something I can do?

359
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,583
Midas money is obviously evil!"

360
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,208
But then I realized something.
The Financial District

361
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,250
and Midas money are both
a reality we can't escape.

362
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
In the end, we could no sooner
destroy the Financial District

363
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,958
than we could destroy
our own world.

364
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,291
It's the same with Midas
Money. Trying to stop it

365
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,708
from flowing into our reality
would be like trying to stop

366
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,250
the circulation of all
currency on the planet.

367
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,125
Our only choice is to coexist.

368
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,583
But to make sure
that coexistence is

369
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,708
a relatively peaceful one,
I formed the Starling Guild.

370
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,000
All I can do is try to control
the profit-making balance

371
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,666
between our reality and
the Financial District.

372
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,375
So I buy Japanese government
bonds with Midas money

373
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,458
to prevent the
collapse of the country.

374
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,416
Even though you think
money's evil?

375
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,750
Our nation already moves
to the beat of its drum.

376
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,750
If the flow were to stop,
everything would fall apart;

377
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,083
everyone would be miserable.
Who would benefit

378
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,708
from something like that?

379
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,791
Even if the world is stained in
evil, as long as it's peaceful,

380
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,666
I'd still choose that over
a world where people starve.

381
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,916
I don't care if I get
my hands dirty. My only goal

382
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,416
is to protect this world
as it is now.

383
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,583
I understand that but
I still can't get used to

384
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,291
people using the black money.

385
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,666
I don't care if it's
the only thing

386
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,458
keeping our country
from collapsing.

387
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,375
I'm still not willing
to accept it, not yet anyway.

388
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,916
Just give it a little more time.
Someday you'll understand.

389
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,250
I'm not so sure.

390
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,791
I am. Trust me.

391
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,208
Hey, can I ask you somethin'?

392
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,500
Sure. Go ahead.

393
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,708
Why are you so interested
in that Yoga kid?

394
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,125
It's not like he's especially
sharp, just the opposite even.

395
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,583
And you said he was an
economics student, didn't you?

396
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,625
You sure wouldn't guess that by
the way he talks about money.

397
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,875
Those obsessed with money
hold onto it, they don't

398
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,791
make it move. That's what
makes him interesting.

399
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,833
For now, think of him as my
little pet project. Objections?

400
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,041
Nope.

401
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,375
Q, d'you hear that Kimimaro
fed his Asset instant ramen?

402
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,083
What's "ramen"?

403
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,916
If you'd like, I could
bring you some next time.

404
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,625
No thank you, I'm fine.

405
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,625
I read your report.
I hate to say it,

406
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,291
but it seems like
every time you come in,

407
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,208
the little bit of good
news we have turns bad.

408
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,083
It's not getting any better.
The Financial District

409
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,958
is destroying the
future of mankind.

410
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,375
You've made that point
abundantly clear.

411
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,125
We don't have time
to worry about the risk,

412
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:40,125
we have to stop the flow
of Midas money immediately!

413
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,875
I'm afraid that's not your
decision. Let me assure you,

414
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,958
you're not the only investigator
who's mentioned this.

415
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,666
I'm sorry, but you're just
a small-time bureaucrat

416
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,458
and there are some things you
don't have the power to fix.

417
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,541
This morning,
Kimimaro Yoga officially

418
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,916
became a member
of the Starling Guild.

419
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,083
Considering how he did last
time, isn't it a bit early

420
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,791
for a balanced deal?
Especially against that weirdo.

421
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:14,083
If he can't handle this, let him
crash and burn. Better now when

422
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,291
he won't cause a big
ripple in the real world.

423
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,250
Ugh! That's gross!

424
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,583
Open Deal.
