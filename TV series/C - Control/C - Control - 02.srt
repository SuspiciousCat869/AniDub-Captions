Call it a hunch, but you were
rooting for the new kid,

weren't you?

You know, for an

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,916

a hunch. If anyone was going to

00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,958
C'mon, quit messin' with me.

308
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:15,041
Excuse me, sir? But could we
please get a different cashier?

309
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:20,083
[KAKUTA] 238 out of a thousand.
Your change is 762 yen.

310
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,375
Would you ladies like a bag?

311
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,625
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL 2A]
No thank you.

312
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,500
[KAKUTA]
Please come again!

313
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,666
If that was 'sposed to be
a joke, I'm not laughing.

314
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,666
No, just hold on a sec!
What does this look like?

315
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,541
Huh?

316
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,000
Just tell me!

317
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:33,833
A thousand yen.

318
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,083
Right. How 'bout this one?

319
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,333
It looks the same
as the other one.

320
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,375
Hold these, I need
to go to the bathroom.

321
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,125
Mashu, do you know
what's going on?

322
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,458
[MASHU] It's always been like
that, you just couldn't see it.

323
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,833
This may not be
a big deal to you

324
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,666
but I'm totally
freaking out here!

325
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,458
Why? It's just money.

326
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,041
Yeah, but it's creepy looking.

327
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,000
All the cash
in the District is black.

328
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,416
You're saying it's
just like regular money

329
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,208
once it makes its way
into this world?

330
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,458
Pretty much.

331
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,041
So it's okay to use it then.

332
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,833
Why're you asking me?
I'm no expert.

333
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,291
Hey!

334
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,791
Is something wrong, Mashu?

335
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,166
You're gonna have to decide
if you want to deal or not!

336
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,291
If you don't have
the will to fight,

337
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,000
this isn't gonna end well!

338
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,875
Look, I can't babysit
you forever, got it?

339
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,166
[yelping]

340
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,666
You've gotta start taking this
seriously! It's not some game!

341
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,666
Okay.

342
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,250
Better get going.

343
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,291
[SHIMADA]
Something wrong?

344
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,833
[KIMIMARO]
Nah. I'm fine.

345
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,166
Can I help you?

346
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,875
[MALE CUSTOMER 2A] 
Just this. Don't need a bag.

347
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,041
All right, sir,
197 out of ten thousand.

348
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,166
That's 9,803 yen.

349
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,000
[MALE CUSTOMER 2A] You kiddin'
me? I saw a five thousand

350
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,916
yen bill in there! Gimme that.

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,458
No I can't.

352
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,791
[MALE CUSTOMER 2A] If I take
those small bills my wallet'll

353
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,875
be too fat
to fit in my pocket!

354
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,958
[KIMIMARO] It's just that that
bill is kinda dirty and--.

355
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,333
[MALE CUSTOMER 2A]
What the hell do I care?

356
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,625
Hand it over, you idiot!

357
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,875
[SHIMADA]
Sir, please calm down.

358
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,375
Stay outta this, old man!

359
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,875
[KIMIMARO]
What the hell are you doing?

360
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,041
[MALE CUSTOMER 2A] That how
you talk to your customers?

361
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,708
You want me
to call the manager?

362
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,958
Just gimme
the damn money already!

363
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,416
There's nothing wrong with it!

364
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,750
Here ya go.

365
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,208
Huh?

366
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,458
Shut your mouth,
take the money,

367
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,250
and get outta here
right now, 'kay?

368
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,041
[MALE CUSTOMER 2A] Who the
hell do you think you are?

369
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,791
[SOICHIRO] Is that enough
to persuade you?

370
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,833
[[MALE CUSTOMER 2A laughing]

371
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,250
Ain't no take-backs, man!

372
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,000
Fine. As long as I don't
have to look at your ugly face,

373
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,708
I would say that we're even.

374
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,541
[KIMIMARO]
Excuse me, sir?

375
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,500
Here, I wanted to thank you.

376
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,000
[SOICHIRO]
You bought me a coffee?

377
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,916
[KIMIMARO]
Yeah, but it's no big deal.

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,083
I ran into a little
extra money recently.

379
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:11,041
[laughing]

380
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,708
No hold on. I'm sorry.

381
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,000
I didn't mean to laugh.
Thank you.

382
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,833
[SOICHIRO] Must be tough working
at a convenience store

383
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,041
this late at night.

384
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,500
[KIMIMARO] It's not so bad.
I'm used to it.

385
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,583
But you're not used to
the black money, are you?

386
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,416
[KIMIMARO]
Hey. Who are you?

387
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,791
I'm just someone who happened
to see your first deal.

388
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,500
You're pretty impressive
for a rookie.

389
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,041
So then you've been
to that city, too?

390
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,083
[SOICHIRO] Only people who've
been to the Financial District

391
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,458
can tell the difference
between regular and black money.

392
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,958
Actually, it's called
"Midas Money".

393
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,708
'Cause it's issued
from the Bank of Midas.

394
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,500
[KIMIMARO]
Is it dangerous?

395
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,291
[SOICHIRO] No more than
regular cash. It may look

396
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,583
a little strange but there's
no harm in using it.

397
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,916
[KIMIMARO] I was told my future
is being held as collateral.

398
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,500
Is that true?

399
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,500
[SOICHIRO] Yeah, but the money
you borrow against it can help

400
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,458
build a better future.

401
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,000
[KIMIMARO] May I ask what
you do for a living?

402
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,083
[SOICHIRO] Now, that's a tough
one. I guess you might say

403
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:11,125
I use money. And exceptionally
large sums of it.

404
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,458
If things work out,
maybe you can do the same.

405
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,833
[chuckling] I couldn't care less
about being rich! All I want

406
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,958
is a normal life with
a guaranteed salary

407
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,500
and a family of my own!

408
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,208
And that's really
good enough for you?

409
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,791
Why wouldn't I be happy earning
a living like everybody else?

410
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,708
You're just gonna settle
for "normal"?

411
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,208
But that's no different
than running away

412
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,666
from a challenge.
You're not a coward, are you?

413
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,791
[KIMIMARO] No! Not that it's
any of your business.

414
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,166
Maybe you're just afraid
of losing. Is that it?

415
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,375
Your father
had that fear, too.

416
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,125
How would you know that?

417
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,416
If a comment like that
makes you mad, then you must be

418
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,833
trying to run away
from your parents as well.

419
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,000
[KIMIMARO]
Do you really know my dad?

420
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,250
[SOICHIRO] 
You've gotta quit running.

421
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,500
Don't be afraid
of your own potential.

422
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,125
Everyone has to
find meaning in their life.

423
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,833
Thanks for the coffee.

424
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,375
[KIMIMARO] You're saying
I can't be normal?

425
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,125
[SOICHIRO]
We'll find out.

426
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,958
My name is Soichiro Mikuni.
And I would be willing

427
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,333
to help you. If you decide
to make something of yourself.

428
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,333
Either way, I'll be waiting,
on the other side.

429
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,541
[SATO]
Hmph.
