01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,291
anything to do with it
but it wasn't long before

157
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,875
I was hooked.

158
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:54,291
It takes money
to raise children.

159
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:55,791
I was reluctant to have kids

160
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,375
because I knew we
couldn't afford it

161
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:59,541
but my wife
wanted to try anyway.

162
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:02,541
And I don't blame her.
She doesn't understand

163
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:06,000
financial burden because she
comes from a wealthy family.

164
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:09,208
I knew my salary wasn't
enough to support a child

165
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:11,833
but she wouldn't take
"no" for an answer.

166
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:14,833
The Financial District was
the solution to my problems.

167
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:16,958
It was thanks to
the money I earned in deals

168
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:19,041
that I was able
to start a family.

169
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:22,333
What is it that
you're fighting for, Yoga?

170
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:24,916
[KIMIMARO]
Good question. I don't know.

171
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,041
I'm still looking
for the answers myself.

172
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:30,458
[EBARA] You've been doing
some soul-searching?

173
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,958
[KIMIMARO]
I don't know.

174
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,041
[EBARA] Whoever said that
having something to fight for

175
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:36,291
makes you stronger was a liar.

176
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:38,708
If it was true, you never
could have defeated me.

177
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:41,541
[KIMIMARO] Well, I don't know
if I'd consider that a win.

178
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:43,916
And what does that mean?
It doesn't count as a win

179
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
just because
Mikuni bailed you out?

180
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,041
Take any advantage
you can get!

181
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:49,916
[EBARA]
Be proud of your victories.

182
01:09:51,041 --> 01:09:53,250
Because when you lose
you're left with nothing!

183
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:54,958
It all crashes down!

184
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,708
My dad killed himself
when he went bankrupt.

185
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:00,375
He was an Entre, just like us.

186
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:04,000
[EBARA] I'm sorry. But I can
understand why he did it.

187
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:07,916
In fact, I've thought about
it myself. It's strange.

188
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,083
As an Entre, I was forced
to borrow against my future,

189
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,291
which the bank
is holding as collateral.

190
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:16,708
It was such
a nebulous concept

191
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,750
that I was willing
to hand it over

192
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:21,833
without even giving it
a second thought.

193
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:24,833
It wasn't until I went
bankrupt that I realized

194
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:28,500
how truly devastating
losing your future could be.

195
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,458
Sorry to interrupt, I thought
you might like some tea.

196
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:36,250
No, it's fine. You shouldn't
have gone to the trouble.

197
01:10:39,416 --> 01:10:40,833
[KIMIMARO]
Did you have your baby?

198
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,083
What?

199
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:44,125
[KIMIMARO]
It's just, weren't you about

200
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,666
to have your third child?

201
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,791
[laughing] Now, you must be
confusing me with somebody else.

202
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:52,291
Oh thank you but, uh,
I thought you were--

203
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:54,041
[TOSHIKO] I swear there's
something in the water.

204
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,958
First you and now your student?

205
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:58,541
I think I would know
if I was pregnant.

206
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:01,041
We don't have kids.
It's just the two of us.

207
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:04,166
[TOSHIKO] Don't get me wrong,
I would love to have children.

208
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,041
Unfortunately, I haven't had
any luck conceiving.

209
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:08,250
[EBARA] It'll happen, honey,
there's no rush.

210
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:09,750
[TOSHIKO]
Sure, you say that now

211
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:12,291
but what about your
drunken rant last night?

212
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:13,541
I woke up to him yelling,

213
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:16,041
"Where are the children?
What happened to them?"

214
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:18,375
I thought you had
lost your mind!

215
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:20,458
[EBARA] No, that was just
the booze talking.

216
01:11:20,541 --> 01:11:22,125
I don't know
what came over me.

217
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,083
[TOSHIKO] Maybe deep down
you do want kids.

218
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:27,583
[EBARA] No, no, I was just
dreaming, that's all.

219
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:29,625
It must've just been a dream.

220
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,416
[EBARA] When I returned,
everything had changed.

221
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,250
My children never existed.

222
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:38,083
Even the child in my wife's
belly disappeared.

223
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:40,416
There were no records,
no photographs.

224
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,041
Now all I have left--

225
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:46,708
--are memories of a family
that never was.

226
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:50,208
Our world has been changing
right before our very eyes.

227
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:53,625
The shifts are so subtle
most people never even notice.

228
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:56,833
But it's steadily
getting worse and worse.

229
01:11:56,916 --> 01:12:00,083
I wonder what your father lost
when he went bankrupt.

230
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:02,000
After what happened to me,
I'd say you're lucky

231
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:04,000
to even be here right now.

232
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:08,458
I'm so sorry.

233
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,791
[KIMIMARO] All of this happened
'cause I won. It's my fault.

234
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:14,791
[EBARA] I admit, we wouldn't
be here if I hadn't lost

235
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:16,625
but think--If you
had lost the deal

236
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,041
it's highly likely that
you would've found yourself

237
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:21,500
in a similar situation.
Surely that's not

238
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,041
what you want.

239
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,625
There's no way
to win, is there?

240
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,958
Either I make
other people suffer

241
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:33,333
or I end up suffering myself.
What kind of choice is that?

242
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:36,333
This may sound pessimistic
but when it comes down to it,

243
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:38,458
life is about taking
what you want from others

244
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:41,000
and having things
taken from you. For example,

245
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:43,750
another man took Hanabi away
from you, isn't that right?

246
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:47,625
No. It isn't like that!
She's just--she's just a friend.

247
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,750
I think my point still stands.

248
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:53,583
[EBARA] If I had known things
were going to turn out this way,

249
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:55,500
I would've joined
the Starling Guild.

250
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,166
[KIMIMARO]
What's the Starling Guild?

251
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,375
[EBARA] You've never heard
of it? It's an organization

252
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,875
in the Financial District
run by Soichiro Mikuni.

253
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,250
He claims its purpose
is minimizing

254
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:06,916
the Financial District's
effects on our world

255
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,541
by controlling the amount
of money exchanged in deals.

256
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:13,916
It seems like quite a few Entres
have joined their ranks lately.

257
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,916
When you become a member
you give up any chance

258
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,833
of ever winning big but they
also keep you from going bust.

259
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:21,958
I tried to steer
clear of them, myself.

260
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,541
But if I had known then
what I know now,

261
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:26,125
I would've buddied up
to Mikuni real fast.

262
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,666
Just so you know,
I don't hold a grudge.

263
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,541
I don't blame you for anything.
I chose to participate,

264
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:37,125
and I take responsibility
for my actions.

265
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:39,041
If you want to make it up
to me, then don't lose!

266
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:41,333
It'd only make
this situation worse!

267
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:43,583
I want you safe because
you're the only other person

268
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:46,458
in this world who has
any memory of my children!

269
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,458
Hey Mr. Shimada,
how many kids do you have?

270
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:58,166
[SHIMADA stammering]
Where did that come?

271
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,041
I'm sorry I just realized
I've never asked you about them.

272
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,958
I see. Well that's all right.
I never really set

273
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:05,958
the record straight
on that one.

274
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,250
Now's as good a time
as ever, right?

275
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:10,833
I, uh, don't have any kids.

276
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,833
[KIMIMARO] Oh, so it's
just you and your wife?

277
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:15,250
No, just me.
Don't have a wife.

278
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:17,458
Never met
the right girl, I guess.

279
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:20,041
Maybe I shoulda tried harder
when I was young.

280
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:23,625
[SHIMADA chuckling] Sorry I
didn't mention it sooner.

281
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:27,625
Yeah. Not to pry but
don't you want to get married?

282
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:30,125
Even if I did, you really think
there's a woman out there

283
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:31,833
for a guy who's pushing
sixty and works

284
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:34,333
part-time nights
at a convenience store?

285
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,833
[Q] Listen. Can you hear
that creaking sound?

286
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,291
[SOICHIRO]
No, what is it?

287
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:44,041
It's the city.
It's creaking.

288
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:46,833
It's as though
it's reaching its limit.

289
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:49,875
I do what I can
and that's all, Q.

290
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,708
That's good enough for me.

291
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,875
The buildings creak when
they're tilted to the left

292
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:58,166
as well as when they are tilted
to the right. Therefore--

293
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,750
There is no right
or wrong way to tilt them.

294
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:02,625
I knew you'd
say something like that.

295
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:05,875
An Asset must'nt
disappoint her Entre.

296
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,000
[SOICHIRO]
This city will never fall.

297
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:16,250
We will never get
out of dealing.

298
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:19,041
Winning may be hell
but losing is even worse.

299
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:22,166
So, the way I see it, the only
choice is to keep winning.

300
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,416
But don't you ever
feel bad about it?

301
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,666
Not at all. Because
I've finally figured out

302
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,083
the proper way of doing things.

303
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:30,083
I don't understand.

304
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:32,375
[MASAKAKI] Mr. Mikuni,
please come with me.

305
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:33,958
It's time for your deal.

306
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:34,833
Watch, and I'll show you.

307
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:36,583
Uh, okay.

308
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:47,208
[HORII] Mr. Mikuni's deals
always draw a big crowd.

309
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,916
But they tend to be
pretty lavish productions

310
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,625
so that's no surprise.

311
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:56,458
It's one darkness card
against another, huh?

312
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:01,625
If you're that torn up,
why don't you just quit?

313
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:04,083
You don't have a lot of money
to lose so if you went bankrupt

314
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:07,291
now you wouldn't die. I mean,
your professor didn't, right?

315
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:08,833
Even if I don't die,
that doesn't mean

316
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:10,125
someone else won't disappear!

317
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,208
Well that settles it then!
That means no more

318
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:14,000
whining outta you,
ya got that?

319
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,541
Mr. Kikuchi.
If you might reconsider,

320
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:18,875
I'd still be honored
to have you in our guild.

321
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:25,958
[TAKEDAZAKI] Look at that! The
Syndicate's tagging along today.

322
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:29,333
In that case, pardon me for
making a bit of money off you.

323
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:40,166
[SOICHIRO'S CARD]
Open deal.

324
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:40,958
Kakazuzu.

325
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:41,666
Yes, sir!

326
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,500
Hurst, go!

327
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,791
[KIKUCHI'S CARD]
Pac-Man Defense.

328
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:12,333
This is nuts.

329
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,791
[MASHU]
Check out the balance sheet!

330
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:16,875
He's losing money but it's
going down at a steady rate!

331
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:21,541
It may seem like
he's losing ground but

332
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:25,333
he's in total control. I gotta
admit, this guy's not half bad!

333
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:27,958
[TAKEDAZAKI] Hurst is a powerful
Asset but its maintenance cost

334
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,791
is too high.
At this rate of earning,

335
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:31,541
Kikuchi is going to lose.

336
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:33,416
Open my stocks to the public!

337
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,166
[KIKUCHI'S CARD]
Yours.

338
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,125
Hurst is yours.

339
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:38,875
Alright!

340
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:39,750
I'm buyin'!

341
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,041
Me too!

342
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:50,833
[KIKUCHI] Now I can take
my time and enjoy this.

343
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,375
[SHINDO]
The Syndicate, huh?

344
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:55,250
[ISURUGI] Mr. Mikuni has
15 billion,100 million

345
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:57,458
but after selling his stocks,
Kikuchi has double that

346
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,916
at 36 billion, 900 million.

347
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,291
[KIKUCHI] Let's see how long
you can fend me off, boy!

348
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,333
[MASHU] It's decreasing
at the same rate as before.

349
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:12,583
Now!

350
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:13,541
[SOICHIRO'S CARD]
Direct.

351
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,666
Check, Old Man.
You can't keep this up.

352
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,083
The backlash from
his Pac-Man Defense

353
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:24,875
can be a real bitch,
you know!

354
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:32,416
You're too cocky
for your own good, boy.

355
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:38,791
[KIKUCHI] Time's almost up.
Looks like I win.

356
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:42,000
Smooth as silk.
He isn't off by a single yen.

357
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:44,875
You had enough fun for today?

358
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:46,000
What was that?

359
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:47,041
[SOICHIRO]
White Knight.

360
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,375
[SOICHIRO'S CARD]
White Knight.

361
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:50,333
Another one!

362
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:52,208
Man here she comes!

363
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:19,416
Alright, Princess. Hurry.

364
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:22,458
She found the core?

365
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,000
[shrieking]

366
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:28,625
[SOICHIRO thinking]
Will she make it in time?

367
01:19:29,666 --> 01:19:31,625
[SOICHIRO]
Princess, come back, quick!

368
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:37,833
And now I think I'll have you
give me back my money, old man.

369
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:40,666
[KIKUCHI] Your money?
Your money, you bastard!

370
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,083
[SOICHIRO'S CARD]
Direct.

371
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:48,541
[KIKUCHI yelling]
Mikuni!

372
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:55,208
[SLEEPING BEAUTY]
You need your sleep, remember?

373
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,083
[SOICHIRO'S CARD]
Closing.

374
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:02,041
[KIKUCHI'S CARD]
You lost.

375
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,041
[SOICHIRO'S CARD]
You have gain.

376
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,083
[MASHU]
I can't believe it!

377
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:10,375
He won! By only one percent!

378
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:14,166
You do realize that even
one percent can have an effect.

379
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:21,083
Congratulations on your win.

380
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,041
Thanks.

381
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:24,000
That was really great.

382
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:27,000
So you say, but you don't look
all that impressed to me.

383
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:29,625
Seriously, I thought
you were amazing out there

384
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:31,750
and I'm being honest.

385
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:35,291
But that doesn't mean I want
you to take me under your wing.

386
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,500
'Cause I don't have
any interest

387
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,416
in becoming
a powerhouse Entre like you.

388
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,916
Okay then what do you
want to become?

389
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,166
[KIMIMARO]
I'm not sure.

390
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,791
[MASHU]
Annoying, isn't he?

391
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:47,166
[SOICHIRO] That old man is
strong. It's because he has

392
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:49,750
a huge amount of money
backing his Asset.

393
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:51,041
If I made him go bankrupt

394
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,416
it would have a huge effect
on the real world.

395
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,750
That's why I couldn't
let that happen.

396
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,416
Deals aren't about
winning or losing.

397
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,666
The real thrill
comes from making

398
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:02,166
the maximum amount of profit
without taking too much away

399
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,541
from your opponent.
After all you have to consider

400
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:05,916
what influence
that flow of money

401
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,750
will have on the real world.

402
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:09,875
That's why I have
to be as strong as I am.

403
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:13,916
[KIMIMARO] Then all I have
to do is not lose, right?

404
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,708
[SOICHIRO] Yeah, but first
you have to be strong enough

405
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:17,291
to control that.

406
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:25,833
[KIMIMARO]
I'll try. No, I'll do it.

407
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:30,583
I've had enough. I don't want to
rob anyone else of their future.
