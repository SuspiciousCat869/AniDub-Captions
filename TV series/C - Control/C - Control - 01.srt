00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,833
Oh crap. Looks like
I'm gonna be late.

162
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,625
Just leave that stuff.
I'll take care of it for ya.

163
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,166
[KIMIMARO] Thanks a lot, man.
I'll see ya later!

164
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,000
Have a good one.

165
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,333
[SHIMADA]
That's impressive!

166
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,750
You're a full-time student and
you have two part-time jobs?

167
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,291
[KIMIMARO ] The other
convenience store I work for

168
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,041
couldn't give me
any more shifts.

169
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,541
[SHIMADA]
Ah, to be young again.

170
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,750
[KIMIMARO]
I work hard

171
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,208
but it's nothing compared
to guys like you

172
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,791
who work to support
their families.

173
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,833
[SHIMADA laughs nervously]

174
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,750
Is that your friend?

175
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,416
[KIMIMARO] Huh? Uh...

176
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,125
That's Hanabi.

177
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,875
You do know there's
a test tomorrow.

178
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,208
[KIMIMARO] No way! This is
the first I've heard.

179
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,333
Is it a pop quiz?

180
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,541
[HANABI]
You're gonna need these.

181
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,416
I wrote down all the
main points for you.

182
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,833
Just read 'em over before you
go to sleep and you'll do fine.

183
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,291
Thanks a lot.

184
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,625
But you shouldn't have gone
out of your way like this.

185
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,625
My life would be easier
if you'd get a cell phone.

186
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,500
Then I could just
text the notes to you.

187
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,916
[KIMIMARO] Yeah, I would
but I can't afford it.

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,666
I'm flat broke right now.

189
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,666
[HANABI] I don't want
to sound rude, but

190
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,750
I get the feeling you have
money you just don't spend it.

191
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,458
[KIMIMARO]
I like being self-sufficient

192
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,916
so I have to be careful with it.

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,833
[HANABI] Was that a dig at
those of us whose parents

194
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,666
pay for our college education?

195
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,291
[KIMIMARO]
No, I didn't mean it like that.

196
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,583
If you keep obsessing
about living a "normal" life

197
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,500
it'll end up being anything but,
and that'd be totally lame.

198
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,166
You came all this
way just for me?

199
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,875
Mm-Hmm...

200
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,208
So, don't say I never do
nice things for you, okay?

201
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,666
My shift's almost over,

202
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,541
what do you say I take you
to dinner to say thank you?

203
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,125
[HANABI]
My boyfriend's waiting for me.

204
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,625
Sorry.

205
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,208
[KIMIMARO] Uh, no problem.
Guess I'll see you at school.

206
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,500
You'd better ace that test!

207
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll try!

208
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,125
[door closes and locks]

209
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,875
[KIMIMARO dryly]
Honey, I'm home.

210
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,666
[KIMIMARO sighs]

211
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,583
It gets pretty
lonely around here.

212
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,000
It sucks you're gone but
I kinda like living alone.

213
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,625
I don't have to worry about
'causing problems for anybody.

214
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,708
Oh--! So much for that.

215
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,333
Hanabi totally went
out of her way for me.

216
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,750
[knocking]

217
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,583
[yawning]

218
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,541
[dog barks in distance]

219
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,833
It's night already?

220
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,375
[MASAKAKI] Good evening.

221
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,083
I'm a representative
from the Bank of Midas.

222
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,041
My name's Masakaki.
Do you have a moment?

223
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:13,916
Huh?

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,750
[whispering]

225
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,875
[MASHU] C.

226
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,500
[whispering]

227
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,750
[MASHU] C.

228
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,750
Who are you?

229
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,625
Masakai from the Bank of Midas.

230
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,458
I'd like to talk to you
about fund management.

231
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,416
[KIMIMARO] No thanks man,
I'm not interested.

232
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,541
Look, I don't have
any money, okay?

233
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,083
[MASAKAKI]
Just hear me out.

234
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,833
My offer might surprise you.

235
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,500
I may be able to help you start
earning money more efficiently.

236
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,791
In fact, you could easily
double or triple your income.

237
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,958
[KIMIMARO] Uh... I'm sorry.
But I'm not really interested.

238
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,166
[MASAKAKI]
Are you sure?

239
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,666
[KIMIMARO]
Just get outta here.

240
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,666
[door slams and locks]

241
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,833
Talk about pushy. Huh?

242
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,958
I keep studying but none
of this stuff is sticking.

243
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:00,875
Huh?

244
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,791
[MASAKAKI]
Have a seat.

245
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,125
Huh?

246
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,708
[MASAKAKI] I've brought
you to a place where time,

247
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,416
as you know it, does not exist.

248
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,625
I suppose you could
think of it as limbo!

249
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,166
But you don't have
to stay here forever,

250
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,083
I'll send you back
when you're done studying.

251
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,125
Go ahead--have at it!

252
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,666
Huh?

253
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,708
You've barely said more than
"huh" to me this entire time.

254
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,375
Uh... uh...

255
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,958
[MASAKAKI] We have an
opening for an Entrepreneur

256
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,291
in the Far Eastern part of
Asia's Financial District.

257
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,000
We desperately need
to fill this position

258
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,708
so we've randomly chosen--
Well, guess who?

259
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,375
Kimimaro Yoga, a student at the
Heisei College of Economics.

260
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,166
That is you, isn't it?

261
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,375
Uh, yeah.

262
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,125
[MASAKAKI] You see,
the Financial District

263
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,708
is open to almost anyone.

264
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,833
No special skills
required. Lucky for you.

265
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,208
The first time you visit you
may feel a tad overwhelmed

266
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,958
but there's no 
need to be afraid.

267
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,375
You'll get the hang of it.

268
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,000
[KIMIMARO] Yeah.

269
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,583
Now you keep saying "yeah."

270
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,083
Is that really all
you have to say?

271
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,083
Yeah.

272
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,500
[MASAKAKI]
Fine, have it your way.

273
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,291
But you'll have to gather
your wits sooner or later.

274
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,791
[KIMIMARO] Is that supposed
to be some kinda joke?

275
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,958
If anybody needs to "gather
their wits" around here,

276
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,625
it's you!

277
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,875
No need to be cruel,

278
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,208
I'm trying to prepare
you for your new role.

279
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,750
Oh yeah, and what
"role" is that?

280
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,500
Ta-da! You have been chosen
to become an Entrepreneur!

281
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,916
An Entrepreneur?

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,375
Sorry, I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

283
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,250
You're an Entre! That's what
we call them for short.

284
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,250
Sounds cool, don't you think?

285
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,666
Yeah, that's great...

286
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,125
But I still have no idea
what you're telling me.

287
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
[MASAKAKI] I'm afraid you're
going to find the concept

288
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,041
hard to grasp.

289
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,625
Graduates of our
educational system

290
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,041
are virtually incapable
of abstract thought.

291
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,250
[KIMIMARO]
Are you calling me stupid?

292
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,541
[MASAKAKI chuckles]

293
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,041
Ahh!

294
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,833
[MASAKAKI] How can I put it
in terms you'll understand?

295
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,791
All that you have to
do is simply agree to

296
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,333
tender your future to us.

297
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,333
At that point, we'll
hold it as collateral

298
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,541
and you'll be able to
borrow money against it.

299
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,666
[KIMIMARO] Huh?

300
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,125
We'd like for you to
start investing in

301
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,250
the Financial District and
we'll reward you with money.

302
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,625
Is that too much to ask?

303
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,250
You want me to
give you my future?

304
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,750
Technically, it's still yours.

305
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,083
But it might change,
depending on your actions.

306
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,833
So this could take
years off my life?

307
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,500
Well, that's the chance
you take with this deal.

308
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,708
Then forget about it.

309
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,541
I don't understand.
Don't you want money?

310
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,791
Of course I do.

311
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,583
But I'm not willing to
risk my future for it.

312
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,958
But you could afford
to go to the party.

313
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,833
You wouldn't have to
work two part-time jobs.

314
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,041
And you could enjoy
a stable lifestyle

315
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,916
without ever having to fight
to become a civil servant.

316
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,416
How'd you know that stuff?

317
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,041
You're intrigued, aren't you?

318
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,500
Be honest.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,208
Ah!

320
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,041
[MASAKAKI chuckles]

321
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,583
Ah!

322
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,666
Whoa.

323
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,375
What a dream...

324
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,125
[beeping]

325
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,916
What the--?

326
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,416
One, ten, hundred, thousand,
ten-thousand, hundred-thousand?

327
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,000
So, how'd you do on the test?

328
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,333
[KIMIMARO]
Uh. Okay, I think.

329
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,875
Thanks for the notes,
they really helped.

330
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,291
You're not as "self-sufficient"
as you thought, huh?

331
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,416
[KIMIMARO]
Heh... Guess not.

332
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,458
[DUDE 1B] Yo!

333
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,083
[DUDE 1A] We may have to
cancel the party tonight

334
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,708
'cause no one can chip in.

335
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,958
It's not like alcohol's
that expensive.

336
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,875
If it happens, my offer
still stands, Hanabi.

337
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,000
[HANABI] Thanks but I don't
know if I can make it.

338
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,458
I think I'm in.

339
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,583
[DUDES gasp]

340
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,708
[DUDE 1A]
Whoa dude, are you serious?

341
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,458
[DUDE 1B] Cool, I guess
we'll see ya tonight then.

342
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,208
[KAKUTA] I'd spend it.
It's their mistake, right?

343
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,291
Besides, it's not like you
stole the money or anything.

344
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,625
Well no, but still.

345
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,458
[KAKUTA] It'd be one thing
if it was 10 million yen

346
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,750
but it's just 500 thousand.

347
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,291
[KIMIMARO sighs]

348
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,708
You're stressin' out
for nothin', man.

349
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,541
[SHIMADA]
Hypothetically speaking?

350
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,333
That's right. What would you
do if it happened to you?

351
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,541
[SHIMADA]
Back when I was your age,

352
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,875
I would've reported
the mistake to the bank.

353
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,291
No kidding, right?

354
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,291
[KIMIMARO laughs]

355
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,583
[SHIMADA]
But at this point in my life,

356
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,000
I'd probably go ahead
and use the money.

357
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,375
Having extra cash is
always a good thing.

358
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,916
And the bank won't
miss 500 thousand yen.

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,916
Besides, if you were to 
report it, it's possible

360
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,416
someone could lose their
job over a silly mistake.

361
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,708
[KIMIMARO]
You've got a point.

362
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,250
[SHIMADA]
Everybody needs money nowadays.

363
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,750
I mean, take a look at me.

364
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,000
You think I enjoy working
at a convenience store

365
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,791
all hours of the
night at my age?

366
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,708
[KIMIMARO] Maybe if I just
take out a little bit.

367
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,375
[ATM 1C] Please don't forget
to take your withdrawal.

368
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:40,458

[KIMIMARO grunts]

370

[MASAKAKI]
Well, look who's here.

371
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,333
I knew it wouldn't be long.

372
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,708
At the end of the day,
it all comes down to money.

373
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,250
Wouldn't you like the
opportunity to make more of it?

374
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,875
If all goes well, you can
have anything you desire.

375
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,875
Even that girl's heart.

376
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,666
Hanabi isn't the kinda
girl who'd date a guy

377
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,125
just 'cause he has money!

378
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,708
[MASAKAKI] Oh really? Then
how do you explain the fact

379
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,833
that her boyfriend's
a spoiled brat?

380
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,041
As far as I can tell,

381
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,875
the only difference
between the two of you

382
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,083
is that he happens to
come from a wealthy family.

383
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,250
[KIMIMARO] You. You put
that money in my account?

384
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,708
[MASAKAKI]
I'm afraid it's the only way

385
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,291
I could get your attention.

386
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,541
That 500 thousand yen
is earnest money

387
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,208
and it's yours if you want it.

388
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,750
[KIMIMARO]
I think I'm gonna throw up.

389
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,208
[MASAKAKI] So what will you do,
my friend? Will you keep it?

390
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,333
Or shall I take it back?

391
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,541
Here's something
for you to ponder.

392
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,166
If your father had money, do you
think he might've stuck around?

393
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,791
What do you know about my dad?

394
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,166
[MASAKAKI] I know that
if you have the funds,

395
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,833
you may be able to find
out what happened to him.

396
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,416
[KIMIMARO]
Quit messin' with me!

397
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,791
[MASAKAKI] This is an invitation
to the Financial District.

398
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:50,958
Those with cards are granted

00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,416
passage into the realm
without exception.

400

With this card you can withdraw
cash from any ATM in the world.

00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,750
Please be careful with it.

Remember, we're holding
your future as collateral.

You won't regret this.

I promise.

Where to?
