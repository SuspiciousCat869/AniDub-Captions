1
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,833
Is ASEAN movin' stocks and
adjusting interest rates

2
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,083
fast enough?

3
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,458
No. It appears the Southeast
Asian Financial District

4
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,583
is teetering on
the brink of collapse.

5
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,333
Well, that's no good.

6
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,333
Let's prepare for C.

7
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,041
If a Financial District
goes bust

8
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,625
does that mean
its country'll disappear?

9
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,083
That's right. You weren't around
for the Lehman Shock, were you?

10
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,166
You've no clue how
serious this is. Sorry.

11
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,500
You're better off not knowing
the answer to that question.

12
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,083
Aw c'mon, just give it
to me straight!

13
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,625
Well, the short answer is yes.
It will vanish.

14
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:32,000
Whoa, that's crazy! Wait. You're
sayin' it could happen now?!

15
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,916
Before the Lehman Shock,
there was a country in

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,125
the Caribbean Sea. It was one of
the great economic world powers

17
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,333
called the Caribbean Republic.

18
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:44,333
But when the South American
Financial District fell

19
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,833
it was wiped off the map.

20
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,083
Who would've thought
a bustling city like Tokyo

21
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,000
could turn into
this ghost town?

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,916
You know, if things don't
start pickin' up around here

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,333
I'm gonna be outta
business in no time.

24
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,125
Lemme guess, that's
your way of tellin' me

25
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,916
the country's on its last leg?

26
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,875
Smart lady!

27
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,750
Hate to say it, but
I don't think I'm gonna be

28
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,958
doing business in yen anymore.

29
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,083
It's practically worthless.
All our future transactions

30
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,625
will have to be paid
in American dollars,

31
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,041
or better yet,
make it Chinese yuan.

32
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,833
So your homeland is completely
falling apart around you

33
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,333
and the only thing
you're worried about

34
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,041
is switching currency?

35
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,458
Well, to be fair,
it's not like I got to choose

36
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,375
where I was born.

37
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,375
Have any new info for me?

38
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,958
There's a member of the Starling
Guild who might switch sides

39
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,000
if he's given
a talking to, that is.

40
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,750
Convince him to switch
and I'll pay you three times

41
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,750
the usual in dollars,
yuan, whatever you want.

42
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,208
Oh. Miss Sato? I also got
an interesting tidbit of info

43
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,333
on Kimimaro Yoga.

44
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,416
Then let's hear it.

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,250
You're familiar
with his asset, right?

46
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,041
From the first moment
I laid eyes on her,

47
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,416
I've had this weird feeling
I've seen her somewhere before.

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,958
Big deal.

49
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,875
The reason she looks familiar
is because she used to work

50
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,916
alongside the boy's father.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,041
Couldn't care less. If you wanna
make money off info like that,

52
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,750
you should be talking
to the kid, not me.

53
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,625
Well, I'll be damned.

54
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,458
It appears I've misread you.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,958
Hey Hanabi.

56
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,541
Hey Kimimaro. Need somethin'?

57
00:04:55,625 --> 00:05:00,750
No, I guess not. How'd student
teaching go? Did you like it?

58
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,291
I did. It was a lotta work,
you know?

59
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,250
But I had a good time, too.

60
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,041
Awesome.

61
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,250
That all?

62
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,083
Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to bug you.

63
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,750
Well, you are.

64
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,958
Kakuta?

65
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,291
Sorry, man.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,291
The one thing that's
hit me the hardest

67
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,916
since I started my
investigation of the District

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,166
is the endless amount of
statistical data I've read

69
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,791
indicating that the decline of
the human race is imminent.

70
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,791
It looks bad
but this was expected.

71
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,958
We're in the next stage. Early.
There's no reason to worry.

72
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,625
Oh, I'm so sorry.

73
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,166
Let me get that.

74
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,958
What's he doing up there?

75
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,583
Professor Ebara!

76
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,541
Yoga. How've you been?

77
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,750
Is there something wrong?
You look pale.

78
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:44,125
Well, yeah. I'm worried about
you. Why're you up here?

79
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,166
Because, this is my last
ditch effort to get my kids

80
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,875
back somehow. I'm afraid
jumping is the only way.

81
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,958
I've tried everything else.
I got rid of my possessions

82
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,250
hoping it might result
in some kind of trade;

83
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,583
I even scrapped
my years of research.

84
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,958
My life is all that I have left
to give up.

85
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,000
Professor, I know you're upset
but you have to realize

86
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,166
jumping won't bring them back.

87
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,083
I know I'm taking a risk
and I could end up dead

88
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,000
but that's a chance I'm willing
to take. If the bank sees

89
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,708
how desperate I am,
maybe they'll return

90
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,208
my wife and kids to me.
I'll have my family back.

91
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,125
Look, just because
you offer them your life

92
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,583
doesn't mean the bank'll
trade it for theirs.

93
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:34,208
I know. Truthfully,
I just can't take it anymore.

94
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,833
When I came back from our
deal, I went out drinking

95
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,041
instead of going straight home.
I was terrified- I had no idea

96
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,000
what fate might
be waiting for me.

97
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,958
When I finally walked
in the door and realized

98
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,875
my children were gone.
Well, I was heartbroken.

99
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,708
At the same time,
I felt relieved because

100
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,166
I thought it would
be so much worse.

101
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,875
But ever since they were
taken away from me

102
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,958
I don't have any drive.
It's as though I've

103
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,208
lost the will to live.

104
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,666
I've tried to distract
myself with my research

105
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,833
but it just doesn't work. I
can't concentrate worth a damn.

106
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,000
How could I have been such
a fool? When Masakaki asked

107
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,791
for my future as collateral,
I handed it right over to him

108
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,708
with no questions asked.

109
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,750
I never would've done that
if I had known going bankrupt

110
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,166
meant losing it.

111
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,833
There's gotta be something
we can do to get it back.

112
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,041
There must be. I'll go ask
around the Financial District.

113
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,416
So don't jump!

114
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,666
Look at you, playing the hero.

115
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,250
I didn't want to get
wrapped up in all this.

116
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,458
I just wanna be
an ordinary guy again.

117
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:38,250
No, it's good. You've finally
started to move forward!

118
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,666
I'm proud of you, Yoga.
It's about time you started

119
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,291
asserting yourself.

120
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,291
I don't understand,
why'd you come here?

121
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,958
There's something I gotta do.
And it's gonna cost me

122
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,500
a lot of Midas money.

123
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,625
Unfortunately, that means
the next time we deal

124
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,750
I'll probably be a little
low on funds. I know that's

125
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,666
going to make things
harder on you.

126
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,083
I can handle it.

127
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,500
You're not angry?

128
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,708
I'm sure you've got a
perfectly good reason for it.

129
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,208
Spend away. It's fine with me.

130
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,833
You just do what you gotta do.

131
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,625
Masa-kaki!

132
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:27,125
Ma-sa-ka-ki!

133
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,208
There's no need to yell.
I'm standing right here.

134
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,208
It's not nearly as difficult
to get your attention

135
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,833
as I thought it'd be.
All I had to do was scream.

136
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,041
Might I suggest you try
a whisper next time?

137
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:40,750
My ears are quite sensitive.

138
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,291
Sure.

139
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,791
Thanks. Now how may I be
of assistance, Mr. Yoga?

140
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,250
Do you remember Daisuke Ebara? I
was forced to deal against him

141
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,125
and he ended up going bankrupt?

142
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,041
Yes!

143
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,291
I want you to give him back
the future you were holding

144
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:59,041
as collateral. I'm willing
to pay you for it.

145
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,041
I'll give you 100 times
the amount he had

146
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,833
before we started the deal.

147
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,666
What?! Has he gone crazy?!

148
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,166
That's funny. I had no idea
that you were such a comedian.

149
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,541
How much is it gonna be?

150
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,916
I would love to take
you up on your offer

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
but I'm afraid
that's just not possible.

152
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,791
Why not?! If I pay the bank 100
times his original fortune,

153
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,250
that's a huge profit!

154
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,791
I don't make the rules,
I simply enforce them.

155
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,000
Those decisions are made
by the man upstairs.

156
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,791
Fine, then take me
up there to see him!

157
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,750
I can't do that. The boss man
isn't much of a people person.

158
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,166
Boss man? Wait! Hey!

159
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,041
Enjoy the rest of your day!

160
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,583
You wanna get a bankrupt
Entre's future back, huh?

161
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,791
That's gonna be tough.

162
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,791
I figured you'd be
the guy to talk to.

163
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,375
You got it, kid! Now,
lemme warn ya, there've been

164
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,250
several Entrees who've tried
to do the same thing as you.

165
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,583
And as far I know, not a single
one of them was successful.

166
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,916
Daisuke Ebara. When he went
bankrupt against you,

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,833
his two rug-rats disappeared.
Well, three if you count

168
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,416
the bun in the oven.

169
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,125
You know, if you're feelin'
guilty and you wanna

170
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,541
make amends, there's a much
easier way to go about it.

171
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,958
What's that?!

172
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,916
You compensate the guy!
You know, like when somebody's

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,416
killed in a car accident
and the victim's family

174
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,250
is paid big money
for their loss.

175
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,791
I'd say three kids
is gonna cost ya at least

176
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,208
a few hundred million.

177
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,916
Paying him off isn't gonna
make you feel any better!

178
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,291
He wants his children back.
Not money.

179
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,833
That's true.

180
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,041
As Singapore's currency
and interest rates rise,

181
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,041
its company's share
prices are plummeting.

182
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,208
It's worrisome, especially
since their government

183
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,375
hasn't proposed
a single relief measure.

184
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,375
This recession has hit every
industrialized nation--

185
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,458
The Southeast Asian
Financial District's

186
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,333
at the end of its rope.

187
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,875
That's not good. It's hitting
a little too close to home.

188
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,458
C.

189
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,000
C.

190
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,500
Where's Isurugi?!
He should be here by now.

191
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,333
Chill out,
he's probably on his way.

192
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,791
I'm sorry I'm running late.
Something came up

193
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,125
as I was leaving work.

194
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
Why didn't you call and
give us a head's up, man?!

195
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,333
Timing's everything. If
we're off by even a minute

196
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,708
it can break us.

197
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,583
Reading from
Mr. Mikuni's script?

198
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,958
Why, you little!

199
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,916
You can't fault the man
for attending to business.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,083
Now that he's here,
he'll just have to

201
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,500
work harder to catch up.

202
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,875
Thank you for understanding.

203
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,750
So how is our
current situation looking?

204
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,333
The Southeast Asian Financial
District is crashing harder

205
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,541
and faster than I anticipated.

206
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,000
I think it's time we shift
our priorities and focus

207
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,541
on defensive fund-raising.

208
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,833
I want every member
of the Starling Guild

209
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,333
to challenge
a nonmember to a deal.

210
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,500
And steal his fortune.

211
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,291
You're not worried that might
affect the real world?

212
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,166
If this situation progresses,
it'll threaten

213
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,250
our very existence.
We can't afford to waste time

214
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,958
worrying how our actions
might upset the balance.

215
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,208
We gotta pick our opponents.

216
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,500
Whoa! These are the top
three Entres who aren't

217
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,125
in the guild, huh?

218
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,166
I'll take on the
strongest dude-

219
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,000
he looks like
a good match for me.

220
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,125
What about you?

221
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,000
Doesn't matter.

222
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,875
Guess I'll take number two.

223
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,916
You'd better not mouth off
to that guy, Shindo,

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,541
'Cause if you piss
him off, it's adieu to you.

225
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,500
You think you can
do better, ya freak?!

226
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,791
Excuse me. Where can I find
Professor Daisuke Ebara?

227
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,875
Probably at the funeral?
But it's not here-

228
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,166
it's in Hokkaido.
Evidently that's his hometown.

229
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,791
Someone died?

230
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,625
Yeah, he did.

231
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,875
Professor Ebara's dead?!

232
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,958
He was hit by a car.
Sorry, I thought you knew.

233
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,458
Dear Miss Hanabi.
I hope you're good.

234
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,166
You were the best student
teacher in the whole world.

235
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,125
Class isn't the same
without you.

236
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,250
We decided to write you
letters 'cause we miss you.

237
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,583
You're a really nice lady
and we had a lot of fun

238
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,250
the week you were here.

239
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,750
I wish you could've stayed
our teacher forever.

240
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,833
You should come back and visit
us soon. It would be fun!

241
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:51,958
I hope I was your favorite
student! Love, Yuna Kimura.

242
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:03,666
It was terrible. Professor Ebara
was hit by a drunk driver.

243
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,916
What makes it worse is the
driver said he was racing

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,083
to make the green light.

245
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,458
And he didn't see the
professor standing there.

246
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,333
You'd think
a person's life would be

247
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,000
more important
than making good time.

248
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,708
Now don't lose it, okay?

249
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,833
I won't!

250
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,250
Hey, that's my money!
Give it back!

251
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,166
Here ya go.

252
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,583
Thank you!

253
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,291
Our world has been changing
right before our very eyes.

254
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,041
The shifts are so subtle most
people never even notice,

255
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,500
but it's steadily getting
worse and worse.

256
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,750
This can't be happening.
What the hell is going on?!

257
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,541
Well, well,
if it isn't Mr. Yoga!

258
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,791
This is the first time we've met
in this world, isn't it?

259
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,500
Maybe it's some kinda sign from
the universe. Want a crepe?

260
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,416
On me. I got a whole truck
full of 'em.

261
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,458
So tell me. Why do you run a
crepe truck? You've gotta make

262
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,125
a ton of money with all your
information trafficking.

263
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,000
You don't need
any more, do you?

264
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,916
Of course I do! You can never
have enough money.

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,458
"The more you have
the greedier you get."

266
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,708
Yeah, I would imagine
that's true with most people.

267
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,708
I'm different 'cause
I want more than money,

268
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,916
I want consumer confidence.

269
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,375
If they think they can trust ya,
people are more likely

270
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,500
to throw big bucks your way.
Lemme give you an example.

271
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,958
Why do you buy
information from me?

272
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,500
Because I need it.

273
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,958
But why me? How do you know
what I'm telling you is true?

274
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,375
'Cause Mr. Mikuni introduced you
and I trust him.

275
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,916
My point exactly.
Your trust in him brought me

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,708
a new paying client.

277
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,333
Building consumer confidence
in my business allows me

278
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,833
to earn more.

279
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,375
My profits continue to rise
as long as people have faith

280
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,958
in the value of their money.

281
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,958
If they lose faith it's
worthless. The same applies

282
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,958
to futures being
held as collateral.

283
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,958
Guess you could say that.
You have to ask yourself.

284
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,625
Whether you have more
faith in the future

285
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,833
or in the power of money.

286
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:21,083
I can't believe we haven't
decided on a name for you yet.

287
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,541
Why don't we ask
your Daddy what he thinks?

288
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,375
Do you have any ideas, honey?

289
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,708
What's the perfect name
for our little girl?

290
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,625
Mashu.

291
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,833
You look tuckered out, kiddo.

292
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,791
What the hell are you doing?!

293
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,708
Is he for real?!

294
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,041
What a waste!

295
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,333
If you don't need the cash,
then give it to me!

296
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,791
You're not gonna yell at me?
I thought you'd be mad

297
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,000
about me wasting
my money like this.

298
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,500
If this is what you wanna do
then I'm not gonna stop you.

299
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,541
Go right ahead.

300
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,500
I'm proud of you
for being so bold.

301
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,291
I don't want this stuff anymore.
I'm not willing to steal

302
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,666
anyone else's future for it.

303
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,833
In the end, it's just paper.
Look how it burns.

304
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,416
Has this experience
taught you anything?

305
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,958
Now I know that having
a future is more important

306
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:38,083
than having money because I
have more faith in the future.

307
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,500
You do realize burning your
Midas money isn't gonna

308
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,916
do any damage to the
Financial District, right?

309
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,041
Consumer confidence is what
gives it its value. Not you.

310
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,291
You're not gonna make it
worthless by burning it.

311
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,750
Sure, you may
destroy a few bills

312
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,833
but the bank will just
end up printing more.

313
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, that's true.

314
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,541
If you wanna do something,
you're gonna have to act fast.

315
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,125
The country's heading
into the final stage.

316
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,583
Once we hit it
there's no turning back.

317
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,166
Is something wrong?

318
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,416
I'm beginning to wonder if maybe
what he said to me was right.

319
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,791
What who said?

320
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,000
Ko Sennoza.
If all we have left is

321
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,833
a future of
missed opportunities

322
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,708
then the present
has no meaning.

323
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,916
Didn't we cover this?
He had it wrong.

324
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,333
How can you be sure?

325
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,250
Even though it may be slightly
altered by our actions,

326
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,333
the future itself
will always be there.

327
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,208
But if it's miserable,
who wants it?

328
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,458
I do.

329
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,125
No, according to what
you told me, you don't.

330
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,416
You said people are too stressed
to worry about tomorrow.

331
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,416
Does that mean we should
sacrifice the people

332
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,416
in our future to hold onto
the people who're alive now?

333
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,875
You were wrong about Sennoza!
He wasn't just someone who

334
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,666
could afford to look
towards the future.

335
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,541
He wanted to do what's best
for all of mankind!

336
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,083
If the present were to disappear
so would the future.

337
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,583
It exists for the sake
of the future!

338
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,166
You have news?

339
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,375
When the Southeast Asian
District falls looks like

340
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,958
Singapore's gonna
go down with it.

341
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,958
So, it's begun.
How are we on funds?

342
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,375
We're low.
It's barely enough.

343
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,375
We can't worry about that right
now we'll just have to make do.

344
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,583
It's time to make our move.

345
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:18,000
We'll fight off C the best that
we can. We'd better head back.

346
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,958
Right.

347
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,500
C? I dunno what you're up to
but it can't be good.

348
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,375
Keep your mouth shut,
and don't dare get in my way.

349
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,291
Maybe you'll learn something.
