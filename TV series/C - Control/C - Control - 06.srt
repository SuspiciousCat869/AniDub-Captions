1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,250
Humans have an insatiable
desire to purchase goods

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,916
and consume materials.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,041
Some tend to misconstrue this
as the sin of "greed"

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,541
but in all actuality
it's a basic human need.

5
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,458
We can satiate that desire
by purchasing goods

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,541
for those less fortunate.
I don't think that's "greedy",

7
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,958
do you?

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,500
No, I think that's generous. 

9
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,000
But there aren't many people who
are willing or able to make

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:30,250
a charitable contribution
in our current economy.

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,708
I firmly believe that
everyone has compassion

12
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,375
for their fellow man.
For example.

13
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,208
A few weeks ago we had a chain
of anonymous contributions

14
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,791
come through.

15
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,583
It was almost as if charitable
donations had become a trend.

16
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,291
Many people are torn because
they're not sure whether

17
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,958
altruistic acts
are truly selfless.

18
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,166
Ko Sennoza. 29 years old.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,958
He's participated in 57 deals.
56 wins, 1 loss.

20
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,958
His personal fortune is
9 billion, 870 million yen.

21
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,250
He has a deal scheduled
for next Thursday.

22
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,958
His opponent is Kimimaro Yoga.

23
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,291
Making a charitable donation
is investing in the future in

24
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,791
a more pragmatic way, that's how
I like to look at it anyway.

25
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,208
I think most people
would agree.

26
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,666
What an idiot.

27
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:18,291
♪ opening song ♪

28
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,500
Mashu! Go look for the Entre!

29
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,500
Okay!

30
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:04,708
Do it!

31
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,500
Here goes!

32
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,958
We were able
to take down the Asset.

33
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,375
Yeah, but we've still
gotta find the Entre!

34
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,500
That'll be tough.

35
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,750
Damn it! What happened, Teddy?

36
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,625
That's him!

37
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,416
Uh-oh.

38
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,708
Direct.

39
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,833
Hurry up and
get it over with, would ya?

40
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,541
I'm only gonna
take the amount I spent.

41
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,750
Closing. You have gain.

42
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,583
We did it!

43
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,916
Yeah, we did!

44
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,125
You should be
proud of yourself!

45
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,666
Why is that?

46
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,250
'Cause that was a lot of work!
Investigating your opponent,

47
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,458
coming up with a strategy.

48
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,208
I thought you were crazy
but it worked!

49
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
I'm glad I decided to try it.

50
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,041
You must feel good.

51
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,375
Wait. Why's that?

52
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,583
You decided to "go with
your gut" and it paid off!

53
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,291
You're on a winning streak!

54
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,750
It's not about winning.

55
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,000
Someone needs to loosen up
and enjoy the moment.

56
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,791
I feel bad when
our deals don't go well

57
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,166
but that wasn't the case today!

58
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,583
This may not be
what you wanna hear,

59
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,000
but I think winning
feels awesome!

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,375
Can we please
change the subject?

61
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,791
Why can't I talk
about winning when that's

62
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,916
what I'm here to help you do?

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,166
Oh. I forgot about that.

64
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,791
How could you forget?

65
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,333
It's hard to think
of you as a partner

66
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,791
'cause you're a little girl.

67
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,416
If I had a giant Asset like
that bear thing we fought,

68
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,083
it'd probably be
a different story.

69
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,416
Like different how?

70
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,208
What?

71
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,041
Why're you staring
at me like that?

72
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,666
I wasn't staring at you.

73
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,291
I was told you're the
embodiment of my future.

74
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,416
I was just wondering
what that means.

75
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,916
You must be Kimimaro.

76
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,750
So this girl's your Asset.
You like ramen?

77
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:10,625
Aren't you cute? I love the way
your horns curve. It's charming.

78
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,916
And you are?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,666
I'm sorry. How rude of me.
My name's Ko Sennoza

80
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,041
and I'll be your next opponent.
I hear you're really strong.

81
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,833
I don't know about that.

82
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,333
I'd like to
discuss something with you,

83
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,583
please don't take offense.

84
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,333
Has anyone ever told you
there's a way to pass

85
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,833
on an upcoming deal?

86
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,833
I know it's possible if you
transfer some of your money

87
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,958
back to the bank.

88
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,458
But no one ever
told me how much.

89
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,833
Half of your personal fortune.

90
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,000
That's crazy!

91
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,708
I'm willing to cover
that expense for you

92
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,958
if you'll agree to it.

93
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,541
Agree? To what?

94
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,458
Don't play dumb. I'm asking you
to pass on our deal Thursday.

95
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,250
What? Why does it
have to be me?

96
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,708
You can pass on it, can't you?

97
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,333
Losing half my fortune would
adversely affect reality.

98
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,375
However, I could easily afford
to pay half of yours.

99
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,458
If you'll take me up
on my offer.

100
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,375
Don't be alarmed. I find this
setting much more conducive

101
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,708
to conversation.

102
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,166
I don't understand.
How do you know

103
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,166
what half of my fortune is?

104
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,166
'Cause I do my research.
I always make it a point

105
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,125
to learn everything I can
about my opponents

106
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,041
before I approach them
with my offer.

107
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,208
Can you believe that nobody
has taken me up on it yet?

108
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,125
Then why do you even bother?

109
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,625
It doesn't matter how well
a deal is controlled;

110
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,583
any win or loss will
have an impact on reality.

111
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,250
I sure don't want to be
responsible for that, do you?

112
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,208
You don't have to make
a decision right now.

113
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,375
Feel free to contact me
any time. See ya.

114
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,833
Wow, he's a creep.

115
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,291
Nah, that can't be right.

116
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,708
Something wrong?

117
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:40,125
No. I just feel like I've
seen him somewhere before.

118
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,375
What the--?

119
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,000
"Sennoza's nonprofit
organization is committed to

120
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,666
donating vaccines
to developing nations.

121
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,000
They've received accolades
for their charitable acts

122
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,541
both here and abroad."

123
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,750
"Some followers are drawn to
his unique stance on altruism.

124
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,750
Others find his
youthful vibrance appealing."

125
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,750
"His colleagues call him the
'Prince of Volunteers'."

126
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,041
He's even creepier
than I thought.

127
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,500
Excuse me, sir?
Are you Mr. Kimimaro Yoga?

128
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,875
Yeah.

129
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,958
I need you to come with me.
Your aunt's in trouble.

130
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,833
Just get in
and I'll explain. Hurry!

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,958
So, what happened?

132
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,375
Hey! Why'd you lock the doors?
What's going on?

133
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,708
I tricked you.
Didn't think you'd fall for it.

134
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,583
Why would you wanna kidnap
a poor college student?

135
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,750
I don't have any money!

136
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,625
I'm not kidnapping you,
I just wanna talk.

137
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,041
We can go wherever you feel
the most comfortable.

138
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,791
Except for
the Financial District.

139
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,583
Who are you, lady?

140
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,208
I'm an Entre just like you.

141
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,000
I also happen to be
investigating the District.

142
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,958
I don't know what you think
you're gonna get outta me.

143
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,791
I've got nothing
but questions myself.

144
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,666
I know the feeling. I just
wanna have a little chat.

145
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,791
It seems Mr. Soichiro Mikuni
has taken an interest in you.

146
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,166
I'm trying to figure
out what he wants with

147
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,125
an ordinary college student.

148
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,541
There are only
two kinds of people

149
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,250
in the Financial District.
Those who're

150
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,083
completely consumed by it
and those who aren't.

151
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,750
I don't think
it's gotten to you yet.

152
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,541
And if you're anything like me,
you wanna keep it that way.

153
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,250
Mikuni's different though.
He's trying to find a way

154
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,125
to use the District
to benefit this world.

155
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,583
He doesn't realize that's
a dangerous gamble.

156
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,833
Why is that?

157
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,208
He's trying to stabilize
the country's economy

158
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,750
by using Midas money.
Problem is, nobody knows

159
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,791
what effect his efforts
may have on our future.

160
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,750
I wanna give him
the benefit of the doubt.

161
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,291
I mean, maybe he's unaware
that what he's doing is risky.

162
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,416
But I find it hard to believe
a man of his intelligence

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,541
with such sharp business acumen
wouldn't consider that thought.

164
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,541
I'm sorry, but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

165
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,208
The only way we
can guarantee our future

166
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,708
is to destroy
the Financial District.

167
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:55,666
It's crazy. I realize that
but we can't take a chance.

168
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,958
Team up with me! I think we
can pull it off. Whaddaya say?

169
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,041
I don't think what you're
suggesting is even possible.

170
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,833
That place has been
around forever.

171
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,791
It wouldn't be an easy task
but if we went through

172
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,958
and crushed every system
and group that's supporting it,

173
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,583
it's bound to fall.

174
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,958
You don't mean--

175
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,666
I do. We'll have to take down
the Starling Guild.

176
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,083
Are you kidding?
They're trying to help

177
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,875
by minimizing the effect
the deals have on this world!

178
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,666
Didn't you hear
about Basho Pharmaceuticals?

179
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,416
The Guild covered
Kikuchi's debt thereby

180
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,583
preventing his bankruptcy
from affecting reality.

181
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,916
They stepped in 'cause it was a
deal between two wealthy Entres.

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,583
And what's wrong with that?

183
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,958
They kept a lot
of people from losing--

184
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,166
What they did wasn't heroic.

185
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,333
It was nothing more
than a stop-gap measure.

186
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,750
Sure, they saved
ten thousand jobs

187
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,958
but they had to pump ridiculous
amounts of Midas money

188
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,125
into our economy to do it!

189
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,250
There's no telling how
that'll affect our future.

190
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,250
Who knows how much
of it Mikuni's squandered.

191
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,916
I'm so confused.
I don't know who to believe.

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,708
Now that you know how I feel.

193
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,333
Tell me what
you think about them.

194
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,958
Why're you asking me?
I-I just joined the guild!

195
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,333
I dunno what to think!

196
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,916
For all you know
I-I'll tell Mikuni everything!

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,958
You wouldn't. I can tell
by looking into your eyes

198
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,541
that there's more to you
than just money.

199
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,625
C.

200
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,291
C.

201
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,958
Think it over, okay? You don't
have to decide right now.

202
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,958
That's the second time
I've heard that today.

203
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,375
Care to elaborate?

204
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,750
My next opponent said
the same thing to me earlier.

205
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,666
It was Sennoza, wasn't it? When
he first got to the District,

206
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,166
Mikuni took
an interest in him, too.

207
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,750
He declined his invitation
to the Guild.

208
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,583
I don't need time
to think it over.

209
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,666
I'm not gonna work with you.

210
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,083
You really expect me
to believe you,

211
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,791
who I just met,
over Mr. Mikuni? I just--

212
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,166
What the hell are you doing?

213
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,208
We're being followed.

214
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:54,958
Run!

215
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,458
Dontcha think this method's
gettin' a little tired, ma'am?

216
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,000
Gotta keep you on your toes.

217
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,000
I'd be careful if I were you.

218
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,708
Callin' on my cab
to get ya outta trouble

219
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,500
may only bring ya more.

220
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,541
Too late for that, right?

221
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,041
I was suffocating!

222
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,833
Crap. How'm I gonna
get my van back?

223
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,083
I know times are tough
for everyone right now.

224
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,041
What if I told you
to forget today

225
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,583
and worry about
the future instead?

226
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,583
"What the hell is this idiot
talking about?", right?

227
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,666
If we spend our time
worrying about

228
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,083
how we're going to get through
today when tomorrow comes

229
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,291
we won't have the energy
to embrace it.

230
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,458
Wouldn't you all agree?

231
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,041
You should
talk it over with Sennoza.

232
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,875
Ask him how we can keep
the Financial District

233
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,625
from affecting reality. He's
devoted his life to the issue.

234
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,041
You came all this way
to see me?

235
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,458
Have you made a decision?

236
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,791
No, I haven't yet.
If you have the time

237
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,500
I'd like to ask you
about some stuff.

238
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,750
No problem.
Do you mind if we

239
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,291
head back to
my office for a bit?

240
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,041
The media tells us
that our economy

241
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,458
is still in a good state.

242
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,375
But today you saw the reality
they're trying to hide.

243
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,833
Japan is plagued
by economic disparity.

244
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,791
Our financial institutions are
being flooded with Midas money

245
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,666
which just further
disrupts the balance.

246
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,666
And you think it's because of
the Starling Guild.

247
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,791
I'll admit, their theory
of controlling deals

248
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,166
to minimize their effect
seems innocent enough.

249
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,708
But every time they make
a move it feels as though

250
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,625
the two worlds
are becoming more separated.

251
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,000
If all we have to
look forward to is

252
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,833
a future of missed
opportunities

253
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,583
then the present
has no meaning.

254
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,000
Our futures are
being held as collateral,

255
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,250
which means each time
we deal, they change.

256
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:42,000
I've seen how much a loss can
change it and it's devastating.

257
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,291
Yeah, I've been there.

258
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:50,083
There's something
I'd like you to see.

259
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,750
Every year, the children
who've benefitted

260
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,291
from our vaccines
send us drawings

261
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,291
to show their appreciation.

262
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,500
They don't have
the money to buy a card

263
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,125
so they make us one.

264
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,750
There's a recurring theme
in the artwork.

265
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,000
Can you spot it?

266
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,916
No. The pictures
are so different.

267
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Some are of towns,
others are people.

268
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,458
They've drawn the future. 

269
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,541
Their impoverished countries

270
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,166
flourishing after
development--

271
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,833
and who they want to be
when they grow up.

272
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,333
Oh wow.

273
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,333
In all my deals
I've only ever lost one.

274
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,666
It may not have been
a major loss

275
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,500
but I was affected
nonetheless.

276
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,583
When I came back to the office
afterwards I noticed that

277
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,625
several of the drawings
had changed. It was as if

278
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,416
some of them
had been replaced.

279
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,708
They changed?

280
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,208
Then they disappeared,

281
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,583
along with the futures
they represented.

282
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,916
When you deal,
you're taking a risk.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,750
You know that either you
or your opponent's future

284
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,750
will be altered.

285
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,208
It's best to avoid
the situation altogether,

286
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,708
but that's not always
an option

287
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,250
so if you must deal,
there's one way

288
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,166
to lighten the blow.

289
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,708
You can give your
opponents their future back

290
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,500
by offering up your own.
Remember that.

291
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,041
That took forever.
Sorry, Yoga.

292
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,083
Was it the
insurance company again?

293
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,791
Yeah, I just wanna
cancel my policy.

294
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,375
I don't know if cancelling your
insurance is such a good idea.

295
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,000
I may regret it
down the line but

296
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,583
I can't handle
the payments right now.

297
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,041
It's a shame
'cause I've been

298
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,291
paying on that policy
since I was your age.

299
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,500
But I just can't
swing it anymore.

300
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,166
Money's been tight lately.

301
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,791
Seems like
everyone else my age

302
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,750
is worrying about retirement.

303
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,583
And I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life

304
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,375
just tryin' to scrape by.

305
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,250
Guess I'm pretty pathetic, huh?

306
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,291
Works for me.

307
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,625
You're easy to convince.

308
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,916
Well, it's obvious
that you've already

309
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
made up your mind.

310
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,625
I wanted to know
how you feel about it.

311
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,916
How I feel about it?
Why does it matter?

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,208
You're the Entre, you get
to make the decisions.

313
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,916
I was right
about Sennoza, huh?

314
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,416
I know good people
when I see 'em.

315
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,916
Told ya he's a sweetheart!

316
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,291
Why do you look
so surprised to see me?

317
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,708
I'm assuming
the reason you came up here

318
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,875
is because you were
looking to run into me.

319
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,083
Well, kinda.

320
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,833
Okay, now I'm
thoroughly confused.

321
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,208
Did you come here
to see me or not?

322
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,500
Do you think it's wise
to go on a date

323
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,666
before an important deal?

324
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,208
No! I mean
we're not on a date!

325
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,375
We are. Is that a problem?

326
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,625
What is this "date" thing?

327
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,250
I'm worried about my next deal.

328
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,000
He asked you to pass,
didn't he?

329
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,958
He asks that
of every opponent.

330
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,416
What are you going to do?
You decided?

331
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,750
No, not yet.

332
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,125
I went up against Sennoza once

333
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,958
and he asked the
same thing of me.

334
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,583
I "passed" on his offer.

335
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,833
Like he could've covered
half my fortune.

336
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,041
You're the opponent
he lost to?

337
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,583
Originally, I was intrigued
by his theories.

338
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,083
I thought they
were interesting.

339
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,583
But when I started digging
a little deeper--

340
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,916
I realized he had it backwards.

341
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,041
What're you talking about?

342
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,583
When we say "the
future" we're talking

343
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,625
about a continuation
of the present.

344
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,083
Therefore, if we lose
the present,

345
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,083
the future
would cease to exist.

346
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,875
Wait, but if all we have to
look forward to

347
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,708
is a future of
missed opportunities--

348
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,208
--Then the present
has no meaning.

349
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,916
I've heard that before.
Straight from Sennoza's mouth.

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,041
That's the logic of someone
who's doing well financially.

351
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,291
A man who can afford
to look towards the future.

352
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,208
Very few have that luxury.
Most people are too busy

353
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,958
struggling to make it through
today to worry about tomorrow.

354
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,500
I suspect Sennoza has had
a comfortable upbringing,

355
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,250
which is what's
dulled his senses.

356
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,291
He can't seem to smell the scent
of blood lingering on money.

357
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,708
The what?

358
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,041
People die for it and many
others would kill for it.

359
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,041
Every bill has the smell
of someone's blood.

360
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,708
I'm sure you've noticed by now.

361
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,750
I'm not going to tell you
what to do tomorrow.

362
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:28,958
But if you want to
make it in this city,

363
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,458
you have to deal
sooner or later.

364
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,291
You stand up and fight.
That's how you

365
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,166
get things done around here.
No one will take you seriously

366
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,541
if you run from deals
like a coward.

367
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,333
Look, don't let
what he said get to you.

368
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,458
Hello, Kimimaro?

369
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,333
My senses must
be dulled, too.

370
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,500
Money doesn't smell like
anything in particular to me.

371
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,166
Perhaps it's because I don't
know what blood smells like?

372
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,541
That could be.

373
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,291
However, I can taste
its many flavors.

374
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,708
Good to see you.
I knew you would

375
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,375
see things my way.

376
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,791
I was gonna take you up
on your offer but--

377
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,791
You've changed your mind?

378
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,958
I don't know what to do.

379
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,375
I see.

380
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,625
If all we have
to look forward to

381
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,291
is a future of
missed opportunities

382
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,958
then the present
has no meaning.

383
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,291
I can tell by looking
into your eyes

384
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,666
that there's more
to you than just money.

385
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,666
You stand up and fight.
That's how you get things done.

386
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,666
No one will take you seriously
if you run from deals

387
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,000
like a coward.

388
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,333
I know you're confused but
you've gotta make a decision!

389
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,541
Open deal.

390
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,833
Kimimaro!

391
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,375
No turning back now!

392
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,416
Karyuma!

393
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,083
Angel.

394
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,000
Mashu!

395
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,833
So powerful. He's a lot stronger
than I thought he'd be.

396
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,416
I won't last long.

397
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,875
Angel.

398
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,750
Hey are you okay?

399
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,958
Mashu, no.

400
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,458
Angel.

401
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,958
Hey, what are you doing?

402
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,291
Mashu!

403
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:51,666
Hey. Are you still with me?
Please! Say something!

404
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,875
Don't worry about me.
I'm a fast healer.

405
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,666
Mashu.

406
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,125
At this point, all I can
really do is meet him head-on.

407
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,666
But it's pretty risky.
He'll probably finish me off

408
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,875
with a Flation.

409
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,291
No! I can't lose you, Mashu!

410
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:15,541
No. Kimimaro.
You don't need my help.

411
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,666
You don't wanna win this deal.

412
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,333
That's fine because
I kinda feel the same way.

413
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,458
You've got it all wrong.
I don't wanna win

414
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,750
but I don't wanna lose either.

415
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,500
You're the only thing
that matters to me.

416
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,541
I can't lose you. I won't lose
another person I care about.

417
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,500
Come on. Let's go.

418
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,583
Angel.

419
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,666
Hey.

420
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,541
Hey. I stopped by your office

421
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,333
but there was nobody there.

422
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,208
Yeah, I decided it's time
to pull up stakes.

423
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,958
I've got a select few
of the staff coming with me.

424
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,583
Did this happen
'cause of our deal?

425
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,958
Let's take a walk.
I never thought you'd hit me

426
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,125
with two Mezzoflations
back to back.

427
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,666
Sorry.

428
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,791
There's no need to apologize.
You did what you had to do.

429
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,875
I would've
done the same thing

430
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,125
if I was in your shoes.

431
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,958
Still, it was
a sneaky way to win.

432
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,000
The way things were going,

433
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,333
it was only a matter
of time before

434
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,958
I lost the cushion I needed
to control the deal.

435
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,208
And that would've
had a negative impact

436
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,416
on reality, so you made
the right call.

437
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,833
In all honesty,
it was probably my fault

438
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,500
for underestimating you.
As it turns out you're

439
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,750
a much stronger Entre
than I am.

440
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,125
And in my humble opinion, 

441
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,583
I think you've got what
it takes to go the distance

442
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,166
in the Financial District.

443
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,458
Um. What happened to the
drawings on your wall?

444
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,166
Do you really wanna know?

445
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,375
I guess not.

446
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,375
Head's up!

447
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,833
I found that
while I was packing up

448
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,541
our donations for storage.

449
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,416
Now that I have to rely
on fundraising drives,

450
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,416
I won't be able to make
any contributions for a while.

451
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,916
It's sad.
But at least I'm not

452
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,583
dependent
on Midas money anymore.

453
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,208
At any rate, give those noodles
to your charming Asset.

454
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,791
Tell her it's
a present from me.
