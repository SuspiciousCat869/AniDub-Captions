1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,250
Southeast Asia has
been debilitated

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,916
by rapid fluctuations
in their stock market.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,416
This is sure to trigger
a global financial crisis.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,625
We're in desperate need
of emergency funding.

5
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:24,125
Could this instability have been
caused by an outside source?

6
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,416
We suspect that may be the
case, but we've yet to find

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,875
any hard evidence.

8
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,833
So the Financial District
caused this?!

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,291
One of our investigators
who's gained access to it

10
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,333
provided us with this data.

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,041
Have any of you ever
heard of a nation called

12
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,375
the Caribbean Republic?

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,291
Sure, I've heard rumor of it.
I think we all have.

14
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,208
But, I didn't believe
it actually existed.

15
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,583
There are no records.

16
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,791
When the South American
Financial District collapsed

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,166
after the Lehman Shock,
the whole country was

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,125
wiped off the face
of the Earth.

19
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,458
This disturbing phenomena
is known as "C".

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,666
Isn't there some way
this crisis can be averted?

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,916
No, I'm afraid not.
We have no way of knowing

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,416
when it might strike.

23
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,708
What?!

24
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:21,541
It appears as though
the time has come.

25
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,958
I knew you'd pay me a visit.

26
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,333
It's time I make use of this.

27
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,208
Oh! The Darkness card.

28
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,166
Are you absolutely sure
about this, Mr. Mikuni?

29
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,458
You'll be required to
relinquish up to 20 years

30
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,500
of your future as
repayment for the loan.

31
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,041
Sure, whatever.

32
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,250
The bank is not responsible for
any impact this transaction

33
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,791
may have on reality.

34
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,625
I don't have time for
this; could you please

35
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,833
hurry things up?

36
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,708
The chain reaction's
already been triggered.

37
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,833
The Dow Jones has fallen
a whopping 32 percent!

38
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,000
The Mumbai Sensex
is down 48 percent!

39
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,708
What's with the STI?!
Look how fast it's falling!

40
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,208
Straits Time Index?

41
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,416
Yeah. Singapore's market
has taken a blow!

42
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,833
Singapore, huh?

43
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,416
Singapore.

44
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,250
We lost another one.

45
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:12,250
Oh wow, This doesn't look
good. The CSI 300 is down, too!

46
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,333
Seems Hong Kong made it through
with little more than a scratch.

47
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,083
Next up.

48
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,166
Doesn't look like
we can avoid takin' a hit.

49
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,125
Are we prepared to begin
investing when necessary?

50
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,708
Yes sir, we're ready
when you are.

51
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,291
Oh, about our funding.
We haven't told a soul

52
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,541
how we got it.

53
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,416
Seems two or three waves
are headed our way now.

54
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,750
Glad they're tiny.

55
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:52,000
TOPIX is at 200. One- ninety.
It just keeps falling!

56
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,708
Evidently we lost a bit
of Shanghai, too.

57
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,708
Looks like we're next.

58
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,458
Never pegged you for the
brooding, melancholy type.

59
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,666
We're cool as long as the
chain reaction doesn't

60
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,250
start expanding. We have just
enough funding to keep all of

61
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,791
the major banks and 80 percent
of the top companies afloat.

62
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,291
Good to hear. I can't thank you
guys enough for helping me.

63
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,333
Who, us? You're the one
who was able to pull in

64
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:33,208
a ton of money at the last
minute. You saved our hides.

65
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,875
We would've crashed and
burned if it weren't for you

66
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,000
but you know I gotta ask. Where
did you get all that dough?

67
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,875
Please, come in. You can
take however much you need.

68
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,416
I'll print as much as
you'd like, there's no limit.

69
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,291
If you'll follow me, please.
This is the rotary press of the

70
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,458
Bank of Midas. It's quite
impressive, don't you think?

71
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,666
Go ahead and take
a closer look.

72
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,708
Just hold out your hand.

73
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,541
Now touch the orb
to your forehead.

74
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,625
The hell is this?!

75
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,375
The spheres dancing before you
symbolize the Midas money

76
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,958
that's printing and your future
that is slowly dwindling.

77
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,333
You can't turn back now!

78
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,666
What the?!

79
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,250
It hurts.

80
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,958
Thank you. Allow me to deposit
it directly into your account!

81
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,875
It doesn't matter how I got
the cash. We needed it.

82
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,250
Now we've got enough
to pull through "C".

83
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,666
What's going on?!
This is crazy.

84
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,125
Here it comes.

85
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,541
The Tokyo market hit stop
loss limits again yesterday,

86
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,625
forcing the government to expand
price control mechanisms.

87
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,583
However, as of this morning,
stock prices continued

88
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,708
to drop precipitously.

89
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,166
Buy! Buy any and
everything you see!

90
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,583
We've got all the
money in the world!

91
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,833
We have to support as many banks
and companies as we can.

92
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,041
To save our country!

93
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,416
Let's switch it up!
Buy this one!

94
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,458
Yes, sir!

95
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,333
Pick up the pace!

96
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,375
Yes, sir!

97
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,916
You think we're gonna be able
to hold it together?

98
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,791
We have no choice.

99
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:07,000
Now it's climbing again.
How's that possible?

100
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,958
Mikuni. This time you've
really crossed the line.

101
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,541
It's gone.

102
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,250
Clap-clap-clap-clap-
clap-clap-clap-clap!

103
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,541
You were able to stop it. My
congratulations on your victory.

104
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,958
For protecting the present you
deserve a big hurrah, sir!

105
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,083
When you settle up with
the bank, it'll be on

106
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,791
a specified date in
one lump payment.

107
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:58,625
Is that okay? Not that you have
much say in the matter.

108
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,125
"Settle up"?

109
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,875
Of course. The loan you were
given comes with a price.

110
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,583
C.

111
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,291
C.

112
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,083
So that "C" thing is the
reason Japan's economy

113
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,416
is all messed up now?

114
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,125
More damage was caused by
the way it was stopped.

115
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,416
The Real GDP has almost been cut
in half. In fact it's dropped

116
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,541
to about what it was
in the early 80s.

117
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,458
It's that bad?

118
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,000
We're lucky, it could've
been even worse.

119
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,291
I bet Mikuni's
gloating as we speak.

120
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,625
What's he got to do with it?

121
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,291
Everything- he's the reason
we're still here. He used

122
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,458
Midas money to invest in
the Japanese stock market.

123
00:11:56,541 --> 00:12:00,333
Thanks to him, it's relatively
stable. At least, for now.

124
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,166
On the down side, the country
could lose years, up to

125
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,291
a decade, of its future because
of what he pulled today.

126
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,125
Really? So do you think "C"
might be gone for good?

127
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:15,416
It's possible. But there'll be
kickback from Mikuni's actions.

128
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,666
Who knows what
he's released on us?

129
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,000
But it's far worse than "C".

130
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,666
What'd Takedazaki
say about Mashu?

131
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,916
That she looked familiar
and he thought he might've

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,083
seen her before.

133
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,666
Did he say where?

134
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,750
Look, I didn't ask for the
info he just let it spill.

135
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,166
I think you should hunt the guy
down and ask him yourself.

136
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,625
Hey, are you guys
having ramen?!

137
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,875
Uh, yeah.

138
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,208
I want some!

139
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,875
I heard you dad was
an Entre too. Is that true?

140
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,291
Yeah. But he was banished
when he went bankrupt.

141
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,375
I'm guessing Takadazaki's
the one who told you that?

142
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,708
Yeah.

143
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,291
That makes sense. I think
the information he was

144
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,708
tryin' to sell me has
something to do with your dad.

145
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,541
So which flavor do you
want- soy sauce or curry?

146
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,041
--Soy sauce!
--Curry.

147
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,333
I'll have to bring one
for you next time.

148
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,916
You will?! Really?!
Is that a promise?!

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,541
Yeah, you betcha.

150
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,500
I got somethin' special
here. Wanna see?

151
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,833
See what? I don't get it.

152
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,750
A picture that might
be of interest to you.

153
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,500
Is it of my dad? Show me!

154
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,333
Take a look.

155
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,583
No way.

156
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,166
That looks like me!

157
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,208
Yeah. Your assets were
identical except your dad's

158
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:42,250
had black hair and her name
was, let me see, Mua!

159
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,500
Mua.

160
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,958
She was a strong asset.
Just like you, Mashu.

161
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,375
Do you know where she is now?

162
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,250
I'm guessing she disappeared.
Probably happened around

163
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,750
the same time your old man
was banished.

164
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,875
They look so much alike.
That's gotta mean something,

165
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,208
dontcha think?

166
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,708
Yeah. I'd like to think so
anyway. Maybe it means

167
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,041
that little girl is a big
part of both you and

168
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,625
your old man's futures.

169
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,916
Do you want it?

170
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,208
Nah. That's okay.

171
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,958
If you act now I'll give
it to ya gratis.

172
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,875
Just this once.

173
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,916
Some dreams come true,
and some dreams don't.

174
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,750
Then there are the dreams you
know won't come true but

175
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,458
you have them anyway. The only
reason we're able to dream

176
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,625
is because we have a future.

177
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,375
A soul that's lost its future is
just like one of those dreams

178
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,333
we know won't come true.
With nowhere else to go,

179
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,708
these lost souls drift into
the Financial District.

180
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,833
They're assets?

181
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,875
I'm probably going out on a
limb here. When I heard you

182
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,000
and your dad's assets
look almost identical,

183
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,625
I couldn't help but wonder
what that meant.

184
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,708
Your matching assets
could be a symbol

185
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,541
of your connection
as father and son.

186
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,000
Well I guess that's possible.

187
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,625
Yeah. I'm starting to think
you're more like your dad

188
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,791
than you're willing to admit.

189
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,041
Sorry, but you're
way off on that one.

190
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,208
Gimme a break. I don't
know why you're convinced

191
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,416
your dad was one of the
"bad guys". I mean,

192
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,083
it's obvious that he loved you.

193
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,166
Going bankrupt can
destroy lives.

194
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,416
Not just the Entre's.
Their family's too.

195
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,833
Your dad did his best to avoid
it. I honestly believe he tried

196
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,333
to escape from the Financial
District before his last deal.

197
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,291
But there is no escape.

198
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,750
By all accounts,
you should've disappeared.

199
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,750
Yet here you are
in front of me.

200
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,250
If you ask me, that proves
your dad loved you.

201
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,708
He fought to protect
his precious son.

202
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,250
Now that you're an Entre,

203
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,625
I'm sure you can imagine how
hard that must've been for him.

204
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,458
I still don't know what I should
be fighting to protect.

205
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,291
Look around and
I'm sure you'll find it.

206
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,625
But don't stress about it.
If nothing else,

207
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,000
you'll know what it is when
you're forced to protect it.

208
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,250
Wow!

209
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,041
Would you do me
a favor, György?

210
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,375
Remember that boy's scent.
We may need it later.

211
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,500
Aren't you sweet? I'm sorry that
you had to come all this way.

212
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:14,250
Hanabi, hurry up!
Your friend's here.

213
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,708
I'm not deaf.

214
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,125
What do you want?

215
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,708
Just checking in. You haven't
been at school for a few days

216
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,333
and you haven't been
answering your phone.

217
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,708
Yeah, sorry. I've been
in bed with a cold.

218
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,333
Okay. And nothing else is wrong?

219
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,416
Why do you ask?

220
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,541
Never mind.

221
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,250
Does anything seem different?

222
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,500
Yeah.

223
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,000
Nope, not a damn thing
as far as I can tell.

224
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,166
It's the same 'ol, same ol'.

225
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,541
Why'd you ask me that?

226
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,541
No reason. Just curious.

227
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:58,583
Gimme a break.
You're losing it. I forgot.

228
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,583
Take out the garbage for me.

229
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,875
What just happened?

230
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,916
Whoa, What's going on?!

231
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,666
It's all different.

232
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:41,958
Shimada!

233
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,375
Not a single customer all day.

234
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,791
I don't understand how this
store stays in business.

235
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,416
Hey, Yoga.

236
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,041
I'm really sorry to bother you
again, is Hanabi home?

237
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,125
And who are you?

238
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,916
Ma'am, we've met.
I'm Kimimaro. Is she home?

239
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,458
Your daughter, Hanabi.
She lives here, right?

240
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,333
Thank goodness. Would you
please tell her I'm here?

241
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,708
Yes. I'm Hanabi. I have
such a strange name,

242
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,625
but it comes in handy.

243
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,625
People always remember me.

244
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:31,458
Who knows what he's unleashed on
us, but its far worse than "C".

245
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,833
Is this happening because
of what he did?

246
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,458
Is this what it means
to "settle up"?

247
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,000
I worked my ass off
to protect my country

248
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,791
and this is what I'm left with?

249
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,666
I've changed my mind.
I wanna work with you.

250
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,000
What he's done to Japan has
gotta be a million times worse

251
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,500
than anything "C" could-

252
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,958
I knew you'd come around.
It was only a matter of time.

253
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,541
While you've been wallowing
in your own indecision.

254
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,666
I've been busy laying
some groundwork.

255
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,541
We can't bring back the lives
that have already been lost,

256
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,791
but it's not too late to
save those who're teetering

257
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,791
on the edge of existence.
This is our chance.

258
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,666
Let's take back
the future together!

259
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,458
The future?

260
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,416
That's right,
we're gonna take it back!

261
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,250
That means you'll have one too!

262
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,291
And what difference
will that make?

263
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,416
Who knows? You might
become a normal girl

264
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,750
instead of an asset.
Anything's possible.

265
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,291
A normal girl?

266
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,833
How can I explain? You could
even be my daughter. I dunno.

267
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,583
But I know that you'd be happy!

268
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,041
How can you be so sure
that I'd be happy?

269
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:40,083
I would take care of you. And I
would protect you, I swear!

270
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,000
Like I was your daughter?

271
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah, I promise.

272
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,583
Why can't we stay
this way forever?

273
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,291
What's wrong with the way
things are now, huh?!

274
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,916
We don't have a future, Mashu!

275
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,166
But if you get it back we could
end up being separated!

276
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,083
We'd be together again
in the future.

277
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,625
That's not the same
as being together now!

278
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,041
Mashu.

279
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,166
It'll be okay.

280
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,916
Hey, do that thing.

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,875
Do what?

282
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,833
You know. Kiss me!

283
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,916
What'd I tell you?

284
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,708
I like you 30 times
more than before!

285
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,666
But that doesn't matter,
does it?! It's fine!

286
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,166
I know you couldn't care
less about how I feel!

287
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:20,875
That isn't true!

288
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,750
Then shut up and do it!

289
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,833
Okay.

290
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,041
That wasn't like it was on TV.

291
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,000
Because this kiss was special.

292
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,750
The kind you give to someone
you're in love with?

293
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,750
An alarming report on the
nation's declining birth rate

294
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,791
was released today by
the Minister of State.

295
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,458
In the span of an entire week,
there were only three births

296
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,208
in all of the prefectures
of Japan combined.

297
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,500
This extreme drop is expected
to lower the country's

298
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,583
current birth rate data which
is already unusually low.

299
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,416
Concerned about the trend, the
Minister stated she plans to

300
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,333
carefully assess the situation.
