317
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,833
since everyone's accepted it
as a work of fiction.

318
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,625
But that was actually the reason
for the cult following

319
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,625
the show's gained since then.
[grunts]

320
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,125
The toy quality at that time
was terrible.

321
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,708
The advanced
action figure technology

322
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,833
we have now didn't exist,
so they couldn't reproduce

323
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,208
the complex movements needed

324
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,250
to create a believable
transforming robot.

325
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,250
Don't even get me started
on the proportions.

326
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,583
[MAN 2] Oh, come on, the poor
quality is part of their charm!

327
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,083
It's also why no one
on Earth buys them,

328
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,208
but that's beside the point!

329
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,750
[laughter]

330
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,083
The studio decided to do

331
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,958
whatever they wanted
with the new episodes.

332
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,708
And they were amazing!

333
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,416
Yeah, but Earthlings
have horrible taste

334
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,125
and never understood
how good they were!

335
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,708
Nah, the studio
was already flirting

336
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,250
with failure regardless.

337
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,666
Gotta admit that last episode
was such a mind-swirl!

338
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,541
I felt lost the majority
of the time anyway,

339
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,416
but then they installed
the Super Hizakuri Beam

340
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,000
and we never even got to see
how it was used!

341
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,875
-That reminds me! I gotta--
-Yeah, screw that!

342
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,541
As one of the many fans
who has only seen

343
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,666
the rebroadcast of the show,
what we want more than anything

344
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,791
is to see the unseen,
legendary episode twelve!

345
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,500
But it doesn't exist!
I want it! Bad!

346
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,416
There are storyboards
and a script created by Yuma.

347
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,041
And Kinomata had signed on
to do character design.

348
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,041
We're talking high quality
for days!

349
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,458
How could this be the episode
that was lost?

350
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,500
It wasn't lost, it was removed
from all broadcast networks,

351
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,250
and then the master film
was destroyed!

352
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,416
Such soulless demons!

353
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,625
We tried it all.

354
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,958
We tried capturing the signal

355
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,583
from the original broadcast
several times,

356
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,041
but all the attenuation
and noise

357
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,833
made it impossible to reproduce.

358
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,125
We didn't care what it cost,
we wanted to see it.

359
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,416
And even after
all our hard work,

360
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,166
we still have nothing
to show for it!

361
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,833
Robby, you may be our last hope.

362
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,250
Did your grandfather
tell you anything

363
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,791
about the
legendary episode 12?

364
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,291
Well...

365
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,708
What you all keep forgetting
is that after 12 aired,

366
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,083
its content became an issue

367
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,875
and it was erased
from existence.

368
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,500
Some say that the creators were
being pressured to destroy it.

369
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,125
-That's the--
-[GIRL 1] That's when the film,

370
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,958
the script, and any
and all production materials

371
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,250
were disposed of.

372
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,875
I heard that Yuma left
the anime industry

373
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,958
and lived his life
completely heartbroken!

374
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,333
One tiny piece
of episode 12 still exists.

375
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,333
A few lines in the script
for episode 11

376
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,208
previewing the plot for 12.

377
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,625
"A terrible plot
has been hatched

378
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,041
"by the Saturnians!

379
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,416
"Hizakuriger faces
its greatest challenge yet!

380
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
"Next time,
'The Saturnian Gakudojin.'

381
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,500
We'll see ya then!"

382
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,000
We have a timeline.

383
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,750
The episodes before and after

384
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,583
mention things that happened
or will happen.

385
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,166
For example, in episode 13,
someone says,

386
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,250
"The Hizakuri Beam failed
to work earlier."

387
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,708
But there were no scenes
before or after showing that.

388
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,708
So, the enemy that
they were trying to beam

389
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,791
had to have been introduced
in episode 12.

390
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,833
And even though it was
the last episode,

391
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,125
13 tells us
basically nothing about 12.

392
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,416
The most popular theory on what
the plot for 12 could be is,

393
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,708
Saturnians were developing
a new kind of nuclear weapon,

394
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,583
and Hizakuriger sets off
to put a stop to it.

395
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,166
But the Saturnians are protected
by a powerful shield.

396
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,916
So, the plot becomes
about looking

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,625
for a new way to stop them.

398
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,833
At least that's what they're all
touting now on the interwebs.

399
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,666
What do you think, Robby?

400
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,750
Pretty sure you're all wrong.

401
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,083
[ALL gasp]

402
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,458
W-w-wait! What makes you
so sure about that?

403
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,000
-Uh, because I've seen it?
-How is that possible?

404
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,708
You weren't even alive
when it first aired!

405
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,708
Listening to you guys geek out
about the show

406
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,208
made me remember something.

407
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,750
It's the same Hizakuriger
I used to watch.

408
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,708
Twelve opens with
the robot's chest glowing

409
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,833
and then all of a sudden
we're in a flashback.

410
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,166
Then the entire episode
becomes about everyone as kids

411
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,666
which is why
I didn't realize at first

412
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,125
that it was the same show.

413
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,666
There's no opening attached
to that one either.

414
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,208
But how did you see it?

415
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,416
My grandpa would always play
these old movies for me

416
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,375
when I would go
visit him as a kid.

417
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,833
He'd put them on this
old-timey projector thing.

418
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,333
That was the master film!

419
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,791
So then, your grandfather
owns the original!

420
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,958
I hadn't thought about that
in a long time. I miss my--

421
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,916
Who cares? You have
to tell me where that film is!

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,708
[overlapping shouting]

423
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,750
We placed it in Grandpa's casket
when he passed.

424
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,125
[ALL gasp]

425
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,750
He's showing it to all
his friends in Heaven!

426
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,416
[ALL groan, cry]

427
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,541
Hold on! That means
you saw episode 12

428
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,708
several times
as a kid, right?

429
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,250
Yeah, but I was five,

430
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,750
and I've drank
a little since then.

431
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,375
I hardly remember any of it.

432
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,000
Aww, memories are important.

433
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,333
Especially from childhood.

434
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,250
So...

435
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,166
[ROBBY whimpers]

436
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,041
I want to help you remember.

437
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,958
What do you say?
Please?

438
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,458
-[electricity crackles]
-[ROBBY screams]

439
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,583
Huh? Huh?

440
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,916
So, uh, what the hell?

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,208
[ARMENI] Earthlings are born
with such a magnificent gift,

442
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,791
but most are completely unaware
of it and its powers.

443
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,625
[MAN 2] It's a gift
we would love to have

444
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,083
more than anything.

445
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,500
What do you mean?

446
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,208
[MAN 1] The device
you're currently sitting in

447
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,583
can directly access
a person's brain

448
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,166
and extract its memories.

449
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,458
[GIRL 2] There are so many
lost videos of Earth's anime

450
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,791
searching for a home,
and not just Hizakuriger.

451
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,458
[ARMENI] This is how we will
finally add those lost videos

452
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,250
to our collection.

453
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,875
Cool, so, does it hurt, or...

454
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,625
[MAN 1]
The pain is not that bad,

455
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,666
but it will leave you
with memory loss.

456
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,125
How bad are we talkin' here?

457
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,333
[MAN 1] You'll forget
who you are

458
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,416
as well as what you are.

459
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,333
[GIRL 2] You won't remember
anything about Earth.

Whoa. I call veto!

461
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,208
No just get away!

You are such
a strong person, Robby.

463
