they say he's pretty dangerous.

162
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,666
-[IKKU] Uh?
-[ROBBY] Huh?

163
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,708
[HATCHI]
No one will give me details.

164
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,333
Just that there are those
who lose all sense

165
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,875
and never recover
from meeting him.

166
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,958
Seems pretty dramatic.

167
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,375
[HATCHI] It's like
something worse will happen

168
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,041
if they share specifics.

169
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,541
They're making it dangerous
by not giving us a heads-up.

170
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,250
Makes it easier to hide if he's
selling fake travel permits.

171
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,875
Are we sure this guy's legit?

172
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,041
[ROBBY]
No, Ikku, we're not.

173
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,333
That's what I was thinking!

174
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,791
Those are bootleg
travel permits!

175
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,833
They're not.

176
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,083
I already looked into that.

177
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,250
[ROBBY/IKKU]
Huh?

178
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,541
[HATCHI]
The ones this boss is giving out

179
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,208
are said to carry
even more weight

180
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,416
than the permits you can get
from your homeland.

181
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,875
You're instantly perceived
as having a higher status,

182
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,875
and everyone treats you
like you're elite.

183
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,500
So instant sports-star status.

184
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,125
Or like... flashing a black card
at a nightclub.

185
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,541
Ikku, hush.

186
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,750
They probably react that way

187
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,541
because they're afraid
of that dude.

188
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,416
They can look at you
and know you made a deal

189
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,708
with the dark emperor!

190
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,750
Hey! Can I get
a refill on this sake?

191
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,166
Sure thing, kappa.

192
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,375
So, if it's that dangerous,

193
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,291
why do we want to get
our travel permits from him?

194
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,416
Because it's the only option
we have right now.

195
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,750
[IKKU/ROBBY]
In here?

196
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,541
He's got giant black egg
gatekeepers?

197
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,458
I don't think I've ever seen
anything so round

198
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,333
and terrifying
in my entire life.

199
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,875
[screaming]

200
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,416
Help! Help us!

201
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,666
Whoa! Take a breath!

202
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,166
What exactly
do you need help with?

203
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,541
It's like we just escaped
a bad horror movie!

204
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,250
What? How?

205
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,541
I was about to become
a shell of myself!

206
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,083
Stay far, far away from him
if you value your life!

207
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,208
One sec.

208
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,958
Are you talking about the boss?

209
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,750
Well, the truth is...

210
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,375
[screaming]

211
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,125
I hope those guys at least got
their travel permits.

212
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,333
Hey, Hatchi, you sure
you want to see this guy?

213
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,708
Maybe we should all sit down
and weigh our options first!

214
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,208
-Excuse me!
-[BOTH] Aah!

215
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,750
Pardon me,

216
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,666
could you introduce us
to the person in charge, please?

217
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,625
[grumbles]

218
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,125
What is wrong with you?

219
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,333
Is there a reason
you're holding me so close?

220
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,166
Sorry, we don't let him out
in public very often,

221
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,125
it's our fault!

222
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,416
We'll get him back

223
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,416
to his safe space right away!

224
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,708
You've got issues, bro.
That wasn't funny!

225
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,958
It was!

226
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,875
We were stopped by eggs!

227
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,166
They were giving us dirty looks,

228
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,375
and you guys
were terrified of them!

229
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,958
Of eggs!
Of giant angry eggs!

230
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,291
Oh ha-ha-ha!

231
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,500
Well, if we hadn't been
sane enough

232
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,958
to drag you out of there,

233
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,958
they would've sucked our souls,
so you're welcome!

234
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,875
"Help! I'm being sucked
by an egg!"

235
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,666
[IKKU]
This guy's seriously twisted.

236
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,000
[BARTENDER]
Here you go. Enjoy.

237
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,500
Uh, smells like fruity coffee.

238
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,750
It's peach hot spring coffee.

239
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,500
Haccone's local delicacy.

240
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,041
I'm no expert, but I'm
pretty sure that's hot pink.

241
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,208
Oh, look at that,
four-point-seven stars

242
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,541
on Trip Sunvisor.

243
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,291
And someone posted that
it tastes amazing

244
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,833
with peach
hot spring sticky buns!

245
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,291
Let's get some!

246
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,583
I'm gonna kill you.

247
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,041
You won't look up
something as crucial

248
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,333
as whether or not
we need transit permits.

249
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,916
But show you
a neon cup of coffee

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,750
and you'll make damn sure
we know what to eat with it.

251
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,708
Wow! It tastes just like
regular coffee!

252
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,791
-Wow!
-[ROBBY grumbles]

253
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,875
By all means, take your time.

254
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,083
Have one for me, too.

255
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,833
Not like we've got
somewhere to be.

256
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,041
We don't need that sticky bun
money for important things

257
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,000
like checkpoint fees
and hyper-road tolls!

258
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,750
You're right, Ikku, you should
probably head back to Earth

259
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,583
and get those transit passes
handled for us

260
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,458
so we can all save
some time and money.

261
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,500
We'll make sure to keep
the hot springs hot for you

-until you come back.
-Huh?

Oh. Never mind.

264
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,125
Robots can't go
swimming anyway.

How dare.

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,791
Whoa! I spy
with my hungry eye

00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,250
three alien hotties
ready for a hot bath!

00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,833
And being the gentleman
that I am

269
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,291
I'm not gonna make them take
that dip alone, you know?

270
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,750
Counting on you, Ikku!
Hello there, ladies!

Damn it, Robby, you idiot!

How can you sip tea
at a time like this?

275
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,541
It's coffee.

276
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,708
Watch the bartender.

277
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,291
I don't trust him.

00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,375
Huh?

Quiet.

280
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,625
He's pretending to do
the dishes, but...

281
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,958
he's actually trying
to eavesdrop.

Oh!

00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,416
I bet he knows
the underworld boss.

Hmm.

285
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,291
Does he think he can just
walk up to anyone here

286
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,666
and demand information,
and with that haircut?

a great help!

Did you get all the answers?

from all that walking,
how about you?

294

right now, doesn't it?

-Huh?
-Uh, what do you guys wanna do?

296
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,750
We should try that
hot spring shaved ice!

297
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,833
I heard it's completely organic,
made with local ice!

Sounds good!
I wanna try vortex blue!

We can all go do
the pirate ship ride after that!

Seems I was right.

really does know

the underworld boss.
