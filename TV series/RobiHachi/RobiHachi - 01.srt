160
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,416
Oh, really?

161
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,583
Well, yeah. You remember
when that whatchamacallit

162
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,791
went to the moon 50 years ago

163
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,250
and made contact
for the first time?

164
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,958
I was gonna move up there
and help build kingdoms

165
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,291
and be super rich and fancy

166
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,333
living that sweet,
sweet moon life.

167
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,166
Uh, what was that thing called?

168
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,750
Uh... Doesn't matter.

169
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,041
The point is, you should
lead an honest life.

170
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,875
Heh. What makes you
think I don't?

171
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,250
Oh, yeah, that's right.

172
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,125
You don't know about the new
enterprise I'm building.

173
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,750
Is it a respectable enterprise?

174
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, in shrimp.

175
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,250
Shrimp?

176
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,916
Did I say shrimp?
I meant, "I like shrimp!"

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,458
Ugh, where's this going?

178
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:43,166
But you know what tastes even
better? Mount Fuji Burgers!

179
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,416
Anyway, you were being nosey

180
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,791
about the money
in my bag, right?

181
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,291
I'm gonna use it
to build my empire

182
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,708
so that I never
have to work again

183
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,833
and you're jealous, aren'tcha?

184
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,083
Not at all.

Come on. You gotta
live an honest life, kid.

186
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,416
I really couldn't care
less about being rich.

187
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,625
And I'm not a kid.

188
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,958
I'm just tired of being bored.

189
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,500
Uh--

190
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,875
All I want is to finally find
something that interests me.

191
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,125
You can't find anything
that interests you?

192
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,458
I'd like to direct your
attention toward these clouds.

193
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,875
"The little one just changed
shape! Oh, how interesting!"

196
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,833
I mean, I'm not seein'
the struggle here.

197
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,333
It's bigger than that.

198
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,708
The world is so predictable

199
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,208
and created with this
preestablished harmony.

200
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,375
We know everything that's
going to happen, so...

201
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,583
...we're always five steps
ahead, no matter what.

202

Even into the future.

203
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,250
There's no mystery to unravel
here. Nothing to explore.

204
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,416
You don't have to predict
the weather, we know.

205
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,250
It should take about a
year to analyze a genome,

206
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,291
but every bit of information
we could possibly want

207
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,000
can be instantly accessed
with a quantum computer.

208
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,750
It's a privilege to wonder,

209
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,458
but there are no
surprises anymore.

[ROBBY]
What world are you livin' in?

00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,333

I have many jobs.

and graduated from college

218

a long time ago.

to bring that up.

220
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,708
But I was bored in college, too.

221
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,000
They didn't teach me anything
I didn't already know.

Hey, you gotta admit,

00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,833
it was pretty stupid of
you to think that college

224
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,125
was about anything
other than partying.

Nothing.

I just have a pet peeve
about unnecessary chaos.

is also a snob.

were a snooty prudey

on the straight-and-narrow,

uninteresting, too.

00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,041
It wasn't an easy escape.

476
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,833
[groans] Yeah, and neither
are you, turns out.

477
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,958
Good news!

478
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,583
I've decided want
to go to Isekandar!

479
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,000
It's like you said before.

480
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,333
I have to stop driving
straight and hit some curves!

481
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,750
I said that?

482
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:43,875
Pardon me.

483
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,833
Will this ship make
it to Isekandar?

484
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,666
I mean, there's no reason
why it couldn't.

485
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,416
The best part is I have no idea
what's going to happen next!

486
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,250
It's all so unpredictable!

487
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,250
And I'm sharing my
first time with you!

488
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,583
You gotta go before I
throw up on my floor.

489
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,041
I guess I'll just have to
tell Yang how to find you.

490
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,333
You know what, kid?

491
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not fallin' for
your weak-ass threats,

492
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,583
so why don't you show yourself
out through the hatch, Hatchi.

493
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,083
Ikku, go open the hatch.

494
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,916
Actually, it may still be open.
That's the way I came in.

495
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Ha?

496
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,416
--[explosion]
--[BOTH gasp]

497
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,458
Whoa.

498
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,500
[ROBBY] That's gotta be the
tackiest, trashiest looking ship

499
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,541
I've ever seen!

500
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,083
--Mr. Yang.
--[ROBBY gasps]

501
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,500
He's very insistent on
getting what he wants.

502
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,500
He followed me all the
way out into space?

503
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,583
Hey! Second wave comin' in!

504
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,000
[ALL gasp]

505
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,916
[YANG]
Why are we going so slow?

506
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,125
Don't worry about
speed! Catch Robby!

507
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,583
[ALLO, GRAS]
Yes, Mr. Yang!

508
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:48,916
They're catching up!

509
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
Do something, Ikku!

510
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,791
--Will you shut up?
--[HATCHI, ROBBY gasp]

511
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,000
[BOTH yell, groan]

512
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:57,833
That hurt!

513
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:58,708
[HATCHI laughs]

514
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,666
Hey! What are you laughing at?

515
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,041
Why don't you tell us
what to do next,

516
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,583
Mr. "I'm so bored with
knowing everything."

517
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,458
There's nothing predictable
happening at all right now.

518
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,791
I don't know what's coming
next, and it's awesome!

519
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,375
[laughs]

520
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,750
Glad you find it hysterical,

521
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,083
but if they catch us,
we can't go to Isekandar.

522
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,625
Excuse me? We can't have that!

523
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,416
I regret nothing!

524
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,083
Blessed be our tractor beam!

525
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,125
That's what I'm screamin'
about. Let's reel 'em in!

526
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,625
How sweet it is to
call you mine, Robby.

527
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,833
Welcome.

528
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,166
[BOTH gasping]

529
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,083
[HATCHI]
Weightless?

530
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,666
What is goin' on in here?

531
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,583
[HATCHI]
Are those space fighters?

532
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,125
[ROBBY]
Looks like it.

533
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,166
You know you could've mentioned
that you had these earlier.

534
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,416
Like I'm hiding them from you!

535
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,416
I didn't know they
were down here!

536
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,833
Guess we both have
to deal with it now.

537
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,708
What do you mean by that?

538
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,416
[ROBBY] We're gonna break off
the tractor beam with these!

539
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,958
But that would be...

540
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,125
...unforeseen and quite
interesting. [grunts]

541
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,458
[ROBBY] Tell me you can
pilot these things.

542
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,041
Sure. I've got a hobby
fighter's license.

543
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,083
Well I can fly a commuter,
so it shouldn't be too hard.

544
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,125
Maybe.

545
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,375
Almost there. Won't be long now.

546
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,625
What? No!

547
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,500
Aw, yeah!

548
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,125
Hatchi, swing around from
the right, would ya?

549
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,458
Would you mind not giving
me orders ever, please?

550
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,125
I do what I want.

551
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,958
How'd they even
get those things?

552
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:35,791
Go after them!

553
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,000
Roger that.

554
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,458
Whoa! They're
shooting at us now?

555
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,500
Uh, are there any
weapons in here?

556
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,833
I dunno, but my
console's lighting up!

557
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,291
Huh? What's this?

558
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,583
Yeah, at this point,
we just gotta do it.

559
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,416
Right!

560
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,250
[ROBBY grunts]

561
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,500
[music playing]

562
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,166
The hell? Where's that
music coming from?

563
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,291
[music continues]

564
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,541
I hear it, too.

565
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,875
There appear to be
speakers in here.

566
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,541
I think mine's flying
on its own now!

567
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,625
It's completely automatic?

568
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:17,125
What in the world?
Are they out of their minds? 

569
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:37,833
Hey.

570
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,250
Okay...?

571
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:58,125
Hizakuriger!

572
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,416
They just merged with
each other! But why?

573
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,083
Did we... ya know?

574
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,375
Guess so.

575
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,583
But why did it
make me the bottom?!

576
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,500
[ROBBY] Next time,
"Truth Found From an Octopus."
