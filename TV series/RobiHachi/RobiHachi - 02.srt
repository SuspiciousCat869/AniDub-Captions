They merged with
each other. But why?

00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,208
Guess this doesn't
come with instructions.

00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,250
Any idea what we
do next, Bottom Boy?

Please don't call me
that, Mr. Top Heavy.

Hey, you mean
Mr. Top of the World

who's ruling you from above!

You don't have the authority,
much less the audacity,

to tell me what to do, mister!

I'd be bitter down there, too.

You're making it
worse for yourself.

If I leave, you would
be completely lost!

Dude, you wouldn't even
exist if it wasn't for me.

See, as the top half, I'm the
one who's got the brain.

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,166
Good luck getting around if
no one's controlling the legs!

19
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,708
You're right,
that is very important.

I do like to pee while
standing up! [laughs]

what to do, Tank-Face!

It doesn't matter if
you're top or bottom.

You have the same job!

Quit screaming and shut
down the tractor beam!

Yeah, that's what we were doing

Aw yeah! Nicely
done, Bottom Boy!

they could reach,

salad even mean?

fact that you made it back.

It, uh, was my old man's.

I took it from our shed
when I ran away from home.

under construction for a while,

How is that possible?

All the way to the fourth
planet of the solar system.

You mean Mars?

That's like Earth's

Oh, wow! Look at that!

128
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,583
I never thought I'd
get to see Mars!

00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,916

I'll think of you every time
I look down at my crotch.

Nice try. I'm not
going anywhere.

[ROBBY gasps]

135
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,083
You still have a debt to
pay, or did you forget?

136
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,583
Look, I'm going to Isekandar
to become a millionaire,

137
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,208
and when I do,
I'll pay things back.

138

Great! I'll be right
here to collect it!

139
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,750
I didn't borrow
the money from you,

140
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,541
so go tell your boss that I'll
be paying him back directly.

141

Hey, we're gonna keep going
when Hatchi jumps out!

142
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,250
Wow, that's incredible. Where'd
you get the fuel for that?

143
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,500
You should have this thing
serviced while you're here.

144
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,458
If you haven't flown it in over
12 years, it's probably due.

145
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,041
Oh, so now you're a mechanic?

146
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,291
Where do you even think I can
take it to get tuned up on Mars?

147
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,958
Doesn't matter.
It's a horrible idea.

148
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,416
I don't want some

How gullible are you, exactly?

153
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,958
You know those Martians
are fictional characters

a long time ago, right?

00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,916
No they're not!
Look it up on the internet

Mars looks the way
it does to you now

345
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,500
because it's been terraformed
by advanced technology.

an inhospitable world full of

endless deserts and temperatures
averaging negative 65 degrees.

with a human on it
from a gift shop!

468
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,000
Papa.

469
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,833
Don't you want the universe to
know the true beauty of Mars?

470
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,083
That's ridiculous!

471
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,708
If this gets out,
it will be the end of us!

472
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,916
Is that what you want?

473
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,250
[HATCHI]
It's already out.

474
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,250
[gasps]

475
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,583
Guess that's the
magic of live TV.

476
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,666
[TAKOKAWAINA screams]
Turn it off!

477
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,666
Why are you still shooting this?

478
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,375
[sighs] It's already done.

479
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,333
My life is over.

480
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,250
Uh?

481
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,500
[ROBBY]
What have we learned?

482
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,333
Covering up the truth by
pretending to be someone

483
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,833
you're not is what awkward
losers and criminals do,

484
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,041
and uses a whole lot of
brain cells that you need.

485
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,250
This is freakin' Mars!

486
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,416
There's enough here
to brag about

487
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,041
without making it some
tentacle paradise.

488
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,041
Like your daughter,
for instance.

489
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,750
You should never ever cover up
a sweet, sweet snack like that

490
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,875
with some creepy octopus suit.

491
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,041
[gasps]

492
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,916
[TAKOKAWAINA]
No! We can't!

493
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,750
No one will know we're Martians
if we're not octopuses!

494
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,250
The real Martian...
was always inside.

495
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,791
The real Martian is just me?

496
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,625
That's who people want
to see, not some mask.

497
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,875
I should show the
people who I really am.

498
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,625
Just being yourself
is more than enough.

499
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,750
Just being myself
is more than enough.

500
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,291
There's nothing to be afraid of.

501
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,916
There's nothing to be afraid of.

502
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,083
[TAKOKAWAINA]
I've never felt more beautiful.

503
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,750
And it was all because
of my pep talk!

504
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,291
I was like, "Dude,
they can't love you

505
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,291
until you love yourself,"
like a freakin' yogi!

506
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,708
Glad you're amused
with yourself.

507
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,375
But do you think
they're gonna be okay now

508
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,041
without the octo-stuff?

509
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,583
[ROBBY] Hell yeah!
They've got a bunch of hotties

510
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,833
and regular Martians
running around

511
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,875
instead of octo-whatevers now.

512
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,833
Wait! Why the hell are
you still standing here?

513
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,750
What do you mean, "why"?
Because I haven't left yet.

514
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,166
Huh?

515
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,500
Heh. Robby knew he was
aboard with us the whole time

516
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,625
when we blasted off.

517
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,916
He's just tryin' to look cool.

518
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,458
Don't you remember
how we got here?

519
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,166
I paid for your ship
to be serviced.

520
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,916
[ROBBY groans] Fine. I guess
I owe you one more trip.

521
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,875
Sounds great.

522
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,041
I can't wait to see Isekandar!

523
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,416
Mr. Yang, look!
We made it to Haccone!

524
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,041
It's time to get
our hot spring on!

525
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,625
--[ALLO yells]
--What just died?

526
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,625
Some major news just
hit the internet!

527
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,500
Well put it on the big screen!

528
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,833
[ALLO] They discovered
Martians aren't octopuses?!

529
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,125
[YANG]
Huh?

530
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,125
Are you serious? That is
not 'big screen' news!

531
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,500
Yes it is!

532
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,250
It means they've been lying
to us this whole time!

533
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,125
[YANG]
Oh, this is a tremendous gift!

534
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,958
Take a closer look
at that photograph.

535
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,708
[ALLO, GRAS gasp]

536
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,166
You can run, but you can't hide.

537
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,041
Buckle up, boys!
We're makin' a U-turn!

538
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,500
[ALLO, GRAS whine]

539
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,041
[GRAS]
But what about the hot springs?

540
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,958
Mr. Yang, you promised!

541
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,583
[YANG]
I take it back!

542
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,875
Robby! There's something
huge we have to discuss!

543
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,333
[ROBBY] I know, I know,
it's impressive, right?

544
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,708
[HATCHI]
That's not what I meant!

545
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,416
[ROBBY]
This better come with a massage.

546
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,541
Shut up and take a look at this.

547
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,125
Ooh, a robot anime.

548
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,333
Dude, you pulled me out of
the shower for this crap?

549
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,041
Look again. It's not
just any robot.

550
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,708
It's ours, but in a TV show
made half a century ago

551
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,958
with cel animation.

552
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,791
Galaxy Traveler Hizakuriger.
