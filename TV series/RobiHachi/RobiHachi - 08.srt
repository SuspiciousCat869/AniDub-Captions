Hoshiro!

469
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,208
How're your rails?

470
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,375
Did you bend them, yet?

471
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,333
Yeah!

472
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,041
You guys should get out of here.

473
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,125
Not everyone is gonna know that
robot is just a big metal suit.

474
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,708
[ROBBY] Yeah, you're right.
We're out!

475
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,916
[ROBBY]
Later, tater!

476
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,708
[HATCHI]
Be safe!

477
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,375
[HOSHIRO chuckles]

478
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,125
I can't believe they actually
started a revolution.

479
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,750
And it's all thanks
to you, right?

480
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,291
Huh?
What'd ya mean?

481
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,541
Finally.

482
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,416
The jamming's gone
and I can see again.

483
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,750
What a nightma--
Argh!

484
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,125
I dare you to try a stunt
like that again!

485
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,208
I swear I'll unplug every cord
in your body!

486
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,666
Oh, come on.

487
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,458
Robots were first created
for humans to help them

488
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,000
with their daily life.

489
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,625
Like partners, actually.

490
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,500
[IKKU] Then treat me like
a partner and stop ignoring me!

491
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,791
[HATCHI] Right! On to the next
stage station world!

492
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,708
[ROBBY] Good call. We gotta lose
Yang or he's gonna...

493
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,666
Wait, is he even behind us?

494
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,041
Hey!

495
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,750
Why are you fighting
on our side, mister?

496
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,291
[YANG] 'Cause I hate
those mech bastards.

497
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,916
[YANG]
Viva Revolution!

498
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,541
[ROBBY] Next time,
"The Family That

499
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,916
Sticks Together, Hizakuriger."
