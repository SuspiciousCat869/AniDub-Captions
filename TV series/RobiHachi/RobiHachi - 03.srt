00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,583
The gods should be led
by a planet, not a moon.

160
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,916
We motion that Monday
be renamed Plutoday!

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
[HATCHI]
The moon will never go for that.

162
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,000
[BOTH]
Make Monday done-day.

163
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,708
Start the week with Plutoday!

164
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,041
You're listening to the chanting
and singing

165
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,500
of Plutonian citizens
marching down Main Street.

166
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,708
[CITIZENS]
Tyurya, tyurya, tyurya!

167
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,458
And leave Tuesday as Tuesday,
that's A-okay...

168
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,791
Whoa!

169
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,416
Look how they're banding
together on this!

170
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,958
We've got your back!

171
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,166
The only ones involved
in this campaign are Plutonians,

172
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,833
but don't other planets
need to vote?

173
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,583
You're right.

174
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,791
You're exactly right!

[sighs]

176
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,333
Where the hell
did those jerks go now?

177
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,250
[CHIEF]
We know it won't be easy

178
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,916
to have our status
legally restored.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,041
That's why we're working
with a major ad agency

180
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,791
to help create
an effective campaign

181
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,291
and provide valuable advice.

182
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,458
That's who suggested
the mascots.

183
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,208
They said the
small-but-mighty attitude

184
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,791
of these ones
would be perfect for us.

185
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,083
So we immediately purchased
the rights for Mr. Pluto

186
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,583
and stepped
onto the battlefield.

187
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,875
Thankfully, he was on sale.

188
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,166
I'm guessing
you're talking about

189
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,416
a liquidation sale?

190
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,166
I'm glad Pluto encourages
repurposing.

191
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,375
Even that one?

192
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,166
They said if we
purchased immediately,

193
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,708
we could have Denshi
at no extra charge.

194
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,041
[ROBBY]
Ooh, what a bargain!

195
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,416
The agency said Pluto needed

196
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,166
to have its own
unique flair and cuisine

197
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,958
to attract tourists
and advised us to create

198
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,041
a signature shaved-ice dessert
using genuine Plutonian ice

199
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,833
that can't be found
on other planets.

200
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,708
[ROBBY] Shaved ice?
But it's freezing here!

201
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,875
Does anyone buy it?

202
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,416
-They don't.
-Cool, good talk.

203
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,583
[HATCHI] Hmm.

204
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,125
Do you remember
what flavor the green one is?

205
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,291
Whoa! Oh, hey, it's nitrogen!

206
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,375
You might want to add some fruit
or something to this.

207
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,375
-It's for more mature palettes.
-You're right.

208
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,625
We just wanted
to do exactly

209
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,000
what the PR department
instructed

210
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,583
to produce
the best possible results.

211
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,208
But so far, nothing has changed.

212
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,125
[ROBBY]
No? You're kidding?

213
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,416
Letting an ad agency tell you
how to run your planetoid

214
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,958
by purchasing expired merch
wasn't the answer after all?

215
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,166
Can't believe they sold you
tired-ass Mr. Pluto!

216
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,375
How was that gonna work?

isn't even rare!

218
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,708
-I told you.
-Papa.

219
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,833
So, did you guys capture us

220
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,166
because you wanted us
to see how badly you failed?

221
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,625
I saw how successful
you were with Mars.

222
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,750

Huh?

223
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,958
And the truth is...

224

The real Martian was inside.

00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,208
Oh, yeah, they filmed it.

226
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,750
After watching that broadcast,

227
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,791
it finally clicked.

-[HATCHI] Hmm?
-[ROBBY] Uh...

229

We had to make Pluto
a planet again.

00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,250
We had to take Monday away
from that moon.

231

to take over!

his own life, much less yours.

to Isekandar

to try to change
his crap luck.

239
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,791
Then why did you agree
to do the Martian TV show

as if you were available?

people take advantage of you.

00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,041
Let's go.
I've got a few words

254
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,875
to say to
a certain ad agency.

255
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,166
Aah! All right!

256
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,833
[BOTH]
Thank you from the Plutonians!

257
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,208
[ROBBY] What you gotta do is
look at what makes Pluto Pluto

258
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,083
and then crank
it up to like a seven.

259
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,666
So, like, what would you say
Pluto's best qualities are?

260
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,875
-There's none.
-I'd say dreams and romance.

261
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,625
Pluto is a planet that inspires

262
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,458
dreams and romance
for all who come to visit.

263
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,750
[ROBBY]
How's that?

264
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,833
According to what
our ad agency told us,

265
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,833
ex-planet Pluto
is known for being

266
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,666
the most remote
planet-ish outpost.

267
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,500
And I mean
in the entire solar system.

268
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,000
This is where battleships and
railway trains take a break.

269
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,041
Screw that.
We should be targeting visitors

270
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,541
with a [bleep] Memorial Hall.

271
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,958
That was a good idea.
Whatever happened to it?

272
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,750
Nothing! They always say
the plans are almost ready

273
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,250
and we should be patient.

274
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,708
You gotta forget everything

275
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,375
this ad agency
is telling you.

276
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,500
The key to strong
tourist attractions

277
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,708
is whether or not
they appeal to the ladies.

278
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,666
Mostly the twenty
to thirty-four demo.

279
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,500
And that schmemorial
or whatever it is

280
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,791

fluffy Plutonian creatures

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,416
that can be grouped together

284
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,416
-That's good!
-Like Plutonian pandas

285
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,458
or even the black
and white pandas that are lost?

00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,041
Why just pandas?

Doesn't really matter what it is

as long as it's
cute enough to capture

Speaking of hearts,
that reminds me.

301
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,750
When we were landing, we saw
a heart-shaped something.

302
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,708
I wanted to ask you about it.

303
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,666
Uh, yes, you saw
the Tombaugh Regio.

304
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,041
[ROBBY]
Wow!

305
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,625
Yep, that's a heart!

306
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,375
That's totally something
that girls would flip out about.

307
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,666
Especially if you tell them

308
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,375
it's some kind
of matchmaking power spot

309
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,916
where they'll meet
their soulmate.

310
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,833
"And that's why Pluto's
the planet of love."

311
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,708
Unfortunately, it's just
an ice field

312
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,041
that happens
to be shaped like that.

313
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,708
I guess it depends
on where you're positioned.

314
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't see a heart
