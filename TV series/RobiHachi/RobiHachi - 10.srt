and drowned!

157
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,500
[chuckles] Dropping the kids off
at the pool?

158
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,458
Shut up! I wasn't doing that!
I was going number one.

159
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,500
[ROBBY] Stop the spacecar.
You're making it worse.

160
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,875
-You pee sitting down?
-[HATCHI] Yes.

161
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,291
Because I'm not
some savage animal

162
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,000
who sprays all over the seat
and then leaves it

163
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,666
for someone else
to clean up like you do!

164
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,375
[ROBBY] Don't even.
I have excellent aim,

165
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,500
thank you very much!

166
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,458
[sighs]

167
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,708
Oh, and how do you explain this?

168
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,458
Oh! I've been looking
everywhere for that!

169
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,833
-Thanks! Where did you find it?
-It was under my bed.

170
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,500
That's not all.
I found this.

171
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,458
And this.

172
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,916
And a full-on library!

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,416
Any idea how these things
ended up in my room?

174
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,083
I missed you so much!

175
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,250
You smell so good!

176
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,916
Promise you'll never
leave me again!

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,958
This is no time
for a pervy reunion!

178
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,875
This is about how every time
I roll over in bed,

179
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,250
another questionable item
is staring me in the face!

180
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,416
You know, once upon a time,
that room was my much-needed

181
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,708
and utilized storage closet

182
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,583
where I kept
many choice treasures.

183
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,125
But because of some
unexpected force,

184
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,500
I made it into a bedroom.

185
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,708
So maybe you should try
a little gratitude!

186
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,166
Seriously?
Who can sleep in there?

187
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,833
I don't know if these walls
are paper thin

188
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,333
or if you're part buffalo,

189
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,958
but your snoring could pull
a sloth out of a coma.

190
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,458
Might wanna go get
that checked out.

191
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,416
[ROBBY] I can't help
what I do in my sleep!

192
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,750
And that's not all you do!

193
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,791
[loud snoring]

194
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,875
[grumbling]

195
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,916
-[snoring stops]
-Huh?

196
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,916

00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,375
[grumbles]

198
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,041
I keep thinking you're dying!

199
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,625
It sounds like
you're struggling to breathe!

200
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,208
Yeah, well, you sneeze
like a sick cat!

201
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,541
Ah. Ah.

202
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,625
Hmm?

203
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,458
Ah. Ah!

204
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,916
[softly]
Choo.

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,458
Does it really have to be
a production every time?

206
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,875
Just sneeze like
a normal person.

207
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:19,958
Who has time for that?

208
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,125
[HATCHI]
You know, we can leave

209
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,458
our bodily differences
out of this.

210
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,833
[ROBBY] Says the kid
who insulted my snoring.

211
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:24,875
[IKKU groans]

212
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,583
You can read, right?

213
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,416
That's my name.
Right there.

214
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,125
So why is it missing water?

215
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,750
This line shows the amount that
was in there when I put it away.

216
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,708
And look how much
is in there now!

217
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,708
[ROBBY]
I have an idea!

218
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,875
Quit drinking half the bottle

219
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,375
and stuffing it in the fridge!

220
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,958
Are you gonna burst
if you drink the whole thing?

221
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,708
I was trying to be economical!

222
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,916
[ROBBY] And what are you gonna
do with that extra water money?

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,625
-Can you maybe do anything else?
-[yelling continues]

224
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,375
I'm bored and you're both
really annoying.

225
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,958
Are these seriously
the only pajamas you own?

226
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,250
Well, now we know
what you can do

227
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,958
with those extra water funds,
don't we?

228
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,000
Can you not wash your crusty,
smelling socks with my clothes?

229
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,583
Uh, can you not wash my clothes

230
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,291
with the essence
of everyone's ex-mother-in-law?

231
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,500
Would you rather smell
like a thrice-worn sock?

232
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,583
How and where did you even buy
this flowery crap?

233
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,916
Space mail order.

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,208
C-O-D!

235
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,541
[ROBBY] You gotta be
frikkin' kidding me!

236
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,916
Did you order one of everything
in their inventory?

237
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,291
I ordered what I need.

238
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,875
I came here with just
the clothes on my back,

239
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,333
so I'm starting fresh.

240
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,875
Usually starting fresh means
starting from zero.

241
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,333
Pastel candles
rarely make the cut,

242
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,291
unless you're moving
into a temple or something.

243
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,375
Are you one of those dance-
in-the-smoke-and-chant types?

244
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,166
I just like candles, all right?

245
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,750
They're very soothing
to have around

246
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,083
when you've had a rough day.

247
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,166
[sighs]

248
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,208
So relaxing.

249
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,041
Man, the jets
in that bath are... Uh!

250
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,833
Hey, don't be sacrificing Ikku!

251
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,875
You're interrupting my bedtime
self-love and healing process!

252
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,666
You can love yourself in private
just like everyone else does!

253
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,166
It's not good to absorb
this much light

254
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,625
before going to sleep!
It inhibits melatonin!

255
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,416
That's the sleep hormone
you're supposed to stimulate

256
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,708
if you want to
wake up refreshed!

257
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,416
La la la la!
I don't want to hear

258
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,916
about you stimulating anything!

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,791
I sleep just fine with
or without light rituals!

260
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,666
[HATCHI] Guess what?
Not everything's about you!

261
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,666

Just stay out of my face
from now on.

Best idea you've ever had,

so why don't you do
the same for me?

Fine. As long as I'm

you wouldn't talk to me.

we're giving him the chance

[YANG grunting]

No need to rush.

because his name is
on the blacklist.

303

As long as he's in debt,
they won't let him through.

304
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,125
But I'm sure
they'll be sweet to him

over at the
Space Immigration Bureau.

306

So that's how we'll get him!

head over there later!
