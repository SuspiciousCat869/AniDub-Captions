going on here!

[OPERATORS scream]

00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,500
[TV REPORTER] Everyone is
excited about this week's

11
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,083
National Foundation Festival.

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,250
Preparation is coming
along nicely in Asteri,

13
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,000
where vendors began setting
up their stalls today.

14
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,625
Many already line the
streets to Nornil Square,

15
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,375
and the surrounding area is
abuzz with anticipation.

[YUI hums]

[TV REPORTER] And now, your
worldwide weather report.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,416
[TV REPORTER] First,
conditions across Enastoria:

19
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,541
The whole country seems to be
blessed with good weather today.

20
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,500

with some scattered clouds.,..

[sighs]

23
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,416
[YUI]
Good morning, Rena!

24
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,875
What's so good about it?

25
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,125
[YUI]
Uh?

26
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,458
Yui! I said I would take
care of breakfast today.

27
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,791
Class is starting back up,

28
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,833
so I wanted to make
something special.

29
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,541
I could have made
something special.

30
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,875
[RENA] You are good at
making breakfast, though.

31
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,208
[YUI]
Umm...

32
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,083
[RENA]
What?

33
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,416
[laughs] I haven't made tea yet.

34
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,416
Would you mind doing it for me?

35
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,625
[RENA]
Hmph.

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,666
I guess that'd be okay.

37
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,041
Thanks, Rena. You're the best!

38
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,291
Uh!

39
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,250
[RENA] It seems like your
break was pretty short, huh?

40
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,833
[YUI]
Yeah, just a week.

41
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,791
We'll be out before
noon today, though.

42
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,750
But I thought I
might stay behind.

43
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,625
Retty and I can spend some
time studying for exams.

44
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,166
I don't understand
why you would want

45
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,333
to spend your time with her.

46
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,791
[gasps]

47
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,875
[RENA clears throat] I don't
enjoy having Retsu around,

48
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,291
that's all. She insists
on patting me on my head

49
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,541
and ruffling my hair
every time I see her.

50
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,041
I hate it when she does that!

51
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,666
[YUI laughs]

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,416
That's her way of
showing she likes you.

53
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,208
She always treats me like
a snot-nosed little kid.

54
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,416
Never mind that I'm
actually the big sister.

55
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,416

Yui! Rena! I'm coming in.

57
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,458
[gasps] Good morning!

58
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,583
Good morning, Aoi.

59
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,791
Morning...

60
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,916
Anyway, I just wanted to
give you a heads-up.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,666
It looks like we'll have
a couple extra hours

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,208
of free time this afternoon.

63
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,916
Okay, thank you.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,583
No problem! Now, if you'll
excuse me, I've gotta go.

65
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,833
See ya!

66
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,958
[RENA] Too early for all
that running around.

67
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,208
She has a lot on her plate,

68
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,958
so you can't really
blame her, can you?

69
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,791
I'd say you have a bit more
on your plate than she does.

70
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,875
[YUI] I know! Now that
I've got some free time,

71
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,666
we can go on a sister date!

72
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,166
Let's go shopping!

73
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,541
And we can visit that café
you've been wanting to try.

74
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,083
It's okay.

75
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,375
You've been really busy, you
don't need to feel obligated.

76
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,958
I don't.

77
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,416
We haven't been able to spend
a lot of time together lately.

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,250
I just though that this might
be a good chance, you know.

79
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,250
Yeah, whatever.

80
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,625
Come on...

81
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,208
I'll think about it.

82
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,875
Well, that's good enough.
But I know it'll be fun!

83
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,083
All right, I'll see you later.

84
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,291
Okay, see you later.

00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,166
[YUI] Hey. I'm actually pretty
excited about our date.

86
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,916
Would you stop
calling it a date?

87
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,250
What?

my ring doesn't fit anymore.

I didn't actually see you that
time, so it has been a while.

remember? [laughs]

same thing to happen here.

came up, and I had to go.

have dinner together, then.

I'll let you cook.

I can do that either.

be able to come back.

It's a present from
your big sis.

to you myself, but...

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,125
I'll get this party
started without you!

162
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,041
[WORKERS screaming]

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,125
[gasps] What's happening?

164
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,625
There are innocent people here.
Let's go someplace else.

165
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,833
If we leave, then I'll
do what you're asking.

166
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,250
People? You really think I care?

167
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,375
Every last person in
this city could die,

168
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,958
and it still wouldn't
matter to me.

169
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,666
[gasps]

170
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,250
[RENA] Eternal executor,
knowing darkness.

171
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,041
And destroying darkness.

172
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,916
I now summon the endless
destruction that lies within me.

173
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,833
Fill me with your
unwavering fury,

174
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,791
unfathomable sacred relics.

175
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,583
[RENA] In the name of Erinius,
reveal yourself.

176
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,833
[RENA]
Magna Alecto.

177
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,541
[MORALES] Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

178
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:17,750
Goodbye, Yui.
I love you so much.

179

[MORALES chuckles]

183
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,541
[gasps] Rena.

184
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,250
Uh!

185
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,666
Rena! Wake up!

186
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,666
[crash]

187
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,541
How pathetic! That was
barely even a fight.

188
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,875
You better get outta my way.

189
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,291
You will cease and
desist at once.

190
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,916
Disarm and prepare yourself
for judgment and punishment.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,500
Why would I do that? Who the
hell do you think you are?

192
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,583
She's Yuinshiel Asteria.

193
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,125
Do you know where you are?
The Enastorian Empire.

194
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,000
In our country we don't tolerate
this kind of violence.

195
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,375
You really think I care about
what you'll "tolerate"?

196
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,041
Heh. That's the funniest thing
I've heard in a long time.

197
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,250
[MORALES laughs]

198
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,750
[MORALES] Look. I don't give a
damn about you or your country!

199
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,833
No!

200
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,875
[MORALES]
You can either run or die!

201
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,125
[RENA]
Yui. Yui.

202
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,166
You've always been so reckless.

203
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,791
What were you thinking,
coming after me?

204
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,000
I was thinking,

205
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,541
"Why would my big sister leave

206
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,416
and tell me that she didn't know
when she would be back?"

207
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,333
I'm sorry. I have to go.

208
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,666
It's not safe for me
to be here anymore.

209
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,833
[YUI] Because of what's
happening now?

210
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,666
[RENA]
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

211
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,958
I have another name
besides Rena.

212
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,041
Magna Alecto. It's been
such a long time,

213
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,625
I can hardly even remember it,

214
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:56,541
but I was selected to serve
as Magna Alecto's core.

215
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,958
[gasps]

216
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,291
[RENA] I'd hoped to stay
here with you forever,

217
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,333
but that was a ridiculous
dream. I'm not human.

218
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,000
It could never last, and I was
stupid to think it could!

219
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,750
[YUI]
Stop that!

220
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,125
So maybe we don't
share the same blood,

221
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:17,291
and maybe you aren't even human,
but none of that matters to me.

222
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:21,375
We're a family, and there's
nothing that could change that.

223
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,916
[YUI] If you'll let me, I would
like to be your strength.

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,791
Okay.

225
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,791
[MORALES groans]

226
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:52,791
[RENA] Yui. Don't be afraid.
I promise I'll protect you.

227
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:02,208
Lend me your strength,
and we can beat him.

228
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,208
No more playin' around!

[MORALES yells]

230
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,958
That's enough.
I'm done listening to you.

[MORALES grunting]

234
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,750
Give up now. It's over.

00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,791
[laughs] That's where
you're wrong!

236
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,125
This is just the beginning!
You and I are monsters.

237
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,375
We don't give up.

238
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,583
We fight until the other
one's ground into dust.

239
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,708
[YUI] You're wrong! It's true
that you may be a monster.

00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,500
But she's not.

[YUI]
Uh.

00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,833
By the name and
the will of Erinius.

Alecto shall pierce through.

Demonic spear, blazing red,
crafted by darkness.

It isn't over! I'm not
finished with you yet!

00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,125
Unleash Crimson Raid!

[COMMUNICATIONS 1A]
Two unknowns,

both of whom are
unaccounted for.

250

[TV REPORTER 1A] Just before
dawn today at 4:00 local time,

251
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,750
a large explosion
occurred in Asteri,

252
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,500
the capital of the
Enastorian Empire.

253

Uh...

00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,041
You know, when I left the café,

258
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,208
I thought I'd never
see you again.

259
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,750
I still haven't forgiven you for
blowing off our date today.

260
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,125
Hey!

261
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,875
You'd better think about how
you'll make it up to me.

262
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:33,625
[YUI] Oh, that's right!
Your gift. Can I open it?

00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,000
Sure.

Can't wait to see what it is!

Oh, my gosh.

266
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,666
I just figured that we could
both keep wearing them this way.

00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,500
So. Uh.

I think it's perfect.
Thank you so much!

Everything will be okay.

We've been through

you'll stay with me always.

Thank you for your patience.

The conference

word from the Empress.

we will accept some
of your questions.

Ladies and gentlemen,
