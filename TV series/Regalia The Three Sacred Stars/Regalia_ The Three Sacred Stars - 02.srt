00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:12,000
[YUI] Regarding yesterday's
events at Fostarosa Pier,

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,791
as yet, we know little
about those responsible,

3
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,958
but the government is conducting
a full investigation.

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,041
Though the pier was
badly damaged,

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,791
I'm relieved to report
there were no injuries.

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:27,333
And, above all,
no lives were lost.

7
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,583
Fellow citizens of Enastoria, I
know you must be feeling uneasy.

8
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,875
But I urge you to be brave
in the face of adversity,

9
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:38,125
and to continue going about
your daily lives as normal.

10
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,375
I am with you.

11
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,125
Together, we will carry on.

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,500
Let us stand united and
support one another

13
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,416
during these difficult times.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,791
We are a nation of
courage and compassion.

15
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:51,833
If we can hold fast to that, we
can maintain our peaceful lives.

16
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,625
[NARU] The Empress will
now answer questions

17
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,291
from the assembled press.

18
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,666
Your Royal Highness,

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,708
photographs from yesterday's
incident seem to suggest

20
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,541
a connection to the Fall
of Rimgarde 12 years ago.

21
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,916
Do you or your Cabinet
wish to comment?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,833
It's too soon to say.

23
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,750
But we are currently following
up on that possibility.

24
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,125
Would you support
taking military action

25
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,625
if these things came back?

26
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,541
[gasps]

27
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,833
[PRESS chattering]

28
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,500
[YUI] My personal beliefs
on conflict are well-known,

29
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,791
but have no place here.
If they harm this country

30
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,916
or any of its people,
we will respond in kind.

31
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,375
[NARU] Thank you. This concludes
today's press conference.

32
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,291
[JONNY]
Just a moment, Your Highness.

33
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,000
Our readers are dying to know:
what are your measurements?

34
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:38,541
[YUI gasping]

35
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:39,166
[AOI]
Huh?

36
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,208
[gasps]

37
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,000
[gasps]

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,583
[gasps]

39
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,625
[YUI clears throat]

40
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,000
I have nothing to
hide from my people.

41
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,583
[BOTH gasp]

42
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,625
[YUI] So, I will answer.
And my measurements are...

43
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,125
[sighs] I still get
so nervous every time

44
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,708
I have to speak to the press.

45
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,916
Why would you answer such
a personal question?

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,500
You didn't have to dignify
that with a response.

47
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,500
[YUI] I wanted to answer
every question I could

48
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,625
because I thought it would help.

49
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,750
[AOI] We know, but still.

50
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,833
It did help by
shifting focus away

51
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,125
from the incident quite nicely.
Even if you did have to reveal

52
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,291
our most closely
guarded secret to do it.

53
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,250
My measurements were classified?

54
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,208
--[AOI sighs]
--[NARU groans]

55
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,875
[ALL sigh]

56
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,041
I swear, Rena must have
the patience of a saint.

57
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,958
[YUI]
Why would you think that?

58
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,875
[MARGARET] In all seriousness,
Rena is the real issue.

59
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,041
The people are going to
demand concrete answers,

60
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,416
so we cannot just sweep
this under the rug.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,416
We need to come up with a plan.

62
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,625
Though the battle
produced no casualties,

63
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,375
damage was extensive.
Repairs could take months.

64
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,416
And we've no guarantee
that something like this

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,708
won't happen again.

66
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,041
[MARGARET]
He's right.

67
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,416
Rena herself said as much
during the debriefing.

68
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,541
I found something that
I think you need to see.

69
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,375
What're those?

70
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,333
[THEODORE] Photos taken
in the Kingdom of Rimgarde,

71
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,375
12 years ago.

72
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,833
[YUI]
When Rimgarde fell...

73
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,000
[AOI]
Without warning,

74
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,583
an unknown cataclysmic event,
rocked the kingdom.

75
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,333
[MARSHALL] Countries from around
the world, including ours,

76
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,375
mobilized troops
for rescue missions.

77
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,000
But we couldn't find a
single person to help.

78
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,916
The entire population
had vanished overnight.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,250
[THEODORE] These mysterious
giants, whatever they are,

80
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,041
were the only clue left behind.

81
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,583
[NARU] And one that was at
the pier today looks similar,

82
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,208
but we don't know for sure that
it's the same one from Rimgarde.

83
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,458
It is the same one.

84
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,541
[ALL]
Hm?

85
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,041
[AOI]
What? How can you be so sure?

86
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,083
Because that's a picture of me.

87
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,291
Huh?

88
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,375
That giant, it and I
are one in the same.

89
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,083
I was there that day.
I watched Rimgarde fall.

90
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,875
[gasps]

91
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,500
[RENA]
Regalia.

92
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,833
That was what they used
to call us. Long ago.

93
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,750
[gasping]

94
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,791
I have lived as you see me,
even before I came here,

95
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,333
but I have another form.

96
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,250
[MARGARET] So, the battle
earlier at Fosterosa Pier?

97
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,208
Yes. That was me fighting.

98
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,875
It was you?

99
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,500
[MARGARET]
And what of the other combatant?

100
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,375
Was that a Regalia
as well? Like you?

101
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,875
[RENA]
No, I don't think so.

102
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,208
It had a human pilot

103
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,375
who referred to it
as a "Regalia Gear."

104
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,333
An imitation perhaps.

105
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,500
Having a human pilot suggests
that it could be manmade,

106
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,416
and therefore this
attack on our country

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,958
was a deliberate
act of aggression.

108
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,458
I completely agree.

109
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,000
You're mistaken. His intent
was to take me away.

110
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,583
[AOI gasps]

111
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,250
[YUI gasping]

112
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:39,958
[MARSHALL]
Uh!

113
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,958
Why was he after you?

114
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:46,541
I wish I knew, but I'm sure
he won't be the last.

115
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,958
None of this would have
happened if it weren't for me.

116
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,041
I'm so sorry.

117
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,583
[YUI]
Rena...

118
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,375
To be honest, I'm having a
hard time processing this.

119
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,625
I can't quite wrap my
head around it either,

120
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,541
but difficult as it may be to
believe, Rena is a Regalia.

121
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,083
Yui was there, she
saw Rena transform.

122
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,416
[AOI]
But what's Rena's connection

123
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,750
to the Fall of Rimgarde?

124
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,916
[MARGARET] I'm not sure
what to make of that yet.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,875
Did the Dowager Empress
know what Rena is?

126
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,416
I don't know.

127
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,625
If she did, it's not something
she ever discussed with me.

128
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,916
I see.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,375
Your Highness, as Head of State

130
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,833
we need to know what are
your thoughts on this matter?

131
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,958
Rena is my big sister.

132
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,625
I trust her, and I don't care

133
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,500
what she is or why these
enemies might want her.

134
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,458
I won't let them take her away!

135
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,791
Are you sure of that?

136
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,708
Because if we were
to be attacked again,

137
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,333
we might not get off so easily.

138
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,791
[MARSHALL] The armed forces have
been placed on high alert--

139
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,583
[THEODORE] But if they
strike without warning,

140
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,500
like yesterday,
there's little we can do.

141
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,291
[NARU] Are you saying
there will be more damage,

142
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,583
or even deaths next time?

143
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,833
I've heard enough!

144
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,666
[ALL sigh]

145
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,333
If fighting is truly the
only option we have...

146
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,083
Clearly we aren't going to get
this all figured out today.

147
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,416
Let's adjourn for now
and reconvene tomorrow.

148
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,041
The Empress is tired.

149
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,416
[MARGARET] In the meantime,
nothing we've learned about Rena

150
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,625
or the Fall of Rimgarde
is to leave this room.

151
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,375
[THEODORE] Even if we
wanted to talk about it,

152
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,000
no one would believe us.

153
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,583
[MARGARET] We'll pick up where
we left off tomorrow afternoon.

154
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,541
That should give Yui
enough time to rest

155
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,875
and make her final decision.

156
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:27,166
Think carefully.
For your sake and ours.

157
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,000
[AOI]
Yui!

158
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,833
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
cut you off in there.

159
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,458
You just seemed like you
were struggling a bit.

160
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,791
[YUI]
It's all right.

161
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,500
If I had blurted out what
I was really thinking,

162
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,916
it might have been a bit
awkward for everyone.

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,166
Remember that we don't want

164
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,333
to make anything awkward
for you either.

165
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,166
Yeah. I know you don't.

166
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,666
[AOI] I can see how much
this is weighing on you.

167
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,333
Did you want to talk about it?

168
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:59,125
[YUI] Thank you for offering,
but I can handle it.

169
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,458
I'm Empress Yuinshiel Asteria,

170
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,500
ruler of the great
Enastorian Empire.

171
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,000
[DRIVER 2A]
This look like a good spot?

172
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,375
[SARA]
Yeah! Thanks!

173
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,666
[TIA]
We made it! That took forever.

174
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,416
I'm hungry. Let's eat!

175
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,125
[SARA]
Wait! We gotta make camp first!

176
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,583
Let's just set it up here!
Then, we can eat!

177
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,166
Okay!

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,958
I should go.
I shouldn't be here.

179
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,500
[YUI]
But why?

180
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:38,666
Because, it's only going to
cause more trouble if I stay.

181
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,291
It's okay. It'll all be okay.

182
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,375
[YUI] Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

183
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,458
No worries. I don't mind.
I'm always happy to see you.

184
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,416
Oh! But forget me. How are you?

185
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,125
Uh...

186
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,541
Yui...

187
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,291
[YUI]
What are you getting at?

188
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:16,916
You've got a bit of a problem,
my friend. See for yourself.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,166
[gasping]

190
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,250
[RETSU "All clothing and
underwear in Yui's size

191
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,791
is flying off store shelves.
Bras, it would seem,

192
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,916
are especially popular.
Even men are buying them."

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,375
I can't imagine why
they would be doing that.

194
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,000
Did your boobs get bigger?

195
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:32,875
Retty!

196
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,250
[RETSU laughs]

197
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,791
[RETSU] So, you want
to protect Renny.

198
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,875
She's your sister.
That's understandable.

199
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,041
But, as the Empress, you have
to consider your people, too.

200
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,333
[YUI]
What do you think I should do?

201
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,833
I don't know.

202
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,791
The only family you've got left
versus the whole country?

203
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,541
That's a tough one.

204
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,250
But wait, Renny's a person
like me, isn't she?

205
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,416
[gasps]

206
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,625
[RETSU] I mean,
she's one of your people,

207
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,000
just like anyone else.

208
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,750
That makes her part
of this country.

209
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,875
[YUI]
Uh!

210
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,375
[RETSU]
Right?

211
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeah, it does.

212
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,625
[RETSU]
There ya go!

213
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,916
Thanks! That actually
helped me a lot.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,666
I think you knew what
you wanted to do

215
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,458
long before you
asked my opinion.

216
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,333
[RETSU] But, if saying I
helped makes ya feel better,

217
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,666
that's fine by me. Gotta go.

218
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,916
Retty, wait a sec!

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,416
[RETSU]
Uh. [gasping]

220
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,833
[YUI] I love you. I'm so
happy you're my friend.

221
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,041
Please don't ever change.

222
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,916
Uh...

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,041
Yui. Run away with me!

224
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,125
[gasps]

225
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,250
[laughs] I kid! I kid!
It was a joke.

226
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,416
[YUI]
Are you crying?

227
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,541
[RETSU] But I'm late,
and you must be busy.

228
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,708
Bring Renny with you next time
you see me, okay? See ya later!

229
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,625
Sure. See ya...

230
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,000
Bye.

231
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,250
[INGRID]
Hello, Your Highness.

232
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,208
May I join you?

233
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,791
[INGRID] That was quite
an impressive battle.

234
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,166
Hard to believe it was your
first time in a Regalia.

235
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,000
I apologize for the amount
of collateral damage.

236
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,583
It was more than expected.

237
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,875
Causing harm to this country
was not our intent.

238
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,416
Who are you?

239
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,958
I am Ingrid, and we are enemies.
At least for the time being.

240
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,791
I'll get right to the point.

241
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,375
Hand over the Regalia,
and we can be friends.

242
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,541
We'll leave quietly and
never bother you again.

243
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,208
And, as your friends,

244
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,458
we'd no longer pose a
threat to your nation.

245
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,375
Simple really. Your choice
should be quite clear.

246
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,125
I'm not giving her to you.

247
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,750
[INGRID]
Is that so?

248
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,750
[YUI] Rena is a very special
person and I love her dearly.

249
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,958
[INGRID]
Person? That thing isn't human.

250
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,791
[gasps]

251
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,125
[YUI] Being a Regalia doesn't
make her any less my sister.

252
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,000
If that is what you wish
to believe, you may.

253
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,083
But, are you really
going to put its life

254
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,458
before the lives of
your beloved people?

255
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,041
[YUI]
Rena is one of my people,

256
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,583
and I must protect her
as I would any other.

257
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,791
I see.

258
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,125
I'm starting to get a sense

259
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,416
of just what kind of
leader you truly are.

260
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,458
Speaking with you has been
an honor, Empress Yuinshiel.

261
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,916
May you be able to maintain the
courage of your convictions.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,125
I'll be watching you.

263
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,083
Good day, Empress.

264
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,083
[JOHANN]
Hello there.

265
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,458
You're with her.

266
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,541
[JONNY] Forgive me for
my question yesterday

267
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,833
at the press conference.
It was, in poor taste.

268
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,375
But we couldn't have so
much focus on the Regalia.

269
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,375
That would be very bad.

270
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,541
I confess I was shocked
when you answered.

271
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,041
Who tells the world their
measurements?

272
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,958
Do you like having people
know the size of your chest?

273
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,083
[gasps]

274
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,041
Oh, my. You are so
cute when you blush!

275
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,333
Tell me who you are!

276
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,833
[JONNY]
Where are my manners?

277
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:37,166
I am Jonny Mabett, and this
is my assistant, Johann.

278
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,875
We'd like to invite
Your Highness

279
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,416
to a very special magic show.

280
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
It promises to be a
spectacle beyond belief!

281
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,333
But you won't be watching it.
You're the star.

282
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,750
[YUI gasps]

283
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,333
[JOHANN]
Heh. Ingrid is so sweet.

284
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,958
Telling you we didn't intend
to do so much damage.

285
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,041
[gasping]

286
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,666
[JONNY]
We'd hate for you to miss it.

287
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,583
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
performance.

288
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,291
[JOHANN] Don't forget to
bring that Regalia with you.

289
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,958
[JONNY]
Farewell.

290
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,166
[YUI] Rena! So what if
they threatened us.

291
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,791
We don't have to go!

292
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:22,083
They're just going to try
and take you away again!

293
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,500
It's not about me, Yui.

294
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,416
You're the Empress. Your people
need you, and they come first.

295
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,708
I know that!

296
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,500
But Rena, just because
I care about my people

297
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,958
doesn't mean I
stopped loving you!

298
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,500
Yui.

299
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:45,541
It's my choice. I shouldn't have
to lose anyone I care about.

300
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:49,083
Everything is going to be okay.

301
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,708
[MARGARET]
So these two approached you,

302
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,916
challenged you and
Rena to a fight,

303
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,708
then just vanished
into thin air?

304
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,583
That's correct, and like the
other time, they're after Rena.

305
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:02,041
It was very clear to me that
they would not negotiate.

306
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,208
We'll assemble a tactical
special forces team immediately.

307
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,416
They'll intercept them.

308
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you, General.

309
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,416
However, your men wouldn't stand
a chance against a Regalia Gear.

310
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,958
Then tell us what it
is you plan to do.

311
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,458
I'll face them myself!
Alongside Rena!

312
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't let you do that Yui!
Let me go in your place!

313
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,791
[YUI]
I'm sorry, but, no.

314
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,125
This is something I have
to do personally.

315
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,583
[AOI]
Yui...

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,416
I have a sacred duty
I must uphold,

317
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,041
and that is to
protect my people.

318
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,958
To put their needs
before my own.

319
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,750
But, if I were to let go
of Rena without a fight,

320
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,666
not only would I lose
someone precious to me,

321
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,041
I would fail.

322
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:49,458
I wouldn't be able to be
the leader Enastoria needs.

323
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,916
Margaret, everyone.

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,291
Please forgive me for
being selfish. I am sorry.

325
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,291
But this is what I must do,
and why I must do it.

326
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,958
I will do anything
to protect Yui.

327
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,833
Rena...

328
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,083
Thank you, Rena.

329
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,333
On behalf of the nation,
please keep our Empress safe.

330
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,333
Thank you. Thank you, all.

331
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,375
It's time to go.

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,833
[NARU] Do you believe that the
Empress made the right decision?

333
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,208
Yes. What if she had just
handed over her sister?

334
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:51,000
Could you serve a leader who
would do something like that?

335
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:55,041
But still, if something were to
happen to Yui, what then?

336
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,208
Perhaps this isn't
the right choice.

337
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,875
Nevertheless, a decision
has been made.

338
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,416
What's done is done.

339
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,541
Come what may, we stand
with our Empress.

340
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,583
We must be strong,
for Yui and Enastoria.

341
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,333
They need our support and
we will not let them down!

342
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,291
[JONNY]
That's it?

343
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,583
The Empress and the Regalia
really came all by themselves?

344
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,541
This country makes
no sense to me.

345
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,750
[JOHANN] Jonny and Johann
proudly present:

346
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,708
Attacks of Amazement!
So, step right up!

347
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,750
I have more questions for you.

348
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,666
But our follow-up interview
will have to wait!

349
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,833
Show time! Let the games begin!

350
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,875
I'm scared.

351
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,291
I'll protect you.
Everything's going to be okay.

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,166
[NARU]
That is Rena. It's all true!

353
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,208
Good.

354
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,083
Rapid response teams
are in position,

355
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,833
they're ready to
move on our signal.

356
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,541
Yui. Rena.

357
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,000
[JONNY] Are you brimming
with excitement?

358
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,916
Let's start with a little
sleight of hand.

359
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,208
Pick a card! Any card!

360
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,375
But watch out,
this deck cuts you!

361
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,291
[YUI gasping]

362
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,208
[JONNY] For my next trick,
pay close attention.

363
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,416
Hurry! Let's make our move.

364
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,125
[JONNY]
Don't blink! Or you'll miss it!

365
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,125
Where did I go?

366
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,375
We're not playing
hide and seek!

367
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:07,458
[JONNY] Ooh, you missed!
Better luck next time!

368
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,291
[JONNY] Look at my hand.
How many balls am I holding?

369
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,541
How 'bout now? And now? And now?

370
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,375
Fire balls!

371
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,208
[RENA grunts]

372
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,708
It's my turn!

373
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,666
[JONNY]
Ooh! Close! But no cigar.

374
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,916
Maybe you'd prefer
smoke and mirrors!

375
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,500
What? I don't see him!

376
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,833
[RENA]
There!

377
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,458
[JONNY] You may think some
of these are illusions,

378
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,125
but they're all real!

379
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,333
Now, Rena!

380
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,000
[yells]

381
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,416
[YUI]
Are they gone?

382
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,625
[RENA, YUI gasp]

383
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,541
[JONNY]
Now you see me...

384
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,791
[YUI, RENA groan]

385
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,875
[JONNY]
...now you don't!

386
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,416
[YUI, RENA gasping]

387
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,000
[JONNY whistles]
Over here.

388
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,125
[RENA panting]

389
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,791
Rena, are you sure you're okay?

390
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,583
Don't worry about me. I said
I'd protect you and I will!

391
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,625
[TIA]
More please! We're still hungry!

392
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,500
[RETSU]
Coming right up!

393
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,958
[TIA]
Hm?

394
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,666
[JONNY] Have you been
enjoying the show?

395
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,833
[JONNY] Because the
best is yet to come!

396
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,750
[JONNY] You are standing
within an Inescapable Box.

397
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,625
In exactly three minutes,
unless you find a way out,

398
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,458
the bomb will explode,
blowing you to pieces!

399
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:01,875
Can you do it, Empress?
Tick, tock! Tick, tock!

400
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,416
[JOHANN laughs]

401
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,000
The empress'll have to pull
off a major trick of her own,

402
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,916
or there's about
to be a big mess.
