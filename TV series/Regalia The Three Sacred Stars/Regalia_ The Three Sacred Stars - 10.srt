Come now, don't be so naïve.

163
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,166
Why would I tell you
the whole truth?

164
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,541
[gasps]

165
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,000
[JOHANN] Still, I guess
I should thank you, Ingrid.

166
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,416
Were it not for your
12 years of hard work,

167
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,750
my dream would never
have become a reality.

168
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,875
[growls]

169
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,625
[INGRID snarls]

170
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,416
[gasps]

171
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,250
[growls]

172
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,416
[chuckles]

173
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,625
[growls]

174
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,541
You have to try and
stay focused, Ingrid.

175
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,000
These aren't like the
Regalia Gear we've faced before.

176
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,166
[JOHANN]
She's right about that.

177
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,333
The old ones I gave to you are
pieces of junk

178
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,666
compared to these.

179
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,125
[KEI] If we just charge in,
the Gear will destroy us.

180
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,625
We need to work together
with Tia and Sara.

181
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,041
[JOHANN] You may have some
trouble getting their attention.

182
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,583
They seem to have
taken an interest in

183
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,416
another one of my puppets.

184
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,541
Something about this one
feels kinda familiar.

185
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,875
Big sister?

186
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,541
[JOHANN chuckles]

187
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,958
Wonderful. Happy family reunion.

188
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,083
Now it's about time
we started the show.

189
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,208
[snaps]

190
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,166
Lux Ex Machina is
starting to move. Look!

191
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,333
[gasps]

192
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,166
Oh, my god...

193
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,083
[JOHANN]
Breathtaking, isn't it?

194
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,291
[growls softly]

195
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,375
From up here you can
see the whole planet.

196
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,625
What better place to watch
the end of the world?

197
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,791
[RENA whimpers]

198
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,958
[TIA]
Sara, this is bad!

199
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,500
He's going to make
everyone disappear again!

200
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,541
I won't make them
vanish right away.

201
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,375
I thought we could
have a little fun first.

202
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,500
Now.

203
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,041
[gasps]
Yui!

204
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,250
[JOHANN] Little by little, I've
begun erasing people's memories.

205
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,791
Particularly their memories
of our dear, sweet empress.

206
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,541
She can't get
into her own castle!

207
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,333
That's awful...

208
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,916
[INGRID gasps]

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,125
[JOHANN] At this point even her
most precious, trusted friends

210
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,333
have forgotten her.

211
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,458
Retsu...

212
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,625
Not you, too!

213
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,291
[JOHANN]
Now, she's about to cry!

214
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,208
I almost feel sorry for her.

215
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,541
[growls]

216
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,958
[JOHANN]
All by herself...

217
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,166
Scared, confused, and without
a friend in the world.

218
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,208
She's lost everything
she ever loved or cared about.

219
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,166
She must be terribly lonely.
But what do I know?

220
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,041
I've got no soul and
don't care about anything.

221
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,333
[INGRID]
Johann!

222
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,250
I refuse to stand idly by
and allow you to torture Yui!

223
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,166
Go back to the void,
you monster!

224
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,666
[gasps]

225
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,083
Are you okay?!

226
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, no!

227
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,958
Sara, we have to help them!

228
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,041
Big sister...

229
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,458
[gasps]

230
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,791
[BOTH scream]

231
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:55,500
[JOHANN] Hah! You're the
only one left standing.

232
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,375
Batter up.

233
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,375
My little sister needs me.

234
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,875
And I'm going to protect her
no matter what!

235
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,625
[JOHANN]
Nice!

236
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,500
That's the ol' fighting spirit.

237
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,333
[RENA groans]

238
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,958
In the name of... Erinious!

239
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,833
Magna Alecto!

240
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,708
[laughs]

241
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:28,833
Well, that's no good.

242
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,583
[RENA whimpers]

243
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,916
[SARA grunts]
Rena!

244
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,208
[TIA]
Sara! Do something!

245
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,375
[grunts]
Get back! Get away!

246
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,000
[SARA]
Noa--listen, please.

247
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,833
If you're in there, help us!

248
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,000
Can she even hear us...?

249
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,500
[NOA]
Sara... Tia...

250
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,333
Run!

251
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,541
[BOTH gasp]

252
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,958
You have to get away!

253
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,000
[grunts]

254
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,500
[SARA]
What are you doing?!

255
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:20,333
[NOA]
Sara, Tia... Forgive me...

256
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,666
[SARA whimpers]

257
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,041
[NOA screams]

258
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,583
Don't make us leave you!

259
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,625
[JOHANN]
Bad Noa!

260
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,166
No more regaining
control of yourself.

261
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,166
[SARA]
I'm sorry, Yui. I feel terrible.

262
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,500
Here you were in
this awful situation

263
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,791
and there was nothing
we could do to help you.

264
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,791
It's okay

265
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,208
I'm sorry, too.

266
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,333
But I can't stop thinking about
that huge Regalia Gear,

267
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,583
and our sister trapped inside.

268
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,166
It was all very strange.

269
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,916
Noa should have been completely
swallowed up by Lux Ex Machina,

270
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,291
but somehow she wasn't.

271
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,208
What's wrong?

272
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,208
Were you very
lonely and scared?

273
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,916
Yeah, I was.

274
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,208
But... I'm not anymore
'cause you're here.

275
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,958
[BOTH gasp]

276
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,000
Thank you both so much
for coming back for me.

277
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,208
I can't tell you
how much it means.

278
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,333
[YUI] Don't worry. We will find
a way to reach the others.

279
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,333
But how?

280
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,958
Yeah. I can't fly.

281
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,250
I'm not sure yet,
but we'll figure it out.

282
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,750
I hope so.

283
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,625
We're stuck, but there are
some things we can do to help.

284
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,541
--Really?
--[TIA] Like what?

285
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,291
The three of us can
eat a hot meal,

286
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,250
and get a good night's rest.

287
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,750
[BOTH]
How will that help?

288
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,375
C'mon, Sara.
Don't you always feel happy

289
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,875
after you've eaten
a nice, hot meal?

290
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,000
[SARA] Mm-hmm! That's the
best part about eating.

291
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,666
And Tia, don't you always
feel your happiest

292
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,375
when you're sleeping
in a nice warm bed?

293
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,958
[TIA] Mm-hmm! I love
being under the covers!

294
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,916
[YUI] When you're
feeling sad and lost,

295
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,458
and you wallow
in those feelings,

296
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,458
they just keep getting
bigger and bigger.

297
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,166
You have to fight them
off with happiness

298
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,875
before they get too big.

299
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,958
Besides, if we want
to save the others,

300
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,750
we're going to need all
the stamina we can muster.

301
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,000
[BOTH]
Right!

302
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,333
[YUI]
I'm gonna roll up my sleeves

303
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,833
and make us
something scrumptious!

304
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,208
[SARA] I'll start
peeling the vegetables!

305
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,416
[TIA]
I'll help you!

306
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,458
[YUI] Let's cook up
a mouth-watering feast!

307
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,083
[SARA, TIA]
Yeah!

308
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,125
[TIA snores softly]

309
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,041
Hey, Yui, are you asleep?

310
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,500
No. Not yet.

311
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,916
Is there something
on your mind?

312
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,541
[whimpers]

313
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,708
Before he took us, while
you were passed out,

314
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,416
Johann said something. That you
and Rena were in bad shape.

315
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,291
If he's right, then pretty soon,

316
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,541
you're gonna end up
like Ryu and Lowe.

317
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,791
I see...

318
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,041
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't
have said anything,

319
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,041
but I'm afraid of losing you.

320
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,791
No, Sara. It's okay.
Thank you for telling me.

321
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,583
Try to get some rest.

322
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,791
[RENA] Yui's out there,
fighting all by herself.

323
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,000
But I know in my heart
she still believes in us.

324
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,291
[RENA]
Please. Help me save her.

325
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,541
Rena...

326
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,291
[SARA] Yui, be honest with me,
are you afraid to die?

327
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,750
Sara!

328
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,791
Of course I am.

329
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,375
Yesterday, I felt for the
first time how lonely it is

330
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,458
when everything you know
and love suddenly disappears.

331
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,500
[YUI] I want to go on
living with Rena.

332
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,375
I want to keep
serving my people.

333
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,125
There's still so much
I have to do.

334
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,416
Yui...

335
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,250
[YUI] But the first step
that I have to take

336
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,791
is just to be brave.

337
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,208
So I'm wearing the clothes
that give me confidence!

338
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,375
[gasps, giggles]

339
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,208
[SARA] Everyone who's made up
their mind to do something,

340
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,750
raise your hand!

341
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,875
Don't forget we wanna
save our sister, too!

342
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,625
But--are you sure it's
even possible to save her?

343
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,791
Why not? She helped us
escape, didn't she?

344
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,875
She must be in there somewhere!

345
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay, time to put
our game faces on!

346
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,083
[BOTH gasp, growl]

347
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,250
We'll do everything
we can. Together.

348
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,875
[BOTH laugh]

349
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,375
[YUI giggles, laughs]

350
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,458
[ALL laughing]

351
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,625
[sighing]

352
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,916
[gasps]

353
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,958
[SARA, TIA gasp]

354
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,416
It's her again?

355
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,000
[gasps]
