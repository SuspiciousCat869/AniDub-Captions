1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,291
Hey, are you gonna come or not?

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,541
[SARA]
Yeah, just a sec.

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,000
You're coming, too!

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,125
You sure it's not weird or
anything for me to be here?

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,458
Of course!

6
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,291
Sara and Tia specifically
asked me to invite you,

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,250
so don't worry about it.

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,500
And besides, it's been way
too long since you and I've

9
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,291
gotten the chance
to have a good chat.

10
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,250
[laughs] Oh! You little
sweetie pie!

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,375
Aw, come on, you're
embarrassing me!

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,791
[splash]

13
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,458
[gasps]

14
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,666
[TIA, SARA laugh]

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,666
[SARA]
You did it!

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,500
I told you not to push me!

17
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,416
[SARA, TIA]
Cannonball!

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,125
[RENA]
Hey, wait a minute!

19
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,041
[SARA, TIA laugh]

20
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,791
Weirdos.

21
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,250
I can't believe a soft, sweet
little marshmallow like you

22
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:02,291
can turn into a massive,
armored giant. It's crazy!

23
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,041
[SARA]
Hey, me, too! Lemme in there!

24
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,750
So, what in the world
are you guys, anyway?

25
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,083
[gasps]

26
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,458
We are Regalia!

27
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,208
[RETSU]
And what's that?

28
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,708
I have no idea!

29
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,208
Yep, we don't have a clue!

30
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,666
[RETSU]
Wait, what? You don't know?

31
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,333
Okay, well, what were you
doing before you came here?

32
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,166
We were out looking
for Rena and Kei!

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,958
Kei? Is it possible

34
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,166
there's another of these
little cuties out there?

35
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,416
Well, I... uh.

36
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,083
[TIA] Yeah! Kei's really
pretty and super sweet.

37
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,583
You should meet her someday.

38
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,666
Exactly how long did
you look for Rena?

39
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,458
For a long time!

40
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,958
Rena and Kei are the best at
hide and seek, aren't they?

41
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,541
[TIA]
Yeah!

42
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,750
I'd guess it was
about 2,000 years.

43
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,000
[gasps]

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,958
Well, you're adorable and
that's all that matters!

45
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:57,041
[SARA, TIA laugh]

46
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,583
[sighs]

47
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,500
[INGRID]
Let's go.

48
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:12,708
I think I could get used to this
kind of life pretty quickly.

49
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,625
Today has been so relaxing.

50
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,625
It makes last night
seem like a weird dream.

51
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,291
But it wasn't. All of
it actually happened.

52
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,500
It did.

53
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,250
[SARA] Hey! What've you two
been up to over here?

54
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,875
Aren't you gonna
get in the water?

55
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,666
We're just taking our time.

56
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,041
Trying to enjoy
the beautiful view!

57
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,166
There's a view?

58
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,250
[BOTH]
Uh?

59
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,125
Yeah, it's pretty.

60
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:47,416
But the world is full of fun
places to go and things to see!

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,750
Well, isn't it?

62
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,083
[SARA] Mm-hm! We saw some
really amazing things

63
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,791
when we were looking
for the others!

64
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,875
Could you tell us more about
the time you spent traveling?

65
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,208
[TIA, SARA]
Uh?

66
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,416
[MARGARET] Tisis. So,
we're looking at another

67
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Regalia and the
person bound to it?

68
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,083
That's right,

69
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,125
but according to the empress,
these two are not our enemies.

70
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,916
[BOTH]
Uh! Hi, Yui! [laugh]

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,541
I'm so glad you're here!

72
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,625
I can't get over how
huge your house is!

73
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,083
It's enormous!

74
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:27,041
Well, it's not actually my
house, you know. Not really.

75
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,625
I'm surprised at how comfortable
they are with her already.

76
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,833
There's a foreign official

77
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,666
requesting a meeting
with the Empress.

78
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,916
There always is.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,208
If we grant that type of
access to one country,

80
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,166
we may be setting a
precedent for others.

81
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,125
Well, to be fair, this
request is a bit unusual.

82
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,625
[THEODORE, AOI]
Hm?

83
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,291
[RETSU hums]

84
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,500
It's so incredible, it's
almost hard to believe.

85
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,625
You looked for Rena
for 2,000 years?

86
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,833
[TIA]
Mm-hm!

87
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,666
See, the secret is,
we never get any older!

88
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,000
[TIA]
Nope!

89
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,500
So, I guess we won't either.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,083
It's okay.

91
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,416
[RETSU] Sara, Tia!
Give me a hand in here!

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,833
[SARA, TIA]
Uh? Coming!

93
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,458
[YUI]
There you are.

94
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,583
[RENA]
I was lonely for a long time.

95
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,666
Uh.

96
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,291
I always wanted
to have a partner.

97
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,625
Tia had Sara,
but I never had anyone.

98
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,916
I just wanted someone around
who could keep me company,

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,083
and for the longest time,
it seemed like no matter

100
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,708
where I went or
how hard I looked,

101
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,333
I always ended up alone.

102
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,333
That's why meeting your mom
and dad meant so much to me.

103
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,666
It changed my life.

104
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:03,250
They made me feel like I
was part of a real family.

105
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,875
I used to think
that I was cursed.

106
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,250
Always wondering why I was
stuck inside this body.

107
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,625
But now, I'm incredibly
grateful to be a Regalia.

108
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,000
Because if I wasn't, then
we never would have met.

109
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,208
It's true.

110
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,625
[TIA]
Hey!

111
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,375
Dinner's ready,
so come and get it!,

112
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,500
[RENA]
You hungry?

113
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,041
[YUI]
Mm.

114
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,583
[phone vibrates]

115
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,333
[YUI]
Uh?

116
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,708
Hey, Aoi!

117
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,333
Yeah, we're just about to
have dinner. Why, what's up?

118
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,375
[gasps]

119
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,458
[RENA]
Uh?

120
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,791
[BOTH]
Uh!

121
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,666
[TIA]
What was that all about?

122
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,750
Apparently there's a
Regalia in another country

123
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,166
who's interested in
meeting with us.

124
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,666
[TIA]
Oh, wow! For real?!

125
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,916
[SARA]
Can we come, too?!

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,041
Is it that Kei person
you mentioned before?

127
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,875
It doesn't sound like it is.

128
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,416
[RETSU] Huh! So, there are
others out there besides her?

129
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,041
Yup. You bet!

130
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,666
But this is gonna
be the first time

131
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,916
we've gotten to meet one
besides Rena and Kei.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
[RETSU]
You traveled for 2,000 years

133
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,291
and never met a single one?

134
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,458
Wow, you're right.
That's so weird!

135
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,458
Totally!

136
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,458
Uh... Ha, ha... [sighs]

137
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,791
I've decided that I should
agree to the meeting.

138
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,791
[gasps]

139
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,916
Yay! We get to
make a new friend!

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,375
I love new friends!

141
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:21,333
So you're gonna take them
on an official state visit?

142
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,833
I'll give you the time off,

143
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,916
but you've still got a pretty
big tab, so you'll have to

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,291
put in some extra hours
when you get back, okay?

145
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,958
[SARA, TIA]
Aww.

146
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,958
Well, let's take
a seat, everyone.

147
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,291
If you're going on an adventure,

148
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,500
you should have a
proper send-off!

149
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,208
[SARA, TIA]
Wow!

150
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,708
These are some fancy eats!

151
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,208
It looks so delicious!

152
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,708
[RETSU] What? It's always fancy!
What're you talking about?

153
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,333
[SARA] Oh no, this is
definitely better!

154
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,666
[RETSU]
Hey!

155
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,833
[gasps]

156
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,750
[AOI] It's hard enough just
getting out of the palace.

157
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,500
I certainly never would've
thought we'd leave

158
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,291
the country at a time like this!

159
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,458
[YUI] I know, but it
can't be helped, Aoi.

160
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,166
[AOI]
No, of course. I understand.

161
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,500
It's my job to worry, remember?

162
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,125
I have no doubt you're making
the best decision for everyone.

163
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,583
This meeting could
give us answers

164
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,208
to some of the
questions we have.

165
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,916
Making contact with
another Regalia

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,625
is far too important an
opportunity to pass up.

167
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,916
Hey, is that it up there?

168
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,875
[AOI] All right,
looks like we're here.

169
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,750
[TALAQY] Welcome! We've been
looking forward to your arrival.

170
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,166
It is a pleasure to meet you.

171
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,000
I am Karim Al Talaqy,
the President of Afmaraldo.

172
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,250
Thank you.

173
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,875
It's a great honor to
meet you, Mr. President.

174
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,291
The honor is mine,
Your Highness.

175
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,875
Now, if you would
please come with me.

176
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,333
Of course!

177
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,166
[TALAQY] This area has been
revered as hallowed ground

178
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,125
for as long as anyone
can remember.

179
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,875
Our people have lived beside
them for many generations.

180
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,250
They're part of our history.

181
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,666
[YUI]
I'm sorry, "they"?

182
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,541
[TALAQY] I'm afraid I must ask
your aides to wait here.

183
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,083
Only those called by the
Regalia may go inside,

184
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,208
but I assure you,
there is nothing to fear.

185
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,541
Yes, I understand.

186
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,541
We'll be back soon.

187
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,791
I hope so.

188
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,666
Please be careful.

189
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,916
[SARA] This seems like
the kind of place

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,750
where a monster would live,
don't you think?

191
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,500
One with big fangs!

192
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,958
[TIA]
Ohh... Wow...

193
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,625
Incredible!
These are all Regalia?

194
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,416
[SARA]
Are they stuck like this?

195
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,000
[TIA]
Aww, I hope not.

196
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,583
[RENA]
Come on.

197
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,333
[YUI] You'd never guess
something so pretty

198
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,208
would be on the other
side of that cave!

199
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,375
[SARA] Whoa! That's crazy! I'm
gonna go and get a closer look!

200
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,250
[TIA]
Right behind ya!

201
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,750
[YUI] I'm feeling nervous and
excited at the same time.

202
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,916
I wonder what they'll be like.

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,166
Me too. I've never met
another one besides us.

204
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,500
So I don't know what to expect.

205
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,791
[SARA]
Hey! Hurry up you guys!

206
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,541
You gotta come check this out!

207
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,208
[TIA] I wonder if this
one is stuck, too?

208
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,375
[SARA, TIA scream]

209
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,791
[YUI]
Sara! Tia!

210
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,291
[RENA grunts]

211
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,041
[VOICE] You mustn't take them
by surprise like that, Lowe.

212
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,416
They're our welcome guests.

213
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,333
[ALL gasp]

214
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,250
[RYU]
My name is Ryu.

215
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,916
It's very good to meet you
at last, Regalia of Erinius.

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,916
[YUI]
Erinius...?

217
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,583
Oh, Lowe.

218
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,916
Can you believe we've
finally met them?

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,916
[RYU] Lowe is Enki's Regalia.
I am bound to them.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,958
[TIA] Whoa! We've never met
another Regalia before!

221
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:26,958
My name is Sara!

222
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,458
And I'm Tia!

223
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,375
I'm Rena Asteria. Hello.

224
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,541
Nice to meet you.

225
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,916
I'm Yui.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,791
Hello! Pleased to meet you.
I can hardly believe it!

227
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,875
[YUI] Oh. Is she a little
on the shy side?

228
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,750
Hi, Lowe!

229
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,208
[RYU laughs]
Sorry, Lowe is actually a man.

230
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,416
[YUI]
Huh?

231
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,166
As a matter of fact,
he and I are engaged.

232
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,541
[YUI] I'm so sorry!
I guess I just assumed!

233
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,083
[SARA, TIA]
Huh?

234
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,708
[SARA, TIA laughing]

235
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,375
[YUI]
This place is truly beautiful.

236
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,583
It's so tranquil and relaxing.

237
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,791
[RYU]
Thank you very much.

238
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,458
It's surprising, though.

239
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,750
You're surrounded by desert
as far as you can see,

240
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,500
but there's a bountiful
spring here.

241
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,583
That's because of the power
granted to Enki's Regalia.

242
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,125
[SARA, TIA laughing]

243
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,541
[RYU] Lowe can manifest the
blessing of water at any time,

244
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:22,125
no matter where he is.

245
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,791
People who are chosen as
the core of a Regalia,

246
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,375
and those bound to them, who
bring out their true power,

247
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,708
have brought great
blessings to mankind.

248
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,000
[RYU] Delivering the power
of the gods to this world.

249
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,958
That is what it means
to be a Regalia.

250
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,166
Does that include
Rena and the others?

251
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,500
[RYU]
Erinius.

252
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,333
Three Regalia whose
purpose it is

253
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:46,000
to channel the
power of revenge.

254
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,750
Why revenge?

255
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,458
[RYU]
You have to understand.

256
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,541
Erinius is a Regalia that
was created for combat.

257
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,083
[gasps]

258
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,541
There's a reason for
its massive power.

259
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,625
Because it was originally
intended to seal away

260
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,958
something very dangerous.

261
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,333
[YUI]
What?

262
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,791
It's called Lux Ex Machina.

263
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,541
[TIA, SARA]
Uh...? Uh?

264
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:19,833
[JOHAN] The same image,
over and over. How boring.

265
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,250
Hey, why don't we just go
and attack the castle?

266
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,333
You know that Tisis
is probably with them,

267
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,000
and Alecto's right
arm came back,

268
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,041
so I don't see why we can't
get the show on the road

269
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,250
instead of waiting around
here twiddling our thumbs.

270
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,500
I don't believe that they're
at the castle anymore.

271
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,208
How about if we throw a
little fit in the city, then?

272
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,833
That would make the soft-hearted
empress come running.

273
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,958
Don't worry your
pretty little head.

274
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,791
It'll be over in no time
at all with your Regalia.

275
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,125
[gasps]

276
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,333
[JOHAN] Oh, well,
if you don't want to go...

277
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,083
Binding darkness born in light,

278
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,000
arbiter of eternal truth...

279
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,333
[INGRID]
Stop that right now!

280
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,000
Whatever you want.

281
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,041
I'm going, though.

282
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,125
[JOHAN]
I've got a new Gear now.

283
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,416
You don't mind if I look
for her myself, do you?

284
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,500
What happened, Ingrid?

285
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,125
[RYU] Lux Ex Machina's
power was devastating.

286
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,458
It swallowed up my
family and friends.

287
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,125
It nearly destroyed
the entire world.

288
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,458
[gasping]

289
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,958
[RYU] Regalia from all across
the globe sought out its domain

290
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,208
in hopes of stopping it,

291
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,208
but their efforts came
to nothing in the end.

292
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,541
Not a single one who
went ever returned.

293
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,041
Lowe and I saved who we could
and brought them here.

294
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,666
Thankfully, Lux Ex Machina was
sealed away before it could

295
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,750
swallow everything, or none
of us would be here now.

296
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,750
Sealed by what?

297
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,500
[SARA, TIA]
Huh?

298
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,250
Mankind was able to find a
way to harness the power

299
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,708
of Erinius, the god of revenge.
They entrusted it to the last

300
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,958
three people who had been
accepted by the Regalia.

301
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:15,375
It was they who were sent
to seal away Lux Ex Machina.

302
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,916
They did. That was an
incredibly long time ago.

303
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,000
[RYU] And in all those years,
we hadn't felt the presence

304
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,916
of a single other Regalia.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,041
So, then, imagine
our surprise when

306
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,166
after waiting thousands of
years, we felt your power.

307
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,416
[BOTH gasp]

308
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,000
It must have been the
fight at Fostarosa Pier.

309
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,250
We immediately assumed that
it was Erinius' Regalia.

310
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,000
We pleaded with President Talaqy
to do everything in his power

311
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,541
to convince you to come
here and meet with us.

312
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,291
I know we should have come
to you, but, unfortunately

313
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,250
Lowe can't move anymore.

314
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,416
[YUI]
So, why did you wanna meet us?

315
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,041
To say I'm sorry that you've had

316
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,958
to carry this burden
on your own.

317
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,416
I know how difficult
it must be for you.

318
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,916
And I wanted to tell
you how grateful I am,

319
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,375
because if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be alive at all.

320
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,833
Thank you for fighting. Thank
you for being so courageous.

321
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,666
[TIA, SARA laugh]

322
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,583
[YUI] So, what about
all the others here?

323
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,333
[SARA]
Yeah, there are so many!

324
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,916
What's their story?
How come they don't move?

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,750
[TIA]
Are they sleeping?

326
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,208
[RYU]
No. They have left this world.

327
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:50,750
[TIA]
Huh?

328
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,708
I thought Regalia didn't die.

329
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,333
[RYU] They fulfilled their roles
and quietly slipped away,

330
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,875
just as we all do.

331
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,458
Even in their absence,
Lowe was happy to continue

332
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,166
providing water to the
place they left behind.

333
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,000
Sady, he has very
little power left.

334
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,416
He hasn't been able to
return to his original form

335
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,291
for a while now.

336
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,875
Does this mean the same thing
is gonna happen to us?

337
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,833
[RYU] We had always
hoped to revive this land

338
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,166
to its former lushness,

339
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,708
and we clung to that wish
for a very long time.

340
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,750
But unfortunately we
couldn't do it with

341
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,500
the limited power
that remained.

342
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,875
The people here are strong.

343
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,375
They love this land
passionately,

344
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,416
with all their hearts,
and would never leave it.

345
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,250
If Lowe has so
little power left,

346
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,125
don't you think you should
be conserving it?

347
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,666
This place is proof that
Regalia once lived.

348
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,875
Proof that we were
a part of this world.

349
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,458
Protecting this land and
watching over its people,

350
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,791
that has made Lowe and me
very happy over the years.

351
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,916
We plan to let the water keep
on flowing until we go the way

352
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,333
of the others and are
reunited with our friends.

353
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,666
Nurturing this land is
what brings happiness

354
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,166
to me and Lowe.

355
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,916
But everyone's path is unique,
as is everyone's journey.

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,458
[gasps]

357
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,750
So, to find your own
path in this world,

358
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,000
you must listen to your heart

359
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,166
and do whatever
feels right to you.

360
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,208
You have already
sacrificed so much

361
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,291
so that we could find
our happiness.

362
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:15,625
Now, we want you to find your
own. That's our final wish.

363
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,333
I want a piece of
that cuddle pie!

364
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:17,958
[TIA]
Yeah!

365
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,875
[TIA, SARA laugh]

366
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,916
Wow.

367
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,791
It's so beautiful!

368
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,291

[snores]

370
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,958
What is it?

371
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,375
I was just thinking I wish
I could see for myself

372
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,583
everything that happened
in Rimgarde that day.

373
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,833
Including all that
happened with you.

374
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,750
If I could do that, I feel like
I might be able to understand

375
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,625
what it is Ingrid's
trying accomplish.

376
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,208
We'll be landing in
Rimgarde shortly.

377
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,208
--Okay, thanks.

Hm?

Well, looky there, I found you!

383
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,291
[CAPTAIN 6A] What the hell
is traffic control doing?

384
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,583
[CO-PILOT 6A] They said it
just showed up on radar!

385
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,083
Someone tell me what's
going on here!

386
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,458
What does that warning mean?

387
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,958
It means that somebody
opened up the loading hatch!

388
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,833
[gasps] Seriously?

389
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,708
Do you really think
we should do this?

390
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,583
Don't worry, it's
gonna be just fine!

391
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,625
This is higher than
the diving board!

392
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,333
You sure?

393
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,958
It's our only choice!

394
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,208
Okay, then.

395
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,916
Are you two ready
to take the plunge?

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,625
[TIA]
Mm-hm!

397
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,916
We're at your service!

398
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,833
[JOHAN gasps]
Well, well.

399
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,208
This just keeps getting more
and more entertaining.
