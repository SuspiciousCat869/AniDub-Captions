00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,041
[GOVERNOR 4A]
National Foundation Day's

2
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,291
an important event,

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,958
and I'd agree that it
should be celebrated...

4
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,541
...but first would
you kindly tell us

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,666
what the hell's being
done about those giants?!

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,208
We governors haven't received
one useful scrap of information!

7
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,041
[GOVERNOR 4B] What's the
military prepared to do?

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,916
[GOVERNOR 4C] What is going on?
Well, Prime Minister?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,291
[MARGARET] I assure you that
each branch of our military

10
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,541
has been on full alert ever
since the second attack.

11
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,000
[GOVERNOR 4A]
Then I say we should begin

12
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,333
operations immediately!

13
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,583
[MARGARET]
At present,

14
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,666
there's simply no way to
predict their movements.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,583
That makes it impossible
for us to know

16
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,083
when or where they'll
appear again.

17
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,750
The army is preparing
for multiple situations.

18
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,666
The thing we must
prioritize above all else

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,958
is the safety of our citizens.

20
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,250
[KEI]
Hey. Ingrid, look.

21
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,500
Which do you like better?

22
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,583
[door opens]

23
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,083
Oh, Abel!

24
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,625
[ABEL] This place certainly
isn't very welcoming, is it?

25
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,708
I agree with you there.

26
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,083
Greetings, Princess.

27
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,833
[JOHAN]
Oh, good, we're all here.

28
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,458
I'm growing bored. Are we going
to get moving anytime soon?

29
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,708
Sitting around waiting is
not exactly my cup of tea.

30
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,291
[ABEL] Very well.
I'll see to it myself.

31
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,291
An excellent idea!

32
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,208
You know what humans
are like, though.

33
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,541
You may not come back from
this little meeting.

34
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,458
Yes, I'm aware of that.

35
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,541
Well, go right ahead.

36
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,875
I seem to have run out of
puppets to take along with me,

37
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,958
anyhow. So that will suit
me just fine. Thanks

38
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,583
I'm leaving this in
your hands.

39
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,375
I'll see that it's
done, Princess.

40
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,458
[KEI laughs]

41
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,416
I wish you the best
of luck, Abel!

42
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,041
Heh.

43
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,708
[YUI]
Please begin.

44
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,083
[NARU]
Okay.

45
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,333
[YUI]
So who is she?

46
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,750
[NARU]
We've verified her identity

47
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,083
as the First Princess of
Rimgarde. Ingrid Tiesto.

48
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,166
[THEODORE] Her vocal and
facial recognition data

49
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,458
are identical to the
time of the incident.

50
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,875
How remarkable. She
hasn't aged in 12 years.

51
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,125
If she's discovered
the fountain of youth,

52
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,666
I wish she'd share it with
the rest of the class.

53
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,291
Continue, please.

54
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,416
[THEODORE clears throat]
This man is

55
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,166
the Princess's long-time
personal military aide.

56
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,500
His name is Abel Lundestad.

57
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,083
[NARU] He's clearly aged
since his last picture.

58
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,458
[THEODORE] During the Fall of
Rimgarde, all Rimgardians,

59
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,750
including the princess,
disappeared without a trace.

60
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,833
[MARSHALL] At that time, the
commander was visiting us

61
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,958
to observe our
military exercises.

62
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,500
So he was spared.

63
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,666
However, after that day, he
vanished like the rest of them.

64
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,666
[YUI] But what do they
want with Rena?

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,000
We're looking into that now.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,166
I wonder if it's possible

67
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,208
they're connected to
the Regalia, as well.

68
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:20,500
The young girl is Kei.
She's a Regalia like me.

69
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,875
[gasps]

70
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:26,791
[RENA] I believe she
is bound to that woman.

71
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,625
The one called Ingrid,
princess of Rimgarde.

72
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,083
Really?

73
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,958
[phone rings]

74
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,291
Yes?

75
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,541
What?

76
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,916
It's Commander Lundestad!

77
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,833
[NARU]
He's currently under observation

78
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,333
by our military at
the Milanike Bridge.

79
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,458
It seems that he has a request.

80
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,708
The Commander is asking
for an immediate audience

81
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,875
with Empress Yuinshiel.

82
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:59,166
In this situation, I don't
believe I have a choice.

83
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,750
I'll go to him.

84
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,458
[THEODORE, MARSHALL gasp]

85
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,500
[gasps]

86
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,416
[MARGARET sighs]

87
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,500
It's the right thing to do.

88
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,750
[gasps]

89
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,541
[NARU] I'm not sure about this.
Did we make the right decision?

90
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,750
[MARSHALL]
Commander Lundestad

91
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,166
was part of the officer
exchange program.

92
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,666
He was dispatched to Enastoria
shortly after his appointment.

93
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,791
[gasps]

94
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,541
I don't believe he's
the type of man

95
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,708
who would do something cowardly.

96
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,208
[YUI]
I am Empress Yuinshiel Asteria.

97
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:00,166
[ABEL] And my name is Abel
Lundestad, Your Highness.

98
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,875
[ABEL] I want to thank
you for going along

99
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,250
with my rather unusual request.

100
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,166
I once had the pleasure of being
a resident of Enastoria.

101
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:19,041
[ABEL] It's beautiful.
Exactly as I remember it.

102
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,875
Thank you, I agree.

103
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,708
[ABEL] Be assured, I haven't
come to fight here today.

104
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,250
I have a favor to ask
of Your Highness.

105
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,583
And what is that?

106
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,750
[ABEL] I humbly request
that you hand the Regalia,

107
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,250
Rena, over to me.

108
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,333
[YUI]
But why?

109
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,208
I don't understand why
you're all after her.

110
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,500
[ABEL]
I'm terribly sorry,

111
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,083
but I'm afraid I can't
answer that at present.

112
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,208
[RENA] Uh! Why should
she do what you say

113
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,875
if you won't even
give her a reason?

114
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,458
Uh?

115
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,500
I cannot just hand
Rena over to you.

116
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,375
Yui...

117
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:57,125
[YUI] I have a duty to protect
everyone in this land.

118
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,583
[ABEL] But surely you must
realize, Your Highness,

119
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,291
that if you continue
to resist us,

120
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,750
your people will undoubtedly
suffer at some point.

121
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,708
What're you saying?

122
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,666
It's quite a heavy
responsibility you carry,

123
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,916
protecting your entire country.

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,375
I can only imagine how
much it must weigh on you.

125
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,416
[YUI]
Yes, of course it does.

126
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,333
But I am determined to
stand my ground on this!

127
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,541
[ABEL]
I admire your resolve.

128
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,708
However, I wonder if it's
wise for one young person

129
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:34,458
to try to shoulder that
burden all by herself.

130
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,625
[gasps]

131
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,083
It has truly been an honor to
converse with you here today,

132
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:45,291
Your Highness, but we shall meet
again soon on the battlefield.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,375
Wait a second!

134
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,916
How dare you make assumptions

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,541
when you have no idea
how strong she is?!

136
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,416
Yui's got more than
just her own resolve.

137
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,291
She also has me by her side!

138
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,625
And I won't just stand around
and let you harass her!

139
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,416
[ABEL] This isn't at all
about harassing the empress.

140
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,791
I'm sorry to say, you
understand nothing.

141
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,416
[RENA growls]
No, you don't understand!

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,958
I know exactly what needs
to happen, and I'll do it!

143
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,250
[YUI]
No!

144
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,375
Please don't do this!
I'm begging you!

145
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,875
I have no other choice!

146
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,500
Rena!

147
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,750
What's happening?

148
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,000
Please don't worry.

149
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,083
I'm gonna take care
of this right now.

150
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,750
If I don't it'll keep happening.
It's time to end it!

Whoops!

00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,583
Where do you think you're
going? You've got work to do!

we'll be back soon!

[YUI]
Rena!

160
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,875
[YUI]
Are you okay?

161
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,958
[ABEL]
Is this the best you can do?

162
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:03,000
[ABEL] What could you possibly
gain from this sad showing?

163
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,333
[YUI] Look at me!
Stay with me! Please!

164
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,458
[gasps]

165
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,333
[BOTH gasp]

166
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,291
[SARA] If you wanna mess
with Rena and Yui...

167
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,166
[TIA] ...you'll have to
get through us first!

168
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,458
[YUI] No, don't!
Stop this. Both of you!

169
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,916
But, Yui! We wanna help!

170
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,625
--[TIA] Uh! Uh-oh.
--[SARA] Whoopsie.

171
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,416
[ABEL] Is it your wish to
continue this boorish fight?

172
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,875
[gasps]

173
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,541
[YUI]
Big sis, please.

174
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,750
If you keep going, the city...

175
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,666
[ABEL] This intrusion has
dampened the mood.

176
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,625
So, I'll be leaving now.

177
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,208
Do ya think he's
talking about us?

178
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,958
[TIA]
Mm-hm!

179
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,625
[ABEL] If this is the
extent of your resolve,

180
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:20,291
then I'm afraid you'll be no
match for Ingrid, Your Highness.

181
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:35,041
[MARGARET] My goodness.
That's quite a report, Empress.

182
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,833
[AOI] I'm just so glad that
you're both back with us,

183
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,125
and safe.

184
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,625
[YUI]
Safe for now.

185
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,416
But I'm afraid that
I failed as a leader.

186
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,208
My purpose in this role
is to protect my people.

187
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,916
And If I can't effectively
fulfill that role, then,

188
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,625
I'm not worthy of
the title of Empress.

189
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,625
[MARGARET]
Is that all a leader does?

190
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,625
[gasps]

191
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,916
She's doing the
best that she can!

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,166
I'm only saying the Empress
should ask herself

193
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,000
if her role is truly
that limited.

194
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,541
[gasps]

195
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,083
[MARGARET]
Yuinshiel.

196
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,041
What does it mean to be Empress?

197
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,583
I'd encourage you to give
that some more thought.

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,291
[RENA gasps]

199
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,625
[YUI]
Rena!

200
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,125
You're looking for Yui,
aren't you?

201
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:57,416
Go away! You stay away
from her, do you hear me?

202
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:10,083
[RENA cries]
I'm so confused.

203
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,500
What's happening to me?

204
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,500
[JOHAN]
Why did you come back

205
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,708
if you haven't given
them a proper fight yet?

206
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,708
[ABEL] It was never my intention
to fight them today.

207
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,875
[JOHAN]
Oh?

208
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,416
[ABEL]
Besides, I've no interest

209
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,791
in beating an opponent when
they're in such a sorry state.

210
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,291
It's best to keep
things interesting.

211
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,958
Hold on a little longer.

212
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,791
Then I'll be able to
give you what you want.

213
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,875
I'll be patient, then.

214
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,000
Better be worth the wait.

215
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,750
[AOI] First we have
the memorial parade.

216
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,625
That's at ten
o'clock in Almorca.

217
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,333
Followed by a celebratory
event at one o'clock,

218
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,750
and then, at four,
in Nornil Square--

219
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,958
Yui, are you listening?

220
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,458
Oh.

221
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,333
Okay!

222
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,916
We're getting outta
here. Pronto!

223
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,166
[YUI]
Where're we going?

224
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,083
[AOI]
To let off some steam!

225
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,125
[RETSU] Here ya go, Renny.

226
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,625
You look a little down.
I hope everything's okay.

227
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,375
You just taking some
time to yourself?

228
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,583
Well, holler if you
need anything else.

229
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,458
[TIA] Will they be able
to fix the bridge?

230
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,458
We're really sorry we broke it.

231
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,291
Don't worry,
it's not your fault.

232
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:50,500
I'm the one to blame. Just me.

233
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,208
Wait, are you saying you didn't
come here to chew us out?

234
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,958
[RENA]
Uh? Mm! No, not at all!

235
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,125
Phew, good!

236
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah, good!

237
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,875
Now, then, tell us what's wrong.

238
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,416
I promised that I
would protect Yui.

239
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,208
But I couldn't
keep that promise.

240
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,583
It turned out I wasn't
strong enough.

241
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,291
You should really consider
allowing Yui to help you.

242
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,708
Uh!

243
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,583
[TIA] Yeah, totally! I'm always
getting help from Sara.

244
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,166
[BOTH]
Right?

245
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,333
[TIA] Why not try doing things
the way we do? It might work.

246
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,791
I'm not so sure.

247
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,250
[RENA]
It's just that...

248
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,375
[TIA, SARA]
Just what?

249
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,458
[RENA]
Gotta go.

250
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,875
Huh?

251
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,708
What about your cake?

252
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,083
You two can have it.

253
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,583
[TIA, SARA]
Yay!

254
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,541
Where'd she go?

255
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,666
[AOI] It's been a long time
since we've been here, huh?

256
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,125
[YUI]
Yeah, when I was little,

257
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,333
I remember you used to
bring me here a lot.

258
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,166
[AOI] Whenever you would get
that look on your face.

259
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,416
Uh.

260
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,875
[YUI] I was determined
to protect Rena.

261
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:12,375
To protect everyone in our
country, but I couldn't.

262
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,958
[AOI] Come on, I want
to show you something.

263
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,541
[AOI]
Go on. Take a look.

264
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,833
Uh?

265
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,666
[gasps]

266
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,041
Huh?

267
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,791
Hey, guys, look!

268
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,750
[WORKERS laugh]

269
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,375
Oh. Look, it's the Empress!

270
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,875
[gasps]

271
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,916
Hey, over here, Your Highness!

272
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,666
[laughs]

273
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,041
So glad she's here!

274
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,583
Yeah.

275
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,541
Seeing her smile like that makes
the hard work more worth it.

276
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,333
All right. How's that
for a morale boost?

277
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,458
[YUI]
Enastoria. I love this country.

278
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,916
I love every soul in it,
and I always will!

279
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Empress Yui paid us
a special visit!

280
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,166
So we gotta work extra hard!
Let's finish today!

281
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,750
You've got something there!

282
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,041
I'll call HQ and get a
mobility support bridge

283
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,916
and some AVLBs sent in!

284
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,625
Hey, you know that I
was just kidding, right?

285
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,125
[WORKER 4J]
Can't build a bridge in a day!

286
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,541
[WORKERS laugh]

287
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,083
[YUI]
No matter what happens,

288
00:19:56,166 --> 00:20:00,000
the people of Enastoria stay
optimistic and keep on smiling.

289
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,333
They're incredible.

290
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,958
[AOI] You're right.
It's easy to love them.

291
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,875
But sometimes... I feel
like I don't deserve them.

292
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:14,166
Don't you get it? You're the
reason we can keep going at all.

293
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,916
You've set that example.

294
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,333
We keep striving,
just like you do.

295
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,000
And keep our heads held high.

296
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,541
[YUI]
There you are.

297
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,750
Uh?

298
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,833
[RENA]
Hey.

299
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,083
[YUI]
I'm so sorry!

300
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,125
[RENA]
Uh?

301
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,875
I mean it. I'm always worried
about doing things "right."

302
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,791
I'm too timid. But I know
that I can do better.

303
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,166
I'll prove it to you, I swear!

304
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,166
I should be sorry!

305
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,708
I didn't think about
your feelings at all!

306
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,875
You made a pledge to
protect your people,

307
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,333
and I wouldn't let you
do anything to help.

308
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,666
[YUI]
Rena.

309
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,375
Let's go see Abel.

310
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,416
I believe we can face
him again together.

311
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,041
Unified. As one.

312
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,375
A proper team.

313
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,958
[RENA gasping]

314
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,833
[YUI] Except, I don't think the
two of us alone will be enough.

315

Huh?

316
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,291
So, I'm glad we can
count on all of you

317
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,375
to help us through
whatever comes our way.

319
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,083
Of course you can.

320
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,541
We're here. For both of you.

321
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,333
Thank you so much!

322
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,708
I have an unusual request.

323
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:59,208
It may take some work, but
I know you can handle it.

324
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,833
I am the Empress of Enastoria,

325
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,833
and there's something I
want my people to see.
