1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,916
Do you really think
we should do this?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,750
Don't worry, it's
gonna be just fine!

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,791
This is higher than
the diving board!

4
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:20,958
You sure?

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,666
It's our only choice!

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,791
Okay, then.

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,583
Are you two ready
to take the plunge?

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:26,291
[TIA]
Mm-hm!

9
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,541
We're at your service!

10
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:39,791
[gasps] Well, well. This just
keeps getting more entertaining.

11
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,416
So, we transformed.

12
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,708
Now what're we supposed to do?

13
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,250
[TIA, SARA laugh]

14
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,750
This is awesome!

15
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:30,041
[TIA] Spinning faster and
faster, this is the best ride!

16
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,541
[RENA sighs]

17
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,166
What's the big sigh for?

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,291
Alecto and Tisis
aren't able to fly.

19
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:35,958
Huh?!

20
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,708
[TIA, SARA laughing]

21
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,208
[YUI screams]

22
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,708
[RENA gasps]

23
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,875
[YUI]
Sara, are you okay?

24
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,083
[SARA]
Yeah. I'm fine.

25
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,208
[YUI]
Let's get back-to-back.

26
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,916
Then they won't be
able to surprise us.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,250
[SARA]
Good idea!

28
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,666
[TIA]
Uh! Ahh!

29
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,541
Big one coming in
at six o'clock!

30
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,291
Good. Face me.

31
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,208
If this was easy,
it wouldn't be fun.

32
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,583
[SARA grunts]
Get him, Yui!

33
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,708
[YUI grunting]

34
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,458
Hurry, try to get upright!

35
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,041
Yeah!

36
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,416
[RENA, YUI gasp]

37
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,375
[SARA, TIA scream]

38
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,083
We're gonna have
a rough landing.

39
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,833
[SARA, TIA scream]

40
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,041
[YUI screaming]

41
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,416
[RENA]
Are you okay?

42
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,666
[YUI] Yeah. What happened
to Tia and Sara?

43
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,333
[TIA coughing]

44
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,541
I thought we were
gonna die for sure.

45
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,833
Oh thank goodness they're safe.

46
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,083
I was so scared.

47
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:12,291
Tia! We're over here! Sara!

48
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,625
So this is what's
left of Rimgarde.

49
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,958
[TIA]
Why are we going in here?

50
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,500
We have to hide from
that Regalia Gear

51
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,875
that was attacking us.

52
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,791
Lay low. That's an absolutely
brilliant plan, Yui!

53
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,125
[SARA]
Whoa! Look at that billboard!

54
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,541
That's Ingrid, isn't it?

55
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,583
From back when she
was the princess?

56
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm pretty sure that's the same
place where we found Rena.

57
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,333
You remember, don't you?

58
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,791
[RENA exhales]

59
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,583
Let's keep moving.

60
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,041
Okay.

61
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,000
[SARA] It's freezing in here,
my feet hurt, and I'm hungry!

62
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,125
I know. But just
a little farther.

63
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,500
Is your tummy rumbling?
I know mine is.

64
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,916
[stomach growls]

65
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,375
[stomach growling]

66
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:12,875
[SARA gasps]

67
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:13,875
[YUI laughs]

68
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,083
Watch!

69
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:15,833
[RENA, SARA, YUI]
Hm?

70
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,541
Ta-dah. Food!

71
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,333
Wow! Snacks! Nice going Tia!

72
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,416
Lucky for us you're always
thinking with your stomach.

73
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
[RENA] Did you swipe
those from the plane?

74
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,916
Sure did!

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,125
Finders keepers!

76
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:29,958
Uh?

77
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:30,666
[YUI, SARA]
Uh?

78
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,708
[RENA]
Hm?

79
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,291
[TIA laughs]

80
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,958
[SARA]
No way!

81
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,166
Wanna check it out?

82
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,166
Yeah!

83
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,166
[MARGARET]
So you are certain

84
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,083
Yui and the others
landed safely?

85
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,750
[NARU] Yes. Infrared scanners
picked up four heat signatures.

86
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,166
Margaret, Yui did what
she did to protect us.

87
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,583
If she hadn't drawn their fire

88
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,791
it would have
destroyed the plane.

89
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,208
I understand that.

90
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,166
But you must rendezvous
with the Empress quickly.

91
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,500
Rimgarde is not safe.

92
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,000
[AOI]
Dammit!

93
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,125
Why didn't anyone think to put
parachutes on this thing?

94
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,333
[NARU]
And what if they had?

95
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,708
Would you really jump
out of this plane

96
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,166
right now and go after her?

97
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,291
Of course I would!
I'm worried sick!

98
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,208
Rimgarde has been
deserted for 12 years.

99
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,333
Nothing there works!
Yui lives in a castle.

100
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,791
She can't handle that!

101
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,291
[TIA]
Rena! Over here!

102
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,041
[SARA] Hurry up, Yui!
We need supplies.

103
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,666
Hm... I'll take one of
these, and one of these.

104
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,083
[TIA]
And this, and this, and this.

105
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,083
[YUI]
Huh...

106
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,000
[TIA]
Yui! Check this out!

107
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,125
Where are you, Tia?

108
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,041
Have you ever seen
one of these before?

109
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,500
Oh. Are those things tents too?

110
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,083
These are hanging cots for
sleeping on the side of a cliff.

111
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,458
Sara and I've used them a lot.

112
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:40,291
You two slept on cliffs?
Sounds fun. I wanna try!

113
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,625
Mm... Let's see.

114
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,750
U-Uh! How did you get up there?

115
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,375
[TIA laughs]

116
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,625
Yes. It's hilarious.

117
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:55,583
[coughs] Yui? Where did
you want to sleep?

118
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,541
I don't mind using
a dusty folding cot,

119
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,666
but is something like
that okay with you?

120
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,916
To be honest, I'm kinda
excited about it.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,625
This'll be my first
camp out, you know?

122
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,791
Actually, can we sleep
in there instead?

123
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,250
I've always wanted to
try sleeping in a tent!

124
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,291
Tents are the best!

125
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,375
Everyone can cuddle
up and get cozy!

126
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,708
Yeah!

127
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:19,125
Uh... Works for me.

128
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,916
[YUI] Wow! I've never cooked
over coals like this before.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,041
[SARA]
Oh yeah? Take a look at this.

130
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,833
Now we have high heat on one
side and low heat on the other.

131
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,333
Oh, so if you stir them,
you can adjust the heat.

132
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,916
Once you get a good fire going,
you can make anything.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,166
Here. Wanna try?

134
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,416
Sure. Let's get this
heat a little higher.

135
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,416
Ahh! Whoops!

136
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,291
[laughs] I think
that's hot enough.

137
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,125
[YUI] Okay. We should start
with the vegetables.

138
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,583
[SARA, TIA, YUI]
Bon Appétit!

139
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,500
[SARA, TIA]
Seconds please!

140
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,875
[SARA, TIA]
That was super yummy!

141
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,291
Camping out is really fun!

142
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,166
Yup! And food cooked over
a fire tastes better too!

143
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,541
It's the bestest ever!

144
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,708
[YUI laughs]

145
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,583
[RENA] We're not exactly
camping for real.

146
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,791
You're right. We're
not out in the wild.

147
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,750
[RENA]
Even so, I'm surprised.

148
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,250
I didn't think you'd be
into this kind of thing.

149
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,458
Why would you think that?

150
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,291
I've never gotten to
go camping before,

151
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,666
so it's new and exciting for me.

152
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,958
I'll bet.

153
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,375
Hey, when we get home, let's
do some real camping outside!

154
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,208
Yeah?

155
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,583
Sure! We could invite Retty,

156
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,708
and Sara and Tia could show
us how to do everything.

157
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,208
We'd be happy to.

158
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,958
We're experts. I can even
start a fire without matches.

159
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,125
What? How do you do that?

160
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,791
Well, you take a stick, and spin
it fast against a piece of wood.

161
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh! But I forgot to mention,
it's very important

162
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,083
the wood is dry.
This won't work if it's wet.

163
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,375
[YUI]
Okay. Then what?

164
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,083
[RENA]
Do you remember that place?

165
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,583
The plan is for all of us
to go there tomorrow.

166
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,708
Maybe it will trigger something
and my memory will come back.

167
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:57,166
[SARA, TIA snoring]

168
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,583
[TIA] Yui, the water's warm.
Come take a bath with me.

169
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,791
[TIA yelps]

170
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,791
[YUI]
This is it.

171
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,250
[RENA gasping]

172
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,666
That's Kei.

173
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,416
You're right, Sara. It is her!

174
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,666
Kei!

175
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,666
What did you do that for, Rena?

176
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,041
It's us.

177
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,291
Let's go.

178
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,041
[TIA]
We've missed you!

179
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,083
Can't you stop a second
and talk to us?

180
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,833
[SARA] We've been trying
to find you forever,

181
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,291
so a little hello would be nice!

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,625
[SARA, TIA]
Uh...?

183
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,916
[TIA]
Whoa...

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,041
What is this place?

185
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,125
[TIA]
I dunno!

186
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:59,708
[KEI laughs]

187
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,000
[TIA, SARA, YUI]
Uh?

188
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,708
I welcome you to the
Kingdom of Rimgarde.

189
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,625
What do you think?

190
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,833
Hello again, Ingrid.

191
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,083
[SARA]
That's the Princess of Rimgarde?

192
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,291
[TIA] Does this mean
she's bound to Kei?

193
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,083
I don't understand.

194
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,416
What happened here to
cause such a disaster?

195
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,333
Until 12 years ago, Rimgarde
was one of the world's

196
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,500
most technologically
advanced countries.

197
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,666
Our scientists had
long been investigating

198
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,583
a new type of energy,
but their research

199
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,083
hit a wall. Unable
to progress further,

200
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,583
the project ground to a halt.

201
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,541
[INGRID] Then, as if
by divine intervention,

202
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,291
someone appeared who had
expertise in the field.

203
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,041
He joined the team as an advisor

204
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,458
and soon got things
moving again.

205
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,666
The experiments he spearheaded
yielded incredible results.

206
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,083
However, trusting him ended
up being a deadly mistake.

207
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,500
[gasps]

208
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,875
[INGRID] It led to
The Fall of Rimgarde.

209
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,458
[BOTH gasp]

210
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,875
One person did that much damage?

211
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,333
[INGRID]
He deceived us.

212
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,458
He hadn't been furthering
our research.

213
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,541
Instead, he used Rimgarde
to revive an ancient power.

214
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,541
[RENA]
What ancient power?

215
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,541
Its name is Lux Ex Machina.

216
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,250
[ALL gasp]

217
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,125
[TIA]
But wait!

218
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,333
[YUI]
Lux was sealed away.

219
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:23,583
Yes. Erinius did indeed
fight Lux long ago.

220
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,166
The same Lux Ex Machina
that destroyed the world.

221
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,958
[RENA] So this scientist was
interested in Lux's power,

222
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,541
but you weren't?

223
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,083
[INGRID] That's right. Though
considering that I'm still here

224
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,708
while my country lies in ruins,

225
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,666
I can't blame you
for doubting me.

226
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,458
Unfortunately, once the truth
was discovered it was too late.

227
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,541
[YUI]
That doesn't make sense.

228
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,541
Uh?

229
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,083
Why are you doing all this?

230
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,583
If you don't want Lux revived,

231
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,833
why attack Enastoria
and try to take Rena?

232
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:47,958
And what about Kei?!

233
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,833
She's innocent!
Why's she involved?

234
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,750
She doesn't belong
to you anyway!

235
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,708
She's one of us and
we want her back!

236
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,333
Uh. Please?

237
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,000
I can explain.

238
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,458
[gasps]

239
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,791
[JOHANN]
There you are!

240
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,708
That was some fancy skydiving
stunt you pulled yesterday!

241
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:06,875
I know that voice!

242
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,125
Hey! It's the same one
that was after us!

243
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,541
Quit flying all over
the place! It's not fair!

[JOHANN]
Oh Ingrid, what a surprise.

245
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,708
I wasn't expecting to see you.

Everything's going to go down
right here, all over again!

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,833
Join the fun, Ingrid.
It's only fitting.

that dwells deep within me.

Unmask what lies beneath.

00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,291
[JOHANN]
Impressive little trap.

324
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,125
We're stuck!

325
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,416
[RENA]
They grabbed us!

326
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,000
[INGRID]
Stop struggling, Yuinshiel.

327
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,583
I have something
important to tell you,

328
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,833
and I need you to stay calm.

329
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,208
[YUI gasps]

330
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,541
[SARA yelling]

331
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,583
[JOHANN chuckles]

332
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,500
[INGRID]
Listen carefully.

333
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,791
With the three Regalia of
Erinius gathered together

334
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,000
in one place, we can
create a resonance.

335
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,958
[YUI]
What's that?

336
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,958
[INGRID] It's hard to describe,
but it could free Kei!

337
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,458
[gasps]

338
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,583
[JOHANN]
You caught them!

339
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,083
Keep holding onto
them just like that.

340
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,375
And don't let go.

341
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,416
[INGRID growls]

342
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,875
[exhales]

343
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:57,541
[JOHANN] Aw... Clumsy Ingrid,
you let them get away.

344
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,458
I'll do all I can to help you.
