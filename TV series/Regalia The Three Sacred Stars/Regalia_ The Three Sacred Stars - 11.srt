Don't worry, I'm fine.

That was a hard hit!
Are you okay?

00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,416
I am. Somehow.

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,250
We can't hold out much longer!

That all you've got?

C'mon, you've survived this
long. You can't give up now.

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,041
Noa?! How could you?

[gasps]
Who's that?

15
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,791
Tia and Sara's sister.
What is she doing...?

16
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,083
[gasps] Oh...

17
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,833
I think I might know.

00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,208
[NOA] You're the only ones left
around here for me to play with.

00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,250
Come on, why don't we
have some fun?

Johann...

21
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,291
[NOA] Oh! Was it
that obvious? [chuckles]

22
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,958
I guess you two have known
each other a long time.

23
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,000
[INGRID] You're not even
trying to hide it!

24
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,583
[NOA laughs]
Why would I?

25
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,458
I've been surprised
with this one.

26
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,333
You'll never believe
what she just did.

27
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,208
She broke away and saved Tisis.
She really is a naughty girl.

[gasps]

29
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,375
[NOA] So, I had
to make some changes.

30
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,583
You'll find she's tied
a bit tighter now.

31
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,750
There's no way she'll
be able to escape again.

32
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,583
What've you done to her?!

33
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,500
We'll be taking Noa
back from you. Now.

34
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,750
[NOA] I don't think
you can, my old friend.

35
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,083
It's funny to think
how we've spent

36
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,208
the past 12 years together.

37
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,916
I'll be looking back on all
those warm memories...

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,791

Huh. It doesn't matter.

Hey. If you're looking for
Alecto, it's over there, dying.

about that reflector!

[INGRID]
I wish that were possible,

we can manage it

Okay, girls.

Tell us where
you're keeping Noa!

Where is she?!

I've sent her on
a little mission.

[YUI] Don't worry
about us. We'll be fine

00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,500
[YUI] You guys need to go
and save Kei and Ingrid!

67
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,583
And find your
big sister, too.

In the name of Erinius--
reveal yourself!

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,583
You gotta stay alive!

00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,916
That was noble of you,
but very stupid.

85
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,458
[NOA] Let's begin
at the beginning.

86
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,666
How much do you know
about the Regalia?

87
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,416
They are divine vessels
which allow one

88
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,875
to access the otherworldly
power of Lux.

89
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:57,875
Kei!

90
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,333
All we can do is keep stalling

91
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,291
and look for some kind
of opportunity.

92
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,458
[NOA]
Correct.

93
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,250
But, you see, there was
always one problem

94
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:08,125
with those divine vessels.
And it's a big one.

95
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,750
In order for the Regalia
to accept Lux's power,

96
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,875
a sacrifice was necessary.

97
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,250
A sacrifice like you,
for example.

98
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,833
[BOTH gasp]

99
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,041
[NOA] Unfortunately, those who
were sacrificed were not able

100
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,041
to withstand Lux's
limitless power,

101
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:26,208
nor could they go back to being
human as they had been before.

102
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,583
They were destined
to fade away,

103
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,416
fixed in the form of the
monsters they had become.

104

[growls]

105
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,583
[YUI]
Rena! Please!

106
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,875
Answer me! Say something!

107
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,416
Please...

108
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,541
[JOHANN]
It's pointless.

109
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,083
[gasps]

110
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,708
Your sister will never go back
to her original form again.

111
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,625
That's her now.

112
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,250
[gasps]

113
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,958
It's all your fault, too.

114
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,083
[gasps]

115
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,083
Yeah, let it sink in. She's left
like this all because of you.

116
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,208
[whimpers]

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,541
So we're merely sacrifices
for the Regalia?

118
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,000
[NOA]
Exactly.

119
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,708
That's why humans tried
so hard to invent new ones.

120
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,416
So they could get rid
of that pesky little flaw.

121
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,208
A new divine receptacle,

122
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:49,125
one that would not
require a sacrifice. You see?

123
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,291
That was Lux Ex Machina.

124
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,166
[BOTH gasp]

125
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,416
[JOHANN] You protect Rena.
You protect your people.

126
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,000
You protect your country.
So noble.

127
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,791
You get high marks for
doing your duty as an empress.

128
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,208
But your sister...

129
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,166
She kept right on using
all of her power, didn't she?

130
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,291
[sighs softly]

131
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,333
Don't stop listening now,
there's more to tell.

00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,541
[gasps]

133
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,208
[JOHANN] You once
asked me whether or not

134
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,291
I had someone I cared
about. Remember?

135
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,416
Well, do you?

136
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,208
The answer to your
question is "yes."

137
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,875
Quite a few someones.

138
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,708
Every last soul on this
planet is mine now.

139
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,666
All of them are
my precious little dolls.

140
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,583
I don't understand why
you're doing all this.

141
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,333
[JOHANN chuckles]

142
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,083
[JOHANN]
Oh, no particular reason.

143
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,625
I just wanted to see the look on
your face when you realized

144
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,750
you'd lost every single
person that mattered to you.

145
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,708
They'll die soon,
Ingrid and the others.

146
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,416
[gasps]

147
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,125
[JOHANN] Everyone
you care about, Empress.

148
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,416
They all belong to me.

149
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
And as for you...

150
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,375
...you'll live in darkness.

151
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,791
You'll lose hope,
and you'll be alone forever...

You were talking about
Lux Ex Machina.

160
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,541
A new divine vessel that
was created by people.

Oh, nothing much really.

163
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,416
Just to demolish and remake
the world by stripping away

164
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,000
the souls of the entire
human population.

165
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,333
This brave new world
will be completely free

166
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,375
of aging and illness.

167
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,916
And the souls like Noa who
are taken by Lux Ex Machina

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
will all become my toys!

169
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,708
I have to admit, that's my very
favorite part of the plan.

170
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:47,833
No!

171
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,125
[SARA gasps]
Get out of Noa right now,

172
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,625
you evil, psycho lunatic!

173
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,875
Yeah, right now!

174
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,208
We're taking her and Rena,

175
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,250
and then we're all gonna go
back home together.

176
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,666
[NOA] I'm afraid
there's no saving Alecto.

177
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,750
[BOTH gasp]

178
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,666
[NOA] Or the empress,
for that matter.

179
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,125
[SARA]
What do you mean by that?!

180
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,125
'Cause if you think you're
gonna stop us, you're wrong!

181
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,541
[NOA]
Don't you remember?

182
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,833
You've seen for yourself
what happens to a Regalia

183
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,500
that's used all of its power.

184
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,791
[gasps]

185
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,333
Oh, don't worry, though.

186
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,166
You'll all be joining
the two of them very soon.

187
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,166
I'm going to make
certain of that.

188
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,666
[growls]

189
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,750
Don't you say that in her voice.

190
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,708
[SARA]
Get out of her, Johann!

191
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:42,791
[YUI sobs]

192
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,458
[gasps]

[YUI]
Mama... Papa... [sobs]

194
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,708
No, you mustn't cry, Yui.

195
00:13:55,833 --> 00:14:02,583
[YUI sobs]

196
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:07,166
I miss them... [sobs]
Why did they go...?

197
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,458
I want them back...!

198
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,750
[YUI sobs]

199
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,875
Huh...?

200
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,833
Hey.

201
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,375
[SARA yells]

202
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,750
--Huh?
--What happened?

203
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,791
[SARA, TIA scream]

204
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,666
[SARA]
What's going on?!

205
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,291
[KEI] Those three Regalia Gear
can switch places instantly,

206
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,041
whenever they want.

207
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,375
The sooner we
beat these guys,

208
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,041
the sooner we can rescue
Noa and regroup with Yui.

209
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,583
How do we do that?!

210
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,083
[KEI]
First, we need to stay calm.

211
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,791
If all three of them
are able to switch,

212
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,166
then we don't stand a chance.

213
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,916
So, let's try to take one
of them out, to start.

214
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,916
And once that one's down, we can
take on Noa by ourselves, okay?

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,416
Yeah!

216
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,958
The only reason that we were
able to go back and get Yui

217
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,125
is because of the help
we got from Noa.

218
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,500
Now, it's our turn to help.
We can return the favor!

219
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,125
We're going to take
our big sister back

220
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,916
from Johann once and for all!

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,333
[KEI]
Listen, you two.

222
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,958
I hate to say it, but I think
you should let us handle

223
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,208
your sister for a bit.

224
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,791
Huh?

225
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,375
[KEI] While we're doing that, I
want you to prepare yourselves

226
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,125
for the biggest battle
of your lives!

227
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,291
But, wait--

228
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,083
It's okay! I promise,
you can trust us.

229
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,375
Roger that.

230
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,500
Roger that!

231
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,500
[BOTH] By the name and the will
of Erinius.

232
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,541
Tisis shall pierce through!

233
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,625
[YUI sobs]

234
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:57,375
[RENA]
Don't cry...

235
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,125
You're here...

236
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,416
Yes. Thank you for
coming to be with me.

237
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,583
Let's go.
Everyone else is waiting.

238
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,791
[RENA]
What is it?

239
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,375
Can't we stay? And be together?

240
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,875
[gasps]
Yui, that's not like you...

241
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,666
Don't you understand?

242
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,291
If we go back, you'll be
stuck as Alecto forever.

243
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,416
[gasps]

244
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,791
It's shielded!

245
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,666
[NOA] There's a very
important toy in the orbis.

246
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,291
You don't think it would be
left without defenses, do you?

247
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,500
[KEI]
That's it!

248
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,125
[INGRID] The souls must
be trapped in there!

249
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,208
[BOTH groan]

250
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,625
[RENA]
Yes, you're right.

251
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,291
After everything
that's happened.

252
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,458
I may never take
my human form again.

253
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,875
[YUI whimpers]
Then let's stay here!

254
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:15,041
I don't care about anything
else! I just wanna be with you!

255
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:19,333
--We can't...
--Isn't that what you want, too?

256
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,833
I know how you feel,
but it's not that simple.

257
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,333
[YUI gasps]

258
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,750
[INGRID grunts]
This thing's a monster!

259
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,500
Ingrid, listen. Do you mind
if I go overboard?

260
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,125
[grunts]
Thought you'd never ask.

261
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,791
Then here we go!

262
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,166
You know what?

263
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,250
I've always thought that you
were the most amazing person.

264
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,458
There's nothing amazing a--

265
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,250
At heart, you're still
a little girl.

266
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,958
You're scared and shy
and easily rattled.

267
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,958
You miss our parents
so much you can't stand it.

268
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,500
Yet, in spite of all that,
you persevere.

269
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,875
That's what makes you amazing.

270
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,875
But don't you see?
I persevere because I have you!

271
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,875
Yes. I understand.

272
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,625
I've worked hard all these years
to become the kind of big sister

273
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,333
you deserve, and that means
I know you very well.

274
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,583
Of course you do.

275
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,833
[RENA]
Which is why...

276
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,416
...I know what you
wanna do, in your heart.

277
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,541
Huh?

278
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,625
You can't hide it from me!

279
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,041
[TIA, SARA] Come now, thunderous
light--rending the netherworld!

280
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,375
[RENA] You came here to get back
what Johann has taken away,

281
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,625
didn't you?

282
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,083
[YUI] Yeah, that's true,
but when I faced him,

283
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,000
I felt completely powerless.

284
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,375
[RENA]
Trust me. I understand.

285
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,958
I couldn't do anything
by myself, either.

286
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,708
Here's the thing--

287
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,250
[RENA] Do you remember that
promise you made our mother

288
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,708
a long time ago?

289
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,625
To work together
no matter what happens.

290
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,166
We're her daughters,
and wherever she is right now,

291
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,500
I believe she's proud of us.

292
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,750
Yes...

293
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,166
You know that she would
never have lied to us.

294
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,291
Right.

295
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,041
I might not be
able to do anything alone...

296
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,083
...but together,
I believe we can make it!

297
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,500
[BOTH grunt]

298
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,000
Look at Tisis!

299
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,541
[SARA, TIA]
Dwelling in many blades--

300
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,500
become the light that
dispels impending darkness!

301
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,875
Rena.

302
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,416
Do you think that when we die,
we'll end up like Ryu and Lowe?

303
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,625
I don't really know.

304
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,916
But...

305
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,166
But what?

306
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,750
When I thought
I might die alone,

307
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,541
I got so scared thinking about
what would happen afterwards.

308
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,500
But now I don't
feel that way anymore.

309
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,666
You don't?

310
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,958
No. Because no matter
what happens next,

311
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,541
I know that I'll
never be alone.

312
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,166
We'll be together.

313
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,791
Who is that?

314
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,541
I'm not certain,
but I think she's me.

315
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,583
Or rather, another me.
One born from Alecto.

316
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,791
Amazing. Is that why you
decided to give her your ring?

317
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,500
Yeah.

318
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,166
I think that's what helped her
guide us back together again.

319
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,166
