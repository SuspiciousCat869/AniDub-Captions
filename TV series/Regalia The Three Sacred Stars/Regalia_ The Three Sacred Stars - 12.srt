Do you think that when we die
we'll end up like Ryu and Lowe?

00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,958
I don't really know.

00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,375
But...

5
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,625
But what?

6
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,291
When I thought
I might die alone,

7
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,041
I got so scared thinking about
what would happen afterwards.

8
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,958
But now I don't feel
that way anymore.

You don't?

10
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,416
No. Because no matter
what happens next,

11
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
I know that
I'll never be alone.

12
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,750
We'll be together.

Who is that?

14
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,041
I'm not certain,
but I think she's me.

15
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:40,000
Or rather, another me.
One born from Alecto.

16
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,250
Amazing.

17
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,250
Is that why you decided
to give her your ring?

00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,916
Yeah.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,583
I think that's what helped her
guide us back together again.

20
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,916
Oh, wow. Thanks, Alecto.

21

Fine. I'll start again
from the top.

166
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,791
Welcome back to the gloriously
reborn Lux Ex Machina!

167
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,541
Greetings to my fellow royal,

168
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,500
Yuinshiel Asteria,
Empress of Enastoria.

169
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,125
So now you're "king" of
Lux Ex Machina?

170
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,500
I am. Lux Ex Machina is the
greatest power in the universe.

171
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,958
And since I alone can wield that
power that makes me the king.

172
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,541
[JOHANN]
Why fight me?

173
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:39,666
We may both be rulers,
but I literally tower above you.

174
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,333
It may be just a hopeless dream.

175
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,666
But I came here for
the people I care about,

176
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,541
and I am not leaving
without them!

177
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:49,041
As the Empress of Enastoria,
and a member of the human race,

178
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,416
I will make you return
every soul you kidnapped!

179
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,583
[JOHANN]
Hate to break it to you,

180
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,333
especially after
the thrashing you took

181
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,666
and that stirring speech,

182
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,666
but your friends beat
you to the punch.

183
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,958
Humanity has already been freed.

184
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,708
[YUI]
Wait!

185
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,125
Why doesn't that bother you?

186
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,000
Are you just going
to do it all over?

187
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,333
[JOHANN]
Of course!

188
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:11,125
Once I eliminate you all,
I'll start from scratch.

189
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,375
--[YUI] Never!
--It's not up to you, Empress.

190
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,083
[YUI] I won't let you
keep doing this.

191
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,333
You're not hurting anyone else!

192
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,625
I'm putting a stop to you
right here and now.

193
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,708
[whimpers]

194
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,791
You've got some nerve,
you know that?

195
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,958
No puny human can stop me!

196
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,125
[BOTH gasp]

197
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,041
--They're goners!
--Run away!

198
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,083
What's happening to Alecto?

199
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,250
I don't know.

200
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,333
[RENA]
How is this possible?

201
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,500
Rena! Look!

202
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,833
She's here to help.

203
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,750
Is she crazy?
She should be on her knees!

204
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,750
Foolish mortal! Why won't
you bow down before me?!

205
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,375
[JOHANN]
Do you have a death wish?

206
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,958
Don't you understand
I am far more powerful

207
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,458
than you could ever be?

208
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,958
[RENA]
You have more strength,

209
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,375
but that doesn't make
you more powerful.

210
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,416
[RENA] When it comes
to individual might,

211
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,291
Yui has much less than
either you or I do.

212
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,333
But that's because
she doesn't need it.

213
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,291
She has something even greater.

214
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,958
She cares about others. That's
why everyone wants to help her.

215
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,541
They give her something, the
power of love and friendship.

216
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:07,375
That is humanity's power!
It's what makes Yui unstoppable!

217
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,458
It's the strength of
many voices calling as one.

218
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,458
The Regalia can never
come close to beating that!

219
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,250
[screams]

220
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,625
[JOHANN]
Die!

221
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,500
[laughs]

222
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,583
[JOHANN] You can't do anything
by yourself, Empress!

223
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,208
That means you're weak!

224
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,750
[JOHANN] Completely useless
without someone helping you.

225
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,500
But I'm not dependent
on others' charity.

226
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,291
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want.

227
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,666
I don't need anyone else!

228
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,333
The only true power
a person has is their own!

229
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,125
And since mine is
stronger than yours,

230
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,375
I'm going to win, so surrender.

231
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,083
[YUI] Tell me the truth, Johann,
are you jealous of humanity?

232
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,666
Heh!

233
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,250
[YUI] When everyone forgot me, I
was shocked by how scared I was.

234
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,416
I had absolutely no idea
that being so isolated

235
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,541
could be that horrific.

236
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,000
[gasps]

237
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,125
Stop talking to me.

238
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,750
You've felt that way, too,
haven't you?

239
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,125
I thought I told you
to shut your damn mouth!

240
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,291
[JOHANN] I've got souls to
collect and more dolls to make.

241
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,083
I don't have time for this.

242
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:37,375
You're going to die, Empress.
It'll be quick, but painful.

243
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,541
[YUI] You just want someone to
care about, who cares about you.

244
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,375
[YUI] But that doesn't
excuse your actions.

245
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,666
We cannot let you
go through with your plan!

246
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,375
--Rena!
--Let's go!

247
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,416
[RENA, YUI yelling]

248
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,916
I'll blast you out of existence!

249
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,041
No! He can't!

250
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,541
[SARA, TIA]
Yui!

251
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,916
[grunts]

252
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,291
[BOTH]
Astral fist of Fire!

253
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,916
[gasps]

254
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:45,375
[BOTH panting]

255
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,333
[panting]

256
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,875
[INGRID]
Yui! Are you all right?

257
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,916
--[KEI] Rena!
--[SARA, TIA] That was crazy!

258
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,625
[JOHANN]
I despise you, Empress.

259
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,375
With every fiber of my being.

260
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,541
[gasps]

261
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,916
[JOHANN] You're right.
I don't have any friends.

262
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,416
There isn't a single
person I care about.

263
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,208
And the humans I collect end up

264
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,166
being nothing more
than lifeless dolls.

265
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,833
Yui... Rena...

266
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,083
[CITIZENS screaming]

267
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,333
Sara... Tia...

268
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,958
[screaming continues]

269
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,208
[RETSU]
Yui!

270
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,375
[JOHANN]
How dare you pity me.

271
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:42,250
You, who has everything!
I won't allow it...

272
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,875
I don't care if
I destroy the world.

273
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:49,458
I don't need anything.
Humanity can rot!

274
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,166
[gasps]

275
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,541
[JOHANN]
Yuinshiel Asteria...

276
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,125
...I will kill you.
