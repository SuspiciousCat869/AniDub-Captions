1
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,958
[JOHANN laughs] Come out,
come out, wherever you are...

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,291
[SARA]
Big meanie!

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,708
[YUI] Ingrid said something
about creating a resonance.

4
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,833
Do you know what she meant?

5
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:28,916
[gasps]
Look out!

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,041
[YUI gasps]

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,041
[YUI screams]

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,666
--Yui!
--Are you okay?!

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,833
Rena, no!

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,708
Come on! Wake up, Rena!

11
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,666
[gasps]

12
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,416
Kei's here, isn't she?

13
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,500
[YUI]
Answer me, please!

14
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,500
[gasps]

15
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,916
I was so worried
that I'd lost you!

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,375
I found Kei.

17
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,125
--[gasps]
--Hey, Tia!

18
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,791
--Can you hear me?
--Yeah.

19
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,500
[RENA]
I know where Kei is!

20
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,875
That Regalia over there. It may
look like her, but it's not!

21
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,375
Wait, that's not really her?

22
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,041
How do you know?

23
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,625
[RENA] It's just a feeling,
but it's strong.

24
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:01,583
The real Kei is inside of us.
Inside Erinius.

25
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,500
[JOHANN] Still nothing?
Where'd you run off to, Empress?

26
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,375
[YUI] Rena.... If you know
where she is, help her!

27
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,916
What about you?

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Unless I'm here, you won't be
able to use Alecto's powers.

29
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,250
You'll be on your own.

30
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,666
This is more important;
Don't worry about me.

31
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,791
Please, Rena.

32
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,625
Just go, now.

33
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,750
We'll bring her back.

34
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,083

[YUI gasps]

37
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,875
[TIA]
There you are!

38
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,875
I'm so glad I finally found you!

39
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,958
You sure that Kei
is in here somewhere?

40
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,375
I am.

41
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,083
Somewhere.

42
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,166
[growls]

43
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,916
That was close.
A little too close.

44
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,000
[YUI] Bear with me a sec.
I'll try to think of something.

45
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,458
[TIA]
Wow! Look at this place!

46
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,125
Let's see if Kei's in here.

47
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,291
[gasps]

48
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,958
[TIA]
Ah! What's going on?!

49
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,083
[RENA gasps]

50
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,791
Ah!

51
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,750
[RENA]
We should follow.

52
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,500
[TIA]
Hang on! I'm still confused.

53
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,291
[JOHANN] I know they're
around here somewhere,

54
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,833
but I can't see through
all this smoke.

55
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,625
[gasps]
Gotcha!

56
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,041
[JOHANN]
Too bad! So sad.

57
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,166
Now, Yui!

58
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,416
[YUI yells]

59
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,041
[SARA]
Yah!

60
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,541
[JOHANN grunting]

[yells]

62
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,541
[SARA]
All right!

63
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,750
Wow, we actually pulled it off!

64
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,416
[RENA gasps]

65
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:02,750
[RENA] Where are we?
Is this Rimgarde...?

66
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,791
[RENA]
Kei...

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,625
[INGRID] You shouldn't be out
here all alone like this.

68
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,625
[KEI gasps]

69
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,250
Why don't you come with me?

70
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,416
[KEI]
Huh...?

71
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
And that's Ingrid.

72
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,666
We've got room for her,
don't we Abel?

73
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,625
[KEI laughs]

74
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,125
[giggles, sighs]

75
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,833
[INGRID]
It looks lovely on you.

76
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,958
Do you like it?

77
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,833
[KEI giggles]
I do!

78
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,458
[laughs]

79
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,208
[RENA] I understand now.
These are Kei's memories.

80
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:58,875
[gasps] All the lights
are so beautiful!

81
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,125
[laughs]

82
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,000
There's so much food
and it all looks wonderful!

83
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,750
It's yummy!

84
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,458
Thank you for coming to see
all the progress we've made.

85
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,333
It's a real honor,
Your Highness.

86
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,583
[INGRID]
Happy to be here.

87
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,291
So where's this new advisor?

88
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,916
Oh, yes. Let me introduce you.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,583
He's right over there.

90
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,583
I've been looking forward to

91
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,833
meeting you for
awhile, Princess.

92
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,333
My name is Johann.

93
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,041
A pleasure to meet you,
Johann. Call me Ingrid.

94
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,625
[JOHANN chuckles]

95

[giggles softly]

96
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,416
[JOHANN]
That's kind of you,

97
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,833
but truly, the
pleasure is all mine.

98
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,958
[JOHANN]
You're going to regret that.

99
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,208
[SARA gasps]

[TIA, RENA gasp]

101
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,208
[SCIENTIST A]
It's Alecto!

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,625
[gasps]

103
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,916
You said you wanted
to get results, fast.

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,791
Careful what you wish for.

105
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,458
I'm afraid that
it's too late now.

106

[whimpers]

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,458
[SCIENTIST A]
Look! There's Tisis!

108
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,250
It's making contact with Alecto.
They're beginning to fight!

109
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,333
You just had to come
running, didn't you?

110
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,291
[SCIENTIST A] Resonance has
exceeded critical levels!

111
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,291
What the...?

112
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,750
We can't abort!

113
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,208
[JOHANN]
Aww...

114
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,083
I warned you there'd
be consequences

115
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,791
if you didn't go slow.

116
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,041
[chuckles]

117
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,375
Tell me what's going on here!

118
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,083
[RENA gasps]

119
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,208
What's happening?!

120
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,375
[whimpers]
Ingrid, you're here...

121
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,500

[gasps]

125
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,666
We're watching
The Fall of Rimgarde.

126
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,666
[INGRID]
Kei...

127
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,166
[JOHANN]
You confuse me, Empress.

128
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,541
Why are you putting
yourself through

129
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,541
all this needless suffering?

130
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,708
This isn't your fight.
It's got nothing to do with you.

131
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,833
This has to do
with my big sister.

132
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,333
That makes it my fight!

133
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,125
Actually, no, it really doesn't.

134
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,208
Besides she's not truly
your sister, is she? [chuckles]

135
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,791
You won't win this.

136
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,375
[JOHANN]
Rimgarde was too ambitious.

137
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,708
If only your scientists
had listened to me,

138
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,166
then none of this
would have ever happened.

139
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,708
[JOHANN] Oh, a gun!
Someone please save me!

140

Kei...

142
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,750
It happened though...

143
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,125
Thanks to those morons,
I'll have to start all over...

144
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,708
Well, maybe not completely.
I do still have dear Kei.

145
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:27,083
No! Johann! Leave her alone.
She's been through enough!

146
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,166
But I couldn't possibly abandon
my precious little doll.

147
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,583
She can't hear you
because she belongs to me.

148
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,750
[gasps]

149

[INGRID]
Don't go...

150
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,166
You're free to come
along, if you like.

151
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,166
After all, this is
partially your fault.

152
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,541
If you hadn't taken her in,

153
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,375
none of this would be
happening to her. [chuckles]

154
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,166
[INGRID whimpers softly]

155

[BOTH gasp]

156
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,750
[YUI]
It was you!

157
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,666
You caused the Fall of Rimgarde!

158
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,166
You did terrible things
to Ingrid and Kei!

159
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,125
Damn!

160
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,666
[JOHANN]
So what?

161
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,000
Like I keep saying, Empress,
this has nothing to do with you.

162
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,750
Just leave your little friends
here and go back to your castle.

163
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,458
[YUI] They're my friends
because I care about them.

164
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,333
I can't leave them behind!

165
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,916
I won't!

166
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,458
[JOHANN] Oh, really?
Well, that's too bad.

167
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,625
I'm afraid I'm not
done with them yet.

168
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,666
[growls]

169
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,458
[YUI]
I don't understand.

170
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,083
How is it possible for
a living being to be so cruel?!

171
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:55,291
Have you no soul? Is there
nothing you care about?!

172
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,916
[TIA]
Oh no!

173
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,333
[TIA]
Kei!

174
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,833
Rena, what can
we do to help her?

175
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,208
[INGRID] With the three Regalia
of Erinius gathered together

176
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,583
in one place, we can
create a resonance.

177
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,250
A resonance...

178
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,625
[gasps]

00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,166
[RENA, TIA gasp]

180
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,125
I'm getting bored.

181
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,375
You can go ahead
and die, Empress.

182
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,041

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,166
Oh no!

186
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,208
[JOHANN]
This just isn't fun anymore.

187
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,166
And since you're the only one
I really don't need,

188
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,666
I'm afraid you <i>have</i> to die.

189
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,458

[JOHANN laughs]

195
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,000
Goodbye, Yuinshiel.

196
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,416
Enastoria will have to
go on without you.

197
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,000
[YUI gasping]

[JOHANN grunts]

199
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,958
[JOHANN]
Interesting.

200
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,750
It's a little early for you to
be switching sides, you know.

201
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,166
You do remember that Kei
is still under my control.

202
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,166
Twelve years you've carried
the guilt for what

203
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,500
a greedy king
and his minions did.

204
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,750
Though it ate at you,
you bided your time,

205
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,125
waiting patiently for just
one chance, and you blew it!

206
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,625
[INGRID grunts]

207
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,666
Don't mock my pain by
pretending to know how I feel!

208
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,000
[JOHANN]
Fine. Suit yourself.

209
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,333
[SARA]
Yui!

210
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,375
[JOHANN laughs]
Did you think I was stupid?

211
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,666
[groans]

212
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,291
[JOHANN] I know you
were planning to kill me

213
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,375
after you found a way to
save Kei and got her back.

214
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,041
[growls]

215
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,375
You thought you could do it
by creating a resonance

216
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,250
of Erinius, am I right?

217
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,166
You were so close.

218
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,000
Wake up.

219
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:27,916

00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,250
You and I have had
fun together, but...

225
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,083
...it's over now.

226
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:00,625
'Bye...

227
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,791
'Bye.

[INGRID gasps]

00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,166
It's me, Ingrid...

233
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,041
I'm myself again...

234
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,958
[KEI sobs]
Ingrid...!

235
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,208
I missed you so.
Welcome home, Kei.

236
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,333
Hey, Rena. Were you two
able to bring her back?

237
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,583
[RENA]
Mm-hmm...

238
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
Fighting without my big sister
was a lot harder

239
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,541
than I thought,
but I did the best I could.

240
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,000
[RENA]
I know...

241
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,083
[SARA] I'm not totally sure
I get it, but hooray!

242
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,250
--Welcome back!
--[TIA] This is great!

243
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,458
This is great!

244
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,000
[JOHANN]
Well, well, well...

245
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,750
It would appear that the
tables have been turned.

246
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,875
[TIA]
Leave it to us, Kei!

247
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,125
We'll take down that big jerk
for what he did to you!

248
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,750
[RENA] We won't let him
get away with this.

249
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,708
[KEI] Thank you for
the offer, my friends.

250
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,041
But this is a job
for me and Ingrid.

251
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,958
[INGRID] We have been eagerly
awaiting this moment

252
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,541
every day for the last 12 years.

253
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,083
I hope neither of you will mind
if we do the honors ourselves.

254
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,791
Vengeance shall belong to us!

255
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,208
So let's take it!

256
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,791
[JOHANN laughs]

257
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,083
[KEI]
It's been a while, Johann.

258
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,708
[JOHANN] Not for me.
I've seen you every day.

259
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,125
[KEI] How dare you lay so much
as a finger on Ingrid

260
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,083
and the other
Regalia of Erinius!

261
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,000
Now it's time for you to pay
for what you've done!

262
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,916
'Fraid I'll have to
pass on that. Sorry.

263
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,791
You call that an attack?

264
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,208
Perhaps you'll like
this one more.

265
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,125
[JOHANN]
Where'd you go?

266
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,791
[KEI]
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

267
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,250
You're going down.

268
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,791
[JOHANN] Wow! She packs
a real punch when she's angry.

269
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,583
This is what you get for
trying to kill my little sister!

And this is for everything
you did to Sara!

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,958
[TIA]
Haa...!

275
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,708
Feel our anger, Johann!

276
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,083
Feel the rage of
the people of Rimgarde!

277
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,083
By the name and
the power of Erinius,

278
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,250
