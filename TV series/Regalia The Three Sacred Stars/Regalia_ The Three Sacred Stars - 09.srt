1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
[INGRID] Thank you for
honoring Abel's passing,

2
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,416
General Marshall.
It's kind of you.

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
[MARSHALL]
Not at all.

4
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,833
He's one of the
few people in this world

5
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,416
whom I considered a friend.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,666
I can't help feeling as if
I've done him a terrible wrong.

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,041
It's not like that at all.

8
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,250
Well, this is just
between you and me,

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,750
but to be perfectly honest,

10
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,125
I'm feeling a little
envious of Abel.

11
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,166
He managed to fulfill most
of his deepest wishes

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,250
while he was on
that last mission.

13
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,875
He can rest, with the knowledge

14
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,666
that his life and
death had purpose.

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,666
What wishes do you mean?

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,750
[MARSHALL] All of you girls
are finally safe now,

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,166
and that's a
direct result of what

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,250
Abel had set in motion
when he came here...

19
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,708
This is exactly what he wanted,

20
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,916
and I believe he would've
died happily for it.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,916
I'm sure he'd say he doesn't
deserve any recognition--

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,875
but I think honoring him
with this headstone

23
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,083
so we can pay our respects
is what's right.

24
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,833
[INGRID]
Yes. It is.

25
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,791
Thank you, General.

26
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,333
[KEI giggles]

27
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,083
[RENA]
Well... here's our place.

28
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,333
Follow me.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,625
What are you waiting for?
Come inside.

30
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,208
Yeah, okay.

31
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,333
[INGRID] Is this really
the empress's chambers?

32
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,541
[KEI] I know, I thought
it'd be a bit bigger.

33
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,250
[RENA] Yui doesn't care
for the opulence

34
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,791
that comes with her station.

35
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,333
When she's given the choice,
she likes to keep things simple.

36
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,000
Heh.

37
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,125
[RENA]
Here.

38
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,708
[KEI gasps]

39
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,125
[INGRID] This is so
thoughtful of you, Rena.

40
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,791
But do you have anything
a little less frilly?

41
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,916
[gasps]

42
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,708
I'm sure we do.
Just give me a second.

43
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,208
[KEI]
Hold on, Rena.

44
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,583
What is it?

45
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,916
I want you to listen to me!
Sit down for a minute!

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,791
[INGRID]
Uh... All right.

47
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,750
I'm listening.

48
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,666
It's just that
I worry about you.

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,333
You finally have a chance
to live a little.

50
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,291
It's okay to let yourself
feel things and be happy.

51
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,916
It's not quite that simple.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,708
Well, if it isn't,
then it should be!

53
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,208
Life has finally gotten better

54
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,041
and you deserve to
actually enjoy it!

55
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,791
You know... That's the best
advice I've gotten in a while.

56
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,666
Yeah?

57
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,666
I'll do my best. Okay?

58
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,375
Yes. And I'll help
as much as I can!

59
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,333
[INGRID chuckles]

60
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,916
[RENA giggles]

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,666
[NARU] Does this truly
mean that the Regalia

62
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,625
are no longer a threat?

63
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, I do believe
that's the case.

64
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,250
[MARGARET] What about the data
provided by Princess Ingrid?

65
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,541
We can't ignore that.

66
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,000
[THEODORE] It's a
research report from

67
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,833
the Kingdom of Rimgarde.

68
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:35,625
You'll find it fully details how
the Fall of Rimgarde came about.

69
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,458
It's all rather extraordinary
and difficult to believe.

70
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,666
Even after seeing
a Regalia first-hand.

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,666
Ingrid has spent
the past 12 years living

72
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,458
the fallout of
this single event.

73
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,916
I'm inclined to believe
whatever she says.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,500
She has made it clear
that she'll accept

75
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,416
any judgement
that's passed down.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,541
[gasps]

77
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,791
We must determine
a course of action,

78
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,375
including what to do
about the princess.

79
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,583
And there's still the
question of what exactly

80
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,791
Johann was trying to
accomplish in Rimgarde.

81
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,958
[GROUP sighs]

82
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,166
Whatever the case,
until we come up with a plan,

83
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,666
my opinion is that Ingrid should
remain here, just as you wish.

84
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,833
I see no issue with that.

85
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,125
[gasps]

86
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,333
I'm guessing Yui would
be very happy to take

87
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,625
the princess under her wing.

88
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,083
Well, then.

89
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,000
Do you mind if we left Ingrid
in your care, Empress?

90
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,333
I'd love that!

Yeah, it was hot, then cold,
then we fell out of the sky.

That dress was made for yo--

I'll have you know I was
just trying on the dress

to see if it would fit,
that's all I was doing!

You're already thinking about

what I said to you
earlier, aren't you?

I think it looks good on you.

I think I'll change now.

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,208
[SARA]
Wait, now you're running!

162
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,250
[TIA]
You're running!

163
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,583
[RETSU]
Oh, I guess I am! Sorry!

164
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,583
Let's get to it!

165
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,750
[SARA, TIA]
Yeah!

166
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,666
[INGRID]
You've got very nice friends.

167
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,583
Yeah, I think so, too!

168
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,875
[GIRLS]
Cheers!

169
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,666
[glasses clanking]

170
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,791
[YUI]
Would you mind if I joined you?

171
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,458
[gasps softly]

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,958
[giggles]

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,333
[YUI]
You know,

174
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,500
this has always been a favorite
spot of mine and Rena's.

175
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,541
[INGRID]
Yeah?

176
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,583
[YUI]
When we're feeling down

177
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,083
or dealing with
something difficult.

178
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,041
this is where we like to come.

179
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,416
We don't even have
to talk, necessarily.

180
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,666
It's more that the
peacefulness of this place

181
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,083
puts things in perspective.

182
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,833
Sitting on these steps
brings back memories for me.

183
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,083
Huh?

184
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,416
You may not know,

185
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,125
but I was at your mother's
enthronement ceremony.

186
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,750
I was one of the
foreign dignitaries

187
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,458
chosen to deliver
a celebratory speech.

188
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,208
But before I took the podium,

189
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,083
I turned tail and ran
out of the building.

190
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,500
[YUI]
You did?

191
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,375
I suppose you could say
that I didn't really care much

192
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,083
for all the formalities that
came with being a princess.

193
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,958
Once the ceremony started,
I got nervous.

194
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,166
And then I couldn't figure out
how to go back inside

195
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,291
after having run out.

196
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,458
That's when...

197
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,583
[YUI'S MOM]
A-ha! Found you!

198
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,666
[INGRID]
Oh.

199
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,083
[BOTH chuckle]

200
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,666
My mom came to get you?

201
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,583
And as a matter of fact,
she was holding you in her arms.

202
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,416
Really? Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry!

203
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,083
I wish I could
remember all of this!

204
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,041
You were too little for
any memory to stick.

205
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,833
So... I'd honestly be
more surprised if you could.

206
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,208
What do you think those two
are talking about down there?

207
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,500
Eep!

208
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,708
Rena!

209
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,208
Be quiet if you're gonna snoop.

210
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,291
Sorry...

211
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,208
[INGRID] Your Highness...
What about the ceremony?

212
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,041
Is it okay for you
to leave like that?

213
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,791
"The new empress
suddenly fell ill

214
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,541
and was regrettably
forced to take her leave

215
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,916
partway through the
scheduled events."

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,166
Huh?

217
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,291
"Therefore, the ceremony
could not be continued

218
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,583
and all following speeches
from visiting dignitaries

219
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,666
were cancelled."

220
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,375
But, is it truly that simple?

221
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,166
I'm sure Margaret and the others
will know how to handle it.

222
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,833
Right?

223
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,666
[YUI giggles]

224
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,666
[YUI'S MOM chuckles]

225
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,875
--Wow, look at you!
--Your Highness.

226
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,166
Excuse me.

227
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,708
I was wondering...

228
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,291
Can you tell me why we have
kings and queens and empresses?

229
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,416
But you're royalty!

230
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,166
Is that really what
you were thinking?

231
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,416
Now that I think about it, it's
kind of an embarrassing memory

232
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:37,958
[YUI'S MOM]
Well, to be honest,

233
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,458
that's not an easy
question to answer.

234
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,416
[YUI'S MOM]
Let me ask you, Ingrid:

235
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,083
Are you fond of your country?

236
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,458
Well, yes, I suppose
I usually am.

237
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,791
So, what do you like about it?

238
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,125
I'm not really sure.

239
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,375
Um...

240
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,083
Sorry, it's hard
to pin it down exactly.

241
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,166
[YUI'S MOM chuckles] It's an
overwhelming thought, I know.

242
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,291
We love our homelands
for lots of reasons,

243
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,541
some of which are
hard to express.

244
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,833
[INGRID]
Yes...

245
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,625
[YUI'S MOM] I'd bet
most people feel that way.

246
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,875
[INGRID]
You do?

247
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,625
[YUI'S MOM] Sometimes,
things can get you down

248
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,875
and you wonder why
you're where you are.

249
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,458
I've felt it myself
often enough.

250
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,458
Don't let it get to you. 'Kay?

251
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,625
Remember to focus on
the things that remind you

252
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,458
just how special
your country is.

253
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,875
All of the things that endear it
to you. Like no other place

254
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,291
[BOTH laugh]

255
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,750
[YUI'S MOM] Those are the
things that keep us going.

256
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,375
Yes... I suppose
that you're right.

257
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,583
You see? I think that's
the role of a leader.

258
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,083
To be a reminder to her
people of what is good

259
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,000
and right about their country.

260
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,500
[INGRID] I don't know if I
can be that for them, though.

261
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,375
I'm not always
sure I can, either.

262
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,125
I get confused and overwhelmed
just like anybody else does.

263
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,541
But in the end, it comes down to
the fact that I love Enastoria.

264
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,375
That's something that is
never going to change.

265
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,958
[YUI'S MOM] I just have
to keep trying my best.

266
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,916
I'm still an
empress-in-training, you know.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,916
[INGRID] I wish I could
see things the way you do.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,041
Don't worry.

269
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,375
Your heart is in
the right place,

270
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,958
and that's what really
matters, don't you think?

271
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,208
I hope so.

272
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,416
And even if you and I
don't achieve greatness,

273
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,041
we've got Yui.

274
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,708
And later, you girls will
have children, as well.

275
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,000
[YUI'S MOM] I believe as long
as we pass these feelings

276
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,291
and ideals on to those
who come after us,

277
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,541
we will have done our duty
for our countries.

278
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,166
That's a really
beautiful thought, Empress.

279
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,833
You know, actually, we'll
both be in training together.

280
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,666
We can help each other out!

281
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,791
[INGRID]
Thank you.

282
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,166
[YUI]
Me, too, help!

283
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,333
[laughs]
That's right, Yui!

284
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,041
You're in training, too,
aren't you?

285
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,208
[laughs]

286
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,875
[YUI laughs]

287
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,583
[INGRID] You look as though
you might have a question.

288
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,833
Please tell me about Rena.

289
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,208
It was after the
Fall of Rimgarde

290
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:17,750
that I found out where she was.
Here in Enastoria.

291
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,750
So, Abel and I just waited.

292
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,875
We bided our time until you
could become bound to her.

293
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,416
[YUI]
But... why me?

294
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,958
[INGRID] We thought
it was destiny that Rena

295
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,916
was taken in by your mother,
and made a part of your family.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,125
After your mother passed away,
we thought it was only

297
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,875
a matter of time
until you would bond,

298
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,333
since you were the only one
left by her side.

299
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,708
But once Johann discovered
Rena's whereabouts,

300
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,708
Abel and I knew
we were out of time.

301
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,583
We couldn't wait any longer.

302
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,291
[YUI] That's why you came after
her with the Regalia Gear.

303
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,250
[INGRID]
We did it to save Kei.

304
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,291
To cause a resonance,
all the Regalia need to have

305
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,500
someone bound to them.

306
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,250
So that explains
why Abel came, too!

307
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,083
Because you hadn't
been bound yet.

308
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,083
Without you, Alecto's power
was still incomplete.

309
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,208
[gasps]

310
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,416
Empress Yui...
Look after Ingrid for me.

311
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,250
She will need you...

312
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,458
He spoke of you.
It makes sense now...

313
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,083
[INGRID]
Yes... He fought for us.

314
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,583
Abel was trying to
protect us from Johann.

315
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,500
Kei and I, and you and Rena.

316
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,333
You know, I once sent
a letter to the empress.

317
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,125
I knew that she would
be concerned for me,

318
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,375
so I wrote to let her know
that I was still alive,

319
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,583
and that having Rena in
Enastoria could be bad for you.

320
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,541
I told her that if she cared
about the well-being

321
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,333
of her daughter,
then she might have to

322
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,708
make a tough decision.

[YUI'S MOM] Yui and Rena
are both my daughters.

325
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,375
[YUI'S MOM] I know that no
matter what happens,

326
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,375
they'll work together
to figure things out.

327
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:07,208
Because... they're my family,
and I believe in them.

328
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,833
[INGRID] Sometimes I think
her response kept me going

329
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,458
when nothing else really could.

330
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,250
[YUI]
I never imagined...

331
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,791
[INGRID] I'm truly sorry that I
had to involve you

I mean, it's just that I
never got to talk to my mom

337

about anything like that.

[INGRID] I'm sure there
are a million things

if she had the chance.

I've been watching you fight
for quite a long time, now.

You've been so lost,
and you've suffered,

No need to be formal.
