00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,166
I'm so sleepy! It's six a.m!

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,416
Can't we go back to bed, Retsu?

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,166
If you wanna get a good
spot later, then wake up.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,000
We have to hurry and
sell out by lunchtime,

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,541
otherwise we'll be
stuck here all day.

6
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,083
You're all up early.

00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:30,916
Hi Yui!

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,541
[RETSU]
This is a treat. Good morning!

10
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,625
What are you doing here?
Don't you need your rest?

11
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,583
Today's a big day!

12
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,083
Honestly, I just wanted
to see your face.

13
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,500
[gasps]

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,291
Aw, you really are too sweet,
Yui. It's embarrassing.

15
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,625
[RETSU]
What's wrong?

16
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,833
[RETSU]
Yui...?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,541
Please. Tell me everything's
going to be okay.

18
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,541
[RETSU]
Sure. Because it will.

19
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,333
Thanks, Retty.

20
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,541

Hey!

00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,125
[RETSU, YUI gasp]

22
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,166
No fair! What about
a hug for me?

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,375
Me, too!

24
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,333
Uh! Right! Two hugs!

00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,000
[SARA, TIA laugh]

One for Sara. One for Tia.

You girls look after
Retty for me, okay?

I wish I could stay longer,
but I have to get going.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,666
[RETSU]
No worries.

32
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,625
[YUI] Thanks again...
for everything,

33
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,708
That was weird.
It felt like goodbye.

34
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,458
[RENA] You're back.
Where have you been?

35
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,041
I just went for a little
jog to stretch my legs.

36
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,916
Well, I'm ready to go
whenever you are.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,125
You're already dressed?

38
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,958
Let me see.

39
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,333
I don't know. Do you think
I look like a toy soldier?

40
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,458
No. It looks great
on you. I swear!

41
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,416
[SARA]
Chicken skewers!

42

Hot and fresh!
Right off the grill!

43
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,958
Grab one! They're going quick!

44
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,291
Better hurry or I
might eat them all!

[gasps, sighs]

46
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,541
[NARU] "Now that you have read
the full report on the incidents

00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,958
at both the pier and bridge,

48
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,083
I hope you better understand
the plan we came up with

49
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,000
and why we are committed
to moving forward with it."

50
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,916
As dictated by Her Highness.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,583
[MEN]
Hm...

52
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,416
Gentlemen, as you can
see for yourselves,

53
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,250
there is quite a lot
we still don't know

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,000
about the current situation.

55
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,208
It is possible the Empress's
course of action

56
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,666
may not be best.

57
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,875
She is young and inexperienced.

58
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,500
There is no denying
these things.

59
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,833
Nevertheless, despite what she
lacks in wisdom and years,

60
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,125
Yui is thoughtful.

61
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,916
All she wants, as Empress,
is to be a good one.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,125
I would never change that.

63
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,083
All I can do is use my
role as Prime Minister

64
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,333
to support her as best I can.

65
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,875
For the good of the Enastorian
Empire, and our shared future,

66
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,458
I ask you to do the same.

67
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,666
Please support Yui.

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,708
We all ask you to.

69
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,541
Yui?

70
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,000
Be honest. You're
scared, aren't you?

71
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,250
[gasps]

72
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,791
[MARSHALL] Final preparations
for the execution of Yui's plan

73
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,375
are nearly complete.
Ordagry Air Force base

74
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,083
has been sealed off, and
its personnel evacuated.

75
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,708
In coordination with my
counterpart, Mr. Moore,

76
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,708
both Intelligence Agents and
troops are being deployed.

77
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,916
Our departments will be
working concurrently.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,208
Together we must protect
the public. That's an order!

79
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,750
The future of our empire
is at stake here.

80
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,041
Failure is not an option!

81
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:21,583
[YUI] It's only natural that
I'd be afraid of facing Abel.

82
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,125
Right?

83
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,208
I should be. But...

84
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,833
That's not it.

85
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,291
I came up with a plan.

86
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,166
And now, we're about
to go through with it.

87
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,458
A lot of people trusted
me and did what I asked.

88
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,125
But what if I'm wrong?

89
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,583
What if this wasn't
the right idea,

90
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,458
and we should've done
something different?

91
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,833
Honestly, that's what scares
me more than anything else.

92
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,583
As Empress, if I make a mistake

93
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,375
the entire country could
end up paying for it.

94
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,833
Thinking about it makes me
want to run and hide.

95
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,333
But I can't, so I just
smile and keep on going.

96
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,333
[RENA]
Yui...

It's almost time.

Yes. Just about. We're
just finishing our tea.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,375
[AOI]
I'll wait outside.

101

[RETSU] Wow. You did a great
job today, girls!

103
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,083
We did?!

You bet! Now let's hurry,
or we'll be late!

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,166
[SARA]
Yay!

107
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,208
The late Dowager Empress was
quite an exceptional woman.

108
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:31,500
So kind to Ingrid and
all those from Rimgarde.

109
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,125
You're a coward, Abel.

110
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,500
She said she would have liked
to see you again someday,

111
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,416
and you denied her that.

112
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,208
Same amount of disdain and
hostility, even after 12 years.

113
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,541
[ABEL] We'll have to catch
up next time, Jonathan.

114
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,125
If there is a next time.

115
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,291
[gasps]

116
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,291
[MARSHALL]
Abel...

117
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,416
Hey, Rena?

118
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,750
[RENA]
Mm?

119
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,416
[YUI] My mind keeps going
back to ten years ago,

120
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,916
when our mother and father died.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,291
Without you...

122
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,708
...I think I would have
curled up and cried forever.

123
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:18,166
I became empress back then,
but I was too young to reign.

124
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,541
I was a child.

125
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,541
Still, it bothered me
that I had to have help.

126
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,458
I thought, "I'm the Empress.

127
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,500
I should be able
to do this myself!"

128
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,833
It was so important to me

129
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,375
to be able to stand
on my own two feet.

130
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,333
But ya know what?
I think I was wrong.

131
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,250
The only reason I made it
this far was because of you.

132
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,583
Both of you and
the entire country.

133
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,083
Being empress doesn't
mean doing it alone.

134
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,958
I stand with Enastoria
and it stands with me.

135
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,500
This is still scary.

136
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,041
But with the support of
my people, I can be brave.

137
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,500
All is ready, Ingrid.

138
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,125
Abel! What's with the long face?

139
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,125
Sorry I asked...

140
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,375
[door closes]

141
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,916
You don't have to do this.
Johann can go instead.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,583
His Regalia Gear has enough
power for the task at hand.

143
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,375
[ABEL]
No. This is too important.

144
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,125
We must proceed with the
next phase of the plan.

145
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,666
Moreover, entrusting a fool
with a 'fool's errand,'

146
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,000
would be a very bad--

147
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:31,958
Ahh!

148
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,250
Are you okay?

149
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:38,083
Regardless of who you send,
our time is short. Ingrid.

150
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,458
Please allow your humble
servant, Abel Lundestad,

151
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,625
to do this final act for you.

152
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,125
[exhales]

153
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,208
[ABEL] Twelve years ago, I was
not with you in Rimgarde,

154
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,541
as I should have been.

155
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,666
My heart kept beating, but
it was as if I had died.

156
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,000
From that day on, it has been my
utmost pleasure to assist you.

157
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,750
Your life gave me purpose.

158
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,125
[ABEL]
Goodbye, Princess.

159
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,500
Remember me well.

160
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,833
It was very sweet of Abel
to come and say goodbye.

161
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,333
Rena?

162
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,541
When do we get to see Yui?

163
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,833
Shouldn't be long.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,916
[RENA] Listen. You may not be
scared of Abel, but I am.

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,458
[YUI]
You are?

166
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,875
He's stronger than
the others we fought.

167
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm not sure I'll be able
to protect you this time.

168
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,666
I honestly can't imagine what
Kei and Ingrid are thinking.

169
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,333
I don't know what they want.

170
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,416
Plus, I have doubts
about myself.

171
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,666
That's what I'm most afraid of.

172
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,333
Rena...

173
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,958
As a Regalia something's
inside me, that isn't me.

174
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,083
I fear being consumed by it.

175
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,916
That happened 12 years ago and
for a little bit the other day.

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm scared it could
swallow me up,

177
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,083
and then, I couldn't
protect you.

178
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,041
I might even end up hurting you!

179
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,208
You shouldn't be
relying on me, Yui.

180
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,500
You should be afraid of me!

181
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,666
[YUI]
Rena!

182
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,208
[RENA]
Uh!

183
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,166
[YUI] Even though you're afraid
of yourself, you still came!

184
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,458
And knowing that you're
scared too makes me happy.

185
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,750
I guess that sounds weird,
but I really am.

186
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,666
Alone, we're both so scared
and we feel helpless.

187
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,916
But together, we're strong,
and we can do this.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,833
Really?

189
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,291
Believe.

190
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,666
Just keep holding my hand
and don't let go. Not ever.

191
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,291
[RENA]
Okay.

192
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,416
[NARU]
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,250
Empress Yuinshiel would
like to welcome you

194
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,375
and thank you for attending
tonight's event.

195
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,666
Unfortunately she cannot
be here herself.

196
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,583
[TIA, SARA]
Uh?! Oh, there she is!

197
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:35,083
Yeah. But where is she exactly?

198
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,375
So you refuse my
request, correct?

199
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,875
Yes.

200
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,708
[ABEL] Do you realize the
consequences of that decision?

201
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,000
Are you ready to bear the
brunt of what this means

202
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,250
for your country,
all by yourself?

203
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,375
[YUI]
I'm not all by myself.

204
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,791
Being Empress of Enastoria
makes me a leader,

205
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,625
but I stand with my people,
and they with me.

206
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,541
I'm no different from them
and I don't always

207
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,875
make the right choices
because I'm human.

208
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,000
But...

209
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,916
...so are my citizens.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,666
We are all one. We live and
laugh and cry as one people.

211
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,958
And we all want what's
best for our country.

212
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,833
You wanna know why I need Rena?

213
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,416
Because she's what's best
for this country and me!

214
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,666
That's it.

215
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,208
My sister has lived here
with us for 12 years.

216
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,916
She's as much a part
of Enastoria as anyone.

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,333
To just hand her over to you

218
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,041
would be betraying my
country and myself.

219
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,458
[ABEL]
When we last parted,

220
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,125
I said we would meet next
on the battlefield.

221
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,416
Do you remember?

222
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,916
[YUI]
Yes.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
Then prepare yourself.

224
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,291
For I challenge you and
the Regalia to combat.

225
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,875
And I warn you both it will
be a fight to the death!

226

and destroying darkness.

233
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:35,208
I summon you now, to the endless
destruction that lies within me!

234
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,666
Fill me with your
unwavering fury.

Unfathomable sacred relics!

Where'd the Empress go?

239
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,458
[MAN 5B] That's the red giant!
The one from the news!

240
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:21,208
[RETSU] Yui. I'm confused.
What's going on?

241
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,916
Rena?

242
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,500
I'm ready.

We should go help them!

Yui asked us to watch after

Oh, yeah.

00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,625

Talk to me! Are you okay?

260
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,625
[RENA] This isn't enough.
I can't protect Yui.

261
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,250
I can't keep her safe,
but maybe you can.

262
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,458
You're stronger than me.

263
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,416
[YUI] Rena, snap out of it!
I need my big sister!

264
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,583
Promise you'll be with
me always. Forever.

265
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,625
What am I doing?! Yui wants
me with her forever.

00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,000
I can't leave now!

You're Alecto, right?

268
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,708
Then maybe you can help me. I
need more power to protect Yui!

269
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,791
Please, give it to me!

Is this it...?

00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,500
[RENA] What you said on the
runway. You were right.

272
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,625

I can't do it alone.

[gasps]

I need you. We need you.

00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,291
Lend us your strength.

276
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,833
Become bound to me

What?

[RENA] You'll be able
to stay with me forever.

But once we do this,
there's no going back.

What the Regalia's
curse takes, it keeps.

You'll be trapped like we are.

Could you live with that? Yui?

283
