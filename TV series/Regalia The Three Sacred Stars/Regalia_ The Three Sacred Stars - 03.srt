1
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:50,625
[JONNY] The countdown has begun.
Time's running out.

2
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,708
What now?

3
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,208
Don't worry.
It's going to be okay.

4
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,875
[JONNY laughs]

5
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,208
Aw, nice try.

6
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,333
It isn't working!

7
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,166
Then we'll try harder!

8
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,041
[gasps]

9
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,791
[JONNY] Now, let's see here. How
many minutes are left, again?

10
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,833
No more.

11
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,541
Three!

12
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,833
[JONNY]
Two!

13
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,208
[JOHAN]
One!

14
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,208
[JONNY gasping]

15
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,583
[RENA] By the name and
the will of Erinius...

16
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,541
Alecto shall prevail!

17
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,583
Steel fangs, forged by darkness.

18
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,166
Heh.

19
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,875
Unleash Niero Assault!

20
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,541
[JONNY, JOHAN laugh]
Did you believe you'd won?

21
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,958
[BOTH gasp]

22
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,125
[laughs]

23
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:34,791
[JOHAN] Quite a show. Though it
would've been better at night.

24
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:49,708
[JOHAN laughing]

25
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,250
[YUI]
Rena?

26
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,250
[YUI gasping]

27
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,291
[YUI]
What's wrong? What's happening?

28
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,708
[gasps]

29
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,208
[YUI]
A Regalia?

30
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,875
[JOHAN] Aw, come on. We were
just getting to the good part.

31
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,166
I can live with that
small disappointment.

32
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,416
This means all the keys
have come together.

33
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,333
[YUI]
Rena!

34
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:05,125
[YUI]
No! Uh! Come back!

35
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,583
What is that?

36
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,541
I've got you!

37
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:29,083
[RENA panting]

38
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,875
Who are... you?

39
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,791
[gasps]

40
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,333
Yui!

41
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,708
[gasps]

42
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,333
[INGRID]
Stop. That's enough.

43
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,916
No fair.

44
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,375
Now that they're both here,
at least let me say hello.

45
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,166
What's the harm in that?

46
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:46,000
Uh. Fine, as you wish...

47
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,708
I'll go now.

48
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,541
Hmph.

49
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,125
[RENA]
Tisis.

50
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,166
Looks like Rena's found
her way back to herself.

51
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,541
Although, I don't think now

52
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,375
would be the best
time to talk to her.

53
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,958
Well, maybe we should go
back to the restaurant.

54
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,166
I'm starving!

55
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,625
Sure! Sounds perfect!

56
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,583
[RENA]
Are you okay?

57
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,791
[RENA]
I'm so glad you're safe.

58
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,250
[YUI]
Show me, Theodore.

59
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,583
[THEODORE]
Here.

60
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,000
As you can see, it's exactly
like the fall of Rimgarde

61
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,291
12 years ago.

62
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,875
Except for the involvement
of the Regalia Gear.

63
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,708
The Regalia Gear seem quite
similar to Rena's Regalia,

64
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,250
so perhaps they're related.

65
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,833
I would like to know
why the other one

66
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,583
stopped the fight
and disappeared.

67
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,541
That's something we're
currently looking into.

68
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,375
And what of the other
issue we discussed?

69
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,583
We still haven't found
definitive evidence.

70
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's pin down a location
as soon as possible.

71
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,458
[THEODORE]
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,208
[YUI]
Thank you.

73
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,916
I think I would like to go and
see how the recovery work

74
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,083
is coming along so far.

75
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,083
[ALL]
Hm?

76
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,833
You must be exhausted, though.

77
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,791
Why don't you rest
for a little bit?

78
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,666
But, I don't want
to take it easy

79
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,625
while everyone else
is working so hard.

80
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,000
For tonight, just rest.

81
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,833
I've got a busy day planned for
you tomorrow, don't worry.

82
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,250
[YUI]
Uh?

83
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:50,958
[RENA gasps]

84
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,958
What's wrong?

85
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,291
[RENA]
Uh... Yui?

86
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,333
Uh! You're here!

87
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,833
How do you feel?
Are you in a lot of pain?

88
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,750
No. I'm perfectly fine,
thanks to you.

89
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,083
Thank goodness!
I was so worried.

90
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,583
Not as worried as I was!

91
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,958
I was starting to think you
were never waking up.

92
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,458
I'm just tired, is all.

93
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,958
Are you sure?

94
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:13,875
Uh-huh.

95
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,583
I'm glad to hear that!

96
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,708
Especially since I'll
be out tomorrow.

97
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,750
[RENA]
Uh?

98
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,583
The festival is
starting, remember?

99
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,875
[RENA]
Oh.

100
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,583
I'm going into town to see
how the preparations

101
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,916
are coming along.

102
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,083
While I'm gone, you can
get all the rest you need.

103
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,416
Shouldn't you take some
time to rest, too?

104
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,125
Don't worry. I'll be okay.

105
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,291
It might help to lift the
people's spirits if I go.

106
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,708
I'm sure it will, and it's
your duty as Empress.

107
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,208
[YUI] I knew you'd
understand. Good night.

108
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,583
[RENA]
Good night.

109
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,875
[OWNER 3A]
Welcome, welcome!

110
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,125
Excuse me,
are these candies?

111
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,125
They are. Take
whichever you'd like!

112
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,833
Your Highness! We set aside
our best just for you!

113
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,125
Freshly popped! Please
take some, Empress Yui!

114
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,583
Wow. You're all very
kind, thank you!

115
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,625
We brought you some
things, too, Empress Yui!

116
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,625
All my favorites!

117
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,791
Thanks! I hope we
see you again soon.

118
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,875
[sighs]

119
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,250
[RENA]
A green onion skewer, please.

120
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,625
Sure thing! Wait.

121
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,625
[RETSU]
Hey, Renny!

122
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,375
There's a little favor
I need to ask of you.

123
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,000
Uh...

124
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,500
You love being out among
your people, don't you?

125
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,666
Yes. Where do you think
we should go next?

126
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,958
Huh? Oh. I'd say that's plenty.

127
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,875
We've gone through the
whole street already.

128
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,083
Are you sure?

129
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,791
You did a great job today.

130
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,000
I think that you've earned
yourself a little break.

131
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,041
All right, then. Thanks
a lot. See you later!

132
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,416
That's quite a haul.

133
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,333
[laughs]

134
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,791
Oh.

135
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,541
[SARA yelping]

136
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,791
Uh! Can I help? Are you okay?

137
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,791
[SARA groans]
Ow...

138
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,833
Huh?

139
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,625
Hey! I saw you on TV!

140
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,666
Huh?

141
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,541
[RETSU] Basically, you
want to use our kitchen

142
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,000
to make something for Yui,

143
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,583
and you don't want me to say
anything to her about it?

144
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,125
Well. That's very
big-sisterly of you!

145
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,083
[RENA growls]

146
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,375
Uh. I, uh, mean, it's not like
I'm surprised or anything!

147
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,541
Yui always talks about how
great her big sister is,

148
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,625
and now I can see it myself!

149
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,750
Hey, slow down or
you'll fall! Careful!

150
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,791
See, you should've
listened to me.

151
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:43,958
[whimpers]

152
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,375
That's my big girl. No tears.

153
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,208
Yep!

154
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,250
I'm tough, huh?

155
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,291
[BIG SISTER]
You sure are.

156
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,500
So, is that what the
two of you were like

157
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,791
back when you
were growing up?

158
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,500
Yui did cry pretty easily
when she was little.

159
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,375
But, since then, she's grown
into a strong and capable woman.

160
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,750
She sure has.

161
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,458
Do you miss having her
around all the time,

162
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,750
now that she's so busy?

00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,833
I'm not some little kid
who needs her hand held.

164
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,458
[RETSU laughs]

165
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,625
[TIA grunts]
So heavy!

166
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,666
At least tell me what
you're making for her.

167
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,666
No way.

168
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,875
Oh, Retsu! You're back.

169
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:34,666
Uh?!

170
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,416
Uh.

171
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,208
[TIA]
Huh?!

172
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,916
Why are you here?

173
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,208
You two know each other?

174
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,708
That's so sweet. Thanks!

175
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,166
Now, don't forget to clean
it when you get a chance.

176
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,833
So, you said you're visiting
from another country?

177
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,458
Tia and I aren't from here.

178
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:55,250
Oh, "Tia"? Is that who you
came here with, uh, sorry?

179
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,708
Oh. Sara.

180
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,541
It's nice to meet
you. My name's--

181
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,416
[SARA]
Yuinshiel Asteria!

182
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,291
[gasps]

183
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,916
Like I said, I saw you on TV.

184
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's really cool
meeting a celebrity!

185
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,625
Right. Well, thanks.
You can call me Yui.

186
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,958
'Kay, I will.

187
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,833
The guy who gave us a ride
here said you're always

188
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,333
working really hard and
you're a great person too.

189
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,041
Well, that's very nice of him.

190
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,833
He said he'd like to have you
for a daughter-in-law,

191
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,625
but his son's no prince...

192
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,833
You're going to make me blush!

193
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,333
But he also thought it would be
better if you didn't go around

194
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,500
telling everyone in the world
what your measurements are.

195
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,083
[gasps] No! I didn't mean to!

196
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:33,083
[SARA] I like you!
You're funny. [laughs]

197
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,166
There you go.

198
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,375
I guess you're gettin'
the hang of this.

199
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,666
[laughs]

200
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,916
If you want, you can sit down
and have a cup with us.

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,250
Really? Yay!

202
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,625
[RETSU] Just until a customer
comes, all right?

203
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,875
Yep!

204
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,541
I'm surprised Sara's
not with you.

205
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,416
Yeah. She's busy right now.

206
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,125
She said something
about "forced labor"

207
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,625
and went off to
run some errands.

208
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,083
I had to stay behind
as a hostage.

209
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,583
[RENA]
Hm...

210
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,500
Wait, she doesn't know what
she's talking about, Renny!

211
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,666
We're actually
the victims here!

212
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,958
Thanks a lot, Sara...

213
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,791
You don't always have to
look so scary. Now, smile!

214
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,541
[RETSU]
Hey, stop manhandling her!

215
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,291
You're going to hurt my
precious little Renny!

216
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,208
Wait a sec. What do
you mean, "yours"?

217
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,625
You and Rena may be friends,

218
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,541
but it's not like
she's bound to you.

219
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,541
[RETSU]
Huh?

220
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,875
Break's over.

221
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,000
You're expected back at
the stall, so get moving.

222
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,583
[RETSU]
Aww...

223
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,125
[growls]

224
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,541
Uh! I thought I could enjoy a
little time with my friends,

225
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,708
but no, around here it's
all work, work, work!

226
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,041
We'll see you later.

227
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:39,625
[door closes]

228
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,000
[YUI]
Oh, wow!

229
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,000
You've been traveling around
the world all this time?

230
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,000
That's impressive for
somebody so young.

231
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,541
Yep!

232
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,583
Except now we're stuck in this
city as indentured servants.

233
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,208
I don't know when we'll
be able to leave again.

234
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,750
Huh?

235
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,541
I was sent to run errands, but
they're holding Tia hostage.

236
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,166
The poor thing must be
so frightened right now!

237
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,291
What are you doing?

238
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,875
Helping Tia. Can you
take me to her?

239
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,625
Uh.

240
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,083
[RETSU]
Aww.

241
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,375
And I thought I was finally
gonna get some time

242
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,875
to bond with little Renny!

243
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,958
[RETSU gasping]

244
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,875
[YUI] Impossible! I never
imagined it would be you!

245
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,333
What?

246
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,250
These poor, frightened girls
are guests in our country

247
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,458
and you decided to turn
them into your slaves?

248
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,333
That's it! I've had enough!

249
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,666
Whatever she told
you, it's a lie!

250
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,958
Seriously?

251
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,041
[gasps]

252
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,208
Sara...

253
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,541
[whines]

254
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,416
[TIA laughs]

255
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,666
This is so much fun! We haven't
cooked together in a while.

256
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:50,083
I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

257
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,666
We didn't like it,
but we had to stop you.

258
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,708
I know. Thank you for that.

259
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,208
[TIA]
Did you see Kei?

260
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,791
I did.

261
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,375
I wish I understood what's going
on with her, but I have no idea.

262
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,416
[TIA] If you two are in a fight,
I'm sure we can sort it out.

263
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,708
Once Sara gets back,
we can all go see Kei!

264
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,458
And then after the two
of you have made up,

265
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,458
we'll go back home with Sara.

266
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,375
We'll all live together again.

267
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,583
It'll be just like
old times, right?

268
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,125
But I've got Yui now.

269
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,958
Yui? You mean you're
bound to someone?

270
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,750
Cool! You can bring her along!

271
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:25,125
You'll be together forever,
just like me and Sara!

272
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,750
That does sound really nice.

273
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,750
[TIA]
So let's do it!

274
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,000
I can't. Yui has... obligations.

275
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,541
[TIA]
Hm?

276
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,291
[RETSU]
Whoa! Look at this line!

277
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,291
A skewer sampler
please, Highness!

278
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,875
Thank you so much for
waiting. Take care!

279
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,541
Ugh. I'm so worn out,
and I'm starving.

280
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,000
You're earning your
food this time.

281
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,500
I won't let you dine
and dash again.

282
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,000
Sorry, Retty. I guess I
misunderstood before.

283
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,791
I think it's probably
more accurate to say

284
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,583
that you were lied to before.

285
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,333
Quit spacing out!

286
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,916
Honestly! This is
the thanks I get

287
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,166
for letting you stay until you
could work off your bill?

288
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,875
I should've just reported you!

289
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,250
[SARA whines]

290
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,583
Oh, come on, you can give
the poor girl a break.

291
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,000
Get a little rest, Sara.
We can take it from here.

292
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,833
Huh? Uh?

293
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,166
Thanks!

294
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,125
[RETSU]
Okay, fine, you can go.

295
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,291
[SARA]
Woo-hoo!

296
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,666
[RETSU] You're too soft
on her, you know!

Oh. What a long day!

307
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,541
It was really nice of you to
help run the stall with us.

308
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,416
Actually, I had a lot of fun!

309
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,916
You were a total natural.

310
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,041
Yeah! The skewers
were delicious.

311
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,416
[laughs] I'm glad, thank you!

312
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,000
So, a love for cooking
is something

313
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,541
you and Renny have in common?

314
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,875
I wonder what she's making
over at our place right now.

315
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,083
[YUI] Huh? I didn't know Rena
came to your place today.

316
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,208
Maybe you should head over there
and see what she's been up to.

317
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,583
Uh...

318
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,458
Hey, hold on. You know
somebody named Rena?

319
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,958
[YUI]
Huh?

320
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,166
It's all finished.

321
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,625
Aw, yay!

322
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,958
[RETSU, SARA]
We're back!

323
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,166
Oh! Looks like they're
done working the stall.

324
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,791
[YUI]
Something smells good.

325
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,500
[gasps]

326
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,333
[SARA]
Rena! [laughs]

327
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,833
Sara.

328
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,166
So, have you actually been
with Yui for all these years?

329
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,416
[RENA]
Uh!

330
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,916
Yui? The person you were
telling me about before?

331
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,375
Um, hello!

332
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,875
My name is Yuinshiel Asteria,
and you must be Tia.

333
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,083
Nice to meet you.
I'm a Regalia, like Rena.

334
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:34,833
Huh?

335
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,291
[RETSU]
Hm?

336
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,791
[SARA]
Wait. What?

337
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,000
[RENA]
Mm.

338
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,916
Really? You mean she
finally found somebody?

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,875
I'm so happy for you, Rena!

340
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:51,041
[YUI] I see now. Sara and
Tia, they're like us.

341
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,666
Yeah. Well, obviously, there's
something I'm missing here.

342
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,166
Did you finish it, Renny?

343
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,833
Uh! Yeah.

344
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,500
Oh, wow! For me?

345
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,458
I wanted to make you
something special.

346
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,250
We put some love into it!

347
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,291
You help so many people
without asking for anything.

348
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,375
So, thanks.

349
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,666
This is what you were
up to all day?

350
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,333
[RENA]
Mm-hm.

351
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,958
I love it, thank you! And
thank you for helping, Tia.

352
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,000
My pleasure!

353
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,916
Wait a sec. I think
I've seen you before!

354
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,083
--Are you the Booby Empress?
--[YUI]  What?!

355
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,541
That's right, the Booby Empress:

356
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,291
not just super nice
and an amazing cook,

357
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,833
she's also got a rockin' body!

358
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:30,708
She does!

359
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,125
Hey! Please don't call me that.

360
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,583
[laughing]

361
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,000
Aw, not you too, Rena?

362
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,166
[BOTH laugh]

363
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,750
No matter what, we'll
always be together, right?

364
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,458
Right!

365
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,666
So, anybody wanna
piece o' cake?

366
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,833
Yeah! Make sure I get
a really big piece!

367
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,916
Two really, really
big ones for me!

368
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,166
I'm not sure you
two deserve any.

369
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,333
[TIA] Aww! But we worked
so hard! Please?

370
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,375
In fact, I think I
deserve three slices.

371
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,375
[SARA] Well, in that case,
I deserve four, at least!
