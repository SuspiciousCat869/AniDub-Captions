She is the source of
power for all Regalia.

The power of light. Lux.

37
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,458
[YUI] Mama and Abel showed us
what was really important.

38
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,583
We need to pass on what
we've learned from them.

[JOHANN]
Don't be so foolish!

128
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,791
If you tie your fate
to the fate of others,

129
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,375
you'll all end up dead!

And then what?!

Once you die, your lives
amount to nothing!

But for my soulless dolls,
life and death don't matter.

And they give nothing

I don't need your sympathy.

166
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,416
I was born alone and
I lived my life alone.

167
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,166
I'm going to die alone.
Why should it be any different?

168
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,708
[gasps]

169
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,958
What're you doing?

170
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,291
--She's leaving us.
--What?

171
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,208
Lux, wait!

172
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,291
Take this. I want
you to have it.

173
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,583
It means we're family,
and no matter where we are,

174
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,291
we're always together.

175
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,750
[JOHANN] Huh.
What are you doing here?

176
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,958
It's too late
to change anything.

177
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,250
[JOHANN]
Just let me die...

178
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,000
What's going on?

179
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,041
[JOHANN]
I don't understand.

180
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,500
Does this mean you're
coming with me?

181
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,833
[JOHANN]
Goodbye, Yuinshiel Asteria.

182
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,541
I might have been
a better man...

183
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,875
...if someone like you
had been the one who made me.

184
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,208
[gasps]

185
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,416
Look at the sky.

186
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
We made it home, Kei!

187
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,250
[giggles]

188
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,708
[BOTH laugh]

189
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,250
[BOTH giggle]

190
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,916
[laughs]

191
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,000
[RENA] What do you plan
to do after all this?

192
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,958
[YUI]
Hmm...

193
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, first, I'm
going to go home.

194
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,375
Then, I'm going to take a bath,
and eat a big, hot meal!

195
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,125
And after that...
I think I'll sleep for a while.

196
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,500
That's not what I meant
and you know it!

197
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,083
Just kidding.

198
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,958
After dinner, I thought
we could all get together

199
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,375
and talk about it.
Sound okay?

200
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,666
Okay.

201
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,375
[YUI]
Good.

202
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,833
Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

203
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,791
I know it.

204
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,083
[giggles]

205
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,708
[laughs]

206
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,083
Heh.

207
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,333
[giggles]

208
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,875
[sighs]
Yes!

209
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,041
[gasps]

210
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,833
Whatever's next,
we'll face it together!

211
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,875
Yeah!
