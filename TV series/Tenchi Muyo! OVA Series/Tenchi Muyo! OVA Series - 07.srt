- HUH?  YOU!
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU?

12
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,708
DON'T COME
INTO MY ROOM LIKE THAT.

13
00:02:55,791 --> 00:03:00,083
- BUT I WORRY ABOUT YOU, TENCHI.
THINK OF ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

14
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,583
CAN I HELP IT IF I
WANT YOU TO BE SAFE?

UH-OH.

36
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,916
HOW DO I GET BACK
TO MY NORMAL SELF?

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,875
WHAT'S THAT?
OH, I REMEMBER.

00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,416
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

43

- ( grunts )

44
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,708

THIS IS FOR YOU.

00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,041
- THAT IS FROM THE ROYAL TREE.

49
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,000
- TSUNAMI SAID IT WAS FOR YOU.

50
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,791
SHE SAID IT WAS RYO-OH'S SEED.

51
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,791
RYO-OH'S?

52
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,666

I'M SORRY.

- MISS WASHU,

68
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,041
YOU'RE THE #1 GENIUS SCIENTIST
IN THE GALAXY.

69
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,416
AND THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE
TO ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME.

70
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,208
- NO!  NOT UNLESS--

71
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,750
- UNLESS YOU CALL ME
LITTLE WASHU!

72
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,500

73
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,333

- EGH!  NO!

75
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,125
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING
UNLESS YOU CALL ME LITTLE WASHU!

76
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:57,625
- HOW CAN I CALL YOU LITTLE
WHEN YOU'RE 20,000 YEARS OLD?

77
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,333
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
LITTLE WASHU.

78
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,791
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

79
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,875
CAN YOU BUILD ME A UNIT
TO PLANT RYO-OH'S SEED?

80
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,625
- OF COURSE.
I CAN DO THAT. THAT'S EASY!

81
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,291
- OF COURSE. 
AFTER ALL,

82
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,916
YOU ARE THE #1 GENIUS SCIENTIST
IN THE GALAXY.

- OF COURSE.  I'M THE #1 GENIUS
SCIENTIST IN THE UNIVERSE!

( laughs ) 

85
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,500
- ( laughs ) 
- BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

86
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,333
( groaning )

87
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,708
THAT WOULD BE MY
STANDARD ANSWER,

88
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,291
BUT FOR YOU, I'M GONNA DO IT

89
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,916
BECAUSE I REALLY REALLY LIKE
YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,875

00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,958
HUH?

93
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,833
- HEY, JUST KIDDING.

94
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,583
THERE IS SOMETHING WE CAN USE.
KAGATO MADE IT.

95
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,583
BUT THERE ARE
NO FUNNY TRICKS INVOLVED.

96
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,000
AND THE INTERIOR CONFORMS
TO JURAI'S ENVIRONMENT.

97
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,958
IT'S REALLY A GOOD PIECE
OF WORK.

98
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,416
- WHY DID HE MAKE IT?
- WELL, KAGATO'S REASON

99
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,833
FOR HAVING RYOKO ATTACK PLANET
JURAI WAS TO GET TSUNAMI.

100
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,416
- AH.
- SO THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO DO

101
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,625
IS TO ENTER ALL OF THE DATA
ON YOUR KEY.

102
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,583
- AND RYO-OH
CAN BE RESURRECTED.

103
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,833
- ( birds chirping )

LOOK! ALL THESE CARROTS
WILL BE FOR YOU.

107
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,750
HEY!
HOLD ON NOW.

108
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,375
THEY DON'T GROW THAT FAST.
- ( whimpers )

109
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,750

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,833

112
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:35,916
- OH, I WONDER WHAT
SHE'LL DO NOW. ( laughs )

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,125
FOMI MISSED HER CHANCE WITH KEN.
SHE'S SO CLUMSY.

114
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,458
( laughs ) 

115
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,875
OH NO.

- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?
HUH?

122

- WELL, WE ARE READING COMICS
FOR GIRLS.

123
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,291
- COMICS FOR GIRLS?
WHAT IS THAT?

124
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,583
- STORIES ABOUT A BOY AND GIRL
FALLING IN LOVE.

125
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,291
- HUH?
- THEY'RE ABOUT THE ART OF LOVE.

126
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,750
IT'S A HANDBOOK ON HOW TO WIN
THE LOVE OF SOMEONE YOU LOVE,

127
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,416
EARTH-STYLE.

135
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,458

I REALLY DON'T WANT TO--
WELL, BE RIGHT BACK.

OH, WHERE'S AYEKA?
I THOUGHT SHE WAS WITH YOU.

146
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,291

SHE'S JUST ON HER WAY
TO GET AYEKA.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,500
BUT I NEED TO SEE YOU.

152
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,500
- AH, YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING,
AREN'T YOU?

153
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,041
- BINGO.

- HMM.  BLOOD, BODY FLUIDS,
HAIR SAMPLES.

160
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,458
THAT'S JUST ABOUT ALL

00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,583
- TENCHI, FEBRUARY
IS THE BEST MONTH.

322
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,208
AS OUR RELATIONSHIP DEEPENS,

323
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,333
WE WILL HAVE THE BLESSINGS
OF THOSE AROUND US.

324
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,208
- WOULDN'T BLESSINGS FOR A MATCH

325
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,291
WITH A MONSTER BE
POINTLESS, TENCHI?

326
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,625
- IT WAS FATE--
FATE THAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

327
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,041
WASN'T IT, TENCHI?

328
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,916
- TENCHI!
- TENCHI!

329
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,291
- Ayeka: HE'S A BETTER MATCH
WITH ME.

330
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,500
- YOU KNOW, THOSE BOOKS
ARE 10 YEARS OLD AT LEAST.

331
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,958
- Both: WHAT?!

332
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,791
- BUT THIS ONE HERE
IS HOT OFF THE PRESS.

333
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,083
NOW LET'S SEE.

334
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:10,000
OH, BOTH OF YOU ARE THE ABSOLUTE
WORST MATCH WITH TENCHI!

335
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,041
- Both: EH?
- I, ON THE OTHER HAND,

336
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:16,250
AM, UM, OH!
A PERFECT MATCH.

337
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,958
- OH NO. OH!

338
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,666
- I'M SO HAPPY!

339
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,375
- ( all grumbling )

340
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,791
- FINE, ON TO MY NEXT OPTION.

341
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:31,041
I'LL JUST WORK ON THE OLD MAN
AND MAKE MYSELF THE FIANCEE.

342
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,916
GRANDFATHER?

343
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,791
I WOULD LIKE
TO BUILD A FAMILY WITH TENCHI.

344
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,125
PLEASE HELP ME.
- HMMM.

345
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,583
YOU HAVE BEEN THINKING
FAR AHEAD.

346
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,416
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE MY BLESSING.

347
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,291
- ( laughs )
PIECE OF CAKE!

348
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,708
OOH!

349
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,583
- YOU ARE SUCH A HARDWORKING
YOUNG LADY, MIHOSHI.

350
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:56,541
- WELL, I MUST DO SOMETHING
IN RETURN FOR YOUR KINDNESS.

351
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,708
- I THANK YOU.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

352
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,333
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND,
MIHOSHI?

353
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,666
- OH.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF TENCHI?

354
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,875
- OH, THIS--
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

355
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,166
- IF YOU WERE HIS GIRLFRIEND,
I COULD REST EASIER.

356
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,375
- BUT, UH,
WE'RE BOTH SO YOUNG.

357
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,125
AND WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT ME.

358
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,708
( laughs )

359
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,541
- YOU UNDERSTAND?

360
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,125
YOU MUST DELIVER THIS TO TENCHI.

361
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,000
THEN I WILL GIVE YOU THE CARROTS
THAT YOU LOVE SO MUCH

362
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,416
WITHOUT TENCHI KNOWING.

363
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,875
- ( meows )

364
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,708
- OH!

365
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,875
NO NEED FOR SUCH HASTE.

366
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,208
- ( meows )

367
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,083
- NOW I MUST LEAVE ALSO.

368
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,000
- HEY! HELLO.

369
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,750
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

370
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,583

- ( meows )

373
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,000
- "I AM BUT A HUMBLE SCHOOLGIRL.

374
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:20,166
THERE IS SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

375
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,875
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU
AFTER SCHOOL"?!

376
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,333
- OH, TENCHI!
GREAT TIMING!

377
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,666
CAN YOU GET ME SOME VEGETABLES
FOR DINNER?

378
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,875
- OH, SURE.

379
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,458
- I CAN'T GET AWAY RIGHT NOW!

380
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,875
- ( creatures beeping )

381
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,458
- ( floor creaking )

382
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,625
- HEY!
IS THAT RYO-OHKI?

383
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:02,625
OH.

384
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,166
WHAAA!

385
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,333
THEY'RE GONE!
THEY'RE EMPTY!

386
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,583
OH, I KNEW IT!

387
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,250
IT IS RYO-OHKI!

388
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,958
YOU STUPID LITTLE--
AYYY!

389
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,375
( shudders )

390
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,416
- TENCHI?

391
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
- UH UH UH...

392
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,291
- SO THIS IS THE
REASON FOR THE WEIRD

393
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,166
ENERGY REACTION I DETECTED.

394
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,416
COME ON, COME ON,
BACK TO THE POND.

395
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,583
- ( meows ) 

396
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,375
- UH, ALL RIGHT THEN.

397
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,083
BUT ONLY ONE
FOR EACH OF YOU.

398
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,250
- ( meowing ) 

399
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,958
- TENCHI, DON'T YOU
HAVE THE VEGETABLES YET?

400
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,958
HUH?

401
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,208
WOW!
SO MANY RYO-OHKIS!  WOW!

402
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,583
- SUCH NAUGHTY CRYSTALS.

403
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,208
- ( all meowing ) 

404
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,958
- UH, CARROTS ALL GONE.

405
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,916
BETTER GET BACK TO WORK.

406
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:13,333
- OH, WHERE IS TENCHI?

407
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,625
ISN'T IT AFTER SCHOOL YET?

408
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE
TENCHI NEVER SHOWED UP.

409
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,791
( coughing )

410
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:49,083
NO MORE GIRLS' COMICS FOR ME.

411
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,125
OOOHHHH!

412
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,833
- YOU AWAKE NOW, PRINCESS?

413
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,958
- AWAKE AND FROZEN, THANK YOU.

414
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,458
- DON'T YOU THINK THERE ARE
TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE WAY,

415
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,000
LIKE WASHU AND MIHOSHI?

416
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,958
- ON THAT ISSUE,
I WILL COOPERATE WITH YOU.

417
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,125
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

418
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,458
- ( both grunting )

419
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,083
- FIRST WE'LL CREATE
A FORCE FIELD

420
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,583
AT THE DOOR TO
LOCK WASHU INSIDE.

421
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,875
AND THEN WE'LL MAKE MIHOSHI
GO BACK TO THE GALAXY POLICE

422
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:25,916
FOR A WHILE.

423
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,416
- MY, YOU'RE SO DEVIOUS,
AREN'T YOU?

424
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,833
- ( both laugh )

425
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,208
- EARTH STYLE OR WHATEVER--
BOY MEETS GIRL.

426
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,250
AFTER ALL, TENCHI AND I
ARE BOTH HUMANOID TYPES.

427
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,708
WHAT WE WANT
HAS GOT TO BE THE SAME THING.

428
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,583
- I'LL WASH AND WASH
AND PRESENT MYSELF TO TENCHI

429
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,625
IN THIS BEAUTIFUL SKIN.
AND HE'LL SAY,

430
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,875
"AYEKA, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL."

431
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,708
- NO NEED TO BE AFRAID,
TENCHI.

432
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,875
I'M THE HUMANOID
OF YOUR DREAMS.

433
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:52,166
- ( both laughing )

434
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,458
- ( clapping )

435
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,583
AHEM!

436
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,791
HONORABLE SIR,
COULD I HONORABLY HONOR--

437
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,000
UH, HUMBLY--
COULD I USE YOUR PHONE?

438
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,500
- MM-HMM.

439
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,125
- ( ringing )

440
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,125
- I'LL GET IT!

441
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,500
HELLO?
MASAKI HOME.

442
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,708
OH, THAT SOUNDS AS IF
I'D MARRIED INTO THE FAMILY.

443
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,666
HOW EMBARRASSING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

444
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,916
YOU THINK IS SOUNDS THAT WAY?

445
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,541
- ( grumbling )

446
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,250
GET A GRIP!
AND LISTEN UP, DETECTIVE.

447
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:31,083
- AH!
- ( panting ) ARGH!

448
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:35,250
THIS IS YOUR VERY NASTY SUPERIOR
AT THE GALAXY POLICE, MIHOSHI.

449
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,125
- OH MY!  HELLO.

450
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,750
BUT HOW ON EARTH
DID YOU KNOW I WAS HERE?

451
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,708
- AN UNIMPORTANT DETAIL.

452
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,875
NOW COME BACK QUICKLY
TO MAKE YOUR REPORT.

453
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,625
- YES!  DETECTIVE MIHOSHI 
IS ON HER WAY.

454
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,458
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, SIR!

455
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,625
- GOOD.

456
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:54,500
( laughs )

457
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:57,166
GULLIBLE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

458
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,583
- ( slurping )
- HMMM?

459
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,250
- HMMM.
WHAT DO I DO?

460
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,916
I NEED A SPACESHIP.

461
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,083
WHAT DO I DO?

462
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,500
HMM?

463
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:10,208
OH, AYEKA.
- DON'T WORRY.

464
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,041
LET'S TALK TO WASHU.
I'M SURE SHE WILL BE ABLE

465
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,833
TO GET YOU A SPACESHIP OR TWO.
- REALLY?  REALLY?!

466
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,666
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

467
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:22,833
- YOUR SHUTTLE FELL INTO
SUBSPACE AROUND HERE, RIGHT?

468
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,916
SO NOW
WE JUST NEED TO FIND IT.

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,125
- CAN YOU DO THAT?

470
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:30,958
- POLICE SHIPS ARE RARE
IN THIS AREA,

471
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,666
SO IT SHOULD BE EASY
TO LOCATE.

472
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,416
NOW LET'S SEE.
THERE IT IS!

473
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,833
- OH, WONDERFUL!
THANK YOU.

474
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,291
- ( beeping )
- ( clapping )

475
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,833
- THERE IT IS.
THERE'S MY SPACESHIP.

476
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:49,791
- ( both gasp )

477
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,375
- ( both screaming )

478
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:59,083
- OH NO!
WHAT DO WE DO?

479
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,083
- ( roaring )

480
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,791
- HAVING A FOOLISH DAUGHTER

481
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,291
IS MORE WORK FOR MOM!

482
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:12,500
- WELL, THAT WAS SURE SIMPLE.

483
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,750
- SHUT UP.

484
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,208
IF ONLY I HAD ALL MY GEMS.

485
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,583
- BYE, MIHOSHI.

486
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:29,208
- TENCHI, THANK YOU!
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

487
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:30,416
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

488
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,833
AND GOOD LUCK, MIHOSHI.

489
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,791
- I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU
OR THE TIME I SPENT HERE.

490
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:39,375
SO I--

491
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,791
- MIHOSHI,
ARE YOU REALLY GOING HOME?

492
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,875
- YES, I HAVE TO
BECAUSE MY WORK--

493
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,583
- NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO!

494
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,291
( crying )

495
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,916
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T WANT TO.

496
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,083
I-- ( crying )

497
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:59,916
- SASAMI, LET'S NOT
MAKE IT DIFFICULT NOW.

498
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,208
- ( sobbing )

499
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:07,166
- MIHOSHI, YOU CAN COME BACK
ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED, CAN'T YOU?

500
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,125
- YOU MEAN YOU DON'T MIND
IF I COME BACK HERE?

501
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:14,375
- DO YOU REALLY, TENCHI?

502
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,375
- YES, OF COURSE.

503
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:19,041
REALLY, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO COME BACK HERE.

504
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT'S SO NICE.

505
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:25,625
I WILL COME BACK
AS SOON AS I FINISH MY WORK.

506
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:29,083
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, TENCHI.

507
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,416
- WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

508
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,000
- WELL, AT LEAST
SHE WON'T BE BACK FOR A WHILE.

509
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,750
- COME BACK SOON, MIHOSHI!
COME BACK SOON!

510
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,458
- Both: BYE BYE NOW!

511
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:56,583
DON'T COME BACK
FOR A LONG TIME.

512
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,666
- ( whimpering )
- THAT'LL DO IT.

513
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,166
THE LAST OF 'EM
IS OUT OF THE WAY.

514
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,000
- ( grunting )
- WHAT? WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?

515
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:12,083
GOOD LUCK TO ME?
- YOU--

516
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,333
- AND THAT I'M PERFECT
FOR TENCHI?

517
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,875
WELL, THAT'S AWFULLY NICE
OF YOU TO SAY.

518
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,458
PRINCESS, YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

519
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,916
- ( Ayeka whimpering )

520
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,000
- MIHOSHI, WE WILL
REACH THE RENDEZVOUS POINT

521
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,625
WITH THE MAIN SHIP SHORTLY.

522
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,750
DOCKING COMPLETE.

523
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:43,166
SUPER INTERSPACE HOTLINE
NOW OPEN.

524
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,583
MIHOSHI,
YOUR PASSWORD, PLEASE.

525
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,208
MIHOSHI?

526
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,750
MIHOSHI, YOUR PASSWORD.

527
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,916
- OH!
( laughs )

528
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,458
- MIHOSHI?
- YES?

529
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:02,291
- WE ARE READY
FOR SUPER INTERSPACE HOTLINE.

530
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,916
PLEASE SAY YOUR PASSWORD.

531
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,666
- UM, I DON'T KNOW.
THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN

532
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,500
WHO LIVED IN A SHOE?

533
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,541
- PASSWORD CONFIRMED.
- WOW.

534
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:14,083
- THE LINE HAS BEEN CONNECTED.

535
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,958
- ( scanning )

536
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:18,125
- REPORT TRANSFER COMPLETE.

537
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,375
- GREAT, THEN LET'S GO BACK.

538
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,458
- YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE A
VERBAL REPORT TO YOUR SUPERIOR.

539
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,375
- OKAY.

540
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,791
- YOU DID IT,
DETECTIVE MIHOSHI!

541
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,791
OH, I HAD A FEELING IT WAS YOU!

542
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,208
I HAD A FEELING.

543
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,500
TWO DAYS AGO,
THERE WAS A REPORT

544
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,000
FROM THE SPECIAL UNIT
ASSIGNED TO RESCUE YOU.

545
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:39,041
THEY DETECTED A SHOCKWAVE
AND AN ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE

546
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,416
BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED
BY A HUGE EXPLOSION.

547
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,875
THE HEADQUARTERS
DID AN ENERGY SPECTRUM ANALYSIS

548
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,958
AND CAME UP WITH A RESULT
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

549
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,625
THE EXPLOSION
WAS FROM SOJA.

550
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:50,041
THEN I RECEIVED YOUR REPORT.
OH, YOU DID IT!

551
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,791
CONGRATULATIONS.

552
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,958
NOW MY JOB IS SAFE
AND YOU CAN GO BACK PROUDLY

553
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:58,041
TO THE CENTRAL OFFICE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

554
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,000
UH, WHAT'S WRONG, MIHOSHI?

555
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,958
- OUCH.

556
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,041
- WHAT?!
YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK?

557
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:11,125
- RIGHT.  I,
FIRST CLASS DETECTIVE MIHOSHI,

558
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,541
WISH A REASSIGNMENT
TO PATROL THE SPECIAL AREA

559
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,208
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

560
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,833
- BUT--

561
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:20,916
BUT WHY?
WHAT FOR?

562
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,250
YOU'RE TURNING DOWN
THE CENTRAL OFFICE?

563
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,875
CENTRAL COMMAND?

564
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,000
YOUR GRANDFATHER--
I MEAN THE MARSHAL--

565
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,625
IS LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU AND--

566
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,625
- NO, I'M NOT A CHILD ANYMORE

567
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,250
AND PLEASE DO NOT WORRY
ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER.

568
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:36,125
- UH, WON'T YOU RECONSIDER?

569
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:39,000
BESIDES, THE EARTH
ISN'T OUR TERRITORY.

570
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,208
GALAXY POLICE CAN'T GO THERE
WITHOUT JURAI'S PERMISSION.

571
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:45,583
- I ALREADY
HAVE THEIR PERMISSION.

572
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:46,750
WHAT?!

573
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,708
- HE SAID
THAT HE WANTED ME TO COME BACK.

574
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,291
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

575
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,000
- WHAT I MEAN IS--

576
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,000
WHAT HE SAID IS--

577
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:59,041
TENCHI ASKED ME
TO COME BACK AND HE--

578
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,458
OH, HOW EMBARRASSING!

579
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:04,500
OH, CHIEF, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MAKING ME SAY THIS!

580
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,125
OH!
( laughs )

581
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,458
THEN I-- UH--

582
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:12,083
- YUKINOJYO, WHO IS TENCHI?

583
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,166
- HE IS RELATED
TO THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

584
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,000
- HUH?
- HOWEVER,

585
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:19,250
DUE TO SOME MISSING DATA,
EVEN I CANNOT BE CERTAIN.

586
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,416
- MY GOD!

587
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
DETECTIVE MIHOSHI!
- ( blabbering )

588
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,666
- HEY YOU!

589
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,375
LISTEN, MIHOSHI!

590
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,208
- HUH?

591
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,833
I'M SORRY,
MY REPORT IS FINISHED.

592
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,250
FIRST CLASS DETECTIVE MIHOSHI
IS ON HER WAY.

593
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,125
- WAIT, MIHOSHI!  NO!

594
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,458
- ( computer tone playing )
- LET'S GO, YUKINOJYO.

595
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,208
- YES, MA'AM.

596
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,916
- HEY, MIHOSHI!
MIHOSHI!

597
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,666
OH GOD.  HMM.

598
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,958
OH, WELL, I GUESS
THIS TAKES PRIORITY FOR NOW.

599
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,166
- ( floor creaking )

600
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,541
- FINALLY.

601
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:15,708
TENCHI, TONIGHT I CAN FINALLY--

602
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,583
( laughs ) 

603
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:20,708
TENCHI, YOU AWAKE?
ARE YOU?

604
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,458
- UH, WHAT'S UP?
IT'S REALLY LATE AT NIGHT.

605
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,541
- ( sighs )
TELL ME, TENCHI,

606
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,708
WHO DO YOU LOVE?
ME OR AYEKA?

607
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,083
- WELL...

608
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,916
- PLEASE ANSWER ME, TENCHI.

609
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,708
- UH...

610
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:39,750
- YOU LOVE AYEKA.
OH!

611
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,875
YOU DON'T LIKE ME
BECAUSE I DO THINGS

612
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,666
LIKE PUNCH HOLES IN THE CEILING
AND GO THROUGH WALLS

613
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,166
AND FLY IN THE AIR.
IS THAT IT?

614
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,041
- I DON'T MIND
ANY OF THAT.

615
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,250
- THEN ANSWER ME, TENCHI.

616
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,250
- I LOVE YOU, OF COURSE!

617
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,750
- ( gasps ) TENCHI!

618
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,208
- RYOKO!
- Both: ALL RIGHT!

619
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,791
( both laughing )

620
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,791
Both: SHHH!

621
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,333
- OKAY.

622
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:09,291
YOU WON'T GET ANY SLEEP,
TENCHI.

623
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,125
- ( pulsating )

624
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:14,708
- TONIGHT WE ARE GOING
TO GET REAL WET.

625
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,250
OH YEAH.

626
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,916
- ( croaking )

627
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,375
- AYEKA!

628
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:35,166
- I'M GLAD I HAVE
THAT FORCE FIELD SET UP.

629
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,666
CALLOUS PERSON,
TRYING TO GET INTO HIS ROOM

630
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,250
WITHOUT EVEN KNOCKING.

631
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,416
- YOU'RE CHEATING, AYEKA!

632
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,708
- CHEATING?  YOU'RE A FINE ONE
TO TALK ABOUT CHEATING.

633
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,166
- THAT REALLY
WAS A CHEAP TRICK.

634
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,958
- AND WHO FELL
FOR THE CHEAP TRICK? HUH?

635
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,333
- HMM!

636
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,833
- YOU JUST TRY AND LAY
A FINGER ON TENCHI.

637
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,291
I WON'T LET YOU!

638
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,291
- ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN.
YOU CAN GO FIRST.

639
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,500
I DON'T CARE.

640
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GO FIRST?

641
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,625
- WELL, YOU'RE TRYING TO GET HIM
INTO THE SACK TOO, AREN'T YOU?

642
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:08,958
- WHAT?
- WELL, AREN'T YOU?

643
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,916
IT'S OKAY, I DON'T MIND.

644
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,916
- I AM NOT A WOMAN
OF LOOSE MORALS!

645
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
- REALLY?

646
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,791
HMM.
- WHAT?  WHAT IS IT?

647
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,083
- I SPY A LITTLE LIGHT MAKEUP,

648
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,625
A NEW NIGHTIE...

649
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,125
( sniffs )

650
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,416
AH, I CAN ACTUALLY
SMELL YOUR HORMONES.

651
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,291
"MY MIND AND BODY ARE PURE!
MAKE LOVE TO ME!"

652
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,541
THAT'S THE MESSAGE
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ACROSS.

653
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,666
- NO, YOU'RE A LIAR!

654
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,666
- YOU LOVE TENCHI, DON'T YOU?

655
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,875
- OF COURSE I--
( whimpers )

656
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:45,666
- THEN WHY? IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO WANT TO BE WITH HIM

657
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,500
AND MAKE LOVE WITH HIM
IF YOU LOVE HIM.

658
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:53,125
- BUT IS HE-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT ME.

659
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,750
AND-- AND IT'S--

660
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,791
AND IT'S--
- AND IT'S--

661
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,291
- AND IT'S JUST TOO EARLY
FOR US.

662
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,875
- OH, WELL,
IN THAT CASE,

663
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:05,041
I'LL GO FIRST.
- HMM. HUH?

664
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,833
NOW HOLD IT! THE POINT IS
NOT WHO'S GOING TO GO FIRST!

665
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

666
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:13,833
YOU!
YOU WON'T GET PAST ME.

667
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:18,000
- FINE. WE'LL DO THINGS THE WAY
YOU LIKE TO. WE'LL FIGHT!

668
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,083
- ( both grunting )

669
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,875
- Sasami: TENCHI?

670
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,625
AYEKA?

671
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,166
RYOKO?

672
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,250
ARE YOU HERE?
ARE YOU?

673
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,208
RYO-OHKI?

674
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,500
WHERE DID EVERYONE GO?

675
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:42,958
TENCHI?

676
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:47,375
- ( glass shattering )
- AHHH!

677
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,666
OH, TENCHI.

678
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,666
TENCHI, YOU--
I'M HURT.

679
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,833
TENCHI, WATCH OUT.

680
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:08,291
WAIT, DON'T TAKE HIM AWAY.

681
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:11,083
TENCHI-- DON'T TAKE HIM AWAY!

682
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:14,791
NO, DON'T TAKE HIM AWAY!

683
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:20,916
NO, STOP!
DON'T TAKE HIM!

684
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,291
NO, WAIT.

685
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,916
PLEASE DON'T.

686
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,541
DON'T TAKE HIM AWAY, TOKIMI.

687
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:32,208
AYEKA, WHERE ARE YOU?

688
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,166
RYO-OHKI?
WHERE ARE YOU?

689
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,916
AYEKA?
AYEKA?

690
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,875
- ( grunting )

691
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,000
- LISTEN UP, PRINCESS.
YOU LEAVE TENCHI TO ME.

692
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:46,291
HE'S TOO MUCH TO HANDLE
FOR A LITTLE GIRL LIKE YOU.

693
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,416
- ( grunting )

694
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,416
- I'M NOT SHUTTING UP
OR GIVING UP!

695
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,083
- ( Sasami crying )

696
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,000
( knocking )
- HUH?

697
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:18,125
- TENCHI?  TENCHI?
- ( door closes )

698
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,916
- WHAT'S WRONG, SASAMI?

699
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,791
- I HAD A SCARY DREAM.

700
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,291
CAN I SLEEP WITH YOU?

701
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:26,541
- WHERE'S AYEKA?

702
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:30,166
- SHE'S WITH RYOKO.

703
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,333
- Washu: FIGHTING AGAIN,
I'M SURE.

704
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,625
- Both: HUH?

705
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,500
- Tenchi:
THOSE TWO ARE SO IMPOSSIBLE.

706
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,333
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

707
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,333
- Sasami:
THERE YOU ARE, RYO-OHKI.

708
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,916
I'M SO GLAD.
- Both: HUH?

709
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,333
- Washu: LET'S FORGET ABOUT THEM
AND WE'LL ALL SLEEP TOGETHER.

710
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:48,208
- ( door slides closed )
- NOW JUST A MINUTE.

711
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:51,000
- Ryoko: WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!
- ( beeping )

712
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,708
- I WONDER WHAT THAT WAS
OUT THERE.

713
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,916
- ( Ryo-Ohko meows )
- TWO WET FOOLS

714
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,125
WHO FORGOT TO KNOCK.
- HUH?

715
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,750
- OH, NOTHING.

716
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,333
COME ON, LET'S GO TO SLEEP.

717
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,333
- ( meows )
- ( laughs ) 

718
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:07,333
- Tenchi: SO, SASAMI,
WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM ABOUT?

719
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,875
- LET'S SEE.

720
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,250
A WOMAN TOOK YOU AWAY, TENCHI.

721
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,125
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS.

722
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,375
- DON'T WORRY,
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

723
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:16,458
- OKAY.

724
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,666
- ( both sigh )

725
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:37,875
- ( ship passing )
- Both: HUH?

726
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,416
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

727
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,166
- SOUNDS LIKE
MIHOSHI'S SHADOW.

728
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,291
- OH!

729
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,208
- AND IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

730
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:46,708
- Tenchi: HUH?

731
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:52,458
- MIHOSHI?  MIHOSHI?

732
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:54,041
- YES, YUKINOJYO?

733
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:58,166
- MIHOSHI, WE SHOULD BE APPLYING
THE REVERSE BRAKE.

734
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,333
- THE AUTO CONTROL
SHOULD DO THAT.

735
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:01,791
SO DON'T WORRY.

736
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:05,083
- AND I STILL DON'T SEE
ANY BEACON

737
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,333
FROM THE EARTH, MIHOSHI.

738
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,750
- OOPS, I FORGOT.

739
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,500
- FORGOT WHAT?

740
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,916
- THEY HAVE NO SUCH THING
ON PLANET EARTH.

741
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,708
- WHAT?!
- ( ship screeching )

742
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:22,000
- ( both laughing nervously )

743
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,791
- ( both groaning )

744
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,125
- Azaka: LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY.

745
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,583
- Kamidake: SUCH WONDERFUL
SPRINGLIKE WEATHER.

746
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,583
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows ) 

747
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,000
- MMM. HUH?

748
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,791
HUH?  OH.

749
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,458
AHHH!

750
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,250
- All: HUH?

751
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,333
- GET AWAY FROM THERE!

752
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,250
- ( meows )

753
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,916
- I TOLD YOU THAT
WASN'T A CARROT.

754
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,333
- ( meows ) 

755
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,916
- AH, RYO-OH!

756

- ( meows ) 

757
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,500
- OH, I SEE.

758
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,041
YOU'RE TALKING
WITH RYO-OH.

759
