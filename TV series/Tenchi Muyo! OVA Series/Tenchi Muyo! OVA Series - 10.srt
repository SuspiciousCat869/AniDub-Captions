- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN TELL ME LATER.

167
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,583
NOT NOW.

168
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,166
- WE MUST PUT AN END
TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.

169
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,500
- WHAT?!

170
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,833
BUT I LOVE YOU!
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!

171
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,916
- I HAVE A WIFE AND CHILDREN.
PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,125
- BUT I LOVE YOU STILL!
- ( meows ) 

173
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,750
- I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!
- SHH!

174
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,291
- THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

175
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,333
- RYO-OHKI.

176
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,500
- SO YOU WERE NEVER SERIOUS
ABOUT ME?

177
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,958
- OH, YES, OF COURSE I WAS.

178
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,625
I DON'T TO HURT YOU
BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE YOU.

179
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,541
- I WOULDN'T MIND BEING HURT.

180
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,083
WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU
IS ETERNAL LOVE.

181
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,125
LOVE!  LOVE!

182
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,583
LOVE!

183
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,750
- POPOKO.

184
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,541
- CHIEF! OH!

185
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:31,500
- POPOKO!
- OH, CHIEF.  OH!

186
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,875
- ( alarm sounding )

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,708
- Chief: NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

188
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,083
IT WILL JUST MAKE YOU SUFFER.
- ( all groaning )

189
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,416
- SUFFER, I WILL.

190
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
LOVE WILL OVERCOME IT ALL.
- HMM?

191
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,166
I THINK I HEAR SOMETHING.
- OH, POPOKO, DARLING.

192
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,458
- OH!
- HMM?

193
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,666
MMM!
- OH, CHIEF!

194
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,500
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WON'T REGRET IT?

195
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,416
- NEVER!

196
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,666
CHIEF!

197
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,625
CHIEF.  AW!

198
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,041
- WHOO!

199
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,000
- OH, YES!

200
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,083
- HEY!
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

201
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,500
BUT WE HAVE NEWS TO REPORT.
- All: OH!

202
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,833
- THE GALAXY POLICE BATTLESHIP
SHONGA HAS BEEN ROBBED.

203
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,166
NO STATEMENT OR DEMAND--

204
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,833
- WELL, RYO-OHKI, I'M
READY FOR YOU NOW.

205
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,791
- AND NOW SIGN OF PROGRESS
HAS BEEN MADE

206
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,000
IN THE INVESTIGATION SINCE
THE ROBBERY WAS DISCOVERED.

207
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,208
- OH!  MY GOD.

208
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,291
- WELL, IT'S GETTING LATE.

209
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,875
GUESS I'LL HAVE MY LUNCH NOW.

210
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,375
HMM?
AHA! SOME RICE CRACKERS.

211
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,541
- ( Mihoshi laughs )

212
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,250
- ( panting )

213
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,125
- ( gasps )

214
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,625
- HMM?
- HUH?

215
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,833
- ( meows ) 

216
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,208
- HMM, NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

217
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,833
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THIS TANK, MISS WASHU?

218
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,250
- THE MASSES WERE KEPT
IN THAT TANK.

219
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,750
- Ryoko:
MASSES? WHAT'S MASSES?

220
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,875
- YOUR FATHER, RYOKO.
- All: WHAT?!

221
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

222
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,625
- WELL, WHAT I MEAN IS
I CREATED YOU

223
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,375
BY USING THIS CREATURE
WITH MY EGG CELLS.

224
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,208
RYO-OHKI WAS MADE
THE SAME WAY.

225
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,416
EXCEPT IT WAS
WITH A MINERAL LIFE IN HER CASE.

226
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,000
- MINERAL LIFE?

227
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,875
- SO THEN IT WAS RYOKO'S FATHER
WHO HAS ESCAPED?

228
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,333
- ( Ryoko grumbles )

229
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,166
- THE MASSES
ARE GENTLE CREATURES BY NATURE

230
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,208
AND WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING
LIKE THIS.

231
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:43,166
UNLESS SOME VERY SPECIFIC FACTOR
INTERFERED.

232
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,375
- PLEASE, MA'AM,
JUST WHAT IS A MASS ANYWAY?

233
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,458
- MMM!  THAT IS AN EXCELLENT
GOOD QUESTION, MISS AYEKA.

234
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,666
- ( beeping )

235
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,208
- All: WHOA!

236
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,166
- WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

237
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,583
- QUIET.
QUIET, THANK YOU.

238
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,333
- ( whirring )

239
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,500
- AHEM.
NOW PLEASE LOOK AHEAD.

240
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,416
THIS IS A MASS.

241
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,708
- HMM!

242
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,875
- SO THAT
IS RYOKO'S HONORABLE FATHER?

243
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,916
IS THAT RIGHT?
- ( grumbling )

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,208
- I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF HER
AS A MONSTER,

245
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,541
BUT NOW I KNOW FOR A FACT
SHE REALLY IS A MONSTER.

246
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,000
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?! OH!

247
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,041
- LISTEN NOW!

248
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,000
THE MASSES ACT AS A GROUP.

249
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,083
AND IT IS THE WILL
OF THEIR LEADER,

250
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:37,708
WHICH IS THE BRAIN, THAT DECIDES
THE BEHAVIOR OF THE GROUP.

251
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,875
HOWEVER, WHEN THE LEADER
SENSES ANY OTHER WILL

252
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,791
STRONGER THAN THEIR OWN,
THEY ACCEPT IT AS THEIR BRAIN

253
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,791
AND ACT ACCORDINGLY.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

254
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,833
- All: UH...

255
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,625
- AH.

256
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,416
I GUESS YOU DON'T.

257
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
SO ASK ME SOME QUESTIONS,
OKAY?

258
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,250
- OKAY.  YOU MEAN
IF THOSE MASSES MOVE AROUND--

259
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,750
- RAISE YOUR HAND FIRST
IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION.

260
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,000
- OH, PROFESSOR?
- YES, MISS AYEKA?

261
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:09,625
- QUESTION. WILL IT
CLOSE UP THE PROBLEM

262
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,583
IF THOSE CREATURES MOVE
AROUND ON THEIR OWN?

263
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,583
- OH, YES INDEED.

264
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,833
IN FACT, WHEN ATTACKED OR
EXPOSED TO SOME EXTREME TENSION,

265
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,208
MEANING WHEN THE MASSES
FEEL THREATENED,

266
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,583
WELL, THEY HAVE A HABIT
OF SHOOTING OUT PARTS OF

267
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,166
THEIR BODIES AT THE ENEMY.

268
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,583
WHAT YOU SEE HERE
ARE THE REMAINS OF A SPACESHIP

269
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,916
DESTROYED BY ATTACKING MASSES.
- Sasami: WOW!

270
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,458
- HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR
SUCH TINY CREATURES

271
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,958
TO GENERATE SUCH POWER?

272
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,333
THE SECRET IS IN THEIR
PHYSICAL STRUCTURE.

273
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,541
THEY ARE COMPOSED
OF THE MATERIAL,

274
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,000
THE NEUTRAL MATERIAL
AND THE ANTI-MATERIAL.

275
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,666
- ( snoring )

276
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,541
- WHAT THAT MEANS
IS THAT THE ANTI-MATERIAL,

277
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,416
NORMALLY ENCASED
IN A NEUTRAL MATERIAL,

278
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,041
IS DISTURBED IF PART OF THE
NEUTRAL MATERIAL IS DESTROYED

279
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,583
BY SOME EXTERIOR STIMULATION,

280
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,500
WHICH RESULTS
IN A COUNTER EXTINCTION

281
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,875
BETWEEN THE MATERIAL
AND ANTI-MATERIAL AND--

282
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,916
- KABOOM!

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,208
- AHH.

284
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,916
- PROFESSOR? I THINK RYOKO'S
FATHER IS VERY DANGEROUS.

285
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,500
AND I THINK WE SHOULD
PROBABLY TRY TO CAPTURE HIM

286
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,333
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

287
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,875
- ( grumbles )

288
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,791
- OUR PROBLEM
IN FINDING THE MASSES

289
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,083
IS THAT THEY DO NO REACT
TO ANY SEARCHING SYSTEMS,

290
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,250
SUCH AS LIGHT-REACTIVE
AND HEAT-REACTIVE SYSTEMS.

291
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,166
THE ONLY WAY
IS TO USE OUR PHYSICAL SIGHTS.

292
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,416
SO HERE IS THE QUESTION.

293
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,125
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT
FINDING THE MASSES?

294
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,541
- ( yawns )

295
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,250
- ANSWER, MISS RYOKO?

296
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,500
- WHAT?
YOU'RE ASKING ME?

297
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,958
WELL, I-- I THINK WE SHOULD
ALL GO AND LOOK FOR THEM.

298
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,583
( laughs ) 
- BOO!  WRONG!

299
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,250
- I THINK WE WILL KNOW
WHERE THE MASSES WENT

300
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,000
IF WE CAN FIND THE FACTOR
THAT HAS AFFECTED THEM.

301
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,500
- EXCELLENT ANSWER,
MISS AYEKA.

302
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,958
- ( meows )

303
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,250
- AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE
THAT FACTOR IS THIS?

304
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,791
- ( meows ) 

305
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,833
- BUT HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
OF THAT?

306
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,250
- IF ANYONE COMMUNICATED
WITH THE MASSES,

307
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,750
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HER.

308
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,583
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE RIGHT
THERE IN FRONT OF THE TANK.

309
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,208
- WELL, IF YOU KNOW ALL THAT,

310
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,958
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ASK RYO-OHKI WHERE--

311
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,458
OH.

312
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,833
- IN ORDER TO FIND OUT
WHERE THE MASSES WENT,

313
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,500
WE'LL CHECK HER MEMORY
WITH THIS DEVICE.

314
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,791
- NO, YOU CAN'T!

315
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,750
NO!  YOU CAN'T CHECK HER MEMORY
WITHOUT HER PERMISSION.

316
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,291
YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT.
POOR THING.

317
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,166
- SASAMI.
- ( meows )

318
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,500
( meows )

319
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,166
- RYO-OHKI.

320
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,625
- GOOD GIRL.

321
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,916
THAT'S STRANGE.

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,375
VERY VERY STRANGE.

323
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,083
THE MAIN O.S.
SHOULD BE IN HERE.

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,083
- ( all laughing )

325
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,541
- UH, NOW THERE'S NOTHING
BUT CARROTS.

326
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,291
AND THIS AREA-- OH,
THERE IS SOME DATA ABOUT US.

327
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,333
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND
THE MOST RECENT DATA SHE HAS.

328
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,750
- AWW!
- Sasami: I SEE.

329
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,916
RYO-OHKI WANTED TO HELP TENCHI.

330
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,166
- YOU'RE SO CUTE.

331
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,708
SWEET THING.
BUT WAIT.

332
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,541
IF THE FORCE
BEHIND WHAT'S MOVING THE MASSES

333
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,916
IS THE WILL TO HELP TENCHI...

334
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,500
- THEN THE MASSES
WENT TO TENCHI.

335
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,958
- WAIT! BUT WHY WOULD
THE MASSES GO TO FIND TENCHI

336
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,958
IF THEY'RE RYOKO'S FATHER?

337
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,000
- IT'S NOT MY FATHER!
- OH.

338
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,750
- PROFESSOR WASHU?

339
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,041
- OUR TROUBLES BEGIN

340
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:05,000
IF THE MASSES SENSE THE
HIDDEN POWER INSIDE TENCHI.

341
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,958
- OH NO.

342
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,375
- THEN THEY WILL ATTACK HIM.

343
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,166
- ( meows )

344
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,041
- TENCHI!

345
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,833
( grunts )
- RYOKO!

346
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,791
- AHHH!

347
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,833
- WELL, ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS WARN YOU--

348
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,625
- ( crashing )

349
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,708
- ABOUT THE SHIELD UP THERE.

350
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,583
- ( sighs )

351
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,166
HMM?  AH!

352
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,416
OH!

353
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,500
AH!

354
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,125
( grunts )

355
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,416
- I-- I WONDER IF THAT'S AN
EXPERIMENT OF WASHU'S.

356
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,041
UH, EXCUSE ME?

357
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,458
( groans )
- Sasami: NO!

358
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,750
- TENCHI, WATCH OUT!

359
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,625
- THAT CREATURE
IS VERY DANGEROUS!

360
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,750
- EH!
- Washu: DON'T MOVE, TENCHI!

361
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,375
- AH!

362
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,125
- YOU'LL ONLY ENTICE
IT IF YOU MOVE.

363
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,208
- YOU COULD HAVE TOLD
ME THAT A LITTLE SOONER.

364
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,583
- PLEASE STOP IT,
HONORABLE FATHER.

365
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,875
YOUR DAUGHTER RYOKO
GRIEVES FOR YOU.  PLEASE STOP.

366
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,916
- BUT, MIHOSHI,

367
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,708
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S A WOMAN.

368
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,250
- OH.

369
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,166
YOU ARE SO RIGHT, SASAMI.

370
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,666
- NOW DON'T YOU DARE
TO MOVE EITHER.

371
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,791
NOT WHILE
WE'RE IN THE MASSES' TERRITORY.

372
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IN THEIR TERRITORY?

373
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,333
YOU MEAN TO SAY-- - SETTLE DOWN
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SCARE IT.

374
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,208
- ( grumbles )

375
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,958
- WE'LL BE JUST FINE.
OUR DECOY IS ON THE WAY.

376
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,625
- Ayeka: DECOY?

377
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,583
- OOF!
THAT DAMN WASHU.

378
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,625
- ( groans )

379
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,208
- All: TENCHI!

380
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,041
- WHOA!
I'M FINISHED FOR SURE!

381
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,791
- TENCHI?

382
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,958
( laughs )
HUH?

383
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,916
- AH.
SO I GUESS THIS IS IT.

384
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,750
- ( masses screaming )
- OOHHH!

385
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,458
( grunting )

386
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,500
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

387
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,708
- RYO-OHKI!

388
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:04,041
- RYO-OHKI, ASSIMILATE NOW
AND CONTROL!

389
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:07,000
- ( squeals )

390
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,333
- Sasami: RYO-OHKI!

391
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,750
- Mihoshi:
OH, RYOKO'S FATHER!

392
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,916
- RYO-OHKI!

393
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,416
- RY-- RYO-OHKI!

394
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,250
- MISS WASHU,
IS SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?

395
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,166
- Mihoshi: WASHU?

396
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,958
- SHE'S OKAY.

397
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,916
- ( whimpers )

398
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:33,333
- ( laughs ) 

399
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,541

AH.  MMM.

412
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,333
