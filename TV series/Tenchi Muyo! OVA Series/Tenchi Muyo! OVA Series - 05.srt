- DON'T BE SO GREEDY!
- ( meows )

7
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,250
- THANKS TO YOU, WE'VE HAD
TO TURN ALL OUR FIELDS

8
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,750
INTO CARROT FIELDS, YOU KNOW.

9
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,791
- ( meows ) 

10
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,125
- WHOA!

12
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,000
- WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
HUH?

13
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,791
OH, IT'S ONLY SNOW.

14
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,666
THAT'S ALL.

15
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,791
SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE EVER SEEN SNOW?

16
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,291
- ( screeches )

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,958
- HUH?

18
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,750

MMM.

20
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,166
( sighs )

21
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,791
NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL
HEAVEN ON EARTH.

22
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,041
MMM!

23
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,333
- HUH?  OH.

24
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,958
- HEY, HOW ABOUT A DRINK?

25
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,166
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

26
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,333
- JOIN ME, HUH?
- UGH!

27
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,000
( gulping )
- WOW! 

28
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,166
YOU SURE KNOW
HOW TO PUT THIS STUFF AWAY.

29
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,375
- NOW LET ME REMIND YOU,

30
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,625
I HAVEN'T QUITE FORGIVEN YOU
FOR THAT INCIDENT THE OTHER DAY.

31
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,166
- COME ON,
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?

32
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,041
YOU'RE STILL UPSET
ABOUT THAT?

33
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,000
I AM CERTAINLY SORRY
THAT YOU COULDN'T SEDUCE TENCHI.

34
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,083
( laughs ) 

35
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,833
- YOU'RE DISGUSTING.
UGH!

36
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:25,208
YOU SEE, TENCHI AND I
ARE RELATED BY NOBLE BLOOD.

37
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,041
( gulping )

38
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,083
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

39
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,250
- YEAH, BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN
TWO MONTHS SINCE YOU TWO MET.

40
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,750
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,

41
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,416
HAVE KNOWN HIM
SINCE HE WAS THIS TINY.

42
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
HE SURE WAS A CUTIE PIE.

43
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,625
HE SURE WAS.

44
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,416
AHHHH.

45
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,833
- Grandma: YES?
WHAT'S THE MATTER, TENCHI?

46
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,708
DO YOU SEE A MONSTER?

47
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,000
HEY, TENCHI?
- HUH?

48
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,958
OH, GRANDMA.
- DID I SURPRISE YOU?

49
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,875
- YEAH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GRANDPA.

50
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,666
( Tenchi crying )

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,708
OH, GRANDMA.

52
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,833
HEY!  HEY!

53
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,416
AH!  OW!

54
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,041
OH, COME BACK, HOT POTATO!

55
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,500
- Grandpa: TENCHI!
- I'M COMING.

56
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,166
- Ryoko: I ALWAYS HOPED
THAT ONE DAY

57
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,583
TENCHI AND I
WOULD PLAY TOGETHER.  HMM.

58
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,666
BUT NOW HE TREATS ME
LIKE I'M SOME SORT OF

59
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,583
MONSTER OR SOMETHING.

60
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,083
SO OF COURSE
I TEASE HIM SOMETIMES.

61
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,666
YOU UNDERSTAND, DON'T YOU?

62
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,458
- ( Ayeka laughing )
- MMM?

63
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,583
- YES, BUT DARLING,
YOU WERE A MUMMY.

64
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,666
MAYBE TENCHI JUST DOESN'T
WANT TO PLAY WITH A MONSTER.

65
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,333
- THANKS FOR THE SYMPATHY.

66
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,500
- WELL, LET'S BE HONEST,
SHALL WE?

67
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,541
YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY HE TREATS YOU LIKE HE DOES.

68
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,041
I THINK I KNOW THE PROBLEM.

69
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:12,291
I'M PRETTY SURE THE PROBLEM
IS YOUR AGE!

70
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:16,125
YOU'RE OVER 1,000 YEARS OLD
AND IT'S ANNOYING TO BE SEDUCED

71
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,833
BY AN OLD LADY.
- ( gasps )

72
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,375
- JUST LOOK
AT MY BEAUTIFUL SKIN.

73
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,791
IT'S SO YOUTHFUL,
AND YOURS IS SO, WELL,

74
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,833
MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN
SOAKING TOO LONG.

75
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,875
( cackling )
- I HATE YOU.

76
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,791
YOU'RE SO CRUEL.
( bawling )

77
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,416
- SHOULD I JUST
CALL YOU OLD BAT?

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,291
- HELLO.
AM I DISTURBING YOU?

79
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,000
- ( crying continues )

80
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,708
- HELLO!
- YOU!

81
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,708
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

82
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,333
- ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT TENCHI?

83
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,208
I HOPE IT'S OKAY
IF I MAKE MYSELF COMFORTABLE.

84
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,625
AT THAT MOMENT...

85
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,833
( gulps )

86
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,666
...WHEN I HEARD
THAT IT WAS TENCHI WHO SAVED ME

87
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,583
WHEN I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO BE SUCKED INTO A BLACK HOLE--

88
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,875
WELL, WHEN I HEARD THAT,

89
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,291
I THOUGHT HE JUST MIGHT
BE MY DESTINY.

90
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,916
- ( groaning )

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,125
- YES, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

92
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,541
HE MIGHT BE MY DESTINY.

93
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,625
( laughs )

94
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,916
WE JUST MET AND I'M TALKING
TO YOU LIKE THIS.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,208
- ( bird squawking )
- ( both groaning )

96
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,416
- ALL RIGHT, HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO STAY IN THE BATH?

97
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,708
WHOA!  IT'S STINKY.
IT SMELLS LIKE SAKE.

98
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,125
- ( meows )

99
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,875
- OH, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO
UNDERSTANDS MY FEELINGS.

100
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,541
- ( screeches )

101
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,375
- HMM? AH.

102
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,333
- ( Kagato laughing )

103
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,291
- ( all gasping )

104
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,208
- ( laughter continues )

105
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,375
WELL, I FINALLY FOUND YOU,
RYOKO.

106
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,875
- KAGATO!
- AHHH!  YOU PERVERT!

107
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,833
( both shouting )

108
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,291
- AHH!  AHHH!

109
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,375
OOH!
- RYOKO, NO!

110
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,291
- ( laughs )

111
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,875
- ( grunting, screaming )

112
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,125
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- ( alarm sounding )

113
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,416
- HEY, WHOA!

114
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,375
- ( alarm stops )

115
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,458
- THIS ONE'S THE REAL ONE,

116
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,791
THE INFAMOUS BRUTAL CRIMINAL.

117
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,708
KAGATO!

118
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:27,375
ETERNAL AND MOST WANTED CRIMINAL
KAGATO,

119
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,208
COME OUT NOW.
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

120
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,875
I SAID COME OUT!
- ( meows )

121
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,458
- PLEASE EXCUSE
MY BEHAVIOR EARLIER.

122
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,041
I DEEPLY APPRECIATE
YOU COMING OUT TO WELCOME ME.

123
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,125
- RYOKO!

124
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,958
- HOWEVER THIS ONE
BELONGS TO ME.

125
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,875
SHE IS, HOW CAN I SAY IT
DELICATELY?

126
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,250
WASTE PRODUCT.
STILL SHE IS AGILE.

127
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,250
I'LL BET SHE'S GIVEN YOU
SOME TROUBLE.

128
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,041
PRINCESS SASAMI,
PRINCESS AYEKA,

129
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,166
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S BEST
WE TALK SOMEPLACE PRIVATE,

130
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,625
SOMEPLACE WHERE
THERE'S NO ONE TO BOTHER US?

131
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:14,083
- ( grunts )
KAGATO, I WILL ARREST YOU.

132
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,125
THIS IS A SPECIALLY
PROTECTED AREA.

133
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,666
ANY KIND OF COMBATIVE ACTION
IS FORBIDDEN.

134
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,833
IF YOU INVOLVE ANY CIVILIAN,
I'LL BLAST YOU TO BITS.

135
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,000
- OH MY, OH MY.

136
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,958
YOU REALLY FRIGHTEN ME.

137
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,833
YOU SEE, I'VE HEARD MUCH OF YOUR
HEROIC EPISODES IN THE PAST.

138
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,958
NOW I HEAR YOU'RE OVERWORKED
AND YOUR PERFORMANCE STINKS.

139
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,875
- ( grunts )

140
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,583
- ( laughs )

141
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,583
- ( clicking )
- HUH?

142
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,125
OH!

143
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,208
- PLEASE, I DON'T WISH
FOR YOU TO MISUNDERSTAND ME.

144
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,041
I'VE ONLY COME HERE TO INVITE
YOU ALL TO MY SHIP, THE SOJA.

145
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,625
VERY PLEASANT PLACE.

146
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,833
A PLACE WHERE WE CAN
GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER.

147
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,291
- ( sword zapping )

148
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,166
- OH, I SEE--
YOU HAVE THE SWORD.

149
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,791
BUT THAT'S THE KING'S PROPERTY.
WAVE IT AROUND LIKE THAT

150
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,000
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO HURT YOURSELF, YOUNG MAN.

151
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT KING?

152
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:11,041
- YOU WOULD FIGHT ME WITHOUT
FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SWORD?

153
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,500
ALL RIGHT THEN.

154
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,041
- ( grunting )

155
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,708
AHHHH!

156
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,333
- DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE.

157
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,250
NOW JUST HAND ME THAT SWORD.

158
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,458
- Ryoko: TENCHI!

159
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,375
- HMMM?

160
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,083
DON'T LET HIM HAVE IT!

161
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,750
- FASCINATING.

162
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,000
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT BOY
INTERESTS YOU SO MUCH, RYOKO?

163
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,083
- ( grunting )
- RYOKO!

164
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,125
- AHHH!

165
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,000
- WHOA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

166
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,875
- IT IS SAID THAT SWORD
HOLDS THE GREATEST ENERGY

167
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,250
IN THE UNIVERSE. BUT THE SWORD
WILL ONLY RELEASE THAT ENERGY

168
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,958
WHEN HELD BY A SUITABLE OWNER.

169
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,625
MY QUESTION IS,
ARE YOU THAT SUITABLE OWNER?

170
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,333
- MAYBE I AM, MAYBE NOT.
I DON'T KNOW!

171
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,916
- I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,125
ARE YOU A SUITABLE OWNER
OF THAT SWORD?

173
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,291
- RELEASE HER.
LET RYOKO GO!

174
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,166
( groaning )

175
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,041
- TENCHI, NO!

176
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,583
- ( squeals )

177
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,375
- EH.

178
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,583
- ( grunts )

179
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,875
AHHHH!

180
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,375
AH!

181
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,333
COME, I'LL TEST YOU.

182
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,875
- ( grunting )

183
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,500
AHHH!

184
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,750
- ( all gasping )

185
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,041
- WHOA!

186
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,250
- HA!
- OW!

187
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,750
- THIS IS NO FUN.

188
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,416
DO YOU ENJOY MAKING ME
WASTE MY TIME?

189
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:09,666
- ARE YOU PLAYING WITH SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU?

190
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,625
- GRANDFATHER.

191
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:15,041
- COME, RYOKO,
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE.

192
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,958
- THERE YOU ARE,

193
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,208
THE FIRST CROWN PRINCE
OF JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

194
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,916
I WONDER, COULD YOU SHOW ME
THE SECRET OF THE UNIVERSE?

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,625
WILL YOU SHARE THAT TREASURE?
- PLEASURE? 

196
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,666
WELL, I DO KNOW OF A REALLY
COMFORTABLE HOT SPRING NEARBY.

197
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,375
- AHHHH!

198
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,166
- WELL, AREN'T WE COCKY?

199
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,500
- THE GREATEST ENERGY
IN THE UNIVERSE?

200
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,458
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

201
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,708
AND IF THERE WERE, IT COULDN'T
BE CONTROLLED BY HUMANS.

202
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,583
- I HAVE JOURNEYED THROUGH
SEA AFTER SEA OF THE STARS

203
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,291
IN ORDER TO FIND THE SECRET.

204
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,750
WHAT WILL IT TAKE
TO GET THAT POWER?

205
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,166
YOUR BLOOD?
JURAI ROYAL FAMILY'S BLOOD?

206
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,416
- AH!

207
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,333
( grunting )

208
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,916
( grunts )

209
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,083
- HA!

210
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,666
- Tenchi: RYOKO!

211
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,750
- USING A WOMAN
AS YOUR SHIELD, COWARD!

212
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,875
RYOKO, WAKE UP!
WAKE UP!

213
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,958
AYYYY!
- DON'T KILL HER, GRANDPA!

214
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,041
HELP HER!

215
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,083
- ( moaning )

216
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,125
- HMM?
- ( laughs )

217
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,750
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HAVE YOU GIVEN UP?

218
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:35,708
( yelling )

219
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,750
AHHHHH!

220
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,125
- IT'S NOT YOURS, EH?

221
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,833
- ( moaning )

222
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,875
I SEE.

223
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,791
THEN THIS BOY
IS YOUR SUCCESSOR.

224
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:57,333
- TENCHI. ( gasps )
- RYOKO!

225
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,541
- I WILL TAKE
YOUR PRECIOUS RYOKO WITH ME.

226
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,833
IMPROVE YOUR SKILLS.
THEN COME TO US.

227
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,791
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

228
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,500
- ( grunting )
OH!

229
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,000
- YOU'RE MY BROTHER!

230
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,916
YOU'RE MY BROTHER YOSHO,
AREN'T YOU?!

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,875
- SORRY, I--
I GUESS NOW YOU KNOW.

232
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,333
- BUT WHY?

233
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,541
TELL ME!

234
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,291
- EASY NOW, DON'T SCOLD ME.

235
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,416
- ( Ayeka crying )

236
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,166
THAT HANDSOME BROTHER.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

237
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,416
YOU'VE CHANGED SO MUCH.

238
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,625
AND YOU--
YOU'RE OLDER.

239
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,875
- DON'T CRY. AYEKA, I WAS
NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THIS.

240
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,041
BUT IF I HAD STAYED
ON PLANET JURAI,

241
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,041
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONFLICT
BETWEEN YOU AND ME

242
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,333
OVER SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE.

243
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,541
AYEKA, YOU SEE,
MY MOTHER WAS AN EARTHLING.

244
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,333
AND I AM TOO.

245
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,458
OR AT LEAST HALF OF ME.

246
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,875
- BUT WHY SHOULD THAT MATTER?

247
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,208
OUR FATHER MADE THE LAW

248
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,333
THAT AFTER HIM,

249
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,541
WE SHOULD MIX WITH BLOOD
OF OTHER PLANETS.

250
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,791
- IT WAS A LAW
THAT MANY JURAIANS DIDN'T LIKE.

251
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,333
IN THOSE DAYS,
THERE WAS TREMENDOUS PREJUDICE.

252
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:21,166
I-- I COULD NOT BEAR IT.

253
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,500
SO WHEN WE WERE ATTACKED
BY RYOKO,

254
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,625
I LEFT TO FIGHT,
NEVER TO RETURN.

255
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,208
NOW THIS PLANET IS MY HOME.

256
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,666
AND THIS IS WHERE I WISH
TO BE BURIED.

257
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,708
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF RETURNING TO JURAI.

258
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,750
- BUT WITHOUT JURAI,

259
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,875
WITHOUT ITS LIFE TREE
AND WATER...

260
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,166
- I WILL DIE.
I KNOW THAT, AYEKA.

261
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,833
AND SUCH A THING DOESN'T MATTER.
SOMEDAY YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.

262
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,791
- THEN IT'S TRUE, GRANDPA.
YOU'RE YOSHO.

263
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:54,041
AND THE STORIES,
THE LEGEND, ALL OF IT IS TRUE.

264
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,875
- YES, AND YOU ARE CROWN PRINCE
OF PLANET JURAI.

265
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,416
YOU LOOK SURPRISED.

266
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,333
- BUT YOU NEVER SAID A THING.

267
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,166
- AND IF I HAD, WHAT THEN?

268
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,833
WOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN
WHAT TO DO?

269
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:10,125
SILLY BOY!  NOW IS YOUR TIME
TO GRASP THE FUTURE.

270
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,333
I AM SORRY.

271
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,208
I HAD NO IDEA
YOUR HEART WAS SET ON ME.

272
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,875
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

273
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,375
WE COULD GET MARRIED NOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

274
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,583
- BROTHER, PLEASE!
DON'T MAKE FUN.

275
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,958
- OH! 
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

276
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,791
I'M TOO OLD.
BUT TENCHI, HOWEVER,

277
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,125
IS ABOUT THE RIGHT AGE.

278
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,416
HE'S A VERY GOOD GRANDSON.

279
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,083
- ( grunting )

280
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,250
- AND YOU TWO
ARE PERFECT TOGETHER.

281
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,208
- UH...

282
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,208
- ( crying )
- Ayeka: HUH?

283
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,666
- I'M SO MOVED!
I'M SO MOVED!

284
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,625
SORRY, BUT IT'S SO TOUCHING,
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

285
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,125
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

286
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,500
- GRANDPA,
I HAVE TO SAVE RYOKO.

287
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,250
BUT--

288
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,208
- BUT SHE'S THE CAUSE
OF ALL OF OUR TROUBLE.

289
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,416
YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T HAVE TO SAVE HER.

290
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,666
- TENCHI, I WILL GIVE YOU
THAT SWORD.

291
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,750
KAGATO IS VERY DANGEROUS.

292
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,750
YOU MUST GO AND DEFEAT HIM.

293
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,208
IN ORDER TO GET HOLD
OF THE SECRET TREASURE,

294
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,500
HE WOULD THINK NOTHING
OF DESTROYING THIS PLANET.

295
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,083
- BUT CAN I DEFEAT HIM?
I DON'T KNOW, GRANDPA.

296
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,583
I HAVE A HARD ENOUGH TIME
HANDLING THAT SWORD--

297
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,333
- WITH THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE,

298
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,833
HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO
PROTECT THESE WOMEN?

299
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,291
YOU HAVE A POWER
THAT HASN'T BEEN AWAKENED YET.

300
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,375
TRUST YOURSELF.

301
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,750
- GRANDPA?
I UNDERSTAND.

302
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,916
- NO, TENCHI, YOU SHOULDN'T!

303
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,458
- AYEKA, LISTEN NOW.

304
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,375
FOR EVERY MAN, THERE'S A TIME
WHEN HE MUST FIGHT.

305
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,166
- YES, BUT--

306
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,000
- PLEASE, TENCHI, WATCH OUT!

307
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,666
- ( grunting )

308
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,000
- THE SWORD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED
TENCHI AS ITS TRUE OWNER.

309
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,000
- YES.

310
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,000
- JEEZ!

311
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,041
- Yosho: ARE YOU GOING, TENCHI,

312
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,333
WITH THE SWORD
YOU CAN'T QUITE HANDLE YET?

313
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,083
EVEN SO,
ARE YOU STILL GOING?

314
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,833
- HMM!

315
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,000
RYOKO, I MUST SAVE HER.

316
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,083
- TENCHI, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

317
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,666
- I'LL GO WITH YOU TOO.
- THANK YOU.

318
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,708
- AS A MEMBER
OF THE GALAXY POLICE,

319
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,166
IT IS MY DUTY.

320
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,958
- Sasami:
SIS, YOU'LL COME, WON'T YOU?

321
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,958
- I DON'T KNOW.

322
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,416
- AYEKA, PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF GRANDPA.

323
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,250
- OKAY, HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET THERE?

324
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,958
- UH?
- ( squeals )

325
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,833
( meows ) 

326
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,958
- HE MUST SEE SOMETHING.
LET'S GO, TENCHI.

327
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,208
- OKAY.

328
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,750
- AYEKA?

329
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,833
AYEKA!

330
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,916
- MM-HMM.

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,916
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

332
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,041
- ( ship beeping )

333
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,875
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM?

334
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,916
- ( growling )

335
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,708
( squeals )

336
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,958
AHHHH!

337
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,375
- NO, MY LITTLE RYO-OHKI!

338
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,750
- ( squeals )

339
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,958
- OH MY! THAT POOR LITTLE
CREATURE. WHAT DID WE DO?

340
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,958
OH NO!
- RYO-OHKI!

341
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:39,833
- WELL, I GUESS WE CAN USE THAT
TO TRAVEL IN, HUH?

342
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,625
- ( machines beeping )

343
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,500
- Kagato: HERE THEY COME,
THE FOOLS.

344
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,125
IT'S STRANGE.

345
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,083
THEY'RE COMING HERE
TO THROW AWAY THEIR LIVES

346
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,916
TO SAVE SOMEONE
AS DEFECTIVE AS YOU.

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,166
- I AM NOT YOUR MACHINE ANYMORE.

348
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,250
I AM A HUMAN BEING!

349
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,708
- HUMAN BEING?

350
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,750
COMPARED TO THE INFINITE WILL
OF THE UNIVERSE,

351
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:13,666
HUMAN FEELINGS AMOUNT TO LITTLE,
NOTHING MORE THAN DUST.

352
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,291
YOU KNOW, YOUR CURRENT FORM
WAS CHOSEN

353
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,291
ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS CONVENIENT.

354
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,375
YOUR ORIGINAL FORM COULD HAVE
BEEN ANYTHING THAT I WANTED.

355
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:25,083
LIKE A STONE.
SHALL I TURN YOU INTO A STONE?

356
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,625
WOULD THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?

357
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,083
( Kagato laughs ) 

358
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,166
I'D LOVE TO STAY AND CHAT,
BUT I'D BETTER PREPARE

359
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,791
TO WELCOME OUR GUESTS.

360
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,250
- OH!  IF YOU LAY
YOUR DIRTY HANDS ON TENCHI,

361
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,583
YOU'LL BE SORRY.

362
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,833
I SWEAR IT!
YOU'LL BE SORRY!

363
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,541
- ( machine beeping )

364
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,458
- ( beeping )

365
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,750
- Ayeka: KAGATO'S SHIP
IS ABOUT TO ATTACK.

366
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,041
PLEASE AVOID IT.

367
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,541
- WELL, BELIEVE ME,
I'D LIKE TO,

368
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,083
BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING!

369
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,041
- ( all shouting )

370
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,083
- RYO-OHKI, ATTACK!
I COMMAND YOU.

371
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,250
OH, I CANNOT OPERATE THIS SHIP.

372
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,666
- ( all shouting )

373
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,416
- OH.  OH, THIS MIGHT HELP.

374
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,666
- HMM?

375
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,500
EXCUSE ME OVER THERE.

376
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,666
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE DOING?

377
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,208
- WELL, THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT
FROM ALL THE OTHERS.

378
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,875
DO YOU HAPPEN TO
KNOW HOW IT WORKS?

379
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,166
- NO, I DON'T!

380
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,750
BUT I COMMAND YOU
TO FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT NOW!

381
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,916
AHHH!

382
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:48,000
- I AM THE ONE WHO BUILT
THE SHIP THAT YOU ARE IN.

383
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,500
EVERY MOVE YOU MAKE,

384
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,250
YOU KNOW I WILL SEE THROUGH IT.

385
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,125
- AHH!  IT'S HOPELESS!
WHAT CAN WE DO?

386
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,750
- ( all scanning )
- HUH?

387
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,750
- Both: WHOA.

388
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,416
OOOH!  AHHH!

389
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,166
- WHAT-- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

390
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,333
- MAYBE THE BALANCER WAS HIT.

391
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,291
- ( laughs ) 

392
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,666
MORE?  AHH!

393
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,208
- NOW I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

394
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

395
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:29,083
THIS HAPPENS TO BE
A COMPUTER UNIT.

396
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:32,583
- YEAH, WELL, I JUST
DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH TO DO.

397
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,625
( laughs ) 

398
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:42,208
- NOW THAT'S
A VERY CAPABLE EVASION.

399
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,083
I WONDER IF IT'S DUE
TO THE POWER OF THE BOY'S SWORD.

400
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,000
- AYEKA, WE NEED
TO DO SOMETHING.

401
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,666
CAN WE ATTACK FROM YOUR SHIP?

402
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,958
- IT IS POSSIBLE.

403
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,083
BUT I'M NOT SURE THE SHIP
IS FULLY FORMED YET.

404
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,083
- I DON'T NEED THIS.
- IT'S DANGEROUS.

405
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,958
- WELL, WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
AND DO NOTHING.

406
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,833
- I WILL GO.

407
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:03,375
- NO, YOU CAN'T.
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

408
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,000
- UH, TENCHI!

409
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,791
- ONCE I GET THERE,
YOU'LL HAVE TO DIRECT ME.

410
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,583
AYEKA, I'M READY.

411
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,375
- FIRST YOU MUST OPEN
THE LIGHT HAWK WINGS.

412
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,125
- LIGHT HAWK WINGS?

413
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,166
- IT'S THE SHIELD
FOR THAT CRAFT.

414
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,958
ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTION
IS A DEFENSE SYSTEM.

415
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,416
HOWEVER, YOU CAN USE IT
TO ATTACK ALSO,

416
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,625
BUT IT ISN'T MEANT
FOR THAT PURPOSE.

417
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,625
WE WILL BE VULNERABLE.

418
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,708
- IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.

419
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,708
HOW DO I OPEN THE WINGS,
AYEKA?

420
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,375
WHOA!
TELL ME WHAT TO DO!

421
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,750
- AH, THEY'RE USING
THE LIGHT HAWK WINGS.

422
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,250
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

423
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:58,125
JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY
IS POWERFUL INDEED.

424
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:01,458
BUT I HAVE A SUITABLE STRATEGY.

425
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,458
- TENCHI, PLEASE HURRY!

426
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,666
- ( grunting )

427
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:24,916
- ( gasps )

428
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,375
- AHHHH!

429
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:51,083
AHH!

430
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,958
- ( gasps )

431
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:01,291
- ( laughs )

432
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:09,208
- Ayeka: TENCHI?  TENCHI!

433
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,666
TENCHI!

434
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,958
TENCHI?  TENCHI!

435
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,291
TENCHI?  TENCHI?

436
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,500
TENCHI, TENCHI!

437
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:22,666
TENCHI, TENCHI?  TENCHI!

438
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:31,041
AHHHH!

439
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:35,083
- AHHHH!

440
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,416
TENCHI?

441
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,083
TENCHI?

442
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,416
WHERE ARE YOU?

443
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,458
( gasps )

444
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,458
OH!

445
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,791
( sobbing )

446
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,166
KAGATO, KAGATO,

447
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,500
YOU HAVE STOLEN THE ONE
THAT WAS MOST PRECIOUS TO ME.

448
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:25,458
AND I WILL MAKE YOU PAY.

449
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:31,583
YOU WILL PAY!
