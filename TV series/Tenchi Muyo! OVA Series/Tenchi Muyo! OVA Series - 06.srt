1
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,291
( sighs )

2
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,125
RYOKO! WE THOUGHT YOU
WERE KAGATO'S PRISONER.

3
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,958
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

4
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,625
WELL, NOW THAT YOU'VE ESCAPED,

5
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:32,208
PERHAPS WE CAN SAVE TENCHI,
SINCE HE WENT TO SAVE YOU!

6
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,708
- WE MUST GO NOW.

7
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,791
WE MUST CHALLENGE KAGATO.
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO.

8
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,541
- IS THAT RIGHT?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO--

9
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:42,125
WE CAN FIND TENCHI, THAT'S WHAT
WE CAN DO. DO YOU HEAR ME?

10
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,416
OW!

11
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,791
OH!

12
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,125
HUH?

13
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,166
IS HE DEAD?

14
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,125
- IT'S NOT OVER YET.

15
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,166
I WILL KILL KAGATO.

16
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,708
I WILL KILL HIM!

17
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,916
EVEN IF IT KILLS ME.

18
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,208
LET'S GO!

19
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,750
HA!

20
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,166
HAAAAA!

21
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,166
- ( panting )

22
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,250
OH, NO, DON'T DIE, TENCHI!

23
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,916
PLEASE DON'T DIE.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,041
WHOA!

25
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,958
( sobbing )

26
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,958
BY THE ROYAL SEAL
IN MY TRUE NAME,

27
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,083
PLEASE OPEN THE PATH TO OUR
ANCESTORS, THE SPACE TREES.

28
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,500
HEAVEN TO OCEAN,
OCEAN TO EARTH,

29
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,000
EARTH BACK TO HEAVEN,

30
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,625
SHOW ME THE PATH
ENGRAVED BY THE LIGHT.

31
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,958
- Ayeka: NOW WHICH WAY
DO WE GO?

32
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,000
- ALL THE PASSAGES
WILL LEAD TO HIM.

33
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,875
- LET'S GO.

34
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,583
- HEY, WAIT FOR ME!

35
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,208
- ( growling )

36
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,041
- HYAH!

37
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,500
- AHHH!

38
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,125
- EW, PLEASE STAY BACK!

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,083
- HMMM.

40
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,250
- ( playing )

41
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,083
- ( pulsating )

42
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,333
- HMM.

43
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,500
THERE MUST BE AN ENTRANCE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

44
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,791
- WELL NOW,

45
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,958
LOOKS LIKE AN INVITATION.

46
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,500
- SURE DOES.
LET'S NOT BE RUDE.

47
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,416
- HELLO,
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

48
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,958
COULD YOU PLEASE WAIT UP?
WHOA!

49
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,250
OH NO!
WHERE'D THEY GO?

50
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,583
WHAT IS THIS?

51
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,666
WHERE AM I?  HEY!

52
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,666
WAIT A SECOND.

53
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,500
IF I HAD MY CONTROL CUBE...

54
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,041
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO WAIT FOR ME?

55
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,541
- HMM.

56
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,916
- ( song continues )

57
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,500
- WHAT THE--

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,666
- WELCOME TO MY CHAPEL, LADIES.

59
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,125
ENJOY THE MUSIC?

60
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,000
- STAND BACK, AYEKA!

61
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,708
- OOOH!

62
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,416
SCUMBAG!  OH!

63
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,875
- IS THAT TERM OF AFFECTION
OR DO YOU JUST NOT LIKE ME?

64
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,250
YOU'RE QUITE POWERFUL,
PRINCESS,

65
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,583
BUT THIS CHAPEL'S FORCE
FIELD COUNTERACTS

66
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,750
ALL ENERGY THAT ATTACKS IT.

67
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,416
NOW ALLOW ME TO TEACH
YOU SOME MANNERS.

68
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,666
- AHH!

69
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,833
- AH!

70
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,291
( sighs )

71
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,375
AHHH!

72
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,166
- SHADOW!

73
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,916
- 700 YEARS IS A BIT TOO LONG
OF A REST FOR YOU, RYOKO.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,291
YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL THE REAL ME
FROM MY SHADOW.

75
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,125
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

76
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,583
- KAGATO, DON'T-- MY ARM.

77
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,416
( grunting )

78
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,916
AHHH!

79
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,666
- YOU LOOK QUITE NICE IN GRAY.

80
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,666
YOU WILL SHOW ME THE SECRET
OF TSUNAMI UNIT, PRINCESS AYEKA.

81
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,583
- ( beeping )

82
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,541
- THIS PLACE
IS REALLY REALLY WEIRD.

83
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,375
WHERE'D THEY GO?

84
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,000
KAGATO MIGHT HAVE THEM ALREADY.

85
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,000
AND IF HE DOES,
THAT MEANS I'M ALL ALONE.

86
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,083
WELL, THAT'S OKAY

87
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,875
BECAUSE I'M A
GALAXY POLICEPERSON

88
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,166
AND I CAN HANDLE IT.

89
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,333
I'LL JUST CAPTURE KAGATO
ALL MYSELF AND-- AND--

90
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,000
WHAAA!

91
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,916
AHHH!

92
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,125
AHHH!

93
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,458
I ORDER YOU TO STAY AWAY!

94
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,958
HEY, I'M FEELING LIKE I HATE
SNAKES.

95
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,500
YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT, YOU SNAKES.

96
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,458
ANYTHING YOU COULD SAY
CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU

97
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,666
AS EVIDENCE IN A COURT OF LAW.

98
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,041
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY

99
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,958
AND I GUESS IT WILL HAVE TO
BE AN ATTORNEY THAT

100
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,208
HANDLES NO-ARMED SNAKE FACES

101
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,041
AND THEN--

102
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,250
( panting )

103
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,916
AND THEN...

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,958
THAT'S ALL.

105
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,166
- ( beeping )

106
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,375
- ( glass shattering )
- HEY.

107
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,416
THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU
WILL BE REALLY BAD

108
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,875
IF YOU TRY TO ESCAPE.

109
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,541
I'M REALLY SERIOUS NOW.
I REALLY AM.

110
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,708
THIS THING ISN'T WORKING.
IT'S NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH.

111
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,541
I SHOULD HAVE
PAID MORE ATTENTION

112
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,541
WHEN THEY EXPLAINED
HOW TO USE THESE THINGS.

113
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,166
MMMM AHHHH!

114
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,333
HUH?

115
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,458
( whimpers )

116
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,625
- OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

117
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,291
THANKS FOR SETTING ME FREE,
BY THE WAY.

118
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,458
THIS IS A DANGEROUS PLACE
YOU'RE IN, YOU KNOW?

119
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,583
- YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

120
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,666
- LET'S GET THESE
OUT OF THE WAY.

121
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,958
RISE AND SHINE.

122
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,791
THERE SHE IS.

123
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,125
NOW THIS GIRL'S
TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

124
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,333
DON'T YOU AGREE, MIHOSHI?
- WELL...

125
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,083
- LOOKS LIKE NOTHING'S BROKEN.
- UM, EXCUSE ME?

126
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,791
- THAT JERK TRIED
TO DESTROY HER, HUH?

127
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,333
WELL, I'LL SHOW HIM.

128
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,583
- ( sighs )

129
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,625
- EXCUSE ME?  WHO ARE YOU?

130
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,291
YOUR OUTFIT SEEMS TO BE
A SCIENCE ACADEMY UNIFORM

131
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,750
FROM A LONG TIME AGO.

132
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,708
- YOUR BODY IS SAGGING A BIT.

133
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,583
THE DETERIORATION
OF YOUR MUSCLES

134
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,250
DEFINITELY
AFFECTS YOUR ABILITY TO FIGHT.

135
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,041
IT ALSO AFFECTS YOUR VISUAL
PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTICS.

136
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,833
OH!

137
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,958
- OKAY, PIPSQUEAK, WHETHER MY
BODY IS SAGGING OR NOT

138
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,458
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

139
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,833
WHAT ARE VISUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL
TACTICS ANYWAY?

140
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,375
- YOUR SEX APPEAL, OF COURSE.

141
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,791
- HEY, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
MY BODY SHAPE HASN'T CHANGED

142
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,125
FOR THE PAST 700 YEARS!
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT,

143
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,750
YOU BIG FAT SMART ALECK?

144
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,708
- WHAT I THINK IS THAT'S NO WAY
TO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER, RYOKO.

145
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,541
- ( grunts )

146
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,333
- THAT'S RIGHT.  IN FACT,
NOT ONLY DID I CREATE YOU,

147
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,000
BUT I CREATED RYO-OHKI,
I CREATED THE SOJA.

148
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,416
I'VE CREATED SO MANY THINGS,
REALLY.

149
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,083
BUT I USED MY OVA FOR YOU,

150
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,708
SO I'M MORE LIKE YOUR
MOTHER THAN YOUR CREATOR.

151
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,125
- YOU MUST BE THAT
FEMALE STUDENT

152
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,958
THAT WAS KIDNAPPED BY KAGATO.

153
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,541
- A FEMALE STUDENT?
NO, I AM WASHU!

154
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,875
AND I JUST HAPPEN TO
BE THE TOP SCIENTIFIC

155
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:35,833
GENIUS OF THE UNIVERSE.

156
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,083
I AM CUTE,
I HAVE TO ADMIT!

157
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,458
I LOOK A LITTLE YOUNG
TO BE A MOM, DON'T I, RYOKO?

158
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,333
- HUH?  BALONEY!

159
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,291
I'VE BEEN ALONE FOR 2,000 YEARS,
EVER SINCE I WAS BORN,

160
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,875
EVER SINCE I WAS--
I WAS BORN.

161
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,333
BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS THIS PLACE?

162
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,833
- THIS IS THE REVERSED WORLD.
- REVERSED?

163
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,000
- THIS SHIP HAS TWO LAYERS--
IT HAS A TOP AND A BOTTOM.

164
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,791
BUT THE INTERSECTION
BETWEEN THEM IS ONE WAY,

165
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,166
SO THAT MEANS--

166
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,291
- FORGET ABOUT THAT!
TELL ME HOW TO GET TO KAGATO.

167
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:07,250
- WANT TO TAKE REVENGE
FOR TENCHI?

168
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,750
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT TENCHI?

169
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,958
- AS YOU ARE CONNECTED
WITH RYO-OHKI,

170
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,625
SO AM I CONNECTED WITH YOU,
MY DEAR.

171
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,750
SO I KNOW EVERYTHING.

172
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,375
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT TENCHI.

173
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,250
- UH...
- YOU LIKE HIM!  YOU LOVE HIM.

174
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,000
YOU'VE NEVER
FELT LIKE THIS BEFORE,

175
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,416
AND YOU'LL DO ANYTHING FOR HIM.
ON TOP OF ALL THAT,

176
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,375
YOU WANT TO DO THIS AND THAT
WITH TENCHI.

177
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,708
- OH!
- NOW DON'T YOU?

178
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,500
- OH, SHE'S THINKING ABOUT THAT?

179
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,916
- HEY, STOP!
SHUT UP!

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,416
- IF YOU WANT TO GO,
I WON'T STOP YOU.

181
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,791
FOR YOU, IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE.

182
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,375
- PLEASE STOP, RYOKO.

183
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,083
SHE IS NOT THE ONE
YOU SHOULD POINT YOUR SWORD AT.

184
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,458
- OH!
- HMM.

185
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,083
- RYOKO, I SHOULD
HAVE STAYED OUT OF THIS.

186
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,333
- RYOKO?  BEFORE YOU GO,
I HAVE TO ASK YOU ONE THING.

187
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,000
I WONDER, COULD YOU PLEASE--

188
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,208
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD CALL ME MOM?

189
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,875
- ( grunts )

190
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,541
- HEY, RYOKO!

191
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,791
BUT WHY SHOULDN'T WE
GO WITH HER?

192
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,625
- BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

193
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,708
ONCE WE'RE ON THIS SIDE
OF THE WORLD, WE CAN'T GET OUT

194
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,291
UNLESS KAGATO IS DESTROYED.

195
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,416
- BUT SHE--
- PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

196
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,958
THAT WAS RYOKO'S ASTRO BODY
I BROUGHT HERE.

197
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,500
HER PHYSICAL BODY
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

198
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,666
- OH.

199
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,083
NOW WHERE ARE WE?

200
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,750
- OH!

201
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,458
- Yosho: AYEKA?  AYEKA?

202
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,041
- HMM?

203
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,708
- AYEKA.

204
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,250
- YOSHO!  OH!

205
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,375
- AYEKA,
I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING.

206
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,458
- TELL ME, YOSHO.
WHAT IS IT?

207
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:45,791
- AYEKA, TELL ME ABOUT THE POWER
THE MASTER KEY CAN ACTIVATE,

208
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,916
THE POWER EMBODIED IN THE TREES
OF THE ROYAL FAMILY,

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,958
THE STRONGEST POWER IN THE
UNIVERSE-- TSUNAMI.

210
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,375
TSUNAMI?

211
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,416
- HOW IS IT THAT ONLY YOUR
RELATIVES CAN CONTROL IT?

212
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,916
TELL ME!

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,333
- OH NO!
NO, YOU ARE NOT YOSHO.

214
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,375
OH, LET ME GO!
LET ME GO!

215
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,458
- ( laughs )
IS IT YOUR BLOOD?

216
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,250
- LET GO!

217
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,458
- OR DO I NEED
SOMETHING ELSE, MY DEAR?

218
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,291
- HELP ME!
HELP, PLEASE!

219
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,583
SOMEONE HELP ME! 
TENCHI!

220
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,541
- AHHHH!

221
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,541
WELL, I SEE TSUNAMI MUST BE
PROTECTING THOSE OF ROYAL BLOOD.

222
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,708
IN THAT CASE--
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

223
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,500
- WELL, THE SHREW
THAT WAS IN THE WORLD

224
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,458
OF SHADOW HAS RETURNED, I SEE.

225
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,291
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I'VE BEEN WAITING.

226
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,625
BUT THEN YOUR TIMING
WAS NEVER PERFECT.

227
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,041
- I'M AT YOUR SERVICE.

228
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,708
- ( grunts )
WHERE AM I?

229
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

230
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,333
- Woman: YOU ARE ALL RIGHT NOW.
- HUH?

231
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,458
WHO ARE YOU?
TELL ME WHERE WE ARE.

232
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,875
- I AM TSUNAMI,
THE SHIP OF JURAI.

233
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,791
AND WE ARE INSIDE OF MYSELF.

234
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,000
- INSIDE OF YOU?

235
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,416
BUT YOU'RE HUMAN.

236
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,666
WAIT, I GET IT.
YOU OWN THIS SHIP, RIGHT?

237
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,208
- NO.

238
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,125
THE OWNER OF THIS SHIP
IS SASAMI.

239
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,750
- SASAMI?

240
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,541
- YES.

241
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,666
YOU SEE, WHAT I AM
IS THE MIND OF THE SHIP.

242
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,708
- YOU'RE LIKE A HUMAN VERSION
OF RYO-OHKI?

243
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,250
OH MY GOD!  RYO-OHKI!
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

244
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:20,041
- I CAN DETECT RYO-OH'S KEY
70 LIGHT SECONDS FROM US

245
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,291
AT THIS MOMENT.
- ARE THEY STILL ALIVE?

246
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:28,083
- I FEEL RYO OH'S KEY
RESPONDING FROM WITHIN SOJA.

247
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,541
- ALIVE?
- THEY MUST BE IN CLOSE COMBAT.

248
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,250
- COMBAT? ARE THEY REALLY
FIGHTING OVER THERE

249
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,500
ON THAT SHIP?

250
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,958
PLEASE TAKE ME THERE.
WE HAVE TO GET IN THERE.

251
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,458
- TENCHI, LISTEN TO ME.

252
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,708
I CANNOT LEAVE HERE.

253
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,416
ON THIS JOURNEY,
YOU WILL HAVE TO GO ALONE.

254
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,458
IS THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?

255
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,833
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME.

256
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,291
- WELL THEN...

257
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,291
- Mihoshi: THERE'S NO WAY OUT?

258
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,916
- Washu:
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,666
YOU SEE HERE
ON THE SHIP'S DIAGRAM,

260
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,625
THAT GOES THIS WAY
AND THIS GOES THAT WAY.

261
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,041
- UH-HUH.
- AND SO THERE IS NO WAY OUT.

262
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,000
ABSOLUTELY NONE.

263
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,375
NO WAY!  THAT'S IT.
GOT IT?

264
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,333
- UM, NOPE. I DON'T
GET IT AT ALL.

265
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,375
- OH!

266
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,208
- SO I GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME

267
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,208
IS THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY
OUT OF HERE?

268
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,416
- WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN THEY HANDED OUT THE BRAINS?

269
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
- BUT HOW CAN THIS BE? YOU
CREATED THIS SHIP, DIDN'T YOU?

270
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,416
- MM-HMM.  AND THAT IS
WHY IT IS SO PERFECT!

271
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,125
- ( banging )
- ( gasps )

272
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,875
- ( sobbing )
- OKAY, YOU PAIN IN THE NECK.

273
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,791
THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE THINGS
WE CAN DO HERE.

274
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,541
- RYOKO!

275
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,166
AND WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?

276
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,583
- TAKE THIS AND JOIN IN.

277
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,875
- HURRAY HURRAY, RYOKO!
( blowing whistle )

278
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,416
WATCH OUT.

279
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,750
- AHH!

280
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,958
- HA!

281
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,458
- ALL RIGHT, RYOKO NAILED HIM.

282
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,041
- I SURE HOPE SHE DID.

283
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,333
- THIS PILLAR IS VERY DENSE.

284
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,500
HE MUST HAVE GOTTEN
SERIOUSLY DAMAGED.

285
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,708
( gasps ) AH!

286
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,833
OH!  AHH!

287
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,833
- WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS,
PRINCESS?

288
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,000
- AHHH!

289
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,083
- ( grunting )

290
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,750
- I AM GOING TO ENJOY
CRUSHING YOU.

291
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,291
- YES, I'M SURE YOU
WOULD IF YOU COULD.

292
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,541
- WHAT?

293
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,125
- JUST WHAT SEEMS
TO BE THE PROBLEM, RYOKO?

294
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,458
- BUT WHY DOESN'T RYOKO
USE HER FULL POWER?

295
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,125
- WOWEE!
YOU MEAN SHE ISN'T?

296
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,583
- IF SHE WAS,
THIS WOULD BE OVER BY NOW.

297
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,125
- WELL, EXCUSE ME.

298
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,250
- RYOKO CAN'T BEAT HIM
LIKE THAT,

299
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,916
EVEN ON HER OWN TURF.

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,875
- Mihoshi: RYOKO.

301
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,791
- AHHHH!

302
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,833
- ( grunting )

303
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,916
- AHA.  THAT WAS WHY.

304
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,125
- AHA, THAT WAS WHY WHAT?

305
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,000
- IF RYOKO
USES HER FULL STRENGTH,

306
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,208
AYEKA WILL BE BURNT TO A CINDER
BY THE COUNTER FLOW

307
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,708
OF THE EXTRA ENERGY.

308
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,958
- WELL, YOU SEEM
TO HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS.

309
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,708
WHAT SHOULD SHE DO?

310
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,791
- HAND ME YOUR CUBE.

311
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,125
- AHHHH!

312
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,875
- COME TO ME, AYEKA.

313
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,250
- AYEKA.

314
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,083
- WE CAN'T GET OVER THERE,
BUT THEY CAN COME HERE.

315
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,625
- Kagato: YOU ARE MAKING IT
EASIER FOR RYOKO TO FIGHT, HUH?

316
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,541
EVEN I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
TO AYEKA

317
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,541
NOW THAT SHE'S
IN ANOTHER DIMENSION.

318
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,625
- WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE US ALONE?

319
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,958
'CAUSE IF YOU DO,
I'LL LET YOU GO FREE.

320
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,291
- GO FREE?

321
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,500
- RYOKO AND I ARE NOT
UNDER YOUR POWER ANYMORE.

322
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:05,458
- AND I AM NO LONGER
YOUR STUDENT, PROFESSOR.

323
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,875
DO YOU THINK
I HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING

324
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,875
IN THE PAST 5,000 YEARS?
- WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?!

325
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:16,000
- I DIRECTED ALL THE FORCE
OF THE GEMS FOR SOJA.

326
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,791
ALTHOUGH I COULD MAKE IT
AS COMPACT AS RYOKO.

327
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,791
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THE POWER
I CAN PRODUCE AT ONE TIME

328
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,833
IS FAR GREATER THAN RYOKO'S.

329
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,291
- I'M GETTING WEAK.
MY POWER IS DRAINING.

330
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:31,750
- ( whirring )

331
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,208
- PROFESSOR, I'M GOING TO
SHOW YOU A LITTLE EXPERIMENT

332
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,583
JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS.
- I FORBID IT.

333
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,583
- PRINCESS AYEKA, YOU'RE IN
NO POSITION TO FORBID ANYTHING.

334
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,208
AND SINCE
YOU'RE NOT COOPERATING,

335
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,291
I'LL INTERROGATE
YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER INSTEAD.

336
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,500
( laughs )
- NO, PLEASE DON'T!

337
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,750
SASAMI!  YOSHO!

338
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,791
- THERE IT IS,
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

339
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,083
IT IS TRULY AMAZING.

340
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,958
HOW CAN IT TAKE UP
SO MUCH ENERGY, HUH?

341
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,916
WHAT? WHOA!

342
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,958
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
OH!

343
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,000
- THE 10 WINGS
OF THE NIGHT HAWK,

344
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,083
THE ROYAL FAMILY'S
MOST POWERFUL SHIP-- TSUNAMI.

345
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,083
- IS THAT IT?

346
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,833
- Kagato: MY SHIELD
IS COMPLETELY USELESS.

347
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,041
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL
THE GEMS CAN DO.

348
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,000
NO!
THAT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

349
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,625
- THAT IS THE MOST POWERFUL
OF ALL SHIPS.

350
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,958
- THERE IS ONE FINAL USE
FOR YOU.

351
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,750
WHEN YOU LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS,

352
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,875
ALL THE POWER FROM YOUR GEMS
WILL BE SOJA'S TO USE.

353
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,833
IT'S A PITY, RYOKO,
THAT YOU WON'T LIVE TO SEE ME

354
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,208
AS THE RULER
OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

355
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,583
- I'M SORRY, TENCHI.

356
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:10,125
- AH!
WHAT WAS THAT?!

357
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,166
- TENCHI.

358
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,708
- ( gasps )

359
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,083
ARE YOU REAL?
- I'M NO GHOST!

360
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,666
- Kagato: DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE STILL ALIVE, KID.

361
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,375
- NO, TENCHI, DON'T.

362
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,958
- NOW I'LL BE FINE.

363
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,791
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO?

364
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,708
- HUH?

365
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,916
JEEZ!  I CAN'T GET IT OUT!

366
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,333
- AND NOW I'M WORRIED.

367
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,833
- ( grunting )

368
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,250
- Kamidake: TENCHI,
LET US HANDLE THIS.

369
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,833
- WHAT?

370
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,166
HUH?
- HERE WE COME.

371
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,583
- WHAT A COMICAL PAIR
YOU TWO ARE.

372
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,750
- I GOT IT!

373
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,041
- ( both shouting )

374
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,208
- YOU TWO LOOK AFTER RYOKO.

375
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,875
- Azaka: YES, SIR!
- AYYYYY!

376
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,875
WHAT THE--

377
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,333
DAMN!
JUST WHEN I NEED IT MOST.

378
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,625
- JUST A RUSTY OLD PIECE
OF JUNK.

379
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,791
- WHOA!

380
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,250
( grunting )

381
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,458
- THE MASTER KEY IS JUST A TOOL

382
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,666
TO ACTIVATE THE
POWER OF THIS SHIP.

383
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,458
IT'S USELESS WHEN CUT OFF
FROM THE SHIP'S POWER.

384
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,666
- YEEEEAAA!

385
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,625
OOOHHHH!

386
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,291
- TENCHI?
OH, I CAN'T MOVE.

387
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,666
HEY, YOU TWO, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?! GO HELP HIM.

388
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,041
- WE CAN'T.

389
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,083
KAGATO'S FORCE IS INCREASING
AT AN INCREDIBLE RATE.

390
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,333
WE ARE USING ALL OUR POWER
JUST TO SHIELD IT.

391
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:42,208
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOUR SWORD DOESN'T HELP ANYMORE?

392
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,500
IF ONLY YOU HAD
LEFT THESE WOMEN BEHIND,

393
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,458
YOU COULD HAVE REMAINED ALIVE.

394
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,250
- I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN FORSAKE ANY ONE OF THEM.

395
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,125
- ( laughs ) 
- OH!

396
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,666
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME
BECAUSE I HAVE ALL THE GEMS!

397
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,625
( laughs ) 

398
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,625
- ( screaming )
- ( laughing )

399
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,958
MARVELOUS POWER, SPLENDID.

400
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,958
( laughs ) 

401
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,666
COME TO ME NOW, TSUNAMI!

402
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,833
- ( gasps )

403
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,583
- NO!
THIS CAN'T BE THE END.

404
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,041
- DO SOMETHING BRILLIANT.

405
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,083
YOU CREATED THIS
SHIP, DIDN'T YOU?

406
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,458
- SHE'S RIGHT.

407
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,500
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF.

408
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,750
- WELL, OKAY, SO THERE IS JUST
ONE MORE THING THAT WE CAN TRY.

409
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,083
- WHAT IS IT?

410
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,708
- WE CAN PRAY REAL HARD.

411
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,375
( speaking Japanese )

412
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,416
- ( gasps )
TSUNAMI, I'M SCARED.

413
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,375
- IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.
YOUR POWER JOINED WITH MINE--

414
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,375
WE'LL BE UNBEATABLE
IN THE UNIVERSE.

415
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,708
- TENCHI, I'M SCARED.

416
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,208
- I'M SORRY TO FAIL YOU.

417
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:55,250
I AM NOT CAPABLE
OF RESCUING YOUR SISTER.

418
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,666
I CAN'T EVEN USE THIS SWORD.

419
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,125
- Tsunami: HAVE FAITH
IN YOUR OWN POWER.

420
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,250
- HUH?

421
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:06,666
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
SOJA IS VERY DANGEROUS.

422
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,083
- AS LONG AS I HAVE THIS SWORD,
I CAN MANAGE SOMEHOW.

423
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,583
- LISTEN.
- WHAT?

424
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:16,500
- DON'T RELY
ON THE SWORD ALONE.

425
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:21,375
TENCHI, YOU'LL HAVE TO TRUST
IN YOUR OWN POWER.

426
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,541
- TRUST IN MY OWN POWER?

427
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,250
MY POWER?

428
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,458
- YES.

429
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,958
- Kagato: HOW CAN YOU
HAVE ANY POWER LEFT?

430
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,958
- I HAVE BEEN RELYING
ON THIS SWORD TOO MUCH.

431
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,916
- I WAS GOING
TO FINISH YOU LATER,

432
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,125
BUT WHY NOT NOW, HUH?

433
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,791
SO YOU'RE GIVING UP?

434
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,541
- Ryoko:
TENCHI, RUN!  GET AWAY!

435
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,666
( grunting ) STOP.

436
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,416
AW, PLEASE DON'T.

437
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,291
OH, YOU GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED.

438
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,375
PLEASE SPARE HIM.

439
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:08,333
- CAN THIS BOY
REALLY MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU?

440
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,958
WELL, NOT TO WORRY.

441
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,916
VERY SOON YOU AND PRINCESS AYEKA
WILL JOIN HIM--

442
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,375
VERY SOON INDEED.

443
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,750
HE WON'T BE ALONE IN DEATH.

444
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,750
- NO!

445
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,541
- OH!

446
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,375
- AH, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

447
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,291
AH, IMPOSSIBLE. I THOUGHT
THE POWER FROM TSUNAMI

448
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,875
WAS COMPLETELY CUT OFF.

449
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,041
IT'S YOU!

450
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,500
- AH!

451
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,208
- IT'S YOU!
YOU'RE CREATING ALL THIS.

452
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,541
- THE TRANSFORMATION
OF OBJECTS.

453
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,291
THE WINGS OF THE LIGHT HAWK!
UNBELIEVABLE.

454
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,291
- AHHH!

455
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,291
NOW!
GET HIM!

456
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,250
- AHHH!

457
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,666
- I'VE GOT YOU!

458
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,125
- YEEEAAA!

459
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,958
( groaning )

460
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,833
- TENCHI.

461
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:26,708
SAME NAME AS THE MASTER KEY.
WELL DONE, TSUNAMI.

462
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,166
TENCHI CAN'T BE COPIED.

463
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,958
SPLENDID PLAN.

464
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,541
YOU'VE WON, BOY.

465
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,666
- A BOY WHO CAN
CREATE THE WINGS OF

466
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,875
THE LIGHT HAWK, HUH?

467
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,041
I WANT TO MAKE HIM MINE!

468
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,708
- TENCHI!

469
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:59,291
- All: HI, TENCHI!

470
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:02,291
All: OH, TENCHI!

471
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,875
OW!

472
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,750
- ( laughs ) 
TOO BAD!

473
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,375
I'M GOING TO BE THE FIRST
TO GIVE TENCHI A HUG.

474
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,875
TENCHI!

475
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,750
- ( meows ) 

476
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,583
- I SAID I'M FIRST!
- ( meows ) 

477
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,166
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
MY NAME IS WASHU.

478
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,750
