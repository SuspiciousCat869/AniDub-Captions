ANYWAY, IT'LL BE
JUST FOR A FEW DAYS.

WELL, TENCHI WAS MUCH MORE
ADORABLE WHEN HE WAS LITTLE.

SEE, HIS EYES
LOOK EXACTLY LIKE TENCHI'S.

- HUH? YEAH?
THEY DO?

76
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,875
- AND YOU SEE, IF HE'S THE
GRANDSON OF TENCHI'S AUNT,

77
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,625
WELL THEN, THAT MEANS

PLEASE, MISS AYEKA,
YOU GO AHEAD AND CHANGE.

OR THAT GOES WHERE--
I DON'T KNOW!

DIAPER COVER.

147

OH, I SEE!
SO THIS IS A DIAPER COVER.

148
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,833
THAT'S WHY IT DIDN'T WORK.
( laughs ) 

149

- MMM.
- HE WON'T PEE SO SOON.

157
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,500
- BUT TENCHI TOLD ME
TO PUT THE DIAPER COVER ON

158
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,083
BEFORE I DID ANYTHING ELSE.

159
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,416
- TENCHI WAS MUCH MUCH CUTER
WHEN HE WAS A BABY.

- ( mumbling )

OH, SOMEONE MUST HAVE
MADE SOME ALREADY.

334
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,541
WELL, WASHU, IT SURE LOOKS LIKE
THE BABY BELONGS TO YOU NOW.

335
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,666
- GUESS I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

336
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,166
- HE'S SUCH AN ANGEL
WHEN HE'S ASLEEP.

337
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,375
BUT ONCE HE WAKES UP--

338
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,875
- THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

339
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,458
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TALK YET,
YOU SEE.

340
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,875
SO HE HAS TO SHOW WHAT HE WANTS
WITH HIS BODY.

341
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:05,416
SAYING, "I'M HERE.
I WANT THIS OR THAT."  RIGHT?

342
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,041
- YOU'RE A SELFISH LITTLE THING,
AREN'T YOU?

343
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,208
- WELL, IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

344
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:15,083
YOU SEE, THAT'S THE ONLY THING
YOU CAN BE WHEN YOU'RE A BABY.

345
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,875
HMM?

346
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,875
WHAT NOW?
- OH, WELL, YOU SEE,

347
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,125
I LOST MY MOTHER
WHEN I WAS VERY LITTLE.

348
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,875
AND I WAS WONDERING IF THIS
IS HOW A MOTHER AND CHILD ARE.

349
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,375
- OH, YES, THIS IS EXACTLY HOW
YOU AND YOUR MOTHER WERE.

350
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,750
- OH, YOU THINK SO?

351
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,833
- I KNOW SO.
- HUH?

352
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,416
- ( Taro crying )
- OH.

353
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,000
UM, SORRY I WOKE YOU UP.

354
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,708
WELL, I HAVE TO
BE ON MY WAY NOW.

355
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,208
AND, UH...

356
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,708
- TENCHI?

357
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,708
- HUH?
- GOOD NIGHT.

358
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,458
- GOOD NIGHT, LITTLE WASHU.

359
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,625
- ( whimpering )

360
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,583
MAMA.  MAMA.

361
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,666
MAMA.
- NOT ME, LITTLE ONE.

362
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,791
I'M NOT YOUR MOMMY.
- MAMA.  MAMA.

363
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,791
- NO, I'M NOT YOUR MOM.

364
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,375
( humming )

365
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,375
BINGO!

366
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,125
( humming, slurping )

367
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,875
- 'MORNING.
WHAT'S UP?

368
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:32,458
- OH, TENCHI, GOOD MORNING.
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW,

369
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,041
SO YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT A MOMENT.

370
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,541
- ( doorbell rings )
- HUH?

371
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,250
WHO COULD IT BE?

372
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:42,166
- YES, HONEY, IT'S COMING.

373
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,125
- LITTLE WASHU?

374
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:53,041
- ( all yawning )

375
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,541
- THANK YOU
FOR TAKING CARE OF HIM.

376
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,416
- THANK YOU.

377
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,958
IT WAS SO NICE OF YOU, REALLY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

378
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,833
- I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

379
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,291
YOU DID A GREAT JOB
FOR YOUR AGE.

380
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:09,833
- OH, WELL, THERE'S SO
MANY GIRLS AROUND HERE.

381
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:13,916
SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF HIM ALONE.

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,958
- MA!  MAMA.

383
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,250
- Aunt: OH MY,
THE BABY'S TALKING.

384
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,375
- Father:
WOW, HE REALLY IS TALKING.

385
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,333
"MAMA, MAMA."

386
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,375
- WELL, IT'S TIME FOR US
TO BE GOING NOW.

387
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,791
THANKS AGAIN.

388
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,458
AND PLEASE TELL SASAMI
TO COME VISIT TARO

389
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,291
WHENEVER SHE WANTS.

390
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,750
- OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL HER.

391
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,916
- YEAH!
THANK GOD HE'S GONE.

392
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,791
- YOU WORKED THE HARDEST
OF US ALL, LITTLE WASHU.

393
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,416
IT WAS A LOT OF WORK,
BUT THEN,

394
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,583
WE'LL MISS HIM
WHEN HE'S GONE, I GUESS.

395
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,625
- HE CALLED ME MOM.

396
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,291
OH, BABIES, BABIES.

397
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,791
TENCHI?
- YES?

398
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,041
- I HAD A BABY ONCE.
- WHAT?

399
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:12,375
- THE FATHER WAS A MEMBER
OF ROYAL SPACE ACADEMY,

400
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,875
LIKE MYSELF.

401
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,166
WE WERE BOTH STUDENTS
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.

402
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,333
I LOVED HIM
AND FELT SO ATTACHED TO HIM.

403
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,041
ME AND HIM AND THE BABY--

404
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,375
THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

405
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,000
BUT YOU SEE,

406
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,625
HE WAS FROM
A VERY PRESTIGIOUS FAMILY.

407
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,958
WHILE I WAS GONE,
MESSENGERS CAME FROM HIS FAMILY

408
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:39,166
AND HE AND THE BABY
WERE TAKEN FROM ME.

409
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,333
LINEAGE, SOCIAL STATUS--

410
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:52,708
WHY SHOULD THESE THINGS
MATTER SO MUCH?

411
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,541
THAT'S HOW GROWN UPS ARE.

412
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,958
IF THAT'S SO, I'D BE HAPPIER
BEING A CHILD,

413
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,875
NEVER EVER GROWING UP.

414
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,708
- THAT'S TERRIBLE,
LITTLE WASHU.

415
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,541
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!

416
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,500
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HEEE--

417
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,708
UH, I-- HUH?

418
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:09,791
- HMM!

419
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,791
- WHAAAA!

420
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:20,125
- TENCHI, I'LL BE GLAD
TO BEAR A CHILD

421
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:23,291
IF THE CHILD IS YOURS.
- WHOA WHOA WHOA!

422
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:26,791
UH, MISS WASHU, REALLY, I--
- NO NO NO, TENCHI.

423
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,416
YOU CAN JUST CALL ME
WASHU NOW.

424
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,041
- WHOA WHOA!
- NOW NOW NOW.

425
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,625
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES, TENCHI.
- EEEEEK!

426
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,625
- WHOA!

427
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,583
- HMMM!

428
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:42,750
- OUCH!  YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT
TO YOUR MOMMY, LITTLE RYOKO.

429
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,458
- ( groans )

430
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,208
MOMMY MY BUTT!

431
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:49,041
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO STOP, DO YOU NOW?

432
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,333
- MMM, HONEY, I THOUGHT
I'D MAKE YOU A LITTLE BROTHER

433
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:56,208
IN CASE YOU'RE LONELY BEING
THE ONLY CHILD IN THE FAMILY.

434
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,625
I KNOW IT REALLY MUST BE TOUGH.

435
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:02,000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW I FEEL!

436
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,458
I'M SO SAD.

437
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,583
- MISS-- MISS WASHU!

438
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:09,833
HOW DARE YOU SAY SUCH THINGS
WHEN YOU HAVE A HUSBAND?

439
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,541
HOW DARE YOU?

440
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,375
- THAT WAS 20,000 YEARS AGO
THAT I HAD A HUSBAND.

441
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,083
"HAD" A HUSBAND.

442
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:19,208
AY, BUT I'M STILL
QUITE SO YOUNG

443
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,625
THAT I'M LONELY
COME BEDTIME.

444
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,333
- ( groans )
- AHH!

445
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,291
I'M SO EMBARRASSED.
- AH!

446
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,041
- HEY, YOU,
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.

447
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,500
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

448
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,958
YOU DON'T LAY A FINGER
ON MY TENCHI.

449
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,708
- Ayeka: RYOKO, HOW DARE YOU?

450
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,250
- OH MY.
- RYOKO--

451
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,916
- Ryoko: SHUT UP, I'M BUSY NOW!

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,916
- PLEASE STOP IT,
BOTH OF YOU!

453
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,541
- ( sighs )

454
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,875
- THOSE KIDS,
THEY ARE SO HELPLESS.

455
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:42,416
- HUH?

456
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,458
RIGHT, TENCHI?

457
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,958
THEY NEVER GROW UP, DO THEY?
- ...NOTHING MORE!

458
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,916
- Ryoko: I KNOW TENCHI
WOULD AGREE WITH ME.

459
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,625
Ayeka: HE'S BEEN MINE
SINCE BEFORE HE WAS BORN,

460
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:52,708
I'M TELLING YOU.

461
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,291
- THAT'S WHAT YOU CLAIM,
NOTHING MORE.

462
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,458
- THERE IS A STRONG BOND OF LOVE
BETWEEN TENCHI AND ME!

463
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,375
