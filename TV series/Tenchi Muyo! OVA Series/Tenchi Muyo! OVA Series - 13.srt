- WELL,
NOTHING FROM MIHOSHI YET,

00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,791
ALTHOUGH I AM SURE IT SHOULD BE
READY ANY DAY NOW, COMMANDER.

LEVEL "A." WELL THEN, ALL RIGHT.
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE EASIER

68
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,375
THAN TRYING
TO SUMMARIZE MIHOSHI'S REPORT.

TO GET DONE.

73

YOU'VE CHANGED SO MUCH!

125
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,416

126
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,416
( grunts )

127
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,208
- YOU USED TO HAVE SOFT
AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR.

128
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:13,416
YOU DYED YOUR HAIR AND IT'S
ALL HARD AND POINTY NOW!

129
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,166
- UH...

( sobbing )

132

NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

133
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,333
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN
TO A THING I SAID, DID YOU?

00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,083
MY MOTHER!

147
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,375

151
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,000

00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,958

154
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,916
- IT'S OKAY, MOM.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,500
- OH, BOY.

156
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,416
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH, SASAMI.
- HMM.

157
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,875
- NOW NOW, PLEASE STOP CRYING,
MOTHER.

158
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,541
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
WE'RE TOGETHER NOW.  RIGHT?

159
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,125
- OH, SASAMI!

160
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,791

161
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,583
AH!  THERE YOU ARE.

162
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,583

163
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,375
- AH!
THERE YOU ARE!

164
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:11,333

LONG TIME SINCE I SAW YOU.

165
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:15,500
OH, AND JUST NOW
I SAW LADY FUNAHO ALSO.

166
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,791
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU BOTH
DOING SO WELL.

167
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,500
- HUH?

168
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,166
- ( laughs awkwardly )

169
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,625
- MM-HMM.

170
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,583
- HEH HEH.

171
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,166
- HMM?

172
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,583
- AH, RYOKO, NOW,
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME.

173
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,458
I'M ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING
YOU COULD TEASE ME ABOUT LATER

174
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:44,041
AND I'M WARNING YOU NOT TO.
- UH, YEAH, WHATEVER.

175
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,333
- DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

176
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,208
- HMM.

177
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,958
- ( squeals )
MY MOMMY!

178
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,083
- ( Ryoko grunts )

179
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,500
- LITTLE AYEKA!

180
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,125
- OH, MOMMY!

181
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,583
- AYEKA!

182
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,625
- IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU, MOMMY!

183
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,333
- COME TO ME!

184
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,333
- ( both crying )

185
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,333
- ( laughs ) 

186
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:16,166
SHE'S--
SHE'S CALLING HER "MOMMY."

187
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,041
UH... ( gagging )

188
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,458
- NOBODY MOCKS MY LITTLE AYEKA.

189
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,666
ARE YOU UNDERSTANDING ME?!

190
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,916
- UH, I THINK SO.

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,166
PLEASE LET ME GO.
LET ME GO.

192
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,958
- I DID WARN YOU.

193
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,458
SASAMI?
- HERE, READ THIS!

194
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,500
- OKAY.

195
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,333
"I'M SORRY, PRETTY YOUNG LADY."

196
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,291
- OH.

197
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,666
OKAY, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

198
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,500
- UH...
- COME TO ME.

199
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,583
- OH.  ( grunts )

200
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,833
- ( meows ) 

201
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,208
- Sasami: OH, RYO-OHKI,
YOU'RE AWAKE, HUH?

202
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,583
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows ) 
- OH.

203
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:08,000
- ( meows ) 

204
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:12,500
- ( grunts )
- OH, HOW ADORABLE.  OH!

205
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,916
COME TO AUNTIE MISAKI.
- ( meows )

206
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:22,583
- OH, YOU'RE SO CUTE.
- ( meows ) 

207
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,250
- DON'T--

208
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,791
DON'T MIND ME.

209
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,625
REALLY.

210
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,958
- PLEASE HAVE SOME TEA.

211
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,083
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

212
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,458
HMM.

213
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:02,125
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
I'M BACK HERE.

214
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,750
- YES, HARD TO BELIEVE.

215
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,458
SINCE YOU LEFT THIS PLANET,

216
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,291
THE EARTH MUST HAVE
GONE THROUGH LOTS OF CHANGES.

217
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,083
- COME, YOSHO,

218
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,791
HOW LONG WILL YOU STAY
IN YOUR DISGUISE?

219
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,291
- HUH?

220
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:22,041
I CAN'T DECEIVE YOU, CAN I?

221
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,458
- ( laughs )

222
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:35,333
- NOBODY HERE HAS ANY IDEA
AS TO WHAT I REALLY LOOK LIKE.

223
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,458
- HMM?
- MOTHER?

224
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,708
HMM?
AH, TENCHI!

225
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,791
- ( knocking )

226
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,041
- WHEN YOU'RE DONE
SWEEPING OUTSIDE,

227
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,958
YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THE STAIRS.

228
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,708
- ( footsteps recede )

229
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,416
- ( laughs )

230
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,583
HE REALLY IS SOMETHING ELSE.

231
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,708
YES, QUITE A HANDFUL.

232
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,250
- YOU KNOW, AT FIRST I THOUGHT
I COULD SEND TENCHI

233
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,666
INSTEAD OF GOING MYSELF.

234
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,416
- CAN HE FIT IN
ON PLANET JURAI?

235
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,541
- PERHAPS.
I THINK HE CAN.

236
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,791
- HE MUST BE TROUBLE
FOR THE LADIES.

237
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,541
I CAME HERE BECAUSE

238
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,750
WE HAVE RECEIVED A REPORT
FROM THE GALAXY POLICE.

239
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,083
- WHEN RYOKO WAS RESURRECTED,

240
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,791
I KNEW THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO COME SOONER OR LATER.

241
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,583
BUT WHY?

242
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,333
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
WHEN RYOKO APPEARED?

243
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:42,166
THE GALAXY POLICE REPORT WORKED
AS A TRIGGER. IS THAT IT?

244
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,625
- YOSHO?

245
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,000
- HUH?

246
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,666
- MAY I HAVE ANOTHER CUP OF TEA,
YOSHO?

247
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,875
- OH!
UM, I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED.

248
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,416
MIHOSHI SUBMITTED THE REPORT
TO THE GALAXY POLICE

249
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,541
OVER TWO MONTHS AGO,
DIDN'T SHE?

250
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:10,875
MAY I ASK WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG, MOTHER?

251
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,333
- I SUPPOSE
IT'S BECAUSE MIHOSHI WROTE,

252
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,166
SHALL WE SAY,
AN EXHAUSTIVE REPORT.

253
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,375
- HMM?

254
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:22,458
- MIHOSHI'S REPORT
IS TOP SECRET

255
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,208
WITH THE GALAXY POLICE.

256
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,791
- THEN IT WILL GO TO JURAI'S
SUPREME COUNCIL MEETING.

257
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS NOT A PRIVATE MATTER

258
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,208
TO THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY
ANYMORE.

259
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,708
THE KING OF JURAI
WILL BE HERE SOON TOO.

260
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,500
- FATHER WILL COME.

261
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,750
AND THE COUNCIL'S
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

262
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,750
- WE ARE ITS REPRESENTATIVES,
MISAKI AND I.

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,583
( sighs )

264
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,708
SO, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
OF INFORMATION

265
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,416
AND THE SUPREME COMMANDER
OF THE ROYAL BODYGUARD

266
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,291
HAD TO COME ALL THIS WAY.

267
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,208
- ROYAL TREES
LOSE THEIR POWER

268
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:06,166
ONCE THEY FIND THEIR ROOTS
IN SOIL, YOSHO.

269
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,875
OF COURSE YOU UNDERSTAND.

270
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,958
IF WE WANT
TO SUSTAIN THEIR POWER,

271
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:16,250
WE HAVE TO KEEP THEM CHARGED
BY OUR ROYAL TREES.

272
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,166
DURING THE PAST 700 YEARS,
THE SHIPS THAT WERE MISSING

273
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,166
WERE YOUR FUNAHO,
AYEKA'S RYO-OH.

274
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,833
OF COURSE,
SASAMI'S SHIP AS WELL.

275
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:35,125
- YOU'RE WONDERING
ABOUT MY APPEARANCE, AREN'T YOU?

276
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,333
YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
THE REASON WHY TSUNAMI

277
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,583
HAD TO DO THIS. WOULDN'T YOU?

278
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,708
- THE REPORT
ALSO MENTIONED GEMS

279
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,958
THAT ARE THE SOURCE
OF RYOKO'S POWER.

280
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,833
AND IT SAYS THAT THEY WERE
EMBEDDED IN THE MASTER KEY

281
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,708
TO HOLD RYOKO CAPTIVE.

282
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,666
- MMM.

283
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,666
WELL, THAT MIHOSHI
REALLY IS THOROUGH, ISN'T SHE?

284
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,750
SO, YOU ALREADY KNEW
WHAT TO EXPECT.

285
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,666
I SEE THAT NOW.

286
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,791
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT.

287
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,000
I ONLY WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING.

288
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:16,250
- MY SPACESHIP TREE IS THE
ONLY THING SUSTAINING MY LIFE.

289
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,208
I WAS QUITE SURPRISED
WHEN I FOUND OUT

290
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,708
THAT MY TREE
HADN'T LOST ITS POWER.

291
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,166
THEN I MADE
AN INTERESTING DISCOVERY.

292
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,291
I FOUND THAT RYOKO'S GEMS
WERE GIVING ENERGY TO MY TREE.

293
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,000
AND THAT MEANS

294
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,625
THAT RYOKO'S GEMS
HAVE THE SAME QUALITY

295
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,250
AS THE ROYAL FAMILY'S TREES,

296
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,250
THAT THEY HAVE
THE SAME EXACT POWER.

297
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,125
EVEN BEFORE
WE SAW MIHOSHI'S REPORT,

298
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,958
JURAI'S TREES
SUSPECTED ALL THIS.

299
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,208
SO WHEN YOU FOUGHT
WITH RYOKO,

300
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,791
HER SHIP COULD BREAK THROUGH
JURAI'S DEFENSE AREA

301
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,458
AND SHOWED
MASSIVE DESTRUCTIVE POWER.

302
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:04,291
SO THERE WAS NO DOUBT--
HER GEMS WERE POWERFUL.

303
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:09,250
BUT YOUR SHIP MUST HAVE
SENSED ALL OF THIS AS WELL.

304
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,500
AND YOU--
HAVING FOUGHT WITH RYOKO,

305
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,916
YOU MUST HAVE GUESSED THIS.

306
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,708
GIVEN THAT ALL THIS IS TRUE,

307
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,958
HER GEMS SHOULD BE ABLE
TO CREATE THE LIGHT HAWK WINGS

308
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,750
JUST LIKE TENCHI CAN.

309
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:35,833
- I SEE.
YOU CAME TO GET WASHU.

310
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,208
- WE'VE COME TO CHECK
ON AYEKA AND SASAMI.

311
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,333
AND I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

312
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,166
YOU HAVEN'T SENT WORD TO YOUR
POOR MOTHER IN SO MANY YEARS.

313
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,541
700!

314
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,625
- UH, I WAS GOING
TO GO BACK TO JURAI

315
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,125
AFTER MY VICTORY OVER RYOKO,

316
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:56,541
BUT SOMETHING CAME UP
AND I-- WELL--

317
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,250
- OH, BOYS.

318
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,875
ONCE THEY FIND GIRLS,
THEY NEVER THINK OF THEIR MOM.

319
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,000
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES,
I GUESS.

320
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,333
I GUESS THE MOTHER
JUST GETS IN THE WAY

321
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,791
ONCE HER SON FINDS A GIRL.

322
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,166
- HEY!  WELL,
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE, MOTHER!

323
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,458
- MY POOR POOR AYEKA.

324
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,250
- AHEM!

325
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,541
SO, BY THE WAY, MOTHER,

326
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,416
HAVE YOU ALREADY
FINISHED RENOVATING

327
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,541
THE GREAT HALL AT THE PALACE?

328
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:31,208
- AYEKA DOES SEEM
TO BE HAPPY HERE.

329
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,541
THANK YOU
FOR THE NICE TEA.

330
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,250
- ( sighs )

331
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,125
BY THE WAY, IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO VISIT OUR LIVING QUARTERS,

332
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,333
I'LL HAVE TENCHI
SHOW YOU THE WAY.

333
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,083
I'LL BE OVER THERE
IN A SHORT WHILE.

334
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,333
TENCHI!  TENCHI!

335
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,333
- UH, ARE YOU--

336
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,541
- YES?

337
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,500
- UH, NO, NOTHING.

338
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,125
- I UNDERSTAND
IT'S A TENDER SUBJECT, TENCHI,

339
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,375
BUT I HEARD YOU LOST YOUR MOTHER
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG.

340
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,000
YOU MUST HAVE FELT
AWFULLY LONELY.

341
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,083
- ( gulps )
- HOW IS IT NOWADAYS?

342
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,083
- NOW?

343
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,666
IT'S TOO CROWDED HERE.

344
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,000
- BUT YOU'LL BE LONELY
IF WE TAKE THE GIRLS HOME.

345
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,583
WON'T YOU?
- ( bird chirping )

346
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,083
- OR TENCHI,
YOU COULD COME WITH US, HUH?

347
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,541
- HUH?
- Washu: TENCHI!

348
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,375
- AH.
- HUH?

349
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,125
- ( laughs )

350
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,708
- YOU SCARED US.

351
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,083
WASHU, THIS LADY HERE IS--

352
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,833
- FUNAHO, THE QUEEN OF JURAI,
RIGHT?

353
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,208
HOW DO YOU DO?
MY NAME IS WASHU.

354
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:02,291
- HOW DO YOU DO? PLEASED TO
MEET YOU, YOUNG WASHU.

355
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,416
- HMM.

356
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,916
UH, TENCHI, CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?

357
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,833
- WHAT?
- YOU--

358
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,500
GO AHEAD AND TAKE THIS HOME.
I'LL SHOW HER THE WAY.

359
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,791
- BUT--

360
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,375
- MM-HMM.

361
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,708
- THEN I'LL MEET YOU AT HOME.

362
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,583
- LADY FUNAHO, SHALL WE?

363
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,875
- EXCUSE ME, WASHU.
- HUH?

364
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,583
- COULD YOU CALL ME
"LITTLE FUNAHO"?

365
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,083
I'D LIKE THAT.

366
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,541
- OH! 
I-- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

367
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,541
MIHOSHI EVEN WROTE THAT
IN HER REPORT?

368
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,333
- IT TOOK OUR SUPREME COUNCIL
FOUR DAYS

369
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,458
TO SUMMARIZE MIHOSHI'S REPORT,

370
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,583
DURING WHICH TIME,
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE

371
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,458
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

372
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:59,833
- WHENEVER MIHOSHI IS INVOLVED,
IT TAKES TIME, ALL RIGHT.

373
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,333
- WASHU?

374
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,083
YOU KNOW THE REASON
WHY WE ARE HERE, DON'T YOU?

375
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,250
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER NOW?
TELL ME?

376
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,541
- MY ANSWER IS NO.

377
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,500
- ( sighs )

378
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,625
- ( meows )

379
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,416
( singing )

380
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,916
- RYO-OHKI!
WHAT A GOOD TRICK.

381
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,541
AND SO CUTE!

382
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,000
- ( meows )

383
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,500
- MMM!

384
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,458
YOU ARE SUCH A CUTIE PIE!
YOU ARE, YOU ARE.

385
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,416
- I'M HOME! SOUNDS LIKE
YOU GUYS ARE HAVING FUN.

386
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,291
HELLO THERE, TENCHI.
WELCOME HOME.

387
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,875
( meows )

388
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:01,083
- WHOA!
HOW YOU DOING?  AH.

389
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,541
- WELL WELL WELL NOW.
- WHOA!

390
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,750
- YOU MUST BE TENCHI.

391
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,875
- WHY, YES--
- OH!

392
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,041
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MOTHER?!

393
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,041
- HEY, YOU!

394
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,666
- OH, PLEASE, GIRLS.
- HMM?

395
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,791
- YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GET JEALOUS.

396
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,208
I CARE FOR YOU TOO.

397
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,791
- Both: SHE'S HOPELESS.

398
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,583
- SO THIS IS YOUR MOTHER?

399
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:35,333
- YEP.
SHE'S OUR MOTHER MISAKI.

400
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,791
- WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
IS THIS--

401
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,041
JURAI'S SHIPS ARE POWERFUL
BUT CAN'T BE MASS PRODUCED,

402
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,666
BUT RYO-OHKI
CAN BE REPRODUCED EASILY.

403
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,041
- IT'S FINE IF WE'RE THE ONLY
ONES WITH THE TECHNOLOGY.

404
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,125
BUT IF WE'RE NOT--

405
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,041
- HMM!
I DON'T CARE WHO DEVELOPS WHAT.

406
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,958
IT'S NOT MY CONCERN.

407
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,666
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO ALIENATE TENCHI, SO--

408
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,166
- HUH?

409
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,000
- I WILL NOT HELP ANYBODY.

410
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,166
HOW'S THAT?

411
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,458
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WASHU.

412
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,125
- LADY FUNAHO?
- YES?

413
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:27,125
- PLEASE CALL ME LITTLE WASHU!

414
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,416
ALL RIGHT?
- HUH?

415
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,375
( laughs )

416
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,375
- ( laughs )
I AM LITTLE.

417
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,833
( speaking gibberish )

418
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,958
DO YOU WANT
TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL?

419
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,958
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FORCE ME.

420
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,333
- THE NUMBER-ONE
GENIUS SCIENTIST,

421
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,208
THE SECOND GENERATION
OF JURAI'S BATTLESHIPS,

422
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,291
RYOKO AND RYO-OHKI,

423
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,583
AND THE ORIGINAL SPACE TREE,
TSUNAMI,

424
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,750
PLUS THE BOY WHO CAN CREATE
THE LIGHT HAWK WINGS--

425
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,250
IF I'M NOT AFRAID
OF ALL OF THEM COMBINED,

426
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,625
IS THAT IT?

427
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,000
- I THINK MIHOSHI ALONE
WILL DO.

428
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:09,291
BUT I--
I WILL NOT CREATE ANOTHER RYOKO.

429
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,083
I WILL NOT.

430
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,500
- I SEE.

431
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,583
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD
OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

432
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:22,666
- BUT YOUR GREAT-GRANDSON
IS EVEN GREATER,

433
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,583
GREAT-GRANDMA.

434
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,791
- HMM.

435
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:30,666
- ( ship humming )

436
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,333
- THE KING OF JURAI IS HERE.

437
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,916
- ( meows )

438
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,041
- ( sighs )

439
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,916
MY SISTER,

440
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,666
- AUNTIE FUNAHO!

441
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,500
( laughs )
- SASAMI.

442
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:13,041
YOU ARE LOOKING GREAT.
- ( meows )

443
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,083
- YOU MUST BE WASHU, RIGHT?

444
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:18,250
- HMM?
- OH!

445
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,750
- UH, HOW YOU DO, MISAKI?

446
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,750
HOW YOU DOIN'?

447
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:27,125
- THANK YOU FOR TAKING SUCH
GOOD CARE OF AYEKA AND SASAMI!

448
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,250
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

449
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,916
- EH...
- ( sighs )

450
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,625
- HMM.

451
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:36,708
OH, BOY,
SHE REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE.

452
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,791
AH!

453
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,708
- ( both grunt )

454
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,458
- FATHER!  FATHER!
- ( meows )

455
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:56,500
- WOW, YOU LOOK FINE.
AYEKA, SASAMI.

456
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,958
HUH?

457
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,083
- HI.

458
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,875
- AHEM!

459
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,708
- Ayeka: FATHER.

460
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:07,791
UM, FATHER,
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,

461
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,958
HE IS TENCHI.
- IS THAT RIGHT?

462
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,541
NOW WE ARE GOING HOME.
AYEKA.

463
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,583

464
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,458
- WHAT?

465
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:18,625
- BUT, FATHER,
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

466
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,041
HE IS YOSHO'S GRANDSON.

467
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,875
- YOSHO GOT MARRIED
TO THAT EARTHLING

468
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,291
DESPITE MY WISHES.

469
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,625
I DON'T NEED HIS GRANDSON.

470
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,208
- Funaho: I AM ALSO
ONE OF THOSE EARTHLINGS.

471
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:33,625
- AH, BUT YOU--
YOU ARE DIFFERENT.

472
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,041
- HOW AM I DIFFERENT

473
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,416

AYEKA, I HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN
A FIANCE FOR YOU,

477
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,500
ONE THAT IS SUITED FOR THE CROWN
PRINCESS OF THE PLANET JURAI.

478
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,583
- NO, I CANNOT!

479
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,916
BECAUSE TENCHI IS MY--

480
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,916

481
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,208
- THE KING IS RIGHT, AYEKA.

482
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,625
GO ON HOME!

483
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,875
- YOU STAY OUT OF THIS,
YOU BIGMOUTH!

484
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,083
- YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO YOUR DADDY.

485
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,041
- OH!
- GO ON HOME.

486
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,000
( laughs )
- HA!

487
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,625
I GUESS YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

488
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,166
TENCHI SAID
THAT I COULD STAY HERE--

489
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,000
IN FACT,
AS LONG AS I WANT TO.

490
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,375
- HE JUST TOOK PITY ON YOU,
YOU SILLY PRINCESS.

491
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,625
HE KNEW YOU COULDN'T GET
HOME WITHOUT YOUR SHIP.

492
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,583
OH!

493
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,833
- RIGHT, TENCHI?

494
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,958
- Ayeka: OH! WHAT ABOUT YOU?

495
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:32,125
LEAVE TENCHI ALONE!
I COMMAND YOU!

496
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:35,916
- NO, I WON'T!
- I SAID TO LEAVE HIM ALONE!

497
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,708
OH!  NOW YOU TAKE--

498
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,125
- Ryoko: TENCHI IS MINE!

499
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,166
- HEY, AYEKA!

500
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,958
- HE WON'T BE YOURS, NEVER!

501
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:46,375
- ( both grunting )

502
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,375
- SASAMI.

503
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,875
YOU ARE COMING HOME WITH US,
AREN'T YOU?

504
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:54,375
- I WOULD LIKE TO STAY
WITH TENCHI ALSO, FATHER.

505
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,875
- SASAMI!

506
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,708
- AND IF YOU FORCE ME TO GO,

507
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:01,625
I WILL HATE YOU FOREVER!
SO THERE.

508
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,375
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

509
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,708
( singing )

510
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,333
- HUH?

511
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,250
- ( squealing )

512
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,833
( singing )

513
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,500
- WHAT-- WHAT IS THIS?

514
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,958
- ( whimpers ) 

515
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,500
( crying )

516
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:46,541
- WHAT'S WRONG NOW?
WHAT DID I DO?

517
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,625
- ( crying )

518
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:51,458
- HERE, DRY YOUR EYES,
LITTLE ONE.

519
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,208
THERE THERE.

520
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,791
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERFORMANCE.
THAT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING.

521
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,000
- ( crying )

522
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,708
- UM...

523
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,500
AW.

524
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,458
- ( crying continues )

525
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,166
- YOU'RE A GREAT PERFORMER.

526
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,916
YOU ARE.

527
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,333
THAT WAS PROBABLY
THE BEST DANCE I'VE EVER SEEN.

528
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,458
YOU'RE A REAL LITTLE TROOPER.

529
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:15,333
- MMM.

530
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,875
( meows )

531
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,833
- MMM.

532
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:21,625
- ( meowing continues )

533
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,916
- AH! THEY DID.
THEY ENJOYED IT.

534
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,250
- MEOW!

535
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,625
- YOU WERE GREAT, RYO-OHKI.

536
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,250
- MEOW!

537
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,500
- SO, ARE YOU
REALLY TAKING THEM HOME?

538
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,208
IS THAT WHAT THEY WANT?

539
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,750
- AHEM.

540
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,916
AYEKA?

541
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,541
SASAMI?

542
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,041
- HUH?

543
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,333
- AHH.

544
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,666
- IS THIS TRUE?

545
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,708
IS YOUR WISH TO REMAIN HERE?

546
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:53,750
WOULD YOU REALLY CHOOSE THAT BOY
OVER ME?

547
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,875
- UH UH...

548
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,625
- HEY, DON'T YOU
LIKE YOUR DADDY BETTER,

549
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,333
LITTLE PRINCESS AYEKA?

550
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,833
- THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS!

551
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:04,791
- NONE OF MY BUSINESS?

552
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,500
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, SASAMI?

553
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,208
- IF I LEAVE,
THERE'S GONNA BE REAL TROUBLE.

554
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,541
IF I LEAVE, WHO'S GOING
TO COOK FOR THEM?

555
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,000
- HUH?

556
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,500
- ( both chuckle bashfully )

557
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,583
- IT WOULD SEEM THAT OUR GIRLS
WANT TO STAY HERE.

558
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:22,375
- ( groans )

559
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,458
WELL THEN,

560
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:26,958
THERE ISN'T MUCH
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

561
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,833
ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE.

562
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:34,666
- AH!  THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING, FATHER.

563
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,041
- UNDER ONE CONDITION, THOUGH!

564
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,750
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR WISH
IF AND ONLY IF

565
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:44,666
THAT BOY WINS A DUEL WITH THE
MAN I CHOSE AS YOUR FIANCE.

566
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,583
- HUH?

567
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,916
- ( meows )
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

568
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:57,458
- Man: WELL, I'VE BEEN WAITING

569
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,708
FOR THIS MOMENT.

570
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:02,333
( laughs )

571
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,000
( laughs )

572
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,500
I THINK YOU'LL FIND

573
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:19,166
THAT THEY HAVE SAVED
THE VERY BEST FOR LAST.

574
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:27,708
WHAT?  WE WERE JUST
COMING TO THE BEST PART.

575
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,708
- HUH?

576
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:32,833
- OOPS.
I HAVEN'T EVEN SAID HI TO YOU.

577
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,583
PRINCESS AYEKA,

578
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:38,333
YOU LOOK JUST FABULOUS.

579
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:41,541
- AHEM!

580
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,750
NOW LISTEN
AND LISTEN CAREFULLY.

581
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,333
IF THAT BOY CAN DEFEAT HIM,

582
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,791
THEN YOU MAY
DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

583
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,833
- ( laughs )
I'M ROOTING FOR YOU!

584
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,708
GO, TENCHI!
- OH, TENCHI,

585
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:57,750
YOU ARE WILLING TO
FIGHT FOR US, ARE YOU NOT?

586
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,750
- HUH?
- Ryoko: TENCHI!  DON'T FIGHT.

587
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,791
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THIS FOR THEM.

588
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,208
DON'T BE CRAZY.

589
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,625
WHAT?

590
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,708
AND WHAT'S THAT?

591
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,708
- THIS IS A BILL FOR YOU

592
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,333
FOR ALL THOSE PARTS OF JURAI
THAT YOU DESTROYED.

593
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,500
- UH... OOH.

594
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:17,291
- HOWEVER,

595
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:21,375
IF TENCHI WINS, WE MIGHT
FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

596
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,750
- HMM!

597
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:28,458
( gulps )

598
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:31,250
TENCHI, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT.

599
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,708
- YOU'RE DOING THIS JUST TO SAVE
ME FROM MY DEBTS, AREN'T YOU?

600
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:34,875
- EH.

601
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,916
- HEY!

602
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,833
IS HE SWEET OR WHAT?

603
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,333
- WELL.

604
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:43,916
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOING TO DO IT, AYEKA.

605
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,125
- ( crying )
- I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK, TENCHI.

606
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,250
- UH-HUH.

607
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:51,916
- ( laughing )

608
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:03,166
REALLY,
IT'S JUST A WASTE OF TIME.

609
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,750
HE HAS NO CHANCE.
IT'S TOTALLY ONE-SIDED.

610
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:10,083
BUT I MUST FULFILL
THE WISH OF THE KING.

611
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:14,208
AFTER ALL,
HE IS MY FUTURE FATHER-IN-LAW.

612
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,041
- MMM.

613
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,416
- AND HERE'S YOUR DRINK, MOM.

614
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,708
- THANK YOU.
- ( meows ) 

615
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,916
- HONEY!
WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOME TEA?

616
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,208
- NO, THANK YOU.

617
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:32,000
- Seiryo: AH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS! THIS CAN'T BE TRUE!

618
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,125
- NO!
- THAT BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS AYEKA

619
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:39,000
AND PRETTY PRINCESS SASAMI
ARE CONFINED

620
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:43,541
IN THIS-- ( grunts )--
DUMP!

621
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,125
THIS DINGY AND MISERABLE--

622
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,375
THIS PLACE IS MUCH
WORSE THAN A CELL.

623
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,791
I CAN'T STAND THAT
THE PRINCESSES

624
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,416
ARE IN FORCED LABOR HERE.

625
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,625
I HAVE TO SAVE PRINCESS AYEKA
FROM THIS JAIL,

626
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,916
THIS HELL HOLE!
- HUH?

627
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,958
- I THINK IT'S MY-- OR RATHER
ANY CIVILIZED PERSON'S DUTY

628
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:04,083
TO SAVE THEM
FROM THIS MISERY.

629
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,750
- ( sighs )

630
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,166
- SAY,

631
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,250
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL
TAKE TENCHI TO DEFEAT SEIRYO?

632
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,041
- YOU JUST WATCH.

633
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:16,750
SEIRYO IS GOING TO WIN
IN LESS THAN A MINUTE.

634
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,208
- SO YOU'RE BETTING ON SEIRYO
THEN?

635
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,041
- MM-HMM.

636
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:23,625
- I BET 50,000 YEN
ON TENCHI!

637
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:25,000
WHAT ABOUT YOU, SIS?

638
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,875
I AM BETTING ON
TENCHI AS WELL.

639
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:28,500
- HUH?

640
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,083
- HE'S GONNA WIN!

641
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,000
- MEOW!

642
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,833
- OF COURSE,
I'M WAGERING ON TENCHI.

643
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,500
- ( chewing )
TENCHI FOR SURE.

644
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:40,375
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, WASHU?

645
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:44,541
- UM, WELL,
I HAVE TO BET ON MIHOSHI.

646
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,375
- All: WHAT?

647
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,791
- MEOW!

648
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:57,875
- HMM,
IGNORANCE IS YOUR WEAKNESS.

649
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:00,666
YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE NO MATCH FOR ME.

650
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,291
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

651
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,000
IT'S SIMPLY FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

652
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,541
I DON'T WANT
TO HUMILIATE YOU, YOU KNOW?

653
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,291
- UH, I THINK--
- YOU WANT TO CONCEDE?

654
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:15,250
THAT'S A WISE IDEA
FOR AN IGNORANT BARBARIAN.

655
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,541
- I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS.

656
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,291
- IT CERTAINLY IS, ISN'T IT?

657
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,625
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I WILL BE MERCIFUL.

658
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,500
I'M NOT GOING
TO USE MY FULL POWER.

659
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,375
- WHAT I MEAN IS--

660
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,250
- ( panting )
THIS IS FOR YOU.

661
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,083
- NOW...

662
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,875
I AM READY
IF YOU ARE READY.

663
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:41,750
- MMM.

664
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,208
- ( Sasami gasping )

665
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,333
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, TENCHI?

666
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:12,125
- MEOW!
- UH, UM...

667
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,375
- OH!
- HUH?

668
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:24,000
- YAY!
TENCHI'S THE WINNER!

669
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:27,291
- ( meows )
- ( laughs )

670
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,166
- Sasami:
YOU'VE DONE IT, TENCHI!

671
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,000
- MEOW MEOW!

672
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,416
- ( crying )

673
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,458
EXCUSE ME.

674
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:39,958
MY SHIP IS BROKEN DOWN AGAIN,
WASHU.

675
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:42,833
COULD YOU FIX IT FOR ME,
PLEASE?!

676
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:45,208
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

677
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,041
- I AM TERRIBLY SORRY
FOR ALL OF THIS, TENCHI.

678
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,625
I HOPE WE DIDN'T CAUSE YOU
ANY TROUBLE.

679
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,208
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

680
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,916
I APOLOGIZE
FOR NOT BEING A BETTER HOST.

681
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,458
- TENCHI,

682
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,875
RYOKO,

683
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:27,375
WASHU,

684
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,583
MIHOSHI.
- YES?

685
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:33,291
- AND RYO-OHKI.
- MEOW.

686
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:36,791
- OH, MOMMY!

687
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,208
- SASAMI!

688
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,291
- OH, MOM!

689
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,625
- AYEKA!
- MOMMY.

690
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,333
- ( grumbling )

691
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,458
- FATHER?

692
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,833
- YOSHO.

693
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:56,041
PLEASE, TAKE GOOD CARE
OF AYEKA AND SASAMI.

694
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,583
- YOU NEED NOT WORRY, FATHER.

695
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:01,125
TENCHI IS GOING
TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM.

696
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,666
- YOSHO,

697
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,291
I CAN WAIT
ANOTHER 2,000 YEARS

698
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,166
FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

699
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:19,875
- THANK YOU, ALL OF YOU,
FOR EVERYTHING.

700
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,375
TENCHI, TAKE CARE.

701
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:24,750
- YOU TOO, FUNAHO.

702
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:31,166
- EVERYBODY TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF!

703
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,041
TENCHI, LOOK AFTER AYEKA 
AND SASAMI, PLEASE.

704
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:39,000
- UH... ( laughs )
- SO, BYE FOR NOW!

705
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,833
WE'LL COME VISIT YOU AGAIN!

706
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,833
- MOM, I'LL MISS YOU!
- MEOW!

707
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,291
GOOD-BYE!
COME SEE US AGAIN!

708
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,833
- MEOW MEOW MEOW!
- ( crying )

709
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:53,333
- All: GOOD-BYE!

710
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:57,291
- GOOD-BYE, AYEKA!
BE GOOD.

711
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,375
- ( grunts )

712
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,875
- ( laughs )

713
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:05,166
- I WILL, MOMMY!
GOOD-BYE!

714
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,666
- UH... OH.

715
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:43,250
- ( Azaka yawning )
- Kamidake: GOOD MORNING.

716
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,958
- IT'S A SPLENDID MORNING.

717
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:50,458
- WELL, AZAKA, I GUESS WE'RE
GOING TO STAY HERE FOR A WHILE.

718
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:55,250
- VERY PEACEFUL,
BUT VERY BORING INDEED.

719
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:05,208
- ( yawning )

720
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,791
YESTERDAY
SURE WAS ACTION-PACKED.

721
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,500
- ( explosion )
- HUH?

722
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,000
- Ayeka: YOU WON'T GET
AWAY WITH IT THIS TIME!

723
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,583
- Ryoko:
COME AND GET ME IF YOU CAN.

724
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,083
- GET DOWN HERE, RYOKO!
RIGHT THIS MINUTE.

725
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,291
- WHY SHOULD I?

726
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,500
- Sasami: WHAT'S GOING ON?!
- ( moaning )

727
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,375
- Ryoko: YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL.

728
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,333
NO, MY DEAR,
WE ARE ON EARTH NOW.

729
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:05,375
- HA!
I THINK TENCHI'S GROWING ON HIM.

730
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,333
DON'T YOU THINK SO, SISTER?

731
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:11,458
- TENCHI HAS MORE
THAN HE CAN HANDLE.

732
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:18,708
- ( laughs )
TENCHI.

733
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:21,458
DON'T EVEN THINK
I'VE GIVEN IN COMPLETELY.

734
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,791
THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.

735
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,208
( laughs )

736
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,500
( laughter fades )

737
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,291
- Misaki:
SIS, NEXT TIME WE VISIT,

738
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,416
LET'S STAY FOR A FEW DAYS!

739
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,750
- Funaho:
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

740
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:48,000
- ( end theme playing )

741
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,416
- ( singing in Japanese )
