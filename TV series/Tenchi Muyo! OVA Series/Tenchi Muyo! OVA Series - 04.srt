THE SCENE OF THE CRIME--
THE ANCIENT RUINS OF PLANET 617.

21
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,250
A PATROL SQUAD
CONTACTED PATROL FLEET,

22
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,750
MADE PURSUIT
AND WERE TOTALLY DESTROYED.

23
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,750
THEIR RECORDS INDICATE HE MAY
BE HEADED FOR THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

24
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,208
I WANT YOU TO HANDLE THIS CASE
IMMEDIATELY.

25
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,708

RIGHT AWAY.

- THIS IS CERTAINLY
TERRIBLE NEWS.

31
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,541
- BY THE WAY,
WHO IS ON PATROL

32
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,500
OVER THE NON-INTERFERENCE
PRESERVE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM?

33
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,958
- WELL, DETECTIVE FIRST CLASS
MIHOSHI.

34
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,666
- ( coughs )

35
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,416
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- MIHOSHI?!  NO WAY!

36
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,916
WE DON'T HAVE A
BUDGET LARGE ENOUGH

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,458
TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY ON HER.

38
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:35,458
- BUT, COMMANDER, MIHOSHI IS AN
EXCELLENT DETECTIVE. ONLY--

39
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,666
- ONLY HER SERVICE
RECORD STINKS.

40
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,833
THAT'S ALL.
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

41
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,125
- LOOK AT THIS! DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THESE ARE ON MY DESK?

42
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,083
- UH, MISCONDUCT REPORTS?

43
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,541
THERE SEEM TO BE QUITE
A LOT OF BILLS AS WELL.

44
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,291
- AND MOST OF THOSE
ARE THE RESULT OF THE ACTIONS

45
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,916
OF A SINGLE OFFICER.
- AND THAT WOULD BE MIHOSHI?

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,625
- YOU GOT IT.
- UH, WELL, COMMANDER,

47
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,250
I THINK I MIGHT JUST
HAVE A GOOD IDEA.

48
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,333
- WHAT IS IT?

49
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,833
- WELL, THIS ASSIGNMENT
COULD BE A WAY

50
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,333
TO BE RID OF MIHOSHI
AND ALL OF THOSE BILLS.

51
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,583
YOU JUST LEAVE IT TO ME,
COMMANDER.

52
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,458
- ( squealing )

53
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,458
- ( canned laughter )

54
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,916
- ( laughs )
- ( alarm sounding )

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,416
- EMERGENCY CALL?
AHHH!

56
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,166
EMERGENCY?
I'D BETTER HURRY TO THE COCKPIT.

57
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,958
WHOA!  OH OH OH!
I'D BETTER--

58
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,458
OH!  WHAT A MESS.

( panting ) I--

60
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,666
OH OH!  AH!

61
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,833
- ( alarm sounding )
- WHERE ARE YOU?

62
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,875
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MIHOSHI?

63
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,333
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, SIR.

64
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:03,583
UM, UH...
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

65
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,875
- YOU'RE A MESS.
BEFORE WE TALK,

66
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,791
YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK
AT YOURSELF.

67
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,958
- OOH.  UH...

68
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,291
- AHEM! A VERY SERIOUS
INCIDENT HAS OCCURRED.

72
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,083
SO HERE'S WHAT I WANT
YOU TO DO, DETECTIVE MIHOSHI.

73
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,333
IF YOU FIND A SIGN
OF KAGATO'S PRESENCE,

74
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:29,000
CONTACT THE SPECIAL
INVESTIGATION UNIT IMMEDIATELY.

75
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,458
WE'LL TAKE IT OVER FROM
THERE, UNDERSTOOD?

76
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,750
- YES, SIR.

77
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,375
I AM GOING TO PROVE MYSELF
BY CAPTURING KAGATO.

78
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,166

YUKINOJYO?

00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,375
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ACTING WEIRD
AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

157
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,625
- SEE? YOU'RE THINKING OF
SOMETHING KINKY RIGHT NOW,

158
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,125
AREN'T YOU?

159
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,666
- HUH? HUH?

160
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,208
- I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT WOMAN IS SCARY.

161
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,041
AND YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
I PROTECTED YOU WITH MY LIFE,

162
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:57,708
DO YOU?

163
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,958
- COME ON, GET DOWN.

164
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,875
NOBODY SHOULD SEE
YOU UP THERE LIKE THAT.

165
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,416
- OH, TENCHI!

166
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,458
I WANT YOU TO FLIRT
WITH ME TOO.

167
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,500
- AH, GET SERIOUS.

168
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,291
- WELL, FINE, YOU CAN FLIRT WITH
AYEKA, BUT NOT WITH ME, HUH?

169
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,666
HMM!  BE THAT WAY.

170
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,458
- ( grunts )

171
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,666
WHOA!

172
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,000
WHAT DOES SHE WANT FROM ME?

173
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,916
PEEPING?!  AHH!

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,916
- QUIET.
NOT SO LOUD.

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,750
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

176
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,583
YOU'RE NOT TEACHING ME HOW TO
BE A PEEPING TOM, ARE YOU?

177
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:35,083
- TENCHI, LISTEN,
WE'RE HERE AT THE HOT SPRINGS

178
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:39,583
AND THERE ARE YOUNG LADIES
UP THERE IN THE WOMEN'S BATH.

179
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,875
IT WOULD BE REALLY RUDE
NOT TO PEEK.

180
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,541
- THE HOSTESS WILL KILL US
IF SHE FINDS OUT.

181
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,291
- I'M NOT AFRAID OF HER
AT ALL.

182
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,291
- SO, UH, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE TOWEL, DAD?

183
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,250
- NUMBSKULL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

184
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,416
THIS IS THE TRADITIONAL ATTIRE
FOR PEEPING.

185
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,166
- DAD! STOP!

186
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,000
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME,
YOU KNOW?

187
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,333
- HURRY UP, SON.
WE DON'T WANT TO MISS ANYTHING.

188
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,541
- HI THERE.  AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP HERE?

189
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,625
- HMM?

190
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,291
OH!

191
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,125
( splashing )

192
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,250
- THERE YOU ARE.
I WAS WONDERING WHERE YOU WERE

193
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,166
AND WHAT WAS TAKING YOU
SO LONG.

194
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,500
YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY.
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE?

195
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,166
- BUT, I-- WELL--

196
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,375
ISN'T THAT THE WOMAN'S BATH
UP THERE?

197
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,166
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

198
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,041
- AHH!

199
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,541
- UP THERE THE BATH
IS MORE ROOMY, MUCH NICER.

200
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,541
LET'S GO UP THERE, TENCHI.

201
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,916
- STOP THAT!

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,833
OH!  CUT IT OUT.

203
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,750
- HOLD ON TO ME TIGHTLY
OR YOU'LL FALL.

204
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,916
- WHAAA!

205
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,750
AHHH!  OOH.
- OH.

206
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,958
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO SHY?

207
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,625
YOU'VE SEEN ME NAKED BEFORE,
REMEMBER?

208
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,333
INSIDE THE CAVE?

209
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,083
- YEAH, I REMEMBER,
BUT THEN YOU WERE JUST A MUMMY.

210
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,083
- ( humming )

211
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,250
- GIVE ME A LITTLE
ROOM, WILL YA?

212
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,375
- WHY?
- WELL, UH...

213
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,166
- AH, TENCHI, HELLO.

214
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,750
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
ARE YOU ALONE?

215
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,291
- AYEKA IS HERE TOO.

216
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,416
AYEKA, COME OUT!

217
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,458
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE YELLING
LIKE THAT.

218
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,875
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE ACQUIRED
SOME BAD MANNERS

219
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,625
SINCE YOU'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW
THAT RYOKO WOMAN.

220
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,625
ARE YOU LISTENING, SASAMI?
( gasps )

221
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,583
- AYEKA! AH!

222
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,500
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
TENCHI'S HERE TOO.

223
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,166
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THAT SOONER?

224
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,416
I GUESS
I'LL TAKE MY BATH LATER.

225
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,750
- WHY?  WE'RE ALREADY HERE NOW.
LET'S TAKE ONE TOGETHER.

226
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,000
- Ayeka: LET GO OF ME!  STOP!
- PLEASE!

227
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,791
COME OUTSIDE!
- I TOLD YOU TO STOP IT.

228
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,916
- COME ON,
LITTLE MISS PARTY POOPER.

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,125
TIME TO COME OUTSIDE.
TENCHI IS WAITING FOR YOU.

230
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,958
- AHH!  STOP IT, PLEASE.

231
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,083
STOP IT!
LET ME GO, LET ME GO.

232
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,666
- NOW WHAT'S THIS SHY ROUTINE
ANYWAY?

233
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,375
I MEAN,
YOU WERE PRETTY AGGRESSIVE

234
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,916
IN THAT MOUNTAIN CABIN,
WEREN'T YOU?

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,125
- HUH?

236
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,708
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED AT THAT CABIN?

237
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,375
- COME ON, IT'S SIMPLE.

238
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,875
I JUST LOOKED
INTO RYO-OHKI'S MEMORY.

239
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,250
- WHAT?!

240
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,416
- YOU CAN'T TURN BACK NOW.
COME ON IN.

241
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,333
WATER'S FINE.
( laughs ) 

242
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,666
- HUH?

243
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,708
- ( humming )

244
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,916
HMMM!

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,583
- ( giggles )

246
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,291
HUH?

247
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,416
- ( both screaming )

248
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,041
- AH!  TENCHI,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

249
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,666
- <i>EXCUSEZ-MOI,</i>
<i>S'IL VOUS PLAIT.</i>

250
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,583
- OH!
- TENCHI.

251
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,708
COME UP!
- MMMM!

252
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,041
- ARE YOU OKAY?

253
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,250
- OH.  YEAH, I'M FINE.
THANK YOU, SASAMI.

254
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,750
HUH?

255
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,291
- 'CAUSE YOU LOOK
REALLY PALE.

256
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,083
AND YOUR NOSE IS BLEEDING.

257
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,625
YOU'RE A NAUGHTY BOY,
AREN'T YOU, TENCHI?!

258
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,500
( laughs ) 
- UH, IT'S NOT THAT, IT--

259
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,875
I GOT DIZZY
'CAUSE OF THE HOT WATER.

260
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,875
- REALLY?
- ( meows ) 

261
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,291
- UH...

262
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,041
SORRY FOR BEING NAUGHTY.
- THAT'S MY BOY.

263
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,291
- Ayeka: HOW DARE YOU,
YOU INSENSITIVE WOMAN?

264
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,000
- HMM?

265
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,166
- THEY'RE LOOKING AT US.

266
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,875
- WHAT?

267
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,750
- COME ON NOW.

268
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,958
IT'S NO BIG DEAL
TO SHOW YOUR NAKED BODY.

269
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,000
- YOU SEE THERE?
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

270
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,208
YOU'RE INSENSITIVE.

271
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,041
- TENCHI'S THE ONLY
ONE WHO SAW YOU.

272
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,333
AND YOU WERE GOING
TO SHOW HIM YOUR NAKED BODY

273
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,500
SOONER OR LATER ANYWAY, RIGHT?
- HUH?

274
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,583
- WHA-- WHAT?

275
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,083
WELL, I'M NOT AN EXHIBITIONIST
LIKE YOU ARE.

276
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,958
- IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO TAKE A BATH NAKED.

277
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,625
OF COURSE,
WITH SO LITTLE TO OFFER,

278
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,791
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D WANT
TO COVER IT UP.

279
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,416
BUT SHOW IT OFF,
LITTLE PRINCESS.

280
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,708
I DARE YOU!

281
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,708
- EXCUSE ME, LADIES.
- Both: ARGH!

282
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,500
- NEVER MIND.

283
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,208
- I'VE HAD ABOUT ENOUGH OF THIS.

284
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,166
I THINK
THAT YOU THINK I'M HARMLESS,

285
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,375
AND IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK,
YOU'RE WRONG.

286
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,875
- AM I?  WELL, I THINK
THAT YOU'RE A NAIVE LITTLE GIRL.

287
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,541
HMM?

288
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,541
- THEY FORM
THE MAGICAL FORCE FIELD

289
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,750
THAT HELD YOUR SPACESHIP
CAPTIVE BEFORE.

290
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,708
YOU WON'T GET ANY HELP
FROM TENCHI THIS TIME.

291
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,125
- YOU'RE JUST
A SPOILED PRINCESS.

292
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,083
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?

293
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,916
- GO AHEAD AND BOAST.
IT'S WHAT YOU DO BEST.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,916
ANYWAY, IT WON'T HELP YOU NOW.

295
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,916
- WHERE IS SHE? AHH!

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,833
- WHOA.
- ( laughs )

297
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,166
- DEMON!

298
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,041
- NOW IT'S MY TURN TO SHOW
YOU SOMETHING, LITTLE GIRL.

299
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,833
IT'S THE REASON WHY I'M
CALLED RYOKO, THE DEVIL-CALLER.

300
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,208
- OH!
- WHAT?

301
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,625
- I'M CALLED THAT BECAUSE
I CAN CALL FORTH EVIL SPIRITS

302
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,583
FROM ANYTHING I WANT.

303
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,958
- WELL, WHAT AN AMUSING SHOW.

304
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,375
- ISN'T IT?

305
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,875
I THINK
YOU'LL REALLY LIKE THIS PART.

306
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,791
- ( growling )

307
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,791
- AHHH!

308
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,666
- NOW GO OVER THERE

309
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,375
AND ENTERTAIN
THAT OBNOXIOUS PRINCESS.

310
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,791
WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

311
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,875
GET OVER THERE NOW!

312
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,625
- ( growling )

313
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,333
- UH-OH.

314
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,833
YOU DARE TO DISOBEY ME?
I SUMMONED YOU.

315
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,166
UNGRATEFUL BEAST!

316
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,208
GET BACK IN THE EARTH.

317
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
HMM?

318
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,000
UH... MMMM!

319
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,541
OH, I HAVE TO HAVE A GEM
ON MY RIGHT WRIST

320
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,666
IN ORDER FOR ME
TO CONTROL THIS MONSTER.

321
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,500
- ( growls )

322
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,375
- WHOA!
- ( laughs ) 

323
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,208
I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED.
THIS SHOW IS VERY ENTERTAINING.

324
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,750
HUH? AHHH!

325
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,916
- TENCHI! TENCHI?

326
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,458
- ( laughs ) 

327
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,916
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

328
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,208
STOP WASTING TIME
AND GO GET THE SWORD.

329
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,333
- ( scanning )

330
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,875
- MIHOSHI?  MIHOSHI?
MIHOSHI?

331
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,750
- HUH?
OH, YES?

332
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,375
- A PECULIAR ENERGY POCKET
IS BEING GENERATED

333
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,250
AT ONE POINT
ON THE THIRD PLANET.

334
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,083
THIS SHIP IS CURRENTLY--
MIHOSHI?

335
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,250
- OH, GREAT.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

336
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,875
THIS THING'S NOT RESPONDING
AT ALL. SEEMS LIKE IT'S BROKEN.

337
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,708
- MIHOSHI!
- OKAY.

338
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,083
WELL, THEN JUST HEAD
IN THAT DIRECTION

339
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,833
AND MAYBE WE COULD
FIND SOME CLUES, OKAY?

340
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,666
BUT WAIT A MINUTE.
WE'RE AT A PRETTY HIGH SPEED.

341
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,833
IS THAT OKAY
IN THIS PLANETARY SYSTEM?

342
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,333
- MIHOSHI, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU.

343
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,583
THE SHIP IS FALLING TOWARDS
THE ENERGY POCKET.

344
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,375
WE ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

345
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,916
- OH.
THAT'S NOT SO GOOD, HUH?

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,458
- ( panting )
- HEY! DO SOMETHING.

347
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,583
YOU CREATED THAT THING.

348
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,583
- HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU

349
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,041
THAT I CAN'T CONTROL THAT THING
WITHOUT A GEM ON MY RIGHT WRIST?

350
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,083
- WHY DID YOU CREATE IT
IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT?

351
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,416
- SO I FORGOT ABOUT THE GEM.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

352
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,000
YOU GO THAT WAY!
- ALL RIGHT.

353
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,708
HEY! YOU JUST SENT ME
DOWN A DEAD END, YOU KNOW!

354
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,166
- DID I?
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

355
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,958
- WHAT'S ALL THIS COMMOTION?
- Ryoko: GET OUT OF THE WAY!

356
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,458
- MA'AM, YOU SHOULDN'T
STAY THERE. IT'S DANGEROUS.

357
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,416
- THOSE GIRLS-- THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY MANNERS AT ALL.

358
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,625
I WONDER
IF THEY'RE TENCHI'S TYPE.

359
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,125
- ( growling )
- UH...

360
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,875
HUH?  OH!

361
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,583
- ( growling )
- OH!

362
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,708
- TENCHI!
- WHERE'S THE MONSTER?

363
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,041
- WHERE'S MY SISTER AND RYOKO?
- AH...

364
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,375
- Sasami: TENCHI!

365
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,000
- ( panting )

366
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,625
GOOD TO SEE YOU, TENCHI.
YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

367
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,625
- AHH!  WHOA!

368
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,125
- ( roaring )

369
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,541
- AHHHH!

370
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,916
- I SUPPOSE
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW!

371
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,791
HUH?  WHAT THE--
WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?

372
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,541
JUST WHEN I NEED IT THE MOST!

373
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,166
- ( roars )

374
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,041
- YEEAAAA!

375
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,291
OW!

376
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,625
OH!
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW?

377
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,208
- TENCHI, REMEMBER--
REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING!

378
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,000
- ( both screaming )

379
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,750
- I REMEMBER.

380
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,416
NOW I GOT IT.

381
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,958
YEEEAAAA!

382
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,125
HUH?

383
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,125
- ( growling )

384
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,416
- HUH?

385
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,833
- HUH?
- A SPACESHIP.

386
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,333
- TENCHI, LOOK OUT.

387
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,583
- AHHHH!
- TENCHI!

388
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,791
- HELP!
- TENCHI!

389
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:34,750
- TENCHI!
- ( grunting ) HUH?

390
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,583
WHAT THE--

391
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,083
- Both: WHOA!

392
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,458
OH.

393
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:52,375
- ( all screaming )

394
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,750
- TENCHI, WATCH OUT!

395
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,708
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

396
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,291
( crying )
OH NO, TENCHI!

397
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,041
- SASAMI, IS HE ALIVE?

398
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,208
- ( Sasami crying )

399
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,291
TENCHI!

400
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,583
- ( sighing )

401
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:26,000
- Ayeka: LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS.

402
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,458
- WHERE AM I?

403
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,500
- SO WHO ARE YOU?
AND WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

404
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:37,458
- WELL, UH, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHERE I COME FROM, HUH?

405
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,041
OH MY GOD!

406
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,458
I'VE COME IN CONTACT
WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE!

407
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,541
- EXCUSE ME, YOUNG LADY,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

408
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,291
WE HAVEN'T CAUGHT YOUR NAME YET.

409
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,500
- OH RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
PARDON ME.

410
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,291
MY NAME IS MIHOSHI,
AND I, UH--

411
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,166
WHAT?
WHERE DID IT GO?

412
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,583
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

413
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,833
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHERE IT WENT TO?

414
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,666
- WHAT, "IT"?
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THIS?

415
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,250
- OH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

416
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,625
YES! YES, THAT'S IT.

417
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,458
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR FINDING IT, WHOEVER YOU ARE.

418
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,750
I'M REALLY GRATEFUL!  REALLY.

419
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,166
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PLEASE GIVE IT BACK TO ME

420
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,541
'CAUSE IT'S MINE.
- HMM.

421
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,458
TELL ME, WHAT DO THE
GALAXY POLICE WANT

422
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,791
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

423
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,583
- THE GALAXY POLICE?
REALLY?

424
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,166
- OH, YOU KNOW ABOUT US?

425
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,416
WELL, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF A PURSUIT

426
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,791
OF A VICIOUS CRIMINAL,
BUT BEFORE I KNEW IT,

427
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:35,541
I WAS DRAGGED DOWN HERE
BY THE ENERGY OF THAT MONSTER.

428
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:39,250
OH, UH--
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

429
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,333
- ( alarm sounding )
- WHAT?

430
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,666
- Ryoko: WHAT IS IT?

431
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,333
- I-- I THOUGHT IT WAS BROKEN,
BUT--

432
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,583
- IT'S NOT.
YOU SEE, I FIXED IT.

433
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:51,083
- OH, THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.

434
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,750
BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW
HOW TO FIX THIS BRACELET?

435
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:57,500
THE PEOPLE WHO USUALLY
KNOW ABOUT THESE ARE--

436
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,750
- MM-HMM.
THEY ARE?

437
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,708
- ( panting )

438
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,000
IF YOU COULD
FIX THIS BRACELET...

439
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,000
- MM-HMM.

440
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,041
- OH.

441
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,958
- YOU MUST BE--
NO, YOU COULDN'T BE.

442
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,166
- HMM?

443
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,125
- ARE YOU A--

444
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,666
- A WHAT?

445
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,416
- ARE YOU A JEWELER?

446
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,041
- WHAT?!

447
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,625
NO, I'M NOT!

448
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,708
- OH, YOU'RE NOT?
SO I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE.

449
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,166
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

450
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,458
PLEASE STOP THAT.
- ( meows )

451
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,125
- ( laughs ) 
YOU KNOW WHAT RYOKO IS?

452
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,250
SHE'S A SPACE PIRATE.

453
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,083
- ( meows )
- ( laughs )

454
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,791
- A SPACE PIRATE?

455
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,208
RYOKO?

456
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,625
- ( alarm sounding )
- HUH?

457
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,125
OH.

458
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,583
THIS SIGNAL INDICATES...

459
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,000
THE SPACE PIRATE RYO-OHKI.

460
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,541
AND IT'S VERY CLOSE TO US.

461
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,750
ATTENTION, EVERYBODY,

462
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,583
A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL IS
HIDING NEARBY, SO WATCH OUT.

463
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:07,291
- AH.  AND WHO IS
THE RYO-OHKI ANYWAY?

464
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,500
- WHAT?  UH...

465
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:13,125
ACCORDING TO THIS DATA,
RYO-OHKI IS A RUTHLESS PIRATE

466
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,416
THAT DESTROYED 28 PLANETS
AND 69 COLONIES.

467
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,958
- ( chuckling )
