00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,583
TENCHI.

4
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,916
TENCHI!

5
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,125
NOW WHERE DID HE GO?

6
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,583
HMM.

7
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,625
- ( bones crack )
- ( groans )

8
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,166
WHERE DID HE PUT THEM?

9
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,250
HMM?  LET'S SEE.

10
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,083
WHOA!

11
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,541
HUH?

12
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,333
- IT WAS CURIOSITY
THAT KILLED THE CAT, TENCHI.

13
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,000
- ( screams )

14
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,166
- I BET YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR THESE.

15
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,083
- SO THAT'S WHERE
THEY ARE-- OOPS. 

16
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,583
- YOU WEREN'T TRYING
TO SNEAK IN THERE

17
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,291
AGAINST MY ORDERS,
WERE YOU?

18
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,541
( chuckles )
- NO, I WASN'T.

19
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,875
- IT IS THE ANCIENT LAW
OF THIS MISAKI SHRINE. 

20
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,500
AND YOU ARE NO EXCEPTION
TO THAT LEGACY.

21
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,500
( chuckles )
BUT REALLY, 

22
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,375
YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT'S IN THERE, DON'T YOU?

23
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,291
- MM-HMM.
- HERE THEY ARE, TENCHI,

24
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,750
IF YOU CAN
TAKE THEM FROM ME.

25
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,708
LET'S SEE HOW GOOD
YOU REALLY ARE.

26
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,125
- HMM.

27
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,958
HUMPH.

28
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,791
HYAH!

29
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,208

- HMM.

32
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,666
WORK HARDER.

33
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,750
AND REMEMBER, YOUR CHORES 
ARE PART OF YOUR TRAINING.

34
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,750
- HMM?

35
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,625
CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT.

36
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,000
LUCKY FOR ME, I'M NOT A CAT.

37
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,083
( laughs )

38
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,208
AAH.

39
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,041
OH.

40
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,666
- Katsuhito: 
TENCHI!  BOY!

41
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,125
- ( gasps )
- WHY MUST YOU COME HERE

42
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,541
TIME AFTER TIME

43
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,583
WHEN YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT ALLOWED?

44
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,125
- BUT WHY IS THAT, GRANDPA?

45
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,791
- I'LL TELL YOU WHY, MY BOY.

46
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,500
A DEMON SLEEPS HERE.

47
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,125
- A DEMON?  NO.

48
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,416
- IT'S TRUE.
NOW, LISTEN CAREFULLY

49
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,458
FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT
TO TELL YOU REALLY HAPPENED.

50
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,125
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

51
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,791
A DEMON CAME HERE
FROM THE SKY.

52
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,750
ITS STRENGTH WAS
ENORMOUS AND TERRIBLE.

53
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,708
IT DESTROYED VILLAGES,
BURNED EVERYTHING,

54
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,916
AND OUR PEOPLE
SUFFERED GREATLY

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,958
BECAUSE OF
ITS EVIL POWERS.

56
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,875
- Young Tenchi:
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DEMON?

57
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,625
- Katsuhito: ONE DAY,
A SHIP LIKE A DRAGON 

58
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,500
APPEARED FROM THE SKY.

59
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,250
ON ITS BACK,
RODE A MIGHTY SAMURAI.

60
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,458
HE FOUGHT THE DEMON

61
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,833
USING A SWORD WITH
GREAT SPIRITUAL POWERS.

62
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,041
NOW THE DEMON SLEEPS,

63
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,250
HELD PRISONER
IN THIS SHRINE.

64
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,625
THE SWORD
PLANTED IN THE GROUND

65
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,166
KEEPS WATCH OVER IT.

66
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,458
THAT SAMURAI WAS YOSHO,

67
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,916
YOUR ANCESTOR, TENCHI.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,250
REMEMBER YOUR NAME 
AND WHAT IT MEANS--

69
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,166
"HEAVEN AND EARTH."
YOU MUST REMEMBER

70
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,375
AND RESPECT YOUR ANCESTOR.

71
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,083
REMEMBER.

72
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,166
- HUH?

73
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,875
OH!

74
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,500
( strains )

75
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,458
( grunting )

76
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,333
HMM.

77
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,750
( straining )

78
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,083
HUH?

79
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:20,041
WHA-- IT'S JUST A RUSTY
OLD PIECE OF JUNK.

80
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,958
GIVE ME A BREAK.

81
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,333
"THE SWORD THAT CUTS
THROUGH A ROCK"?

82
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,333
HA!

83
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,041
UH-OH!

84
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,833
WHAT?

85
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,083
- ( rumbling )

86
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,166
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

87
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,875
OH.

88
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,750
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

89
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,916
OH, THINK, GENIUS.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,666
HMM?

91
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,041
OH, A PASSAGEWAY.

92
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,875
AH, THAT'S COLD!

93
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,666
OWW, MY HEAD!

94
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,375

95
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,791
WHOA!  OH, BOY,

96
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,541
( gulps )

97
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,000
HUH?
( groans )

98
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,916
( screams )

99
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,416
( crashes )

100
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,416
OUCH!
( groans )

101
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,916
HUH?

102
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,375
OH.

( gulps )

105
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,541
OH, IT'S JUST A GIANT
GLOWING LIGHT.

106
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,375
NO PROBLEM.

107
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,750
AHH.

108
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,583
W-- WHAT'S THAT?
( gulps )

109
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,375
A DEMON SLEEPS HERE.

110
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,458
IT WASN'T
JUST A LEGEND.

111
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,583
- ( sword clangs loudly )
- AAH!

112
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,583
WHEW.

113
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,666
TIME TO GO HOME.

114
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,291
AH.

115
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,041
I'M ON MY WAY.

116
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,583
OKAY, I'M OUT OF HERE.
( screams )

117
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,375
HUH?!

118

119
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,375
( grunts, strains )

120
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,041
LET ME GO!

121
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,875
- ( raspy breathing )

122
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,291
- ( both scream )

123
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,375

( yelps, growls )

126
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,625
HUH?

127
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,250
- ( demon groaning )

128
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,750
- I'M GIVING THOSE KEYS
BACK TO GRANDPA

129
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,791
AND DO AS MANY CHORES

130
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,833
( panting )

131
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,125
- ( bell tolls )

132
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,208
- HEY, TENCHI.
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

133
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,833
- OH, UH, NOTHING.

134
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,041
JUST AN OLD
PIECE OF JUNK.

135
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:35,208
- OH.  SO, UH, HOW WAS
 YOUR SUMMER VACATION?

136
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,041
- OH, DON'T ASK ME.

137
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,291
JUST ME AND GRANDPA
AT WORK ALL DAY LONG AS USUAL.

138
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,833
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ALL
PART OF THE TRAINING, I GUESS.

139
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,750
- OH, MAN,
WHAT A BIG DRAG.

140
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,708
DIDN'T YOU GET TO MEET
ANY GIRLS EVEN?

141
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,125
- IF YOU WERE A GIRL,
WOULD YOU COME

142
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,666
TO A SHABBY SHRINE
DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS?

143
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,666
- HMM, HELL NO.

144
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,625
- RIGHT.
PLENTY OF GIRLS 82 YEARS OLD.

145
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,041
- OH, SO YOU DATED
MUMMIES ALL SUMMER LONG?

146
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,000

00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,583
FURLING OLD MUMMIES.
( laughs )

00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,583
( continues laughing )

149
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,416
A MUMMY?

150
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,750
- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG, TENCHI?

151
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,333
- HUH?  OH.

152
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,250
- TENCHI, DON'T TELL ME

153
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,791
YOU WERE SO HARD UP

154
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,000
YOU SLEPT WITH A MUMMY?

155
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,666

156
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,708

- GET A LIFE, CLOWN!

157
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,666
- OH.

158
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,541
- I'VE GOT
TO GET A GRIP.

159
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,000
GRANDPA NEVER
MENTIONED ANYTHING.

160
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,750
MAYBE NOTHING
HAPPENED AFTER ALL.

161
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,958
( sighs )

162
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,958
JUST RELAX, TENCHI.

163
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,958

164
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,166
- OH.  HUH?

165
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,791
WHAT?

166
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,875
OH, GREAT,
I FELL ASLEEP.

167
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,666
I MISSED ALL MY CLASSES
AND EVERYONE'S GONE.

168
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,708

179
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,291
THAT'S MY NAME.

180
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,375
- NO.  NO WAY!

181
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,750
- ( growls )

182
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,333
- YOU CAN'T BE--

183
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,666
YOU CAN'T BE THAT...

184
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,125
THAT-- THAT--

185
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,458
THAT-- THAT
FREEZE-DRIED DEMON!

186
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,500
AAH!

187
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,166
- IT WAS COLD IN THERE

188
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,250
AND DARK.

189
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,625
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I WAS TRAPPED IN THAT CAVE?

190
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,250
700 YEARS.

191
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,625
AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

192
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,916
I DIDN'T LIKE IT
AT ALL.

193
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,833
ALL I WANT NOW
IS REVENGE!

194
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:47,166
- HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
- NO?

195
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,958
- NO, NO WAY.
IT WAS MY ANCESTOR,

196
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,166
SOME GUY NAMED YOSHO!

197
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,750
- I DON'T CARE.

198
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,791
I JUST NEED TO LET OUT
MY ANGER ON YOU

199
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,291
RIGHT NOW!

200
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,833
- WHY ME?
IT'S NOT FAIR!

201
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,125
- ( cackling )

202
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,875
WHAT'S THE MATTER, TENCHI?

203
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:20,916

- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO RUN

206
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,916
A LOT FASTER THAN THAT,
EARTHLING.

207
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,208
- AAH!

208

- ( screams )

219
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,541
- HEY, TRY NOT
TO HURT YOURSELF.

220
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,458
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT
FOR YOU.

221
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,083

222
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,916

( exhales loudly )

228
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,958
THAT WAS CLOSE.

229
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,500
I'LL JUST HIDE HERE
WHILE I FIGURE OUT A PLAN.

230
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:12,666
WHAT IS THAT--
THAT SMELL?

231
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,875
OH, GAS FUMES.

232

242
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,083
( grunts )

243
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,291
- IT'S TIME FOR
TODAY'S LESSON,

244
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,875
SCHOOLBOY.

245
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,583
- ( screams )
THERE'S LEAKING GAS!

246
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,833
YOU'LL START A FIRE!

247
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,250
- GAS?  WHAT IS GAS?

248
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,708
- ( groans )

249
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,541
I CAN JUST SEE
THE HEADLINES.

250
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,458
"BRILLIANT STUDENT
BLOWN TO BITS."

251
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,583
OH, MAN, IF I'D KNOWN 
I WAS GONNA DIE TODAY,

252
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,416
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
ALL THAT HOMEWORK

253
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,416
OVER VACATION!

254
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:25,875
I-- I THINK I MIGHT
JUST HAVE AN IDEA. 

255
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,208
- HMM?

256
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,125
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT

257
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,583
I JUST USED THE OLDEST
TRICK IN THE BOOK.

258
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,166
- OOH, WHAT IS IT?

- HMM?

261
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,041
HMM?  HEY, I DON'T
WANT TO MISS ANYTHING.

262
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,125
- YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE BOUGHT IT!

263
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,458
I'M OUT OF HERE.

264
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,416
- NO, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

265
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,583
I THINK-- ( gasps )

266
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,541

267
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,500

271
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,291
- ( screams )

272
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,958
THERE SHE GOES.

273
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,875
YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS KINDA CUTE.

274
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,416
HUH?
OH, OLD SHRINE HABIT.

275
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500

276
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,458
HUH?!  AAH!

277
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,833

WAY TO TREAT A LADY!

278
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,791
- OH, BIG TROUBLE.

279
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,708
- ( shouts )

280
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,166
( gasps )

281
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,250
LOOK AT ME.

282
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,125
MY HAIR IS A MESS.

283
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,041
- THANK GOD. 
- OH!  OH OH.

284
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,166
- ( sighs, pants )

285
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,916
OKAY, OKAY.

286
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,666
SO SHE'S GOT INCREDIBLE
SUPER POWERS AND I DON'T.

287
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,541
SO FAR SO GOOD.

288
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:22,166
SO-- SO NOW WHAT
DO I DO?

289
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,791
- ( giggles )

290
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,875
YOU ARE ONE
BEAUTIFUL DEMON.

291
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,375
LET'S GO.

292
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,416
- ( fire alarm rings )
- ( screams )

293
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,000
TAKE IT EASY.

294
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,958
IT'S ONLY
THE STUPID FIRE ALARM.

295
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,583
- ( ringing continues )

296
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,833
- OF COURSE HALF THE BUILDING'S
GOT TO BE ON FIRE

297
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,916
BEFORE IT RINGS.

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,416
WELL, I GUESS IT'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE KIND OF DAYS.

299
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,666
HUH?

300
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,875
WAIT A MINUTE.

301
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,791
THAT JEWEL ON HER WRIST.

302
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,000
THAT'S GOT TO BE
THE SOURCE OF HER POWERS.

303
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,833
YEAH, THE LEGEND SAYS SO.

304
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,833
THREE GEMS FOR POWER.
WITHOUT HER POWER,

305
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:21,291
MAYBE I CAN GET HER
BACK IN THAT CAVE.

306
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,916
I'VE GOT TO TRY.
COME ON.

307
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,833
YOU CAN DO IT, TENCHI.

308
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,166
( laughs )

309
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,041
I CAN BEAT HER.
IT'S EASY!

310
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,166
- EASY?

311
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,583
- ( grunts )
WHAT THE-- UH.

312
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,708
- DON'T BE SO SCARED,
SWEETIE PIE.

313
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,458
- HUH?
- I WON'T HURT YOU...

314
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,250
TOO MUCH!

315
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,500
- ( screams )

316
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,791
- ( grunts )

317
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,291
- HUH?

318
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,500
WHOA.
- ( gasps )

319
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,625
IMPRESSIVE.

320
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,875
CATCH.

321
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,375
I GOT YOU!

322
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,166
HEY, NO FAIR.
CHEATING!

323
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,041
- WHAT?  GIVE ME A BREAK.

324
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,000
THIS SWORD HAS
A MIND OF ITS OWN.

325
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,125
IF I'D HAD MY WAY, I WOULDN'T
FIGHT A MONSTER LIKE YOU.

326
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,041
- MONSTER?!

327
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,958
TELL ME JUST EXACTLY
WHAT MAKES YOU CALL 

328
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,333
A PRETTY YOUNG LADY
LIKE ME A MONSTER?!

329
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,000
- OH, COME ON.
YOU WALK THROUGH FIRE.

330
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,083
YOU WALK THROUGH WALLS.
YOU RIP HOLES IN THE ROOF.

331
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,750
AND YOU CAN EVEN FLY!

332
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,625
- VERY GOOD REASONS,
BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

333
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,125

I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT DEMON GIRL?
