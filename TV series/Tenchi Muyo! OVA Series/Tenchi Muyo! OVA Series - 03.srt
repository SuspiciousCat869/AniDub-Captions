1
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:37,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,416
- OH.

3
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:30,208
HUH?
THAT'S A ROYAL TEARDROP.

4
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,625
- Man: AYEKA?

5
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,458
- HUH?

6
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,791
FOR YOU, YOSHO.

7
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,208
( giggles )

8
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,000
- AYEKA, WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE?

9
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,125
- BECAUSE YOU WENT OUT,
LEAVING ME BEHIND.

10
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,916
- ( laughs )
- AH!

11
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,041
ONE DAY,

12
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,166
I WILL BE YOUR BRIDE,
WON'T I, YOSHO?

13
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,875
- WHEN YOU GROW UP.

14
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,083
- IT IS THE COLOR OF YOUR EYES.

15
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,125
- A ROYAL TEARDROP?

16
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,041
- MM-HMM.

17
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,041
WHAT'S WRONG?

18
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,875
- THIS FLOWER
SHOULDN'T BE USED

19
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,000
FOR HAPPY OCCASIONS.

20
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,291
- ( glass shattering )

21
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,875
- ( Ryoko laughing )

22
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,041
- YOU DEVIL!

23
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,291
AYY!  AHHH!
- TAKE ME WITH YOU!

24
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,416
YOSHO, TAKE ME WITH YOU!

25
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,208
YOSHO!

26
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,333
( panting )

27
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,000
WHERE ARE YOU?!

28
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,333
YOSHO?

29
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,000
( gasps ) YOSHO!

30
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,916
YOSHO?

31
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,458
( gasps )

32
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,666
- YOSHO?  BUT HE'S DEAD.

33
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,666
- WHAT?

34
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,291
- HERE, TAKE THIS
TO REMEMBER HIM BY.

35
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,791
- AHHH!

36
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,166
( screaming continues )

37
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,041
OH.

38
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,625
( moans )

39
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,458
HE ISN'T DEAD.
HE CAN'T BE.

40
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,791
- ( birds singing )

41
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,125
- I WISH I COULD GO HOME
TO PLANET JURAI.

42
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,666
HMM?
WHAT IS SHE UP TO SO EARLY?

43
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,875
REALLY, WHAT A
DISGUSTING THING TO SEE

44
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,000
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

45
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,666
OH, THAT MONSTER WOMAN.
UGH!

46
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,708
- HMM, LET'S SEE.

47
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,458
AHA!

48
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,416
( laughs )
HMM.

49
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,833
- COME ON, AYEKA!

50
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,166
- I DON'T WANT TO.  NO.

51
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,208
I DON'T WANT TO!
- DON'T BE SO DIFFICULT.

52
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,041
LISTEN TO ME, AYEKA.

53
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,041
YOU'VE STAYED IN THIS
ROOM FOR ONE WHOLE WEEK.

54
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,375
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
IT'S VERY RUDE.

55
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,875
THEY'RE GOING TO
THINK WE JURAIANS

56
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,208
DON'T EVEN HAVE THE COURTESY

57
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,708
 TO SAY HELLO!
- NO, THEY WON'T, SASAMI!

58
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,583
UM, BUT THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY

59
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,666
IS OUT NOW, ISN'T HE?

60
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,291
- THE FATHER MAY BE OUT,
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS--

61
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,958
TENCHI IS AT HOME.

62
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,541
THIS IS VERY VERY HARD ON ME.

63
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
- I'M SORRY, SASAMI.

64
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,041
I SHOULD BE THE ONE
TO WORRY ABOUT THESE THINGS.

65
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,958
- ( sighs )

66
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,958
- LET'S GO.

67
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,916
- PHEW!

68
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,166
HUH?

69
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,416
HMM.

70
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,666
- HMMM!
- ( gasps )

71
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,083
I HATE THIS!

72
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,791
- HUH?

73
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,500
COME ON, AYEKA!

74
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,458
- OH.

75
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,708
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
IT'S BEEN SO LONG,

76
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,916
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK
YOU'D DIED, YOUR MAJESTY.

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,750
- WHERE'S TENCHI?

78
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,625
- TENCHI? WELL, HE ISN'T HERE,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

79
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,500
- AND I WORKED SO HARD
TO GET AYEKA OUT HERE.

80
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,916
HEY!
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,208
WHAT IS IT?

82
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,750
- MMM, WANT TO KNOW?
- MM-HMM.

83
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,458
- HMMM!

84
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,750
- WOW!
- IT WAS BORN THIS MORNING.

85
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,750
ISN'T IT ADORABLE?

86
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,291
- DID YOU LAY IT?

87
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,083
- NO, SASAMI!
GET AWAY, DON'T TOUCH IT.

88
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,416
- ( yawns )

89
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,875
WHAT?  MISS AYEKA.

90
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,458
- OH.

91
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,083
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO EXPRESS
MY SINCERE GRATITUDE

92
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,291
FOR THE HOSPITALITY
KINDLY OFFERED

93
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,291
TO JURAI AND MY OWN FAMILY.

94
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,791
AH, ANYWAY,

95
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,250
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

96
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,750
- WHAT?  YEAH, SURE.

97
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,583
- HEY HEY, PRINCESS, DON'T YOU
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS EGG?

98
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,708
- I HAVE NO INTENTIONS
OF SPEAKING WITH YOU.

99
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:39,166
HA!
SASAMI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

100
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,125
YOU'LL GET GERMS FROM THAT.

101
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,541
- BUT RYOKO'S BABY
IS GOING TO BE BORN,

102
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,000
AND THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
I WANT TO SEE.

103
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,166
SO ARE YOU MARRIED, RYOKO?

104
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,958
WHO'S THE FATHER?

105
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,125
- WELL NOW...
- SASAMI!

106
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,375
- YOU SEE?
- ( gasps ) TENCHI'S THE FATHER!

107
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,166
- WHAT?
- HUH?

108
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,958
WHAT?  MISS AYEKA,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

109
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,250
YOU SEEM UPSET.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

110
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,333
- THAT IS CERTAINLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

111
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,250
WHY DON'T YOU JUST 
GO OVER THERE

112
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,250
AND HOLD THAT EGG
WITH YOUR MONSTER WOMAN?

113
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,291
- EGG?  WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

114
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,666
- OH, I'M SO HAPPY!
SO HAPPY TO BE ABLE

115
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,791
TO BEAR A CHILD
OF THE MAN I LOVE.

116
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,208
- A CHILD?!
- GO AHEAD, FEEL IT NOW.

117
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,541
IT WON'T BE LONG.

118
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,833
- ( groans )
- HUH?  WHAT?!

119
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- ( egg squealing )

120
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,083
- HUH?

121
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:32,500
( screaming )

122
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,666
- ( gasps )

123
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,250
( laughs )

124
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,666
- ( meows )

125
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,083
( cooing )
- ( Ryoko laughs ) OH.

126
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,333
COME HERE.
THERE'S A GOOD LITTLE RYO-OHKI.

127
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,083
- RYO-OHKI?
YOUR SPACE SHIP?

128
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,541
THEN THAT'S THE CHILD OF--

129
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,000
- ( laughs ) 

130
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,000
- IT CAN'T BE TRUE.

131
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,916
- OH, YEAH, PRINCESS.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT'S TRUE.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,958
- CAN A SPACE SHIP
HAVE A BABY?

133
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,458
- SURE.
MY SHIP WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED,

134
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,250
SO IT REPRODUCED ITSELF.

135
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,916
YOU MUST BE CRAZY TO THINK
IT'S TENCHI'S CHILD.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,333
- YEAH, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS KIND OF STRANGE.

137
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,041
- THIS IS SO TYPICAL.
YOU'RE ALL MAKING FUN OF ME.

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,083
- UH, MISS AYEKA,
WE'RE NOT MAKING FUN OF YOU.

139
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,291
AT LEAST, I'M NOT.

140
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,875
- YOU STOP IT!  LET GO!

141
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,333
I WAS SO FOOLISH.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT.

142
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,041
WHY DON'T YOU GO HAVE
A GOOD TIME WITH THAT

143
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,833
FOSSIL WOMAN OF YOURS?

144
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,791
- ( Ryoko laughs ) 

145
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,083
- ( crying )

146
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,541
- WHOOPS.

147
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,166
- I BEG YOUR PARDON.

148
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,833
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, MISS?
WHAT IS IT?

149
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,375
- UM...

150
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,500
UM, NO NO...

151
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,958
NOTHING REALLY.

152
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,000
- ( meows )

153
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,375
- ( laughs )

154
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,458
- ( meows )

155
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,708
- ( laughs ) 

156
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,666
- ( yawns ) YOU KNOW,
I FIND THAT PRINCESS SO AMUSING.

157
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,500
SHE REALLY KILLS ME.

158
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,416
- WHAT KIND OF MISCHIEF
ARE YOU UP TO NOW?

159
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,083
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY CONSCIENCE AT ALL?

160
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,000
- YOU ARE JUST SO SWEET!
- WHAT?

161
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,625
OH!
- YOU'RE SO SWEET

162
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,416
TO BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT ME.
- ( groaning )

163
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,583
- TENCHI, DEAR,
WHERE'S THE SWORD?

164
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,083
- THE SWORD? 
I GAVE IT BACK TO AYEKA.

165
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,666
- YOU WHAT?!

166
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,250
BUT THAT SWORD CONTAINS
ALL OF MY ENERGY SOURCE.

167
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,791
OH, WHY DID YOU GIVE IT BACK,
TENCHI?!

168
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,583
AWWWW!

169
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,958
( gasps )

170
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,916
- SECOND TIME TODAY A YOUNG
LADY HAS RUN INTO ME.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,583
I GUESS I'M JUST LUCKY.

172
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,583
- GRANDPA, I'M SHOCKED.

173
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:07,250
- YEEEAH!

174
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,291
- THAT'S A SPRY YOUNG LADY
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

175
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,916
- HMM? MMM.  HMM?

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,750
- MMM, NOW THEN,

177
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,916
SO THIS IS TENCHI'S BABY,
IS IT?

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,250
- NO NO, GRANDPA.
THIS IS RYO-OHKI.

179
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,625
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

180
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,958
HE JUST HATCHED
FROM AN EGG, GRANDPA.

181
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,500
- I SEE, I SEE.

182
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,250
TENCHI, NOW THAT YOU
ARE A FATHER OF A CHILD--

183
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,125
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
GRANDPA?

184
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,250
- --YOU'LL HAVE TO
BECOME RESPONSIBLE.

185
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,333
YES, YOU'VE GOT A BUMPY ROAD
AHEAD OF YOU.

186
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,375
- IT'S NOT MY CHILD!

187
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,583
OH, FORGET IT!

188
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,208
- ( door slides closed )

189
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,958
- TENCHI, DON'T FORGET PRACTICE
THIS AFTERNOON.

190
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,083
- TENCHI, WAIT!
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

191
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,708
HE'S THE SERIOUS TYPE
JUST LIKE HIS MOTHER.

192
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,375
- ( meows ) 

193
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,833
- RYO-OHKI?

194
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,041
WHAT IS IT, RYO-OHKI?

195
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,625
( gasps )

196
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,125
AYEKA.

197
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,583
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

198
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,708
( bangs head )
OUCH!

199
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,666
RYO-OHKI?

200
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,291
- ( crashing )
- ( Sasami gasps )

201
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,750
- HUH?

202
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,083
- ( crying )

203
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,833
- ( meows ) 

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,708
- AHHH!  AHHH!
( screaming )

205
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,416
- ( meows ) 

206
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,208
- RYO-OHKI!

207
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,083
SHH SHH SHHH!
GO AWAY, YOU DIRTY LITTLE THING.

208
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,666
- ( meows ) 

209
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,666
- ( gasps )
VERY WELL.

210
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,375
I WANT YOU TO STAY RIGHT THERE
AND I'LL BE THE ONE TO GO AWAY.

211
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,041
HA!

212
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,083
NOW DON'T YOU DARE FOLLOW ME.

213
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,875
I SAID DON'T FOLLOW ME!
- ( meows ) 

214
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,666
- HUH?

215
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,875
THE ROYAL TEARDROP?

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,041
IT CAN'T BE.

217
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:43,000
IT'S THE SAME COLOR
AS YOUR EYES.

218
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,416
ONE DAY I WILL BE YOUR BRIDE,
WON'T I, YOSHO?

219
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,041
( crying )

220
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,750
- ( meows ) 

221
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,125
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

222
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,916
PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE.

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,291
- ( whimpers )

224
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,250
OH!
- ( crying )

225
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,291
HUH?

226
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,000
FOR ME?
- ( meows ) 

227
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,625
- THANK YOU.

228
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,333
BUT DIDN'T YOU KNOW
THAT I HATE YOU,

229
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,375
YOU FUNNY LITTLE THING?
- ( meows ) 

230
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,250
- ( laughs ) 

231
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,875
- HMM.

232
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,166
LET'S SEE, HMM.

233
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,291
NOW IF I WERE THAT SWORD,
WHERE WOULD I BE HIDING?

234
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,750
YOSHO!
HMM!  GOOD RIDDANCE.

235
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,833
ALTHOUGH I KIND OF LIKE HIM
IN THAT SIZE.

236
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,291
- Sasami:
AYEKA, WHERE ARE YOU?

237
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,125
- THIS ISN'T
GOING TO LOOK GOOD.

238
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,250
- SHE ISN'T IN HERE.

239
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,166
WHERE DID EVERYONE GO TO?

240
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:07,291
- SO TELL ME,
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

241
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,250
WITH MY SPACE SHIP DESTROYED,

242
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,083
I CAN NEITHER FLY
NOR COMMUNICATE WITH MY PEOPLE.

243
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,208
- ( meows ) 

244
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,166
- THE ONLY CLUE I HAVE
IS THE SWORD.

245
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,083
I WONDER...

246
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,458
COULD MY BROTHER REALLY BE...

247
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,875
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
A WORD I SAY.

248
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,458
- ( meows ) 

249
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,791
- OH! WHAT IS IT?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

250
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,791
YOU'LL GET LOST!

251
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,125
RYO-OHKI!

252
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:42,208
I CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.

253
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,250
- ( sticks clashing )
- Man: HYAH!

254
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,000
- HUH?
- ( grunting )

255
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,250
- TENCHI, WATCH YOUR FEET.

256
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,375
- YEEAAA!

257
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,833
( groans )

258
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,333
- TRY HARDER.
- ( groaning )

259
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,583
- ( laughs ) 

260
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,333
- OUCH.

261
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,666
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S START OVER
WITH THE BASIC PATTERNS.

262
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,833
- OKAY.

263
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,833
- HUH?

264
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,458
- READY?
- <i>HAI!</i>

265
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,791
- ( both grunting )

266
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:18,500
- THAT'S--
- ( grunting )

267
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,458
- THAT'S JUST LIKE THE
SWORDPLAY ROUTINES

268
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,916
OF JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,458
YOSHO--

270
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,250
COULD HE BE A CLUE
TO HIS WHEREABOUTS?

271
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,708
TENCHI?

272
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,458
WHAAAA!
- HUH?

273
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,625
AHHH!
- WHAT'S WRONG, TENCHI?

274
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,041
YOU'RE A SITTING DUCK.

275
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,583
- JEEZ, WAS THAT PART
OF THE ROUTINE?

276
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,958
- NO.

277
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,208
- WHAT WAS THAT?
( gasps ) HUH?

278
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,583
- WHY?  WHY MUST I SUFFER
FROM THIS KIND OF DISGRACE?

279
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,416
OOH!

280
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

281
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,875
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

282
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,083
- I'M SORRY.
I'M ALL RIGHT.

283
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,708
- LADY AYEKA?

284
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,166
- I'M ALL RIGHT.  OH!
IT HURTS.

285
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,708
OH.
- RED BLOOD.

286
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,500
- ( birds chirping )
- HUH?

287
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,083
- UH, NOTHING.
NOTHING AT ALL.

288
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,541
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING THERE?

289
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,666
- UH, SIR?
- HMM.

290
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,583
THAT LOOKS
LIKE A BAD SPRAIN.

291
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:16,333
- SIR, THAT SWORDPLAY ROUTINE
YOU WERE PERFORMING,

292
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,666
I WAS WONDERING--

293
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,208
- TENCHI, CARRY THIS YOUNG
LADY HOME ON YOUR BACK.

294
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,958
SHE'D BETTER NOT BE
USING THIS FOOT FOR A WHILE.

295
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,125
- HEY!

296
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,458
- SIR? DID I SAY ANYTHING
TO OFFEND YOU?

297
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,750
- I'LL BE ON MY WAY HOME NOW.
YOU TAKE CARE OF HER.

298
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,750
- HEY!
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, GRANDPA!

299
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,625
HMMM.

300
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,000
- Sasami: RYOKO, IT'S RAINING!

301
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,875
RYOKO, PLEASE STOP THE RAIN.

302
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,708
- ( sighs )
- STOP THE RAIN!

303
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,291
MY SISTER AND THE OTHERS
ARE STILL OUTSIDE.

304
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,708
- WELL, SORRY. ON THIS PLANET,

305
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,250
THEY DON'T HAVE A
WAY OF DOING THAT YET.

306
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,000
HEY, SASAMI DARLING,
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW

307
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,625
WHERE YOUR ADORABLE SISTER
KEEPS TENCHI'S SWORD,

308
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,166
BY ANY CHANCE?

309
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,750
- YEAH, SHE CARRIES IT WITH HER
WHEREVER SHE GOES, I THINK.

310
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,125
- OF COURSE.

311
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,958
- ( grunts )

312
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,541
- OH.

313
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,333
- ( sighs )

314
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,666
HERE, YOU CAN DRY YOURSELF
WITH THIS.

315
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,416
UH, UMM...

316
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,083
- ( shivering )

317
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:48,375
- UH, I GUESS I'LL GO OUTSIDE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

318
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,625
OH, TENCHI.

319
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,375
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

320
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,333
A-CHEW!

321
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,541
- ( rustling )
- HUH?

322
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,541
OH.

323
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,958
- ( rustling )
- WHAT?

324
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,583
( screaming )

325
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,208
- HUH?  LADY AYEKA!
WHAT'S WRONG?

326
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,541
- SOMETHING--
SOMETHING LUNGED AT ME!

327
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,958
- ( meows ) 

328
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,166
- OH, DON'T WORRY.
IT'S ONLY RYO-OHKI.

329
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,541
- HUH?

330
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,875
- ( meows ) 

331
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,125
- OH.

332
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,791
HE SCARED THE DAYLIGHTS
OUT OF ME.

333
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,666
NAUGHTY THING.

334
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,291
- UH, OH.

335
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,250
- HMM?  OH.

336
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,750
- I'M GOING BACK OUTSIDE.

337
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:22,000
- OUTSIDE?
- YES?

338
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,541
- OUTSIDE IT MUST BE COLD.

339
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,458
- YEAH.

340
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:37,875
- WELL, I GUESS I MUST HAVE
MISUNDERSTOOD CERTAIN THINGS.

341
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,708
- HUH?

342
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,833
- SINCE YOU WERE WITH RYOKO,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HER FRIEND.

343
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,625
- WELL, I'M NOT.

344
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,208
BUT I THINK I STARTED ALL THIS
BY OPENING THE GATE.

345
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,083
- THE GATE?

346
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,416
- NEAR HERE, THERE'S A CAVE
AND RYOKO WAS LOCKED UP IN IT.

347
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,583
- MY BROTHER YOSHO DID THAT.

348
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,958
- YOSHO?

349
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,875
THAT'S WHAT THE LEGEND SAYS.

350
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,958
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

351
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,625
- UH, SURE.

352
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:10,041
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?
- I'LL SEARCH.

353
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,208
YOU SEE, I KNOW I CANNOT RETURN
TO MY PLANET NOW.

354
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,250
I MUST CONTINUE THE SEARCH
FOR MY BROTHER.

355
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,375
ONLY IT'S HARD FOR ME.

356
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,583
I HAVE NO RELATIVES
ON THIS ALIEN PLANET.

357
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,583
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

358
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,083
PLEASE STAY WITH US
AS LONG AS YOU'D LIKE.

359
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,958
I'M THE ONE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THIS.

360
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,791
AND BESIDES,

361
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:33,083
YOU'RE RELATED TOO, I GUESS.

362
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,208
- ( meows )
- YOSHO IS MY HALF BROTHER.

363
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,166
HERE ON EARTH, YOU MAY THINK
IT ODD TO MARRY YOUR BROTHER,

364
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,166
BUT ON JURAI, IT'S NOT.

365
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,458
EVEN THOUGH
MY PARENTS ARRANGED IT,

366
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,208
I WAS HAPPY ABOUT IT.

367
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,541
JUST-- JUST TO THINK
THAT I WON'T BE ABLE

368
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,833
TO SHARE THESE FEELINGS
WITH MY BROTHER,

369
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,041
I-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE!

370
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,208
( sobbing )

371
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,958
- HIS SHIP-- IT MUST HAVE BEEN
DESTROYED JUST LIKE YOURS WAS.

372
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,916
YEAH, THAT MUST BE IT!

373
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
AND HE WAS FORCED TO--
- ( sobbing )

374
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,666
- WELL, UH, SO YOU SHOULD
CHEER UP!

375
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,000
- HUH?
- CHEER UP, AYEKA!

376
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,416
- HMM?

377
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,583
- WHAT IS IT?

378
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,541
CARROT?
SO YOU WANT THIS CARROT?

379
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,916
- ( meows ) 
- THERE THERE.

380
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,791
HOP.

381
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:39,041
- ( meows )

382
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,208
- ( laughs ) 
- CARROTS, HUH?

383
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,416
EAT ENOUGH OF THOSE,

384
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,541
SOMEDAY YOU'LL GROW
UP TO BE A SPACE SHIP.

385
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,416
- ( meows ) 

386
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,291
- WHEW!
IT FINALLY CLEARED UP.

387
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,375
- HUH?

388
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,083
- WELL, SHALL WE GO NOW?

389
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,291
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO SEE RYOKO'S CAVE?

390
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,708
WE MIGHT JUST FIND A CLUE THERE
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

391
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,750
- WHAT-- WHAT IS THAT?

392
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:21,625
- OH, THAT'S THE HOLY TREE
OF MISAKI SHRINE.

393
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,458
WONDER STORIES HANG FROM IT.

394
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,833
THEY SAY IF YOU MAKE A WISH
WHEN THERE'S A FULL MOON,

395
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,750
IT'LL COME TRUE.

396
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:31,000
ANOTHER STORY SAYS YOU CAN
MAKE RAIN IF YOU PRAY FOR IT.

397
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,125
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO SEE IT?

398
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,500
- MMM.

399
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,958
THERE IS NO DOUBT.

400
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:48,000
THIS IS FUNAHO.
IT IS ALIVE.

401
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,833
- FUNAHO?
- MY BROTHER'S SPACE SHIP.

402
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,958
REMEMBER THERE WAS A TREE
EXACTLY LIKE THIS IN MY SHIP?

403
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,125
THIS TREE IS THE BRAIN OF THE
SHIP, THE HEART OF THE SHIP.

404
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,500
- WOW! THIS TRANSFORMS INTO
ONE OF THOSE GIANT SPACE SHIPS?

405
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,875
- NO.
THIS ONE HAS TAKEN ROOT.

406
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,041
IT CAN'T BECOME A SPACE SHIP
ANYMORE.

407
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,458
- ( hollow echoing )

408
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,666
- WHOA!  WHAT'S HAPPENING?

409
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,291
- THE SHIP'S MEMORY.

410
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,833
- MEMORY?

411
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,333
THAT'S--
- THAT'S MY BROTHER'S SHIP!

412
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,208
- Tenchi:
RYOKO-- SHE LOOKS SCARY.

413
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,791
AND HE MUST BE YOSHO.

414
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,125
THIS MUST BE
HOW THE LAKE WAS MADE.

415
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,875
- ( Ryoko moaning )

416
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,875
- HE IS ALIVE.
I'M SURE OF IT NOW.

417
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:13,833
SINCE FUNAHO IS ALIVE,

418
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:17,333
THEN SOMEWHERE ON THIS PLANET,
HE MUST BE ALIVE ALSO.

419
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,458
I'VE BEEN COLD TO YOU.

420
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:22,250
I'VE BEEN NASTY
AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

421
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,250
I BELIEVE THIS IS YOURS.
- WHAT?

422
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,458
- YOU ARE RELATED BY BLOOD
TO JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

423
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,500
AND I AM ASKING YOU
TO PROTECT US UNTIL THE TIME

424
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,208
MY BROTHER IS FOUND.

425
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:37,333
- BUT I'M NO GOOD
AT HANDLING THAT SWORD.

426
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,916
- AYEKA!

427
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,458
( panting )

428
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,833
- SASAMI!
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

429
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,041
YOU'VE BEEN GONE SO LONG,
I WAS WORRIED.

430
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,541
- I AM SORRY.

431
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,416
DID YOU COME ALL THIS WAY
BY YOURSELF?

432
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,125
- OH NO, RYOKO IS WITH ME.

433
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,250
AND RYO-OHKI MET US HALFWAY.
HE BROUGHT US HERE.

434
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,875
- ( meows ) 
- ( laughs ) 

435
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,208
YOU ARE
ONE FUNNY LITTLE CREATURE.

436
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:04,416
- Ryoko:
OKAY OKAY OKAY.

437
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,583
MY, WHAT A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE.

438
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,916
- Tenchi: RYOKO.
- HA!  NOW, TENCHI,

439
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,916
HOW COME YOU'VE BEEN WITH THIS
UNWORTHY GIRL ALL THIS TIME?

440
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,250
- BECAUSE I HAD TO.
LADY AYEKA INJURED HERSELF.

441
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,833
- MMM?  WOW, TENCHI,
YOU GOT THE SWORD BACK.

442
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,833
WELL DONE, MY BOY!

443
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:25,208
- NO, I RETURNED THE SWORD
TO LORD TENCHI.

444
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,000
- HUH?

445
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,791
OKAY!  SO YOU'RE PISSED
WE GOT IT BACK.

446
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,166
AND IT'S NO USE
TRYING TO LIE TO ME.

447
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,750
- BUT IT'S TRUE.
- HMM?

448
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,791
- WE ARE RELATED BY BLOOD,
LORD TENCHI AND I.

449
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:42,875
AND ANYWAY, IT'S REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

450
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:46,166
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?
YOU INGRATE!

451
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,625
OH!

452
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,791
AND I CAME ALL THIS WAY
JUST TO HELP YOU.

453
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:53,375
ALL RIGHT.
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

454
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,333
- RYOKO, COME BACK!

455
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:57,833
- Both: TO HELP US?

456
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,791
- HEY!

457
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,416
COME BACK!
IT'S ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING.

458
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,541
WE DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM,
RYOKO!

459
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,541
- FORGET IT.

460
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,375
- BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO

461
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,291
WHEN SHE GETS UPSET, YOU KNOW?
- OH, I SEE.

462
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,416
AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GOING TO PROTECT ME,

463
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,291
LORD TENCHI.

464
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,083
LET'S GO, LORD TENCHI.

465
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,416
- HUH?

466
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,625
- COME NOW.
- OH.

467
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,958
- HUH?
