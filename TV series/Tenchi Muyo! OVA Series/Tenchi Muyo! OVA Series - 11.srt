27
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,833
MARVELOUS IS THE POWER
OF HER MAJESTY.

00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,000
WHAT A FANTASTIC POWER.

29

WE'RE GOING OUT.

ADJUSTMENT OF THE FIELD
SPACE PARTICLES COMPLETED.

TO HAVE BEEN COMBAT AGAIN.

32
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,666
- ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS, DOCTOR?

33
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,500
OUR MISSION
HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED YET.

34
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,333
- NO NEED TO BOTHER.

35
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,625
I DON'T NEED
TO DO IT PERSONALLY.

36
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,791
LEAVE IT TO THE MACHINES.
THAT'LL BE FUN.

37
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,666
I HAVE JUST RETURNED.

I UNDERSTAND YOUR MISSION

HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED YET,
DR. CLAY.

40
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,833
- WELL, NO.
BUT I HAVE COME

41
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:21,666
TO MAKE AN EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT REPORT TODAY, D3, SIR.

42
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,666
- OH.  MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE REPORT

43
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,916
ON THE MISSION ASSIGNED TO YOU,
I SUPPOSE.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,375
- I HEAR THAT LADY TOKIMI
IS LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN PERSON.

45
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,125
- HMM?

46
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,041
- AND THAT THE ORDER WAS
GIVEN TO SOMEONE ELSE

47
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,166
TO SEARCH
FOR THAT CERTAIN PERSON.

48
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,583
- I WILL NOT INQUIRE

49
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,125
AS TO HOW
YOU CAME TO KNOW THAT.

50
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,416
- I DEMAND AN INTERVIEW
WITH LADY TOKIMI.

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,625
- LADY TOKIMI IS RIGHT HERE.

52
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,625
- HUH?

53
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,750
- HOWEVER,
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE

54
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,666
THAT THE CERTAIN PERSON
YOU KNOW

55
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,666
IS THE ONE OUR LADY
IS LOOKING FOR, IS THERE?

56
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,875
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I NEED
TO SEE LADY TOKIMI, TO CONFIRM!

57
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:08,916
- CONFIRMATION CAN BE GIVEN
BY ME.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,125
YES, MY LADY.

59
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,250
AS YOU WILL.

60
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:18,208
YOU MAY MAKE YOUR REPORT
TO LADY TOKIMI.

61
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,041
- YOU ARE TOO KIND.

62
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,916
BUT WILL YOU TELL ME
WHERE LADY TOKIMI IS?

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,875
- YOU DON'T SEEM
TO REALIZE YET.

64
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,750
VERY WELL.

65
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,875
YOU MAY SEE HER
WITH YOUR OWN EYES.

66
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,750
LADY TOKIMI WILL DESCEND
AND REVEAL HERSELF.

67
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,875
- WH-- WHAT?

68
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,958
- HIGH-LEVEL DIMENSION REACTION.

69
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,416
- OH!

70
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,291
- D3: NOW YOU MAY SPEAK.

71
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,458
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO SAY,
SAY IT.

72
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,833
- OH!

73
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,333
YOU-- YOUR MAJESTY.

74
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,000
LADY TOKIMI, YOU DO
ME TOO MUCH HONOR

75
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,791
BY SEEING ME IN
PERSON LIKE THIS.

76
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,083
I BRING YOU NEWS.
- ABOUT WASHU?

77
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,166
- HUH?
- VERY WELL.

78
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,750
I'LL LEAVE IT ALL TO YOU.

79
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,541
SUCCEED,
AND I MAY GRANT YOUR WISH.

80
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,708
BUT WE SHALL
HAVE THE RULING RIGHTS

81
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,291
OVER ONE ENTIRE GALAXY.

82
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,041
- OH-- WHAT?

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,625
- IT IS LADY TOKIMI'S WISH

84
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,208
TO MEET
WITH LADY WASHU IN PERSON.

85
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:34,291
BUT BE SURE
NOT TO HURT HER.

86
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,666
- YES, SIR.
THANK YOU, SIR.

87
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,333
( laughs ) 

88
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,291
SOON AN ENTIRE GALAXY
WILL BE MINE.

89
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,791
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

90
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,625
- I AM SCARED.
- YOU CAN'T BE.

91
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,625
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
HAVE SUCH EMOTIONS, SO DON'T.

92
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,583
MAYBE YOUR MEMORY
HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETELY ERASED

93
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,541
FROM THE LAST ASSIGNMENT.

94
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,375
- IT IS ERASED COMPLETELY, SIR.

95
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,458
HOWEVER, I CAN'T HELP MYSELF
FROM SHAKING ALL OVER

96
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,166
JUST LOOKING AT LADY TOKIMI.

97
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,291
- WELL, IT CERTAINLY
WASN'T YOUR FIRST TIME

98
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,833
WITNESSING A HIGH-LEVEL
DIMENSION OF LIFE FORM.

99
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,083
- WITH ANYONE ELSE,

100
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,958
I CAN MAKE LOGICAL
COMPUTATION OF EXISTENCE,

101
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,958
BUT LADY TOKIMI--
LADY TOKIMI IS--

102
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:28,000
IS--
- WHAT ABOUT LADY TOKIMI?

103
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,208
- HER VERY EXISTENCE
IS IMPOSSIBLE,

104
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,875
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS PRESENT
RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF US.

105
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,375
AND YET, NO SUCH INFORMATION
IS FOUND ANYWHERE

106
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,083
IN THE DATA BANK.

107
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,583
- NONSENSE!

108
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,750
THE ABSOLUTELY RING
OF THEORETICAL SYSTEM

109
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,791
IS ESTABLISHED HERE
IN THE DATA BANK.

110
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,750
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
IS KNOWN HERE,

111
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,583
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT ABLE
TO COMPREHEND IT ALL.

112
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,666
FOR THE MOMENT,

113
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,166
YOU'D BETTER NOT INVESTIGATE
THE MATTER ANY FURTHER.

114
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,708
- I UNDERSTAND.

115
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,916
- YOU MUST CONCENTRATE
ON THE TASK AT HAND.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,458
I HAVE A LOT FOR YOU TO DO
FROM NOW ON.

117
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,666
- ( birds singing )

118
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,000
- Sasami: ONIONS--
- Mihoshi: ONIONS HERE.

119
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,708
- BELL PEPPERS.
- BELL PEPPERS HERE.

120
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,000
- CARROTS.
- CARROTS HERE.

121

- ( gulping )

128
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,458
THIS IS THE LIFE!

- ( birds scurrying )

130
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,958
- WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT?

131
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,500
- RYOKO.

132
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,291
- THAT'S MY NAME.

133
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,916
( grunting )

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,083
AHHH!

135
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,791
- HA HA HA HA.

136
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,125
- HEY!
YOU LET ME GO NOW!

137
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,333
HA HA HA!
SERVES YOU RIGHT.

138
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,958
( laughs ) 

139
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,166
- OH, YOU-- YOU HURT ME.

140
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,750
IT'S CRUEL OF YOU TO MAKE A SCAR
ON A WOMAN'S FACE.

141
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,375
- LOOKS LIKE ME.
IS THAT MY CLONE?

142
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,250
- ( voice changing ) I'M GOING
TO BORROW YOUR BODY AND MEMORY.

143
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,500
- OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!

144
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,500
( grunting )

145
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,125
- Dr. Clay: I ASSUME YOU HAVE
COMPLETED DUPLICATION PROCESS?

146
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,833
- YES, DOCTOR.
- LOOK AT THIS. ( laughs )

147
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,208
EVEN WASHU WON'T BE ABLE
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

148
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,458
- ( computer beeping )
- HMM?

149
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,458
THIS REACTION IS--
- AH!

150
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,958
- WHAT?
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

151
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,666
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
THAT CAN'T BE DUPLICATED

152
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,208
BY THE POWER ENDOWED IN ME BY
LADY TOKIMI. IT'S INCONCEIVABLE.

153
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,791
- AND THERE'S NO ANSWER
FOUND IN RYOKO'S

154
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,416
MEMORY EITHER, DOCTOR.

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,833
- WASHU WILL DETECT ME
IF I STAY LONGER.

156
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,166
IF WE CAN'T DUPLICATE THE JEWEL,
WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE

157
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,166
BUT TO TAKE HERS.

158
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,833
WE'LL DEAL WITH THE OTHERS
AFTER WE CAPTURE WASHU.

159
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,666
- UNDERSTOOD, DOCTOR.

160
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,833
- ( groans )

161
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,833
- IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED
THIS TIME.

162
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,791
HOWEVER... HMM.

163
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,333
- ( grunting )

164
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,333
- I WAS GOING TO DISPOSE OF HER
ON THE SPOT.

165
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,666
BUT SHE MAY BE WORTH
TAKING TIME TO STUDY.

166
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,041
- AH!

167
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,583
( grunting )

168
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,916
OH, TENCHI!

169
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,041
- WHAT THE--

170
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,833
- Washu:
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, TENCHI?

171
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,500
- I-- I THOUGHT
I HEARD SOMEONE CALL ME.

172
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,083
- YOU'RE HEARING THINGS.

173
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,708
- AH!

174
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,000
- ( scanning )
- HMM.

175
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,208
BY THE WAY,
DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK?

176
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,208
- NO, AND BELIEVE ME,
I'VE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES

177
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,291
SINCE THE COMBAT
WITH KAGATO, BUT--

178
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,541
- YOU COULDN'T
GENERATE LIGHT HAWK WINGS AGAIN?

179
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,750
HMM.

180
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,500
- IT WAS PROBABLY
JUST AN ACCIDENT,

181
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,458
I GUESS.

182
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,500
OR CREATED
BY TSUNAMI'S POWER.

183
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,791
- I DON'T THINK SO, TENCHI.

184
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,958
THOSE WINGS WERE
DEFINITELY GENERATED BY YOU.

185
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,625
NOW LISTEN UP.

186
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,166
YOU WERE COMPLETELY BLOCKED
FROM ANY OUTSIDE POWER

187
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,375
INCLUDING TSUNAMI'S
AT THAT TIME, AND YOUR BODY--

188
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,875
- Sasami: TENCHI!
- HMM?

189
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,083
- ( gasps )

190
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,791
TENCHI, WASHU?
IT'S MEALTIME.

191
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:59,333
- GREAT!
I'M STARVING!

192
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,666
- HMM.

193
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,041
WELL, PROBABLY IT'S ALL MENTAL.

194
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,625
NORMALLY YOU DON'T NEED THINGS
LIKE LIGHT HAWK WINGS

195
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,083
IN YOUR DAILY LIFE.

196
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,416
- MMM, UH, TRIVIAL QUESTION,

197
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,625
BUT DID I REALLY
NEED TO TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF?

198
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,208
- ( laughs ) NO!

199
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,458
- OH, I KNEW IT.

200
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,750
- OH, I AM STARVING.

201
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,125
- TENCHI, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

202
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,458
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE HURT,
BUT--

203
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,666
- OH, I'M FINE.
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?

204
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,041
- OH NO, NOTHING.
( laughs ) 

205
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,208
- GO ON, TENCHI, EAT.
AND EAT A LOT.

206
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,791
- HEY, WHERE'S RYOKO?

207
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,041
- RYOKO WENT OUT A WHILE AGO
TO BUY SOME SAKE.

208
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,166
SHE SHOULD BE BACK
ANY MINUTE NOW.

209
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,291
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

210
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,375
- SHE PROBABLY DRANK
IT ALL ON THE WAY

211
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,875
AND FELL ASLEEP,
AS USUAL.

212
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,000
- OH MY,
NOW THE RICE IS GETTING COLD.

213
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,208
- ( meows )
- DON'T BOTHER WAITING FOR HER.

214
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,583
LET'S JUST EAT.
JUST GIVE HER THE LEFTOVERS

215
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,416
AND SHE
WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

216
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,708
- WELL, I THINK
I'LL GO LOOK FOR HER.

217
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,750
- OH, YOU WILL?

218
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,208
- ( Zero laughing )

219
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,708
WASHU--
SHE IS NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING.

220
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,875
WELL THEN, I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE DOCTOR NOW.

221
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,041
- OH, RYOKO!

222
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

223
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,375
YOU'RE KEEPING EVERYONE WAITING,
YOU KNOW.

224
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,041
- OH, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

225
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,041
WHY IS MY HEART BEATING
SO FAST ALL OF A SUDDEN?

226
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,958
AND MY FACIAL CAPILLARY VESSELS
ARE OPEN ALL THE WAY.

227
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,583
TENCHI MASAKI.

228
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,208
I'VE KNOWN HIM
SINCE I DUPLICATED THE DATA,

229
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,416
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
ABOUT THIS KIND OF REACTION.

230
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,458
- RYOKO, UH--
- YES?

231
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,916
- WHAT--

232
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,916
- OH!

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,166
TENCHI, I WENT TO BUY IT

234
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,458
SO THAT WE COULD DRINK IT
TOGETHER.

235
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,958
- DRINK IT TOGETHER?

236
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,000
- IT'S LIKE INDIRECTLY KISSING.

237
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,875
- HEY!  WHAT ARE YOU--

238
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,125
- OH!

239
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,125
- DOH!  MISS AYEKA!

240
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,625
- ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
- HUH?

241
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,750
- HAVE IT YOUR WAY.  HA!

242
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,958
- AH.

243
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,666
- RYOKO, GO EAT.
GO EAT.

244
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,208
- MMM.

245
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,791
WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THAT BOY?

246
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,125
WHAT'S THIS SURGE OF EMOTION
THAT'S FLARED UP IN ME?

247
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,833
IS IT THAT BOY
WHO'S CAUSED IT?

248
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,375
OH!

249
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,250
- HMM?

250
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,708
- OOOH.
- All: HMM.  MY!

251
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,333
- ( ducks calling )

252
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,625
- ( meows ) 

253
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,750
- ( pulsating )
- WOW, WHAT'S THIS?

254
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,833
- YOU DON'T TOUCH THAT!

255
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,208
- OH.

256
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:02,708
- ( beeping )
- HMM.

257
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,125
NOW STRETCH THE FACE.

258
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,083
AND CLOSE YOUR EYE.

259
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,500
AND CLOSE YOUR OTHER EYE.

260
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,958
AND OPEN YOUR MOUTH--
WIDER!

261
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,708
OH, THAT'S GOOD!
AND SMILE.

262
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,875
- WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

263
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,750
- I'M JUST
CHECKING YOUR LIFE-FORM DATA

264
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,708
FROM THE TIME YOU CAME
TO LIVE IN THIS HOUSE.

265
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,583
YOU KNOW,
SCIENTIFIC STUFF.

266
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,958
BE A GOOD GIRL
AND SIT STILL FOR ME.

267
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,041
- OH.
- RESPONSIVE, AREN'T WE?

268
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,583
WORTHY OF A PRINCESS
OF PLANET JURAI.

269
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,750
- MISS WASHU!

270
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,416
- HEY! EASY. JUST KIDDING,
JUST KIDDING.

271
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,875
- SO THAT'S WASHU,
THE GENIUS SCIENTIST

272
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,291
EVEN MY DOCTOR
CAN'T COMPETE WITH.

273
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,500
- Washu: HEY, NEXT!
RYOKO, DEAR!

274
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:49,083
- HA!  WHY SHOULD I BOTHER
WITH SUCH A THING, HUH?

275
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,041
- SIT DOWN.

276
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,500
- ALL RIGHT.

277
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,416
- ( pulsating )
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

278
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,208
- ( gasps )

279
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,666
WHAT'S THIS?

280
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,750
JUST AS I SUSPECTED.

281
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,958
- HMM?

282
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,833
WHAT IS IT YOU SUSPECTED?

283
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,625
- I SUSPECTED
YOUR BREASTS ARE SAGGING.

284
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,750
- SAGGING?!

285
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,708
- ( laughs )

286
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,125
- HUH?
- HMM?

287
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,458
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )
- OKAY.

288
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,041
- STOP IT, BUBBLEHEAD! I TOLD
YOU NOT TO PLAY WITH THAT!

289
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,541
- ( both squealing )

290
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:42,666
- Dr. Clay:
ZERO, CAPTURE WASHU.

291
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,166
- I'M LEAVING!

292
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,041
- OH, TENCHI, PLEASE,
IT'LL JUST BE A MINUTE,

293
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,041
ONLY TO EXAMINE YOU
A LITTLE BIT.

294
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,500
- BUT I HAVE TO GO
TO THE FIELD NOW.

295
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,541
- YOU PROMISED YOU WOULD BE
MY GUINEA PIG, DIDN'T YOU?

296
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,125
- NOW THERE'S A CONVERSATION
I DON'T RECALL.

297
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,458
- MMM!
TENCHI, DARLING, PLEASE?

298
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,416
- MAYBE LATER, WHEN I COME BACK.
I GOTTA GO, OKAY?

299
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,875
- OOH, YOU MEAN THING!

300
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,458
- ( laughs )
- Tenchi: LITTLE WASHU?!

301
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,458
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE MY GLOVES ARE?

302
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,125
- OH!
HOW'D THEY GET HERE?

303
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,833
- I KNEW IT WAS YOU, WASHU.

304
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,916
- ( both laugh )

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,333
- OH, AND BY THE WAY,

306
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,791
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

307
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,083
HELLO?

308
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,541
- Both: OH, WELL.

309
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,333
- DAMN WASHU!

310
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,000
SHE WON'T FALL
INTO OUR HANDS VERY EASILY.

311
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:49,500
FUNNY, SHE CALLED THAT BOY
HER GUINEA PIG.

312
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,583
HMM.

313
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,916
- WELL.

314
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,333
- RYOKO?
ISN'T TODAY THE DAY

315
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,583
THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO THE LAUNDRY?

316
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,791
- OH, IS IT?
- DID YOU FORGET?

317
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,125
- WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN ME, TENCHI?

318
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,333
- ( grunts )

319

321
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:44,166
MY COTTON! WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO? IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

322
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,083
( sighs )

323
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,583
TENCHI?  OH.

324
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,541
I GOT AN EMERGENCY CALL,

325
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,916
SO I GUESS I'M GOING
TO BE OUT FOR A WHILE.

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,166
- WELL, TAKE CARE, MIHOSHI.

327
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,000
- OH, IT'S SO SWEET OF YOU
TO SAY THAT.

328
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:03,083
SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.
I'LL BE BACK BY DINNERTIME.

329
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:12,333
AHHHHH!
I'M WET!

330
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:17,083
- MIHOSHI, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL THIS TIME?

331
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,541
I'VE BEEN SENDING
SIGNALS REGULARLY

332
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,500
TO YOU SINCE YESTERDAY.

333
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,750
- OH, WET! YUCK!

334
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,833
- MIHOSHI!

335
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:30,291
- AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MESSAGE
WAS RECEIVED FROM HEADQUARTERS.

336
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,916

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,750
YUKINOJYO,
PLEASE PLAY THE MESSAGE FOR ME.

338
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,750
- ROGER.

339
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,750
- AH, IT'S ME.

340
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,541
THIS IS PROBABLY NEWS
THAT YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY.

341
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,208
THE NEW GALAXY POLICE
BATTLESHIP SHONGA

342
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,041
WAS ROBBED,
AND BY SOMEONE UNKNOWN.

343
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,041
NOW WE HAVE A REPORT

344
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,250
IN THE AREA YOU ARE IN NOW.

345
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,833

348
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,791
REPEAT-- SIMPLY CONTACT
HEADQUARTERS, NOTHING MORE.

349

IS ON THE WAY TO INVESTIGATE.

352
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,958
YUKINOJYO?
- YES, MA'AM, MIHOSHI?

353
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,291
- EEEK!

354
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,625
SHHH!

355
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,958
- ( laughs )

356
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,333
- ARGH!

357
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,291
- LITTLE WASHU? DINNER'S READY.

358
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,416
- OH, IT'S SO LATE ALREADY?

359
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,125
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT,
LITTLE RYOKO?

360
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,333
- UH, I, UH...

361
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,583
I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
NEED MY HELP WITH SOMETHING.

362
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,000
- ALL RIGHT.
THEN YOU CAN PUT THIS

363
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,416
AND THIS AND THIS DATA
IN FOR ME.

364
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,166
THANKS, RYOKO.
- ( sighs )

365
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,541
- RYOKO, DINNERTIME.

366
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,000
- OH!

367
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,541
OH, YES,
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

368
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,083
- ( laughs )

369
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,458
EH, DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S OKAY.

370
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,208
- ( sighs )

371
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,125
( moans )

372
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,333
- I DON'T THINK MIHOSHI
IS GOING TO MAKE IT,

373
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,333
NOT FOR DINNER, ANYWAY.

374
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,416
RYOKO?

375
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,125
RYOKO!

376
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,541
DON'T YOU LIKE THE FOOD?

377
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,875
- HUH?
OH, NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

378
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,250
IT'S DELICIOUS.

379
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:56,250
UH, WHY IS EVERYBODY
STARING AT ME?

380
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,250
- ABOUT TIME FOR A TEA BREAK.

381
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,666
OH!

382
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,375
RYO-OHKI!

383
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,250
OH!  OH, WAIT,
YOU HAVE TO WASH IT FIRST!

384
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,750
COME BACK HERE!

385
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,750
- MMM.  WHAT--
WHAT NOW?

386
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,666
- WON'T YOU TAKE A BATH WITH ME?

387
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,791
COME ON, LET'S GO!

388
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,250
- WHOA!

389
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,750
I DON'T WANT TO.

390
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,208
HEY, LET ME GO!

391
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,583
- WILL YOU LISTEN
TO YOUR MOM FOR ONCE?

392
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,375
- HMM, PERFECT.

393
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,750
IMAGINE-- SHE'S GIVING ME
THE OPPORTUNITY

394
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,375
TO BE ALONE WITH HER.

395
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,958
SCRUB YOURSELF WELL
WHILE YOU CAN.

396
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:06,250
- COME HERE NOW,
MY LITTLE RYOKO.

397
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,041
WE'RE ALL ALONE NOW.
- OH.

398
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,791
- YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR BODY
NICE AND CLEAN

399
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,750
OR YOU'LL DISAPPOINT TENCHI.

400
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,125
- UH...

401
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,375
- THAT'S A GOOD GIRL,
LITTLE RYOKO.

402
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,250
HMM?

403
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,666
HMM.

404
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,333
BY THE WAY, TENCHI WAS
TALKING ABOUT YOU, RYOKO.

405
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,958
- WHAT?
ABOUT ME?

406
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,708
- MM-HMM.
HE WAS COMPLAINING

407
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,333
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
CLEANED THE TOILET YET TODAY.

408
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,000
- I SEE.

409
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,333
- ( laughs ) 

410
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,333
- ( flushing )

411
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,833
- WOW, WHAT A SURPRISE!

412
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,208
YOU MEAN YOU VOLUNTEERED
TO CLEAN THE TOILET?

413
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,791
- WHAT?
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS MY TURN.

414
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,208
- NO.

415
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,208
YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF CLEANING THE YARD.

416
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,166
I BELIEVE IT'S WASHU'S TURN
TO CLEAN THE TOILET TODAY.

417
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,291
- HUH?
- BUT I'M IMPRESSED, RYOKO.

418
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,833
- UH...

419
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:17,458
( laughs )

420
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,541
THAT DARN WASHU.  SHE'S A CHEAT,
THAT'S WHAT SHE IS.

421
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,791
BUT IT WORKED OUT FINE
FOR ME.

422
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,708
- Dr. Clay: ZERO?
- I GOT COMPLIMENTS FROM TENCHI.

423
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:33,291
- ZERO!
- ( laughs )

424
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:37,000
- ZERO!
- ( gasps ) DOCTOR.

425
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,958
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

426
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:47,541
YOU HAVE A MISSION. YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE CAPTURING WASHU!

427
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,708
- I'M SORRY, DR. CLAY.

428
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,333
- MMM!

429
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:54,708
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU
AND I SEE THAT BOY CALLED TENCHI

430
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,500
IS DISTRACTING YOU
FROM DOING YOUR JOB.

431
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,166
- OH, NO, NOT REALLY, DOCTOR.

432
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,458
- ZERO?

433
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,125
- OH!

434
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,541
- YOU GOT IT?

435
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,541
- YES, SIR.

436
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:26,083
- RYOKO?  RYOKO?

437
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,000
RYOKO.

438
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,625
RYOKO?

- HMM?  OH, IT'S ONLY YOU,
RYO-OHKI.

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,625
- ( meows )

442
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:44,333
- I AM A LOYAL SERVANT
OF THE DOCTOR.

443
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:49,250
AND THE ORDER
GIVEN TO ME WAS--

444
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,083
- ( whimpers )

445
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,791
- IF THAT BOY IS IN YOUR WAY,

446
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,958
YOU MUST OBEY ME.

447
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,375
ELIMINATE HIM.
