1
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,458
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:01,500
- IF THAT BOY IS IN YOUR WAY,
YOU MUST OBEY ME.

3
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,000
ELIMINATE HIM.

4
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,791
- Washu: NOW THAT'S CUTE.
- HUH? ( gasps )

5
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,125
WASHU.

6
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,708
IF I TAKE YOU WITH ME...

7
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:10,916
- ( grunts )

8
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,166
( gasps )

9
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,541
( grunts )

10
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,500
THEN I WON'T HAVE
TO KILL TENCHI.

11
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,041
- Washu:
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT?

12
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,583
- HUH?

13
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,083
- GONNA TAKE THAT
LITTLE DOLLY TO DR. CLAY?

14
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,416
I HAD NO IDEA HE WENT
FOR THAT SORT OF THING.

15
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,708
- ( groans )

16
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,166
- BECAUSE IF IT'S A GIFT,

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,666
I CAN PUT A RIBBON
ON IT FOR YOU.

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,083
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALL THIS?

19
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,583
- I THOUGHT THE LINK WITH YOU
WAS CUT OFF FOR SURE.

20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,375
- I GUESS THE GEMS
ARE REAL, AREN'T THEY?

21
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,500
- HUH?

22
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,041
THAT DOES IT!

23
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,250
- I'M READY.

24
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,583
- ( grunts )
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

25
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,125
NO MORE VIOLENCE.
I WILL NOT ALLOW IT.

26
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,875
NOT IN THIS HOUSE.

27
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,750
- Azaka and Kamidake: OOH!

28
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,125
- HUH?

29
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,458
HEY, THAT'S MY ROOM.

30
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,416
- DON'T GET IN MY WAY.

31
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,125
- HUH?
- IF YOU DO,

32
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,125
I WILL KILL YOU.

33
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,083
- ( floor creaks )
- HUH?

34
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,833
- OH, TENCHI.

35
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,875
- RYOKO, WHAT'S UP?

36
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,958
- IT'S...

37
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,458
NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

38
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,958
- Ayeka: TENCHI!

39
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,125
- ( gasps )
- WATCH OUT!

40
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,791
- Ryoko: NO!

41
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,125
OH, TENCHI.

42
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,250
TENCHI.

43
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,291
- HMM.

44
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,250
- ( crying )

45
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,625
- Both: HUH?

46
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,750
- WE'RE GOING AFTER HER,
RYO-OHKI.

47
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,166
- ( meows )

48
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,000
- OH, DEAR.

49
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,708
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

50
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,666
- BUT YOU'RE GOING
TO COME WITH ME. YES, AYEKA?

51
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,000
- WELL, I GUESS
I COULDN'T LEAVE HER.

52
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,375
NOT LOOKING SO AWFULLY
PITIFUL ANYWAY.

53
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,333
- ( chuckles )
THANK YOU, AYEKA.

54
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,750
- Ayeka: DON'T YOU THINK THAT
COPY HAS A BETTER PERSONALITY

55
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,333
THAN THE REAL RYOKO?

56
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,166
- Washu: ( laughs )
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,250
- UH--

58
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,125
- Ayeka: SHE'S UNIQUE.
DON'T YOU AGREE?

59
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,666
- Washu: I AGREE.

60
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,041
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

61
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,000
- DID YOU SAY THAT
WASN'T THE REAL RYOKO?

62
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,000
- THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I SAID,

63
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,916
BUT I DID SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,750
- THEN WHAT ABOUT
THE REAL RYOKO?

65
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,375
- WELL, THOSE GEMS ARE REAL,

66
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,458
SO THE REAL RYOKO'S
PROBABLY STILL ALIVE.

67
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,125
- ( sighs )

68
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,791
- Washu: YOU'RE PUTTING
A TRACE ON RYOKO,

69
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,208
AREN'T YOU, RYO-OHKI?
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows ) 

70
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,000
- Washu: HUH?!
BATTLE ENERGY REACTION?

71
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,041
- ( Mihoshi screaming )

72
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,708
- IT'S MIHOSHI.

73
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,708
- YES, I WONDER
HOW SHE FOUND HIM.

74
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,041
- SHE'S A GENIUS.
I SWEAR IT.

75
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,791
- NOW, WASHU!
- HUH?

76
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,708
- IF THAT'S WHERE
RYOKO'S PRISONER,

77
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,166
THEN WE SHOULD STORM
THE PLACE AND GET HER.

78
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,583
- Washu:
I'LL FIND THAT BASTARD CLAY.

79
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,208
- WASHU, COME ON!

80
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,708
- WHY DON'T YOU HANG ON
A SECOND THERE

81
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,458
WHILE I PINPOINT
HIS LOCATION?

82
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,375
- ( screaming )

83
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,458
- AAH!
COME ON, WASHU! HURRY UP!

84
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,625
- ( screams )

85
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,000
- AAH!

86
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,250
- ( gasps )

87
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,250
MM, THAT MIHOSHI
REALLY IS HOPELESS.

88
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,916
- ( beeping )
- HUH.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,833
THERE HE IS.
SEE, TENCHI?

90
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,250
HUH?  OH?

91
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,666
UH...
( sighs )

92
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,875
I WISH YOU WOULD TRY

93
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,291
THINKING A LITTLE MORE 
BEFORE YOU ACT, TENCHI.

94
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,916
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW,
LORD TENCHI?

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,291
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

96
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,041
- FIRST, WE RESCUE MIHOSHI,
AND THEN--

97
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,291
- Mihoshi: WHOA!
- Both: OH?

98
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,291
( shouting )

99
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,208
PLEASE HELP ME,
HELP ME, HELP ME.

100
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,708
OH, NO. WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

101
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,458
WHOA!

102
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,625
( gasps )

103
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,958
I GOT YOU!

104
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,583
TAKE THAT AND THAT!

105
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,125
YES!

106
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,291
- LOOKS LIKE SHE'S 
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS.

107
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,250
- ( Mihoshi shouting )

108
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,750
- ( sighs )

109
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,833
WELL, THAT BOY IS
PRETTY GOOD FOR AN EARTHLING.

110
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,375
BUT HE DOESN'T LOOK
GOOD ENOUGH

111
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,750
FOR WASHU TO BE
SO INTERESTED IN HIM.

112
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,166
WELL, AT ANY RATE,

113
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,333
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY CAN GET HERE.

114
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,666
( chuckles )

115
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,291
- Washu: THAT'S WHY I TOLD
THEM TO WAIT FOR AWHILE.

116
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,875
- WHAT?  WASHU?

117
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,333
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

118
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,166
- YOU CERTAINLY LOOK OLDER,
DR. CLAY.

119
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,166
ALTHOUGH YOUR OCTOPUS HEAD
IS JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

120
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,000
- ( grunts )

121
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,750
HUH?

122
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,083
YOU...

123
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,791
YOU'RE JUST THE SAME,
WASHU.

124
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,958
- ( chuckles )

125
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,041
- JUST LIKE WHEN WE
WERE COMPETING FOR 

126
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,791
THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR
AT THE ACADEMY.

127
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:21,083
BUT NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO FIND OUT HOW I FELT

128
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,208
WHEN I WAS DRIVEN
OUT OF THE ACADEMY.

129
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,416
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS, WASHU.

130
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,625
- HUH?  OHH!

131
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,791
- IT IS MY RECOMMENDATION
THAT YOU DO NOT MOVE.

132
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,875
IF YOU DO, THIS ENTIRE
SHIP WILL BLOW UP

133
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,791
ALONG WITH YOUR
PET GUINEA PIG.

134
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,875
NOT TO MENTION,
DEAR, WASHU,

135
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,416
THAT PRECIOUS GIRL OF YOURS.

136
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,833
- HUH.  OH WELL.

137
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,500
IT'S A GOOD THING IT'S
NOT SOMEONE LIKE AYEKA.

138
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,666
- ( yelling )

139
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,083
- SO PERHAPS
YOU CAN TELL ME

140
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,666
WHAT THOSE GEMS ARE
SHE WAS WEARING?

141
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,416
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

142
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,833
EVEN HER MAJESTY
COULDN'T FIGURE THEM OUT.

143
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,000
WHICH FRANKLY
SURPRISES ME.

144
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,666
- ( imitating Clay )
ACTUALLY, FRANKLY AND HONESTLY,

145
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,333
I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

146
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,708
THEY'VE BEEN AROUND
SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

147
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,000
- ( groans )

148
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,583
WELL, THAT IS INTERESTING.

149
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,416
BY THE WAY,
I REALLY MUST SAY

150
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,708
I WAS VERY SURPRISED
TO HEAR YOU CALL THAT BOY

151
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,416
A GUINEA PIG.

152
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,458
I THINK IT WAS
THE FIRST TIME

153
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,125
I EVER HEARD A HUMAN
CALLED THAT.

154
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,875
WHAT ABOUT HIM
DO YOU LIKE?

155
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,416
HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
ESPECIALLY WORTHWHILE MATERIAL.

156
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,458
ANYONE AS EASY TO TRICK AS HE
MUST BE A BLOCKHEAD.

157
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,125
OH, PARDON ME.

158
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,875
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE ABOUT HIM.

159
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,041
BESIDES, JUST BECAUSE
I CALL HIM MY LITTLE GUINEA PIG

160
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,958
DOESN'T NECESSARILY
MEAN THAT HE'S

161
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,875
A RESEARCH SUBJECT,
DOES IT?

162
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,875
- ( chuckles )
- HUH?

163
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,791
- OH, SERIOUSLY, THIS MUST BE
SOME KIND OF JOKE BY YOU, WASHU.

164
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,875
SOME JOKE INDEED.

165
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,458
- HMM.

166
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,208
HEY, THERE.
I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T

167
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,250
GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
JUST TO REMINISCE

168
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,333
ABOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS,
NOW DID YOU, DR. CLAY?

169
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,291
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

170
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,750
- THERE WAS NOT A DAY
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT YOU

171
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,750
THESE 20,000 YEARS.

172
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,500
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY TIMES

173
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,416
I THOUGHT THAT
EVER KNOWING YOU

174
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,833
WAS THE GREATEST
MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE.

175
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,458
- OLD MEN ARE
SO FULL OF GRUDGES.

176
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,833
- WELL, THAT'S ALL
COMING TO AN END TODAY.

177
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,875
THE BIGGEST PAIN OF MY LIFE

178
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,500
WILL BECOME THE GODDESS
OF GOOD FORTUNE.

179
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,500
- Washu: GOOD FOR YOU.

180
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,375
- I MEAN YOU, WASHU, DEAR.

181
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,333
- UH-HUH.

182
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,500
- UH-HUH?
( stammers )

183
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,458
THERE'S A PLACE
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU.

184
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,041
SOMEONE WANTS TO MEET YOU.

185
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,958
- OOH, LITTLE GIRLS
TURN YOU ON, HUH?

186
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,166
- WHAT?!
- AH!  I KNEW IT.

187
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,208
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME
TO SOME KIND OF SECRET CLUB,

188
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,791
AND THEN DO
ALL KINDS OF THINGS

189
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,125
TO MY YOUNG AND
BEAUTIFUL BODY.

190
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,375
OH MY.  OH MY!

191
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,541
AND AT THE END,

192
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,291
YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING
ABSOLUTELY UNSPEAKABLE.

193
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,958
WOW!

194
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,875
OLD AGE HAS SUCH
A WAY OF DISTORTING

195
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,583
HOW YOU EXPRESS YOUR LOVE.

196
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,958
- ( shouts )

197
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,375
I NEVER SAID SUCH THINGS.

198
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,458
- WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR FEELINGS.

199
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,375
REALLY, I DO.

200
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,125
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND

201
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,375
THAT I'M IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

202
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,458
- WASHU, CUT THAT OUT!

203
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,583
BESIDES, WHY WOULD I
BE INTERESTED IN SOMETHING

204
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,416
THAT I CAN'T TELL
THE FRONT FROM THE BACK?

205
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,416
- ( growls )

206
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,375
TAKE A LOOK, YOU JERK!

207
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,000
- NOW JUST YOU STOP IT.

208
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,416
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

209
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
THE ONE WHO WANTS TO SEE YOU
IS LADY TOKIMI.

210
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,666
- HUH?  LADY TOKIMI?

211
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:01,250
- ( chuckles )
SURPRISED, WASHU?

212
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,666
( chuckles )

213
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,250
- YEAH, I'M SURPRISED.

214
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,583
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE HEARD YOU CALL

215
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,000
SOMEBODY BY A TITLE.

216
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,583
- ( stammers )

217
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,166
DAMN YOU!

218
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,750
- SO, WHO IS THIS
TOKIMI ANYWAY?

219
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,166
REMEMBER I WAS LOCKED UP 
FOR THE LAST 5,000 YEARS.

220
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,125
I'M PRETTY SURE I DON'T
REMEMBER HEARING THAT NAME

221
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,958
WHILE I WAS AT
THE ACADEMY.

222
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:25,041
CAN'T REMEMBER A THING THAT
HAPPENED OVER 20,000 YEARS AGO.

223
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,250
AH, COME ON.
GIVE ME A HINT.

224
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,583
- ( groans )

225
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,625
WELL, YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE
JOKER, AREN'T YOU, WASHU?

226
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,458
YOU MAY NOT KNOW HER,
BUT SHE KNOWS YOU.

227
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,875
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW,
ASK WHEN YOU GET THERE.

228
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,833
- ( panting )
- HUH?

229
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,625
- DAMN IT.

230
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,333
NOW WHERE COULD
RYOKO BE?

231
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:56,125
- TENCHI, I THINK DIDN'T WE
COME THIS WAY EARLIER?

232
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,666
- WHAT?
- Mihoshi: TENCHI!

233
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,416
I THINK THAT MAYBE
WE SHOULD GO THIS WAY, TENCHI.

234
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,000
- HMM.
- HMM.

235
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,000
UH-OH.

236
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,916
- LET'S SEE.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,666
- OH, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
TENCHI?

238
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,333
( gasps )

239
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,166
- UHH.

240
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,291
- ( gasps  )

241
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,333
- ( both gasp )

242
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,666
- NO!

243
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,666
- OH, TENCHI.

244
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,083
( sighs )

245
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,250
- SOMETHING'S VERY WRONG.

246
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,333
THE STRUCTURE OF
THE PASSAGEWAY

247
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,666
IS DIFFERENT FROM
THE GALAXY POLICE STRUCTURE.

248
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,541
AND I THINK THAT PERHAPS
THIS MEANS...

249
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,500
- PERHAPS THIS MEANS...?

250
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,083
- THIS MEANS THAT PERHAPS
WE'RE TRAPPED IN HERE.

251
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,125
- YES, WE'RE TRAPPED IN HERE!
WE ARE VERY LOCKED UP!

252
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,125
- WE ARE?  OH DEAR.

253
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,583
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- ( crying )

254
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,458
- OH, YEAH. BY THE WAY,

255
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,500
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW I KNEW WHERE TO FIND YOU?

256
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,541
AREN'T YOU JUST
THE SLIGHTEST BIT CURIOUS?

257
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,125
- WELL, WHY NOT?

258
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,166
IT'S A LONG TRIP.

259
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,500
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN
AND TALK?

260
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,458
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

261
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,750
- HUH?

262
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,750
- I AM INTERESTED
IN HOW YOU FOUND

263
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,791
THE LOCATION OF THIS BRIDGE.

264
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,250
BUT ALSO HOW YOU
FOUND OUT ABOUT RYOKO.

265
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,541
I THOUGHT IT WAS
BECAUSE OF THE GEMS.

266
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,750
BUT IT SEEMS I WAS WRONG,
I GUESS.

267
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,500
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IN ALL THESE THOUSANDS OF YEARS

268
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,166
I'VE NEVER BEEN DETECTED
IN ANY KIND OF SEARCH.

269
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,166
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

270
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,750
YOU MUST HAVE SOME SYSTEM,
WASHU.

271
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,583
- IT'S SIMPLE, REALLY.

272
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,208
DID YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HABIT
OF MARKING

273
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,416
ALL YOUR FAVORITE THINGS
WITH YOUR SPECIAL LOGO? 

274
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,666
ALWAYS DID.
- WHAT?!

275
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,708
- Washu: THAT'S HOW I KNEW
THAT THE BRIDGE

276
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,791
WAS IN THE STATUE'S HEAD.

277
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,250
- ( stammers )

278
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,250
- AND THIS...

279
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,208
IS YOUR FAVORITE.

280
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,166
- NOW HOW DID YOU GET
YOUR HANDS ON THAT?

281
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,625
NOW STOP THAT!

282
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,583
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TROUBLE
I WENT THROUGH TO GET THAT? 

283
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,583
- WHAT SHOULD I DO
WITH THIS?

284
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,041
- ( groans )

285
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,875
GIVE IT TO ME THIS INSTANT,
OR OTHERS WILL SUFFER.

286
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,625
- HUH?
- ( gasps )

287
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,541
OOH.

288
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,583
- ( chuckles )

289
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,583
- ALL RIGHT.  ALL RIGHT.

290
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,041
- ( gasps )

291
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,791
- ( chuckles )

292
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,875
( gasps )

293
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,583
WASHU?

294
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,250
HUH?
- Washu: AND I DIDN'T FORGET

295
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,041
TO PUT THE RIBBON ON.

296
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,666
- ( murmurs )

297
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,583
- LISTEN UP.
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET

298
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,666
THE GANG AND RYOKO BACK,
AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIS DOLL.

299
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,666
BUT I REALLY MUST
INSIST THAT YOU

300
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,791
DON'T DO ANYTHING
INDECENT WITH IT, OKAY?

301
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,041
- ( both gasp )

302
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,000
- Ryoko: DON'T MOVE.

303
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,375
- ( gasps )

304
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,750
( sighs )

305
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,541
Z-ZERO?

306
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,083
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

307
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,291
NEVER MIND.

308
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,875
( chuckles )

309
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,291
HOW ABOUT THAT?

310
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,375
YOU FORGOT TO TAKE
ZERO INTO ACCOUNT.

311
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,708
I'M ASHAMED OF YOU.

312
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,958
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

313
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,708
- ( scoffs )

314
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,708
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP UP
THAT ATTITUDE FOR LONG.

315
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,458
- I MEANT YOU TOO,
DOCTOR.

316
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

317
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,291
- PAY ATTENTION, DOCTOR.

318
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,833
PLEASE DON'T GET TENCHI
INVOLVED ANYMORE.

319
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,291
- UNBELIEVABLE.

320
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,875
EVEN THOUGH A DIFFERENT
MEMORY WAS PLANTED,

321
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,708
COMPLETE AND ABSOLUTE
OBEDIENCE TO ME

322
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,916
SHOULD BE IN THE DEPTH 
OF HER UNCONSCIOUSNESS.

323
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,750
- MY GUESS IS THAT IT'S BECAUSE
YOU MADE A COMPLETE COPY.

324
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,333
- ZERO.

325
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,416
LISTEN TO ME.
THAT IS NOT YOUR WILL.

326
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,166
THE PSEUDO-PERSONALITY 
THAT WAS PLANTED IN YOU

327
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,750
IS MAKING YOU 
ACT LIKE THAT.

328
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,833
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS ERASE THAT MEMORY--

329
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,791
WHOA!

330
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,750
- NO, DOCTOR.

331
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,333
I WANT THIS MEMORY
AND BODY.

332
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,500
I WANT TO LIVE AS RYOKO.

333
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,583
- YOU WOULD BETRAY ME?
HOW DARE YOU.

334
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,916
WHY, YOU'RE JUST--

335
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,333
YOU'RE JUST A MARIONETTE
THAT I MADE.

336
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,166
- I-- I AM RYOKO!

337
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,958
- ENOUGH!

338
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,166
- ( gasps, screams )

339
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,083
( grunts )

340
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,958
- ( gasps )
ZERO.

341
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,958
- TENCHI.

342
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,375
TEN--

343
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,833
( grunts )

344
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,791
- RYOKO.

345
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,583
CLAY, YOU'RE AN AWFUL BASTARD.

346
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,291
- EVERYONE'S MAKING FUN OF ME.

347
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,375
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED
AT ALL, HAVE YOU?

348
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,916
THIS IS WHY YOU WERE 
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL.

349
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,875
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO STIRRED
THOSE WHO WERE JEALOUS

350
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,208
OF MY TALENT
TO DRIVE ME OUT!

351
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,375
- THERE'S NO ONE LIKE THAT
AT THE GRADUATE SCHOOL.

352
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,958
THE ONES WHO DON'T
LOVE THEIR WORK

353
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,541
ARE THE ONES
WHO ARE DISLIKED.

354
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,833
AND THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT ARE DRIVEN OUT.

355
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,916
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I LOVE.

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I LOVE PERFECTION,
AND MY TECHNOLOGY IS PERFECT.

357
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,000
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE.

358
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,416
THERE CAN'T BE ANY
DEFECT IN MY WORK.

359
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
THERE CAN'T BE!

360
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:46,208
- ( laughing )
YOU IDIOT.

361
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,000
- YOU DARE CALL ME THAT?!

362
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,833
( panting )

363
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,833
HUH?

364
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,416
20,000 YEARS AGO
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

365
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,875
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT?

366
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,416
I REMEMBER INVESTIGATING
YOUR PAST

367
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
A LONG TIME AGO.

368
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,833
OH, YES.  I DO INDEED.

369
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,583
( chuckles )

370
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,833
LET'S SEE WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH LADY TOKIMI IS

371
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,625
BY MAKING A COPY...

372
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,875
OF YOUR MEMORY.

373
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,875
- HUH?
BACK OFF, YOU IDIOT.

374
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,875
DON'T YOU KNOW A WOMAN'S
AGE AND PAST

375
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,583
ARE BEST KEPT A SECRET--?

376
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,458
- I KNOW THAT I AM
A SCIENTIST.

377
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:27,208
I KNOW THAT I CAN'T STAND
LEAVING A MYSTERY UNSOLVED,

378
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:31,458
AND THE SAME APPLIES
TO THAT GEM, WASHU. 

379
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,458
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

380
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,458
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
IT REALLY EXISTS OR NOT.

381
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,500
WHAT THE--?

382
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,041
- HER VERY EXISTENCE
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

383
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:43,000
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS PRESENT
RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF US.

384
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,375
- MY GOD!

385
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,041
- WHOA!

386
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,708
HOW COULD THIS BE?

387
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,250
ITS FUNCTIONS SHOULD HAVE
BEEN TOTALLY SHUT DOWN.

388
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,916
- CLAY!

389
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,041
-  ( gasps )

390
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,250
( gasps )
- ( grunts )

391
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,666
- ( grunts )

392
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,166
- HUH?

393
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,500
- WHEN THIS SHIP DIVIDES,

394
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,208
THE ENERGY REACTOR
OF THE MAIN BODY OF THIS SHIP

395
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,375
WILL BEGIN TO SHRINK
AND THEN IT WILL EXPLODE.

396
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,125
- UHH.

397
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,500
- IF YOU WANT TO STOP IT--
IF YOU WANT TO STOP IT,

398
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,083
THE STATUE OVER THERE
IS THE CONTROL.

399
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,125
- UM...

400
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,375
- YOU'D BETTER HURRY 
OR YOU WON'T MAKE IT.

401
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,375
- HA.

402
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,500
THIS MUST BE IT.

403
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:57,041
TALK ABOUT BAD TASTE,
DIRTY OLD MAN.

404
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,208
- ( funeral march playing
on computer )

405
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,041
- OH, NO.
THIS IS A DUMMY.

406
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,166
DAMN!

407
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,375
- DAMN.

408
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,375
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHOA!

409
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,250
- ( all scream )
- TENCHI!

410
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,750
- AAH.

411
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,750
- M-MIHOSHI,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? ARE YOU?

412
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,166
- ( stammers)
YES, I AM.

413
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,166
OH, TENCHI,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

414
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,333
YOU SAVED ME AGAIN.

415
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,166
TENCHI, I'M SO--
- ( beeping )

416
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,041
- WHAT WAS THAT?

417
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,625
LET'S SEE.

418
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,583
- OH, NO.

419
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,666
THE FLOW OF ENERGY IS
CONCENTRATING ON ONE POINT ONLY.

420
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,250
- OHH.

421
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,708
- IT MEANS WE'RE GOING 
TO BECOME A BLACK HOLE!

422
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,916
- WHAT?!

423
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,958
- WOW.
YOU MEAN IT REALLY?

424
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,875
THIS'LL BE THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER COME SO CLOSE TO ONE.

425
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,250
OH!
- I'M SURE IT WILL BE.

426
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,791
- OKAY.
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY

427
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,750
AT LEAST TO CONTROL THIS SIDE
OF THE SHIP IF POSSIBLE.

428
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,875
- ( groans )

429
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,125
TENCHI?

430
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,791
- ( yells )

431
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,625
- AYEKA.

432
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,208
- I CAN'T!

433
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,166
- ( all shout )

434
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,166
( all scream )

435
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,500
- OH.
( groans )

436
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,083
- WASHU, YOU HAVE 
RUINED EVERYTHING.

437
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,583
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

438
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,291
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT,
WASHU!

439
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,208
HUH?

440
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,541
WHAT?!

441
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,833
THE GRAVITY CONSTANT
OF THE SPACE IS CHANGING?

442
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,375
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
IT CAN'T BE.

443
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,541
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

444
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,916
THE LIGHT HAWK WINGS!

445
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,208
IT'S SAID THEY CAN
ONLY BE CAUSED BY 

446
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,041
A JURAI SHIP.

447
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,750
BUT THAT'S NOT
A JURAI SHIP. 

448
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,500
IT'S A PERSON.

449
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,333
( stammers )
IT'S THAT BOY.

450
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:03,500
HMM.

451
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,333
AND THAT REMARKABLE BOY

452
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:12,333
IS IN THE COMPANY OF WASHU,
ISN'T HE?

453
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,750
THEN I'LL TAKE THIS INFORMATION
TO LADY TOKIMI.

454
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,291
( chuckles )

455
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,375
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

456
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,333
- ( screams )

457
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,916
- WELL, IT IS NOW MY DUTY

458
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
TO ESCORT THE PRISONER,
RIGHT?  ISN'T IT?

459
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,000
- Washu: HERE.
- WHOA!

460
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,000
WELL, WHAT IS IT, WASHU?

461
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,333
A GIFT?  WHO FOR, HUH?

462
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,500
- JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO WHILE AWAY

463
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,750
THE TIME ON DUTY.

464
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,000
- OH, I SEE.

465
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,958
WELL THEN, I'LL BE SURE TO GIVE
IT TO THE APPROPRIATE PERSON.

466
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,291
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

467
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,791
OKAY NOW.
GOOD-BYE, WASHU.

468
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,375
- OKAY, BYE, NOW.

469
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,958
- TAKE CARE.

470
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,375
WHOA!
- ( glass shatters )

471
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,791
- ( groans )

472
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,708
- OH, WASHU?

473
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,291
- DON'T WORRY. I PUT
A TUBE OF GLUE IN THERE TOO.

474
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,375
- I'M SORRY I LIED TO YOU.

475
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,291
- RYOKO.

476
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,208
- RYOKO.
( chuckles )

477
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,541
- I HAVE WANTED TO BE
CALLED THAT FOREVER. 

478
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,958
I ONLY WISH THAT
TIME WOULD STOP NOW.

479
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,916
- ( stammers )
- BUT I AM NOT RYOKO.

480
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,916
- COME ON, TENCHI.
NOW HURRY UP.

481
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,416
- YOU, WHAT IS IT, WASHU?

482
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,000
- PUT RYOKO IN
THE CAPSULE.

483
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,416
- WHAT?

484
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,166
- RYOKO'S GOING BACK
INTO ONE BODY.

485
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,958
- OH.
- BUT...

486
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,416
- YOU KNOW, I GOTTA 
TELL YOU CHARACTERS,

487
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,833
IT'S NOT TOO EASY
TO DUPLICATE MY MASTERPIECE.

488
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,000
I TOOK THE TROUBLE
TO DIVIDE HER INTO TWO

489
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:51,416
BECAUSE I CAN'T CONTROL
THE MIND OF A COMPLETE UNIT.

490
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,416
SO NOW I'M GONNA PUT THEM
BACK TOGETHER INTO ONE.

491
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,708
YEP.

492
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,250
- ( gasps )

493
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,666
OH, I'M-- I'M SO...

494
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,833
- MM-HMM.
- Ryoko: YOU BIG FAT LIAR.

495
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:07,625
- Washu: DO YOU HAVE 
ANY OBJECTION, RYOKO?

496
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,458
- Ryoko: I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MAKING

497
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,125
THIS KIND OF A DECISION FOR ME.

498
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:14,083
I DON'T LIKE IT.
SHE'S SO EMBARRASSING.

499
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,208
- Washu: EMBARRASSING?

500
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,541
YOU MEAN IT'S
EMBARRASSING BECAUSE

501
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,458
SHE REMINDS YOU OF YOURSELF?

502
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:22,541
OR IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE
REALLY JEALOUS OF HER? 

503
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,583
I MEAN, SHE'S SO HONEST
ABOUT HER FEELINGS.

504
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,875
RYOKO.

505
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,875
THAT IS THE OTHER YOU.

506
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,875
THE ONE WITH YOUR
TRUE FEELINGS.

507
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:36,291
AND I BET YOU KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

508
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,250
AM I RIGHT?

509
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,416
RYOKO?

510
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,208
RYOKO, I WON'T FORCE YOU TO

511
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,750
IF YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT TO DO IT.

512
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,208
GOOD GIRL.

513
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,708
- Ryoko: DAMN YOU, WASHU.

514
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,333
- D3: WHAT IS THIS ENERGY?

515
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,916
- IS IT WASHU?

516
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,250
OR IS THIS TSUNAMI'S DOING?

517
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,500
- THAT SWORD IS CAPABLE
OF MATERIAL CONVERSION,

518
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:20,500
AND YET IT ONLY
HAS THREE BLADES?

519
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:24,666
- I CAN'T SAY.
- YOU CAN'T SAY?

520
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,750
OR YOU WON'T SAY?

521
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:32,333
BUT THIS DIMENSION SEEMS
TO BE PERFECT FOR YOUR PURPOSE.

522
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,916
WITH NOT ONLY WASHU,
BUT TSUNAMI HERE.

523
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:43,375
NOW WHAT SHALL WE DO
ABOUT DR. CLAY?

524
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:46,375
- AS I RECALL, THIS DIMENSION
IS YOUR JURISDICTION.

525
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:48,500
- YES, YOUR MAJESTY.

526
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,541
- ( giggles )

527
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,208
- Washu: OH, TENCHI?

528
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,041
- ( gasps )
- HUH?

529
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,416
- ( panting )

530
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,125
- ( door opens, closes )

531
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,208
- WASHU, I THOUGHT
TENCHI WOULDN'T BE BACK

532
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,500
UNTIL LATER THIS EVENING?

533
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,208
( giggles )

534
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,916
- ( chuckles )

535
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,583
SO INNOCENT.

536
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,291
- ( sighs )

537
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,583
OH, MY.
WHEN WILL I EVER

538
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,583
GET BACK TO NORMAL?

539
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,875
( giggles )
