- WE SHOULD PROBABLY
DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

43
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.
COME ON, LET'S GO NOW.

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,833
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
PARDON ME.

45
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,833
WHAT'S MY ASSIGNMENT TO BE?
- YOU'RE NEW, AREN'T YOU?

00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,541
- YES I AM.

47

HOW DO YOU DO?
MY NAME IS WASHU

48
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,750
AND I AM AT YOUR SERVICE,
O GREAT RESPECTED ONE.

49
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,333
- WELL WELL,
FOR BEING SO YOUNG AND ALL,

50
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,708
YOU ARE A GOOD POLITE GIRL
AND I LIKE THAT.

51
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,875
NOW I'M NOT PLANNING ON MAKING
ANY CHILDREN DO ANY WORK,

52
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,208
SO WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG
WITH SASAMI AND PLAY?

53
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,666
- AHA!

54

YES, MA'AM.

JUST WHAT THE--

61
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,166
- QUIT WASTING MY TIME.

00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,083
- ( laughs ) 

64
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,125
- AH, NOBUYUKI.

65
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,916
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A PARTY OF EIGHT,

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE GOT ONE MORE GUEST.

67
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,208
- HUH?  HMM?

68
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,250
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

69
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,125
THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT OF US.

70
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,791
- THAT'S STRANGE.
I COULD SWEAR I SAW A YOUNG LADY

71
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,125
RESEMBLING ME AS A YOUNG WOMAN.

72
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,333
- WELL, THERE'S NO ONE LIKE THAT
WITH US.

73
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,625
NOT AT ALL.
- SHE'S STARTING TO SEE THINGS.

74
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,708
WATCH OUT!
- OH!

75
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,958
- I SAID GET TO WORK
AND I MEAN IT!

76
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,666
- All: YES, MA'AM.

77
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,625
- SHALL WE GO?
- OKAY.

78
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,416
HMMM.

79
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,708
HEY, AYEKA.

80
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,333
- HMM?

81
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,791
- UH, NOTHING.

82
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,958
NEVER MIND.

83
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,583
- ALL RIGHT.

84
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,500

86
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,000
- THIS IS A MILFOIL.

87
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,916
DID YOU KNOW THESE FLOWERS
ARE SUPPOSEDLY GROWN

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,125
FOR THEIR BEAUTY
AND MEDICINAL VALUES?

89
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,166
BUT I WONDER WHAT THEY CURE.

90
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,291
SASAMI?
- HUH?

91
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,958
- COME OVER HERE, SASAMI.

92
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,875

93
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,958

98
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,166
- ( animals scurrying )

99
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,833
- WHERE'D SHE GO?

100
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,875
OH WELL.
RYO-OHKI IS WITH HER

101
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,083
SO SHE'LL BE FINE, I'M SURE.

102
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,250
- ( banging )

103
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,666
- Nobuyuki: THIS MUST BE
WHAT SHE HAD IN MIND

104
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,833
WHEN SHE CALLED
AND INVITED US OVER.

105
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,250
HMM, I WAS SO STUPID.

106
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,541
- Yosho: LET'S JUST SAY NAIVE.

107
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,250
- WELL, YOU WERE EXCITED
ABOUT COMING HERE TOO.

108
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,083
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

109
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,500
- UH, NO.
NOTHING NOTHING.

110
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,541
( laughs ) 
OH!

111
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,208
- MMM.
I TOLD YOU TO BE CAREFUL.

112
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,375
OH!

113
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,833
- ( both grunting )

114
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,375
- BONEHEADS.

115
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,875
- HEY, TENCHI, LOOK.

116
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,958
- OH!

117
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,583
- AHH!

118
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,666
- HMM.  YOU'RE A BIG HELP.

119
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,458
WITH THE WAY
YOU'RE PEELING THEM,

120
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,333
WE WON'T HAVE ANYTHING
LEFT TO EAT.

121
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,083
- IS THAT RIGHT?

122
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,958
WELL, WITH HOW SLOWLY
YOU'RE PEELING THEM,

123
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,208
WE'RE NEVER GONNA FINISH,
MADAM SLOWPOKE.

124
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,916
- MM-HMM!

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,250
WELL, AT LEAST I HAVE A TALENT
FOR NOT WASTING FOOD.

126
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,291
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- THE TRUTH!

127
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,833
- ( both grumble )

128
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,625
- SETTLE DOWN, BOTH OF YOU.

129
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,125
I MEAN, LET'S NOT ARGUE
OVER NOTHING, OKAY?

130
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,833
I MEAN, AT LEAST WAIT TILL
IT'S SOMETHING TO ARGUE ABOUT.

131
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,958
- Both: MMM.

132
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,916
EH.  OOH!

133
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,541

HMM!

135
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,958
- HEY, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

136
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,958
- ( sighs )

137
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,875
- IT WASN'T ME, I TELL YOU.

138
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,625
I REALLY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
AND YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE ME.

139
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,458
SASAMI, WAS IT YOU?

140
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,458

00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,166
- ( men groaning )

158
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,458
- SHH!  I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT WE SAW.

159
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,833
WE SAW A VAGUE GHOSTLIKE FIGURE.

160
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:35,083
- OKAY, YOU-- YOU GUYS ARE JUST
TRYING TO SCARE ME NOW, RIGHT?

161
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,083
- NO, WE ACTUALLY SAW IT.

162
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,291
- MMM.

163
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,583

- Ayeka: YES.

164
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,958
- AHH!

165
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,250
- COME TO THINK OF IT,
DAD AND GRANDPA

166
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,541
SAID THEY SAW SOMETHING--
SOMETHING SIMILAR.

167
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,250
- Mihoshi: STOP IT, PLEASE.
I CAN'T STAND IT.

168
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,500
I CAN'T STAND IT.

169
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,500
- WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF,
TENCHI?

170
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,541
- HEY, DO I LOOK AFRAID?!

171
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,041
- AHH!

172
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,541
- OH! GRANDPA!

173
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,791
- LISTEN.

174
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,541
I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY.

175
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,875
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN,

176
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,750
THE PERSON WHO LIVED
HERE TOLD IT TO ME.

177
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,500
IT BEGINS OVER 600 YEARS AGO.

178
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,541
THERE WAS A HOUSE ON A MOUNTAIN
FAR AWAY FROM CIVILIZATION.

179
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,541
IN IT, THERE LIVED A COUPLE.

180
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,000
PEOPLE RESPECTED AND
ADMIRED THEIR RELATIONSHIP

181
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,458
BECAUSE THEY WERE
SO MUCH IN LOVE.

182
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,250
HOWEVER, THE WIFE
HAD BEEN SICKLY SINCE CHILDHOOD

183
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,791
AND HAD BECOME BEDRIDDEN
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

184
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,416
IT IS SAID
SHE PROBABLY KNEW

185
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,541
THAT HER TIME
WAS RUNNING SHORT.

186
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,958
THEY DID THEIR BEST
TRYING TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER

187
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,375
AND LIVE THEIR LIVES
TO THE FULLEST

188
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,833
AND TO TREASURE
THEIR REMAINING TIME TOGETHER.

189
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,375
ONE STORMY NIGHT,

190
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,791
THEY HEARD A VOICE
THROUGH THE HOWLING WIND.

191
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,916
IT WASN'T THEIR IMAGINATION.
THE VOICE WAS REAL.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,958
THOUGH THEY WERE SCARED,
THEY WERE COMPELLED TO LISTEN.

193
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,750
AND THIS IS WHAT
THE VOICE SAID TO THEM--

194
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,166
"HEAD TO THE WEST.

195
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,208
GO OVER THREE MOUNTAINS
AND YOU'LL FIND AN HERB

196
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,041
THAT CAN CURE
ANY KIND OF SICKNESS."

197
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:08,708
THUS THE WIND SPOKE
AND THEN FELL SILENT.

198
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,750
THE HUSBAND
BELIEVED THE WIND'S WORDS

199
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,958
AND DECIDED TO GO SEARCH
FOR THE HERB.

200
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,166
SHE BEGGED HIM TO REMAIN
AND NOT LEAVE HER ALONE,

201
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,958
BUT HE LEFT
AND SET OUT FOR THE WEST.

202
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,416
- HUH?

203
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,541
MMM!
- OW!

204
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,291
- FOR SIX MONTHS,
SHE WAITED FOR HIS RETURN,

205
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,333
HOLDING ON AGAINST DEATH
WITH ALL HER STRENGTH.

206
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,625
BUT HE DIDN'T RETURN.

207
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,708
SHE SPOKE TO HERSELF, SAYING,
"I WISH THAT I WERE HEALTHY.

208
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,208
THEN I WOULD BE ABLE
TO LOOK FOR HIM."

209
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,666
BUT, ALAS,
HER HOPES WERE IN VAIN.

210
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,458
AND ONE DAY, ALL ALONE,

211
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,375
SHE PASSED AWAY.

212
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,583
AFTER THAT DAY
AROUND THIS PLACE,

213
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,041
PEOPLE BEGAN TO SEE AN IMAGE
OF A WOMAN.

214
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,708
THEY CALL HER THE WHITE GHOST.

215
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,041
SO YOU'D BETTER
WATCH OUT, TENCHI.

216
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,541
- HMM?

217
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,000
- HER SPIRIT WANDERS AIMLESSLY,
SEARCHING FOR HER BELOVED,

218
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:09,541
CONSTANTLY SEARCHING.
SHE MAY EVEN COME FOR YOU.

219
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,833
- HEY!
- AHH!

220
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,416
- ( all shouting )

221
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,541
- HAVEN'T YOU RESTED
LONG ENOUGH?

222
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,583
GET BACK TO WORK!

223
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,125
- All: OH YES, MA'AM!
- OH!

224
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,833
- KIDS TODAY!

225
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,083
EH, THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO,
I HOPE YOU KNOW.

226
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,291
- BUT-- BUT I--
THE WHITE GHOST IS--

227
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,208
- NOT THE WHITE GHOST!

228
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,041
THAT OLD STORY OF YOURS AGAIN?

229
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,541
- YOU-- YOUR STORY?

230
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,708
THEN YOU MADE IT ALL UP?

231
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,833
- ( laughs ) 

232
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,083
YUP.
NOT MAD, ARE YOU?

233
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,291
- Innkeeper: CUT IT OUT!
- ( laughs ) 

234
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,333
OH!

235
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,250
GO RIG THE LIGHTS
OR SOMETHING.

236
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,833
- WHEN WILL THEY EVER GROW UP?

237
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,416
WHY AM I THE ONE
WHO HAS TO FIX THIS?

238
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,375
DAD AND GRANDPA ARE ALWAYS
SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING.

239
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,458
HUH?

240
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,791
SO WHAT IF GRANDPA'S STORY
WAS ALL MADE UP?

241
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,625
I MEAN, WE ALL DID SEE
THAT WHITE IMAGE.

242
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,875
HA HA!

243
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,583
I'D BETTER STOP THINKING ABOUT
GHOSTS OR I'LL PROBABLY SEE ONE.

244
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,583
- ( rustling )

245
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,250
- HEY.  AHHH!

246
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,541
OH!

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,916
( groaning )

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,125
- ( rustling )
- OH!

249
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,416
- JEEZ!
SILLY ME.

250
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,708
IT WAS JUST A STUPID CAN.

251
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,000
AHHH!

252
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,958
- ( glass smashing )
- AHHH!

253
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,625
( panting )

254
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,583
AAHHH!

255
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,416
OH!

256
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,416
AHHH!

257
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,000
- Ayeka: TENCHI!

258
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,541
- HUH?

259
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,583
- ( moaning )

260
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,208
- ( groaning )

261
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,416
- TENCHI!

262
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,791
HUH?

263
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,541
NOW WHERE DID HE GO?

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,750
( groaning )
- YOU'VE SEEN IT?

265
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,375
- YUP.
- ( gasps )

266
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,583
I'M SCARED! ( crying )
- HMM.

267
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,666
I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING.

268
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,541
WHERE DID YOU SEE IT EXACTLY?

269
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,625
- ( groaning )

270
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,375
- All: HUH?

271
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,833
( all screaming )

272
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,958
- HUH?

273
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,666
HMM!  MY IMAGINATION.

274
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,416
- SASAMI?
- OH!

275
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,916
- SAS-- SASAMI?

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,125
- NOT SO TIGHT!  AHH!

277
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,500
- OH.

278
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,916
WELL, SASAMI, IT'S ONLY YOU.

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,125
- I CAN'T BREATHE.

280
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,750
- OH.
- ( moans )

281
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:24,000
- MY, THAT WAS SO SCARY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS--

282
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,666
HUH?

283
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,333
OH!
SASAMI'S REFLECTION IS--

284
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,541
- All: HUH?

285
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,333
- ( gasps )

286
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,916
- TSUNAMI?

287
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,208
- OH MY.  SASAMI.

288
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,458
YOU ARE--

289
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,666
- SASAMI!
- WHOA!

290
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,666
( all screaming )

291
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,500
- AHHH!

292
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,291
- All: SASAMI?

293
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,458
( all calling out )

294
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,500
- ( static over radio )

295
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,583
- AH, SHE'S NOT AROUND HERE
ANYWHERE.

296
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,125
- I LOOKED--
SHE'S NOT INSIDE THE INN.

297
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:11,291
- WASHU?
- HMM?  NOPE, I'VE CHECKED.

298
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,583
MY INSTRUMENTS CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND A TRACE OF HER.

299
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,250
- OH NO.

300
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,666
- I CAN'T COMMUNICATE
WITH RYO-OHKI NOW EITHER.

301
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,000
- EH! WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO SPREAD OUT

302
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,541
AND SEARCH FOR HER OURSELVES.

303
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,458
- WELL, I'LL GO THIS WAY.

304
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,916
- ALL RIGHT.

305
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,625
- AH, LET'S SEE.

306
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,541
I'LL GO THIS WAY,
THEN... HMM...

307
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,500
- YOU!

308
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,541
GO THAT WAY.
- HMM.

309
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,625
- SASAMI?
SASAMI?

310
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,833
SASAMI, WHERE ARE YOU?

311
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,541
( sighs )
WHERE ARE YOU?

312
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,041
THAT REFLECTION
WAS OF TSUNAMI.

313
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,416
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO SASAMI?

314
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,833
( sighs )

315
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,458
OH?

316
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,291
HMM?

317
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,041
- ( meows ) 

318
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,166
- HUH?

319
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,791
- WHAT?

320
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,458
- ( grunting )

321
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,958
OW!  OH!

322
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,333
- SHH.

323
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,791
- WASHU.

324
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,083
- LET'S LEAVE THEM ALONE.

325
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,375
- OH, OKAY.

326
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,083
- ( girls moaning )

327
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,916
( muffled protesting )
- HMM?

328
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,666
- I'M SORRY, AYEKA.

329
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,875
BUT I'M NOT THE REAL SASAMI!

330
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,500
- HUH?

331
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,250
WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SASAMI?

332
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,375
WH-- WHAT?

333
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,291
- ( crying )

334
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,875
- ( meows ) 

335
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,666
- SASAMI?

336
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,625
OH.

337
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,083
UH-HUH.

338
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,625
- 700 YEARS AGO.

339
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,875
YES-- IT ALL HAPPENED
700 YEARS AGO.

340
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,458
- ( laughter )

341
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:20,916
- THAT DAY WHEN THE SPACE PIRATE
RYOKO ATTACKED PLANET JURAI.

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,583
- ( alarm sounding )
- Man: INTRUDER IN BLOCK 194!

343
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,083
INTRUDER IN BLOCK 194!

344
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,375
- PRINCESS SASAMI,
WHERE ARE YOU?

345
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,041
SASAMI!
- ( man continues )

346
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,000
- SASAMI!

347
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,541
AHHH!

348
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,750
- Man: D1, SWITCH TO MODE 4!

349
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,875
- PRINCESS SASAMI!

350
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,125
- ( gasps )

351
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,625
- PRINCESS SASAMI?

352
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,291
WHERE COULD SHE HAVE GONE?

353
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,458
WHERE DID SHE GO?

354
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,458
- WOW!

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,375
WOW!

356
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,000
( grunting )

357
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,166
( gasps )

358
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,208
( laughs )

359
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,875
( gasps )

360
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,291
HOW DO YOU DO?

361
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,958
( laughs )

362
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,041
OH!

363
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,875
OH!  AHHHH!

364
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,708
( heartbeat )

365
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,041
- PRINCESS SASAMI!

366
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,500
WHERE ARE YOU?

367
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,166
OH, THERE YOU ARE!

368
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,166
- MAMA!

369
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,083
- PRINCESS SASAMI!

370
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,208
IS MY LITTLE PRINCESS ALL RIGHT?

371
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,958
- YES!
- OH GOOD.

372
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:12,375
- ( crying )
I TRIED TO TELL YOU MANY TIMES.

373
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,708
THE REAL SASAMI DIED THAT DAY.

374
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,291
THEREFORE I AM--

375
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,166
I AM NOT YOUR REAL SISTER!

376
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,083
- HUH?

377
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,375
- AYEKA!

378
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,000
AYEKA!

379
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,416
AYEKA!
PLEASE WAIT!

380
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,125
- ( laughs ) 

381
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,708
- AYEKA, WAIT FOR ME!

382
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,541
SISTER!
AYEKA, WAIT FOR ME!

383
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,375
WAIT FOR ME!
- ( laughs ) 

384
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,083
- AYEKA!

385
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,500
- ( gasps )

386
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,916
SASAMI!

387
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,666
ARE YOU OKAY?

388
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,125
- ( wailing )

389
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,750
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, SASAMI.

390
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,583
I'M SORRY, SASAMI.

391
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,750
- ( wailing )

392
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,375
- MMM.

393
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,500
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS,
SASAMI?

394
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,000
- UM...

395
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:22,000
- ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS
TO DRIVE ME AWAY?

396
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,333
- NO, AYEKA.

397
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

398
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,333
I DO!  I REALLY--
- ( giggling )

399
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,625
REALLY?

400
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,291
- YES, I DO!
YES, I DO!

401
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,083
- YOU DO?

402
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,833
WELL, I LOVE YOU TOO, SASAMI.

403
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,958
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

404
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,708
- YES.

405
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
- WHOA!

406
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,458
- TENCHI?

407
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,666
- UM, UH, I--

408
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,125
- ( laughs ) 

409
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:00,166
- I FEEL THE SAME
AS AYEKA.

410
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,666
- AH.

411
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,708
- SASAMI, WE LIKE YOU
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.

412
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,291
- RIGHT.

413
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,916
SASAMI, WHATEVER HAPPENS,
YOU ARE MY DEAR SISTER.

414
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,916
- AYEKA!

415
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,458
( sobbing )

416
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,125
TENCHI!

417
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,666
( sobbing )

418
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,041
- BE THAT WAY.
THAT'S FINE.

419
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,291
- ( meows ) 
- ( laughs )

420
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,500
SASAMI IS A LITTLE GIRL
AFTER ALL.

421
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:32,500
LET'S SEE.
- ( muffled talking )

422
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,416
- LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S FALLEN ASLEEP.

423
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
- YES, IT LOOKS THAT WAY.

424
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,083
THE POOR DEAR'S EXHAUSTED.

425
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,708
I GUESS SHE WAS AFRAID AFTER WE
FOUND OUT ABOUT HER SECRET,

426
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,250
WE WOULD LEAVE HER.

427
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:54,083
SHE-- SHE TOLD ME
THAT THE REAL SASAMI DIED.

428
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,875
BUT IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN--
- OH.

429
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,416
- Tsunami: PRINCESS AYEKA?

430
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:11,041
SASAMI DIDN'T REALLY DIE,
PRINCESS AYEKA.

431
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,125
( gasps )

432
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,416
- SHE THINKS OF HERSELF
AS MY CREATION.

433
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,666
BUT SHE ACTUALLY SURVIVED
BY ASSIMILATING WITH ME.

434
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,375
SHE'S STILL YOUNG. ONE DAY
SHE WILL UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING.

435
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,791
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER?

436
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,625
- SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT,
PRINCESS AYEKA,

437
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,541
EVEN IF I HAD TOLD HER.

438
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:35,875
BESIDES, SASAMI NEEDED TO KNOW
OF YOUR FEELINGS FOR HER.

439
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,000
RIGHT NOW, THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE TRUTH OF HER IDENTITY.

440
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:43,458
PRINCESS AYEKA, SHE TRULY IS
YOUR REAL SISTER.

441
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,708
- WOW!

442
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,083
- BEAUTIFUL.

443
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,875
- HERE YOU ARE.
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

444
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:14,166
AHH!
- ( all cheering )

445
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,875
- BEAUTIFUL CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

446
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,458
( laughs )
- ( all laughing )

447
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,541
- OKAY.
- ( meows ) 

448
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,541
- HEY, WAY TO GO, RYO-OHKI!
- ( meows ) 

449
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,208
- HEY, COME ON, TENCHI.

450
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,458
COME ON, HAVE A LITTLE SAKE.

451
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,625
- I'M STILL A MINOR.

452
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,166
- Both: GO RIGHT AHEAD!
- HUH?!

453
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,375
- LET'S LIVEN THINGS UP.

454
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,208
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

455
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,625
MMM!

456
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:42,625
- YEEEE!  WHOOA!

457
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,750
- OH NO.

458
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,541
SOMEONE FEELING
KIND OF BLUE AROUND HERE?

459
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,000
- MMM.

460
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,500
- HMM.

461
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,500
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT JURAI HAD TREES

462
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,916
THAT COULD TAKE ON HUMAN FORM.

463
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,166
( sighs )

464
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,291
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

465
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,750
- MEANING?

466
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:23,250
- TSUNAMI AND SASAMI
ARE THE SAME.

467
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,333
THERE-- GET IT?

468
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,125
- SO WHAT?

469
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,791
- WELL, THEY ARE ASSIMILATED.

470
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:33,625
THAT MEANS THAT SASAMI
AND TSUNAMI ARE IDENTICAL.

471
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,041
WHICH MEANS
THAT WHEN SASAMI GROWS UP...

472
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,958
- SHE'LL LOOK LIKE TSUNAMI?

473
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,333
HMM.  IT CAN'T BE.

474
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:43,125
- Tsunami:
YES, SHE WILL BE LIKE ME.

475
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,291
WE HAVE SEPARATE MINDS
RIGHT NOW,

476
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,458
BUT WHEN WE ARE JOINED
IN ONE FORM...

477
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:57,500
YOU CAN CALL ME SASAMI
OR TSUNAMI,

478
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,666
WHICHEVER ONE YOU PREFER.

479
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,333
- Both: HUH?

480
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,083
- YOU NEEDN'T WORRY.

481
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:09,750
WHEN WE ARE UNITED,
SHE WILL HAVE A COMPLETE MEMORY.

482
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:12,750
- THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE WORRIED.
- HUH?

483
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:16,166
- SO SASAMI WILL LOOK LIKE YOU?

484
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,625
- YES, I AM THE IMAGE
OF SASAMI IN THE FUTURE.

485
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,375
- DAMN, I DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT THIS.

486
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,000
SINCE AYEKA IS NO COMPETITION,

487
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,541
I THOUGHT SASAMI
WAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

488
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,541
- I DIDN'T PLAN ON THIS.

489
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,916
SASAMI'S BEAUTY
WILL SURPASS MINE.

490
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,708
