1
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,750
( theme music playing )

2
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,291
- ( birds, insects chirping )

3
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,791
- ( zapping )

4
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,750
- Kamidake:
ALL SYSTEMS ACTIVATED.

5
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,750
UNLOCK THE TIME FREEZE NOW.

6
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,791
ALL SYSTEMS SYNCHRONIZED
TO BREECH STANDARD TIME.

7
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,833
- WHAT PLANET IS THIS?

8
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:01,333
- Azaka: COLONIZED PLANET
NUMBER 0-3-1-5, EARTH.

9
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,291
- THEN THIS IS WHERE
MY BROTHER YOSHO IS.

10
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,958
- Kamidake: NO, WHAT WE DETECTED
FROM THIS PLANET IS RYOKO.

11
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,083
- HUH?

12
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,125
NOT THAT WOMAN!
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

13
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,125
- Azaka: WE HAVE YET
TO DETECT YOSHO'S SHIP.

14
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,375
BUT HE WAS IN PURSUIT
OF RYOKO.

15
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,291
LOGICALLY,
IT WOULD FOLLOW THEN--

16
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,083
- I SEE.  THAT WOMAN
AND RYO-OHKI MUST BE CAUGHT

17
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,458
AND TRIED FORMALLY
BY OUR PLANET JURAI

18
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,166
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

19
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,041
- Azaka:
PRINCESS AYEKA,

20
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,666
UNFORTUNATELY, ALL OF RYOKO'S
CRIMES WILL BE CANCELED

21
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,333
BY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
AT GALAXY STANDARD TIME

22
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,458
0-0-4-3-2,

23
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,791
OR IN FIVE SECONDS.
- HMM?

24
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,458
WHAT?

25
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,625
- ( beeping )

26
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,041
( tone sounding )

27
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,541
- Azaka: AS OF THIS MOMENT,
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

28
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:54,375
HAS TAKEN EFFECT,
AND RYOKO'S GALAXY WANTED FILE

29
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,791
HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

30
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,333
- DESTROYED?!

31
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,958
ANSWER ME, WHY IS IT?

32
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,166
- THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
IS BASED ON DECISIONS

33
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,541
MADE BY THE HOLY COUNCIL
OF PLANET JURAI.

34
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,375
- THAT IS NOT
WHAT I HAVE ASKED.

35
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,416
I WANT TO KNOW WHY THAT WOMAN
IS NOT SOUGHT FOR ALL ETERNITY.

36
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
- THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
IS BASED ON DECISIONS

37
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,708
MADE BY THE HOLY COUNCIL
OF THE PLANET JURAI--

38
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,791
- NEVER MIND.

39
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,000
THE ONLY CLUE LEFT TO US
IS THAT WOMAN.

40
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,333
WE MUST CAPTURE HER
AT ANY COST.

41
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,958
- BUT THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS--

42
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,291
- THIS IS AN ORDER.

43
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,416
WE WILL THINK OF A REASON.
- Kamidake: YES, MA'AM!

44
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,166
- GOOD.
NOW PREPARE FOR DESCENT.

45
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,041
- Azaka: ANTI-AIR GUARD,
STORMING LEVEL FOUR.

46
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,541
- BEWARE, MY DEAREST YOSHO.

47
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,875
PLEASE BEWARE.

48
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,916
- ( groaning )

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,750
HOW COULD--
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

50
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,250
- NOW I WANT YOUR BALLS,
PLEASE.

51
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,041
- WHAT?!  NO WAY.

52
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,666
THEY'RE MINE AND I'M GOING
TO HANG ON TO THEM.

53
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,500
- OH, YOU NUMBSKULL!

54
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,708
I MEAN THE THREE JEWELS
ON YOUR SWORD.

55
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,708
OTHERWISE,
I CAN'T CONTROL RYO-OHKI.

56
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,666
- RYO-OHKI?

57
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,125
- OH, DON'T TELL ME
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

58
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,875
IT'S THE OTHER DEMON
IN THE LEGEND, YOU DIMWIT.

59
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,291
- SO THAT MEANS IF I GIVE
THE JEWELS BACK TO YOU,

60
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,458
THE DEMON WILL COME
BACK TO LIFE?  FORGET IT.

61
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,333
- NO "IF" ABOUT IT.
GIVE 'EM TO ME.

62
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,166
- NO WAY!  YOU MADE THIS MESS
ALL BY YOURSELF.

63
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,333
YOU THINK I WANT TO DEAL WITH
ANOTHER MONSTER FLYING AROUND

64
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,541
WHEN YOU'RE
ALREADY BLOWING THINGS UP?

65
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,125
JEEZ, THAT'S THE LAST THING
I WANT TO SEE!

66
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,250
OH!
- ARE YOU SURE?

67
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,458
BECAUSE THE ONE APPROACHING US
RIGHT NOW IS EVEN WORSE.

68
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,333
- HUH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

69
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,375
- JUST GIVE ME THE SWORD.
I WANT IT AND I WANT IT NOW.

70
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,666
- ( grunting )

71
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,250
- HA!
- OH!

72
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,375
- ( laughing )
- AH!

73
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,208
( straining )

74
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,958
- OW!  OW!  OWW!

75
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,083
DAMN IT!

76
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,625
OH!

77
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:10,750
- AHH, SO YOU
CAN'T TOUCH THIS THING, CAN YOU?

78
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,125
- UH...

79
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,666
- HEY, BE QUIET. WHAT'S GOING
ON UP THERE, TENCHI?

80
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,791
THESE KIDS TODAY,
I TELL YOU.

81
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,458
I DON'T KNOW...

82
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,250
OH MY GOD!

83
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,666
OOH, AND I WORRIED ABOUT HIM
BEING TOO SHY WITH WOMEN.

84
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,333
( laughs ) NOW HE'S GONE AND
SNEAKED ONE INTO HIS ROOM.

85
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,541
IF I WERE HIS MOTHER, I'D FIND
SOME EXCUSE TO BARGE IN,

86
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,708
BUT AS HIS FATHER, IT'S MY
DUTY TO RESPECT HIS PRIVACY.

87
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,708
- PLEASE GIVE THEM BACK.
I BEG YOU.

88
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,916
- WELL,
NOW I REALLY CAN'T DO THAT.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,416
- PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,291
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
BUT ONLY IF YOU'LL TELL ME

91
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,291
WHAT'S APPROACHING US.
- OH, SHE'S THE DEVIL.

92
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,708
- HUH?
- SHE'S LIKE A DEVIL.

93
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,125
- SHE'S SO DANGEROUS AND MEAN.
SHE'LL FIRE AT YOU

94
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,291
WITHOUT EVEN GIVING YOU A TEENY
WEENY LITTLE CHANCE TO EXPLAIN.

95
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,291
- ( sneezes )
 HUH?

96
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,583
BEGIN THE CAPTURE PROCESS
AS SOON AS WE ARRIVE.

97
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,625
AND YOU MUST REFRAIN
FROM FIRING.

98
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,250
- Kamidake: YES, MA'AM.

99
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:18,333
- Azaka: WE WILL SOON
ARRIVE AT OUR DESTINATION.

100
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,666
- WELL, IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

101
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,541
WE'LL TALK TO THIS PERSON,
AND WE'LL JUST TRY

102
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,166
TO SETTLE MATTERS PEACEFULLY.
- HMM.

103
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,416
- MM-MM.
- NOT A GOOD IDEA, HUH?

104
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,625
IS SHE REALLY THAT BAD?
- YES.

105
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,458
LISTEN TO ME,
WE NEED TO WAKE UP RYO-OHKI NOW.

106
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,250
- DON'T TELL ME
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT.

107
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,458
- NO, WE'LL RUN AWAY.
- HUH?

108
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,583
- YES, IT'S MY DUTY
TO RESPECT HIS PRIVACY,

109
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:46,208
BUT ALSO MY DUTY TO RECORD
MY SON'S DEVELOPMENT IN SEX--

110
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,375
I MEAN, LIFE.
OH, MY WIFE IN HEAVEN!

111
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,708
YOU SHOULD SEE
HOW YOUR SON HAS GROWN.

112
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,000
WHAT?  OH-OH!

113
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,625
AAH!  HONEY?

114
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,541
IS THAT YOU?

115
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,250
- Ayeka: RYOKO, COME OUT!

116
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,375
- WHAA!

117
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,625
- DAMN, I KNEW IT.
SHE'S HERE ALREADY.

118
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,916
- HUH?
- RYOKO!

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,791
RYOKO, YOU MUST COME OUT.

120
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:18,750
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN THERE.
YOU CANNOT GET AWAY FROM ME NOW.

121
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,500
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS ON?

122
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,166
- Kamidake: YES, MA'AM.

123
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,708
- WELL THEN,
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

124
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,083
OH, NEVER MIND.

125
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,125
I WANT YOU
TO FIRE A SHOT NEARBY.

126
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,833
- Azaka: I THOUGHT WE WERE
TO REFRAIN FROM FIRE.

127
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,125
- THAT'S AN ORDER.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,625
- ( grunting )

129
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,083
- I TOLD YOU.

130
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,416
- WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

131
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,000
- HMM.

132
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,291
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
WHY DON'T YOU STAND UP?

133
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,458
NOW POINT THE SWORD HILT
TOWARD ME

134
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,750
AND PRAY TO HAVE THE JEWELS
RETURNED TO ME.

135
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,333
- THAT'S IT?
THAT'S ALL I DO?

136
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,416
- THAT'S ALL.
- HMM.

137
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,333
- ( buzzing )

138
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,541
- ( trilling )

139
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,833
- HUH?

140
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,375
- ( sighs )
ARGH!

141
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,750
WHAT-- WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU ONLY GAVE ME ONE.

142
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,208
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- HUH?

143
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,666
( laughs )
WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

144
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,333
COME, RYO-OHKI.

145
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,708
AWAKEN.

146
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,291
AWAKEN.

147
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,833
- ( screeching )

148
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,250
( meowing )

149
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,500
- COME!

150
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,750
- ( meowing )

151
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,583
- Azaka:
RYO-OHKI IS HERE.

152
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,958
- Ayeka: THERE YOU ARE,
YOU HEINOUS CRIMINAL BATTLESHIP.

153
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,166
ATTACK THAT SHIP.
FIRE NOW!

154
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,333
- WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

155
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,958
SHE'S TRYING
TO BLOW UP MY HOUSE!

156
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,625
- LET'S GO, TENCHI.
- OH, WHY ME?

157
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,041
OH!

158
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,583
- OKAY, RYO-OHKI,
LET'S MAKE OUR GETAWAY!

159
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,708
- ( squealing )

160
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,583
- YES, THIS IS THE FEELING.

161
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,458
OH, IT'S GOOD TO BE MOVING
SO FREELY AGAIN.

162
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,416
- OH MY GOD.
MY HOUSE!

163
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
- SORRY, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO WORRY ABOUT IT,

164
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,375
SO I SHRANK IT AND BROUGHT IT
ALONG WITH US, IF THAT'S OKAY.

165
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,458
- DAD!

166
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,000
- DAMN THAT WOMAN.

167
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,541
FIRE AT HER WHEN READY!

168
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,583
- AAH!
SEAL HER UP.

169
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,500
- HA!  AH! OH!

170
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,791
( screaming )

171
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,625
AAH!
- SHE CANNOT ESCAPE US.

172
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,791
AZAKA, KAMIDAKE, GO!
CAPTURE HER!

173
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,291
- Kamidake: YES, MA'AM.
- Azaka: YES.

174
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,416
- ( grunting )
DON'T GET NEAR.  STAY BACK.

175
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,666
- AAH!

176
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,291
- ( grunting )

177
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,958
GUARDIANS OF JURAI.

178
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,416
AAH!

179
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,666
- AAH!

180
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,000
HUH?
- AH!

181
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:44,250
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
RYOKO, SOMEBODY, HELP ME!

182
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,958
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
HASN'T IT, RYOKO?

183
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,583
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
FOR SOME TIME.

184
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,166
I HAVE A QUESTION.

185
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,708
TELL ME, WHY DID THAT EARTHLING
HAVE THIS SWORD WITH HIM?

186
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,541
ANSWER ME!

187
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,583
- HMM?

188
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,583
- ( groaning )

189
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,666
- ( screaming, laughing )

190
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,333
STOP, STOP!
YOU'RE TICKLING ME!

191
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,875
- ENOUGH.

192
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,833
THIS SEEMS TO HAVE
AN OPPOSITE EFFECT ON YOU.

193
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,833
YOU'RE BEHAVING LIKE, UM,
WHAT'S THAT CALLED?

194
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,375
- Azaka: A MASOCHIST?

195
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,833
- OH, YES.
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT.

196
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,750
- ACTUALLY, LITTLE PRINCESS,
I'M MORE OF A SADIST.

197
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,500
- OH MY!
DOES THAT MEAN YOU LIKE TO--

198
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,500
NEVER MIND,
THAT'S COMPLETELY UNIMPORTANT.

199
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
- ( chuckles )
- I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN.

200
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,208
WHY DID THAT YOUNG MAN
HAVE THIS SWORD?

201
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,250
- YOU BONEHEAD!
- WHAT?

202
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,541
- DON'T YOU FEEL IT
IN HIS BLOOD?

203
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,541
- YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING
MY QUESTION.

204
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,958
- BECAUSE THE SWORD IS HIS.

205
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,125
- DON'T BE SO RIDICULOUS.

206
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,250
YOU KNOW THIS SWORD
BELONGS TO MY BROTHER.

207
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,166
NOW WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS MY BROTHER YOSHO?

208
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,000
- HALF-BROTHER, YOU MEAN.
AND YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY

209
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,458
JUST TO LOOK FOR HIM?  HMM!

210
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,375
THINGS MUST BE DULL
ON PLANET JURAI.

211
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,375
YOU ROYAL TYPES
MUST BE REALLY BORED.

212
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,250
- SILENCE, CRIMINAL!
HOW DARE YOU?

213
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,375
- WELL WELL!
- MY BROTHER'S DISAPPEARANCE

214
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,041
ALL STARTED BECAUSE OF YOU.

215
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,416
- OH, IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

216
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,416
- AH!
- OH!

217
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,791
( screaming )

218
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,416
STOP!  STOP, PLEASE!
YOU CAN STOP NOW!

219
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,791
- NOW ANSWER ME.

220
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,958
- TENCHI PROBABLY KNOWS MORE
ABOUT YOSHO THAN I DO.

221
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,250
GO TALK TO HIM.

222
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,458
- BUT WHY WOULD THIS SWORD
KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS

223
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,875
OF MY BROTHER?

224
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,541
- OH, YEAH, I FORGOT,
THE SWORD IS CALLED TENCHI TOO.

225
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,125
NO, I MEAN THE EARTHLING BOY.
HE'S CALLED TENCHI ALSO.

226
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,625
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

227
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,333
- YEAH, RIGHT.

228
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,041
- PRINCESS AYEKA,
IT IS TIME FOR BED.

229
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,750
- LATER, I AM BUSY.
NOW GO AWAY.

230
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,291
- I CANNOT ALLOW THAT.

231
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,958
THE QUEEN
HAS GIVEN ME STRICT ORDERS.

232
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,916
- OH, VERY WELL.
AND TAKE HER OFF TO JAIL.

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,666
- BEDTIME, LITTLE GIRL.
SWEET DREAMS.

234
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,666
- ARGH!

235
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,541
- COME, PRINCESS, THIS WAY.

236
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,500
- ( belches )

237
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,958
- ( beeping )

238
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,916
- ( groans ) HMM?

239
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,625
WHERE AM I?

240
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,416
WHAT'S THIS PLACE?

241
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,625
HEY!  RYOKO!

242
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,791
WHERE DID SHE GO?

243
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,541
( grunting )

244
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,291
- ( buzzer sounding )

245
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,625
- AAH!

246
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,583
( grunts )

247
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,875
ARGH!

248
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,375
OH, YOU--

249
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,958
STOP IT!

250
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,000
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
JUST LET ME OUT!

251
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,583
- ( squeals )

252
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,833
- OH!

253
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,458
THAT DOES IT.

254
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,666
THIS CALLS
FOR SOME REAL ACTION.

255
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,500
ARGH!

256
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,833
TAKE THAT.

257
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,833
- Sasami:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

258
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,791
- WELL, I'M TRYING TO ESCAPE
FROM THIS STUPID LITTLE--

259
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,250
HUH?
- ( squealing )

260
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,208
- ( giggles )

261
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,416
- WHO-- WHO ARE YOU?

262
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,250
- MY NAME IS SASAMI.

263
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,750
SASAMI?

264
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,541
HAVE YOU BEEN KIDNAPPED ALSO?

265
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,625
- NO, YOU SILLY! ARE YOU
JOKING? THIS IS OUR SHIP.

266
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,541
- THIS IS YOUR SHIP?

267
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,666
YOU'RE AN ALIEN
FROM PLANET SASAMI?

268
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,833
- NO, YOU ARE SILLY!
I COME FROM THE PLANET JURAI.

269
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,916
- WHAT ABOUT THOSE WEIRD LOGS?

270
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,875
- ( laughs )
THEY'RE NOT REALLY LOGS.

271
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,833
THEY'RE GUARDIANS,
OUR SERVANTS.

272
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,958
- AW, MAN, WHAT A RELIEF.
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

273
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,791
- OH, RIGHT, MY NAME'S TENCHI.
HOW DO YOU DO?

274
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,875
- HOW DO YOU DO?
WILL YOU PLAY A GAME WITH ME?

275
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,708
- HMM.

276
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,625
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE WE DO.

277
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,458
AH, THAT'S A CUTE PET.

278
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,458
- MM-HMM.
- AAH.

279
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,958
HEY, THAT LOOKS LIKE--

280
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,291
UH, HUH?  OH, IT'S GONE!
- WHAT'S WRONG?

281
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,625
- OH, I HAD A SWORD
LIKE THAT ONE, BUT IT'S GONE.

282
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,791
- IT MUST HAVE--
- HMM.

283
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,333
- ( squeals )
- HEY, SASAMI,

284
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,708
COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

285
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,166
COULD YOU RETURN
ME HOME RIGHT NOW?

286
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,625
I WAS BROUGHT HERE BY MISTAKE.

287
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,416
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

288
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,500
- WELL, I'LL DO A FAVOR
FOR YOU,

289
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,916
IF YOU DO ME A FAVOR.

290
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,916
- ( sighs )

291
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,916
- MY DARLING AYEKA.

292
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,208
I MUST LEAVE HERE
TOMORROW MORNING

293
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,291
TO DO BATTLE
WITH A RAMPAGING CRIMINAL.

294
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,083
BUT DON'T WORRY,

295
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,708
I WILL DEFEAT THIS CRIMINAL
AND RETURN.

296
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,416
AND WHEN I COME BACK--
- WHEN YOU CAME BACK,

297
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,458
I WAS TO BECOME YOUR BRIDE.

298
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,083
BUT YOU NEVER RETURNED.

299
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,875
YOSHO.

300
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,250
( crying )

301
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,500
- MY SISTER'S ROOM
IS RIGHT OVER THERE.  SEE?

302
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,541
( laughs ) SHE'S ASLEEP NOW,
SO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

303
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,416
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

304
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,833
GO IN THERE AND GET HER
HEAD ORNAMENT, IS THAT RIGHT?

305
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,833
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- BUT WHY SHOULD I?

306
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,916
I MEAN, IT DOES BELONG TO HER,
DOESN'T IT?

307
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,375
- JUST GET IT.
- OKAY OKAY, I'LL GET IT.

308
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,041
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE.

309
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,541
- UH-HUH.
- DON'T WORRY.

310
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,375
( panting )

311
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,125
- ( giggles )

312
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,958
- SORRY TO BARGE IN LIKE THIS.

313
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,791
EXCUSE ME.

314
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,458
EH?  OH.

315
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,083
OH, MAN, GIVE ME A BREAK!

316
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,375
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET THAT OFF OF HER, HUH?

317
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,166
I-- HUH?

318
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,166
THE SWORD?
SHE'S GOT IT.

319
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,416
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

320
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,875
( grunting )

321
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,958
AH!

322
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,083
YOSHO.  YOSHO.

323
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,250

324
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,250
COME ON.  AH...

325
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,208
COME ON.

326
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,541
- HUH?

327
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,000
WHAT?
- AH.

328
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,250
- ( screams )
- NO NO NO, LET ME EXPLAIN.

329
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,458
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
- ( screams )

330
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,916
- AZAKA!  KAMIDAKE!
- Both: YES, MA'AM!

331
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,833
- I WANT YOU TO PUT
THAT SCOUNDREL TO DEATH!

332
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,708
OH MY,
HOW QUICKLY HE RUNS.

333
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,041
- Both: HERE WE COME.
HERE WE COME.

334
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,958
HERE WE COME...
- ( laughing ) 

335
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,000
- VERY FUNNY!
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

336
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,041
- Both: WAIT!

337
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,833
- YOUR LOGS
ARE TRYING TO KILL ME!

338
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,250
- THEY'RE MY SISTER'S!
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

339
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,083
THAT WAY, HURRY!
- WHOA!

340
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:49,500
- HURRY, GO IN THERE.
- WHOA!

341
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,375
- ( yawns )
 HUH?

342
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,416
- AAH!
- ( grunts )

343
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,708
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

344
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,125
- OW!
OH, MAN, NOW WHERE ARE WE?

345
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,625
- YOO-HOO!  YOO-HOO!
TENCHI!

346
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,708
- IT'S HER.

347
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,458
- YOU SHOWED UP JUST IN TIME.

348
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,875
- YOU GOT ME INTO THIS MESS.
YOU GET ME OUT.

349
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,375
I WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW!
- YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO HELP,

350
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,791
BUT WITHOUT THE OTHER
TWO JEWELS, I JUST CAN'T.

351
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,833
SO STOP YELLING
AND GET ME OUT OF HERE.

352
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,291
- LISTEN TO ME.  FIRST OF ALL,
I CAN'T OPEN THIS THING.

353
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,916
YOU KNOW THAT.
AND ANOTHER THING--

354
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,791
- ( sword trilling )
- HUH?

355
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,333
WHOA!

356
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,833
- I GUESS YOU WERE MISTAKEN.

357
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,291
- Sasami: UM, EXCUSE ME.
- HMM?

358
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,208
- ( giggles )
- WHO'S THIS?

359
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,916
- HELLO, NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M SASAMI.

360
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,875
- UH, HO-- WHAT?

361
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,458
- HEY, TENCHI,
WHO IS THIS OLDER LADY?

362
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,500
- ( gong strikes )
- IS SHE A FRIEND OF YOURS ALSO?

363
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,500
- ( grunting ) OLDER?!

364
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,041
( laughs )
YES, I'M HIS FRIEND.

365
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,875
BUT NOT AN OLDER LADY.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LITTLE GIRL?

366
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,583
- WOW, YOU'RE A STRONG LADY.
THAT HURTS.

367
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,541
- I WONDER WHY THIS OPENED.

368
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,541
- Sasami: HEY!
THAT SWORD BELONGS TO YOSHO.

369
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,500
- WHAT?  YOSHO?

370
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,916
- UH-HUH.

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,041
BUT WHY WERE YOU ABLE
TO USE IT?

372
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,458
- OH, YES!
SHOW ME THAT SWORD OF YOURS.

373
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:10,833
- UH-OH.  NOW JUST A MINUTE--
- NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

374
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,750
- WAIT!
YOU CAN'T TOUCH THIS!

375
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,458
- JUST TRUST ME.  RELAX.

376
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,875
- COME ON, STOP IT.
GET AWAY FROM ME.

377
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,208
- SHH.  BE QUIET.

378
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,791
- ( grunting )
- Ayeka: STOP!

379
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,166
- HUH?

380
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,333
- AND HERE COMES THE PRINCESS.

381
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:33,166
- SASAMI!  I SEE IT WAS YOU
WHO RELEASED HIM.

382
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,708
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.

383
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,583
YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

384
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,458
- SORRY, I WAS JUST BORED.

385
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,041
- THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

386
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,416
YOU, TENCHI--
I BELIEVE YOUR NAME IS TENCHI--

387
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,791
I HAVE A QUESTION
I'D LIKE TO ASK OF YOU.

388
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,750
- SURE.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

389
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,458
- WHERE IS THE OWNER
OF THAT SWORD YOU HOLD?

390
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,125
- HUH?  WELL, I THINK HE DIED
A LONG LONG TIME AGO.

391
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,750
- YOU ARE LYING!
- I'M SORRY,

392
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,291
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS
IN THE ANCIENT LEGEND.

393
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,791
- AND WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

394
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,291
- WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE
HIS NAME WAS YOSHO.

395
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,875
- OH NO.

396
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,958
- UH, DOES THAT HELP AT ALL?

397
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,625
- OH, YEAH,
HE DIED, DIDN'T HE?

398
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,458
THAT'S TOO BAD.
- IT ISN'T TRUE!

399
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,250
YOU'RE ONLY TRYING TO TRICK ME.

400
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,541
AZAKA, KAMIDAKE!
- Both: YES, MA'AM.

401
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,083
- AYEKA!  HUH?

402
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,166
- ORDER YOUR BLOCKHEADS
TO PULL BACK.

403
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,041
- YOU PLAY DIRTY TO THE END.

404
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,416
- AAH!
- BYE BYE, LADY.

405
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,791
- Ayeka: SASAMI, COME HERE!
- AAH!

406
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,166
GET BACK, AZAKA!  NO!

407
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,833
GET BACK!
- GET BACK!  STOP!

408
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,458
- ( both grunting )

409
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, TENCHI?

410
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,291
- WHAT'S HAPPENING? I GAVE YOU
AN ORDER TO CAPTURE THEM.

411
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,583
THE SWORD.  THE MASTER KEY
IS IN SYNCH WITH HIM.

412
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:57,291
BUT IT SHOULDN'T REACT TO ANYONE
BUT THOSE OF ROYAL BLOOD.

413
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,500
SO WHY IS IT--

414
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,583
IT CAN'T BE.

415
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,250
NO, IT CAN'T BE TRUE.

416
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,750
- TENCHI?
- WHOA.

417
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,416
- CALL RYO-OHKI.
YOU WANT TO GO HOME, DON'T YOU?

418
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,541
- YEAH,
IF YOU RETURN MY HOUSE TOO.

419
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I WON'T BELIEVE IT.

420
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,625
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

421
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,375
- SUIT YOURSELF, BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY.

422
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,375
- AAH!

423
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:25,333
( squealing, meowing )

424
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,625
- DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.
LET'S GO, TENCHI.

425
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,208
THANK YOU, LITTLE GIRL.

426
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:34,083
- BYE BYE, TENCHI.

427
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,208
- DO SOMETHING QUICKLY.
- Kamidake: YES, MA'AM.

428
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,875
- I WILL NEVER
FORGIVE THAT WOMAN.

429
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:43,458
- I'LL MAKE HER FOLLOW US
DOWN TO EARTH.

430
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,458
AS LONG AS SHE'S ALLOWED
TO FLY AROUND UP HERE,

431
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,375
SHE'S ONLY GOING
TO GIVE US TROUBLE.  HA!

432
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,958
- DON'T DO THAT.
YOU'LL HURT HER.

433
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,500
- HEY, WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON ANYWAY?

434
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,666
IF YOU LIKE HER SO MUCH,
GO JOIN HER.

435
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,541
- SHE'S JUST A GIRL!
- SO WHAT?

436
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:12,375
- Azaka: RYO-OHKI'S MASS
IS GROWING ABNORMALLY.

437
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,541
- BUT WHY AREN'T THEY
UNDER OUR CONTROL?

438
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,833
- Kamidake: THEY SEEM TO HAVE
USED THE MASTER KEY.

439
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,916
- OH!

440
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:24,416
ATTACK ATTACK! WHAT ARE
YOU DOING? WE MUST ATTACK!

441
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,041
- Azaka:
DESCENT VELOCITY INCREASING.

442
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:30,041
IF WE WERE TO FALL TO EARTH,
EVEN OUR SPACESHIP, RYO-OHKI,

443
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,166
WOULD NOT ESCAPE
WITHOUT SERIOUS DAMAGE.

444
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,375
- OH, HOW UNREASONABLE
THAT WOMAN IS.

445
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,375
- ( Ryoko laughing )

446
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,291
- RYOKO, STOP THIS IMMEDIATELY!

447
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:46,083
EVEN YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO ESCAPE
UNHARMED FROM THIS, RYOKO!

448
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,916
SAY SOMETHING!
- ( laughing )

449
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,875
- STOP THIS IMMEDIATELY!
I KNOW YOU HEAR ME.

450
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,625
- Kamidake: 20 SECONDS
TO EARTH'S SURFACE.

451
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:01,083
- AAH!

452
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,000
- ( Ryoko laughing )

453
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,458
- RYOKO, STOP, PLEASE!

454
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,666
EXPLODE EXTERIOR WALL UNIT!

455
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,291
- HUH?

456
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,458
- Tenchi and Ayeka: AAH!
- ( Ryoko laughing )

457
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,791
- OOH!

458
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,208
- News Anchor:
OUR TOP STORY THIS MORNING--

459
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:38,250
AROUND 4:00 A.M., AN OBJECT
THOUGHT TO BE A METEOR

460
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,750
FELL ON THE GREAT SATO BRIDGE,

461
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,083
COMPLETELY DESTROYING
THE BRIDGE ON IMPACT.

462
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,083
AS A RESULT, JAPAN RAIL HAS
BEEN UNABLE TO OPERATE

463
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,708
THIS MORNING, WITH NO WORD YET

464
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:48,958
AS TO WHEN SERVICE
WILL BE RESTORED.

465
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,583
- ( murmuring )

466
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:53,083
- OTHER DAMAGE IS CURRENTLY
UNDER INVESTIGATION...

467
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:57,958
- WOW, TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S A MAJOR STORY.

468
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,833
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG? YOU DON'T
LOOK WELL AT ALL, TENCHI.

469
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,625
- ( mumbles )
- CHEER UP!

470
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,208
WE GOT BACK SAFELY, DIDN'T WE?

471
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,416
YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR THAT.
- RIGHT.

472
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,041
- OF COURSE, NOW OUR
HOUSE IS RIGHT BY

473
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,416
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S SHRINE.

474
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,541
BUT I SURE THINK THAT'S KIND
OF CONVENIENT IN A WAY.

475
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,250
DON'T YOU THINK SO, TENCHI?

476
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,083
- EAT THIS TOO.
IT'S GOOD.

477
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,916
IT'LL MAKE YOU BIG AND STRONG.
- HMM?

478
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,333
- YOU'RE LUCKY--
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A SCRATCH

479
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,333
AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER.

480
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,291
YOU REALLY OUGHT
TO BE THANKING ME.

481
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,833
AFTER ALL, I TOOK CARE OF YOU
AND PROTECTED YOU

482
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,791
AT MY OWN PERSONAL RISK.

483
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:32,500
- BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY OF THE
CRASH WAS ABSORBED BY OUR SHIP!

484
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,875
YOU SEE,
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE OKAY.

485
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:37,000
- SO THAT'S WHY
OUR LANDING POINT WAS OFF?

486
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,958
UGH!  I ALMOST LANDED
BACK IN THAT DAMN CAVE.

487
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,750
- I THOUGHT THERE WAS
ANOTHER YOUNG LADY WITH YOU.

488
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,416
WHERE DID SHE GO?

489
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,041
- SHE'S OVER THERE.

490
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:51,000
- ( grunting )

491
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,500
OH, NOW WHAT?

492
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,666
SASAMI!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

493
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,666
COME AND HELP ME
SAVE RYU-OH, MY SHIP!

494
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,833
- BUT IT'S TOO BIG
FOR US TO HANDLE.

495
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,708
WE'LL NEVER
GET IT OUT OF THERE.

496
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,916
- OH!

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,208
I CAN'T GET STRANDED
ON A REMOTE PLANET LIKE THIS.

498
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,208
I SIMPLY CAN'T.
I HAVE TO SAVE MY SHIP.

499
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,666
MY RYU-OH--

500
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,625
OH!
