1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,739
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] DUNGEONS
ARE PLACES SUCH AS ABANDONED
STRUCTURES,

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,508
FORTRESSES, SHRINES, OR CAVES.

3
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,776
WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS
THEY'RE ENCLOSED AREAS

4
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,613
WHERE IT'S EASY FOR MONSTERS
TO GET THE DROP ON YOU.

5
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,616
A LOT OF DUNGEONS ARE HOME
TO LOW‐LEVEL MONSTERS.

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,851
HOWEVER, WHAT SEEMS LIKE
A LACK OF MONSTERS

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,219
CAN MEAN SOMETHING HUGE,

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,655
LIKE A DRAGON IS GUARDING
A TREASURE THERE.

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,391
BIG DRAGON, ENCLOSED SPACE...
NOT GOOD FOR ADVENTURERS.

10
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:27,694
AND IT'S A WHOLE LOT HARDER
THAN FIGHTING ONE IN THE OPEN.

11
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,630
YOUR TEAMWORK HAS
TO BE IMPECCABLE

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,699
OR YOU WON'T LAST LONG.

13
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:11,264
(SLOW WALTZ)

14
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,299
[SHIROE] I KNOW THIS MUSIC.

15
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,369
HM.

16
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,241
[SHIROE, THINKING] IT'S KIND
OF STRANGE, BUT THIS IS THE
OPENING THEME TO "ELDER TALES."

17
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,077
[SERJIAD] ONCE YOUNG LADIES
IN EASTAL COME OF AGE,

18
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,180
THEY MAKE THEIR SOCIAL
DEBUT AT A FORMAL BALL.

19
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,250
THE 10‐DAY CONFERENCE
BEGINNING TOMORROW ALSO HOLDS

20
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,154
A SIMILAR PROMISE FOR
US TO GET ACQUAINTED.

21
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,696
(SLOW WALTZ CONTINUES)

22
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,799
[SERJIAD] SO WHY DON'T
YOU JOIN THE DANCE?

23
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,333
[SHIROE] EHH?
[MICHITAKA] HUH?

24
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,803
HA HA! TAKE A
LOOK OUT THERE.

25
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:54,708
THEY'RE ALL FASCINATED
WITH YOU. HOW ABOUT IT?

26
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,611
AH. WHAT ABOUT YOU, MISS?

27
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,880
YOUR GRACE, I AM
MY LORD'S NINJA.

28
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,383
I CANNOT BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING
LIKE THAT IN PUBLIC. AAH!

29
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,385
(SHIROE CHUCKLES WEAKLY)

30
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,087
THEN HOW ABOUT YOU?

31
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,624
[MICHITAKA] NO, NO.
I'M MORE OF A ROUGHNECK
THAN SOME DANCER GUY.

32
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,159
[SHIROE] YOU KNOW, I‐I THINK
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE IS‐

33
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,260
YOU. AM I RIGHT?

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,562
[SHIROE] UH!

35
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,064
[KRUSTY] SINCE I REPRESENT
THE ROUND TABLE,

36
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,401
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE
THAT I SHOULD TALK MORE
WITH HIS LORDSHIP.

37
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,369
[SHIROE, WHISPERING]
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,371
(KRUSTY CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

39

[SHIROE, THINKING] YOU'RE
ENJOYING THIS, AREN'T YOU?

40
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,412
MIGHT AS WELL EMBARRASS
MYSELF AND GET IT OVER WITH.

41
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,717
[HENRIETTA] SHIROE...
[SHIROE] HUH?

42
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,020
A GENTLEMAN MUST NEVER ALLOW
HIS LACK OF CONFIDENCE TO SHOW.

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,090
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE A MEMBER OF
THE ROUND TABLE'S DELEGATION.

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,627
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

45
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,696
OK. SINCE YOU'RE BEING
SUCH A GOOD BOY,

46
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,599
I'LL SHARE A LITTLE
MAGIC GIFT WITH YOU.

[SHIROE] EH, HENRIETTA?

49
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,176
SHIROE, TRY TO SMILE.

50
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,446
AND STAND UP
STRAIGHT FOR ME, OK?

51
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,586
PUT YOUR HAND ON MY HIP.

52
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,722
YOU DO KNOW I CAN'T
DANCE, RIGHT?

53
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,924
THIS IS BOUND TO GET
REALLY EMBARRASSING.

54
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,862
YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT MY
CLASS IS, AREN'T YOU, SHIROE?

55
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,730
WHAT YOUR CLASS IS?

56
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,367
[HENRIETTA] I AM A BARD.
JUST LET ME LEAD YOU.

57
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,604
NOW, THEN LET'S DANCE.

[ISUZU] HMM? HEE HEE!

62
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,326

ABSOLUTELY ELEGANT.

A BARD, MASTER?

WEAPON‐BASED OFFENSIVE CLASSES.

67
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,707
BUT UNLIKE THE ASSASSIN
OR SWASHBUCKLER,

68
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,810
THEY PLAY A SUPPORT ROLE
IN MOST PARTIES, HMM.

69
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,411
A SUPPORT ROLE?

70
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,914

77
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,261
[NAOTSUGU] THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BARDS AND ENCHANTERS

78
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,730
IS THAT THEY USE MUSIC.

79
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,865
[NYANTA] ONE OTHER TRAIT THAT
DISTINGUISHES A BARD IS

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,131
[SHIROE] WHAT?
[AKATSUKI] JAM.

149
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,434
[SHIROE] UH...
[AKATSUKI] PASS ME THE JAM.

150
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,870
[SHIROE] OH, YEAH. SURE THING.

151
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,105
(KAYU SLURPS)

152
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,815
[SHIROE] BY THE WAY,
MICHITAKA,

153
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,085
YOU'D KNOW THIS BETTER
THAN I WOULD, BUT DID
WE BRING ANY CHEFS?

154
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,554
HMM, WE
BROUGHT A FEW.

155
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,456
WE MIGHT NEED TO CALL FOR
MORE PEOPLE FROM THE CITY.

156
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,691
DEFINITELY.

157
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,059
WHAT DO WE
NEED THEM FOR?

158
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,728
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT
THE SIZE OF THIS TERRACE.

159
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,964
THEY ARE EXPECTING A
LOT MORE COMPANY.

160
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,602
HMM? WHAT COMPANY?
WAIT. NOBLEMEN?

161
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,604
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE CONFERENCE LASTS
FOR 10 DAYS.

162
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,940
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S
WALL‐TO‐WALL EVENTS
GOING ON EVERY DAY.

163
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,744
THE MAJORITY IS BACKROOM
DEALS AND PRIVATE MEETINGS,

164
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,780
LIKE A BUNCH OF
LITTLE TEA PARTIES.

165
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,615
THE POLITICS HERE
ARE A LITTLE TOUGH

166
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,149
FOR ME TO GET MY HEAD AROUND.

167
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,620
HOWEVER, I HEARD THAT
THERE'S 24 NOBLE HOUSES

168
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,755
IN EASTAL'S LEAGUE
OF FREEDOM CITIES.

169
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,791
ADD THE ROUND TABLE,
AND THAT'S 25.

170
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:56,029
LORD SERJIAD'S CITY OF
MAIHAMA HAS A POPULATION
OF 30,000 OR SO.

171
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,132
[TAKAYAMA] SO IN
TERMS OF PURE NUMBERS,
A CITY LIKE AKIHABARA

172
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,268
IS KIND OF SMALL WHEN YOU
CONSIDER WE ONLY HAVE 20,000.

173
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,772
[SHIROE] I ALREADY HAVE AN
IDEA OF WHAT THE NOBLES
WANT TO FIND OUT.

174
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,073
FIRST AND FOREMOST,

175
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,242
FIND OUT WHAT AMBITIONS
THE ADVENTURERS HAVE

176
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,178
AND THE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS
OF THE ROUND TABLE.

177
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,647
BUT LAST NIGHT AT THE BALL,

178
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,950
IT'S LIKELY THAT WE DISPELLED
SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS.

179
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,653
[KRUSTY] OK, THEN. SO THEIR NEXT
PLAY IS GOING TO BE GETTING US

180
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,021
TO WORK FOR THEM.

181
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,156
[SHIROE] RIGHT. REMEMBER,
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE,

182
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,359
WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED A
SINGLE QUEST FROM THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

183
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,427
(CLOCK GONGS)

184
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:28,929
[KILIVA] THE MAY INCIDENT

185
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,064
IS CERTAINLY THE CAUSE
OF ALL THIS TROUBLE.

186
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,200
THE ADVENTURERS SUPPOSEDLY REFER
TO IT AS "THE APOCALYPSE."

187
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,738
UNTIL NOW, THE ADVENTURERS OF
AKIHABARA WERE PRETTY FRAGMENTED

188
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,073
AND DISORGANIZED.
WHICH, OF COURSE,

189
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,142
MADE THOSE INGRATES MUCH
MORE EASY TO DEAL WITH.

190
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,077
[DALTE] THEY WERE
ALWAYS QUITE USEFUL

191
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,412
IN EXTERMINATING MONSTERS
AND GUARDING CARAVANS.

192
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,748
AS LONG AS YOU PAID THEM,

193
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,850
THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH
WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

194
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,785
BUT EVER SINCE THIS
APOCALYPSE OF THEIRS,

195
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,554
THEY HAVE HARDLY VENTURED
OUTSIDE OF THEIR CITY

196
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,988
TO HELP US AT ALL.
(CLOCK GONGS)

197
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,090
AND NOW THEY'VE FOUNDED
THAT ROUND TABLE.

198
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,193
I GUESS THEY'RE MAKING
AN ATTEMPT TO RULE THEIR
CITY JUST LIKE WE DO.

199
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,528
(CLOCK GONGS)

200
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,329
I'VE HEARD THEY'RE
DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY

201
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,898
AT A RAPID PACE.

202
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,100
WE HAVE TO GET THEIR BRIGHTEST
MINDS WORKING FOR US QUICKLY.

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,870
OTHERWISE, WE'RE GOING TO
WIND UP HAVING THE WHOLE LOT

204
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,972
OF THEM LEAVE US BEHIND!

205
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,741
[SHIROE] WHAT THEY'LL NEED IS
OUR POWER AND ABILITIES.

206
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,611
BUT THEY'LL NEVER ACT LIKE
WE'RE SUPERIOR TO THEM AT ALL.

207
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,781
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THEY MIGHT
GRANT A NOBLE TITLE TO KRUSTY

208
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,415
OR TO THE ROUND
TABLE AS AN ENTITY.

209
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,819
THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA TRY
TO MAKE US BEHOLDEN TO THEM.

210
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,688
THE PROBLEM IS HOW
TO DEAL WITH THEM

211
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,422
WHEN THEY COME TO
US INDIVIDUALLY

212
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,024
RATHER THAN THROUGH
THE ROUND TABLE.

213
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,226
THAT'LL BE KIND
OF TOUGH.

214
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,128
[SHIROE] CHANCES ARE GOOD THAT
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE THE GAME

215
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,231
WHERE NOBLES GO TO THE
GUILDS OR INDIVIDUALS
TO DO THEIR BIDDING.

216
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,966
I'M SURE THE WARRIOR AND
CRAFTING GUILDS WILL WANT

217
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,902
WHATEVER THE NOBLES OFFER THEM,
JUST LIKE THE GAME.

218
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,004
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

219
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,472
[MICHITAKA] POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS
WON'T SAY NO EITHER.

220
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,441
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR
THE ROUND TABLE

221
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,711
TO MONITOR EVERYONE
ALL THE TIME,

222
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,445
NOR IS IT OUR PURPOSE
TO BEGIN WITH.

223
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,149
MAYBE, BUT WE PROBABLY
STILL NEED TO LAY DOWN
SOME GUIDELINES.

224
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,018
[SHIROE] AND THAT'S ONE
REASON IT'S SO IMPORTANT

225
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,886
FOR US TO KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE THINKING.

226
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,456
SO IT'S YOUR TURN,
AKATSUKI. YOU'RE UP.
[AKATSUKI] HUH?

227
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,958
[SHIROE]
RECONNAISSANCE, PLEASE.

228
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,027
[AKATSUKI] HM. I'M ON MY WAY.

229
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,897
(GRUNTING)

230
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,232
[RUNDELLHAUS] HUH?

231
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:16,336
[NYANTA] WELCOME TO THE
FOREST OF LAGLANDA.

232
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,014
[NYANTA] IT'S RATHER
EXPANSIVE INSIDE,

233
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,851
BUT BASICALLY AT THE
FIRST FORK IN THE PATH,

234
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,086
THE RIGHT SIDE LEADS
TO THE BEGINNER COURSE.

235
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,422
THE LEFT IS FOR
INTERMEDIATE PLAYERS.

236
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,724
HMM.

237
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,425
DON'T PUSH YOURSELVES TOO HARD.

238
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,095
TRAINING INVOLVES KNOWING
YOUR CURRENT LIMITS

239
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,530
AND WORKING WITH THEM, HMM?

240
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,366
[NAOTSUGU] THAT'S RIGHT.
DON'T GET YOURSELVES KILLED.

241
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,634
[REZARICK] LISTEN UP, GUYS.

242
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:48,969
YOU'LL ALL BE CAMPING
IN THE CLEARING HERE

243
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,971
AND GOING INTO THE
DUNGEON EVERY DAY.

244
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,508
I'LL BE HERE TO GIVE YOU FURTHER
TRAINING AFTER YOU GET OUT.

245
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,009
(CLAPS HANDS)

246
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,078
ALL RIGHT! LET'S SPLIT UP
INTO OUR COMBAT TEAMS, PEOPLE.

247
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,746
PICK WHO YOU WANT
TO ADVENTURE WITH

248
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,314
AND HOLD YOUR STRATEGY MEETINGS.

249
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,716
THEN HIT THE DUNGEON!

250
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,417
[YOUNG PLAYERS] YES, SIR!

251
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,821
[TOYA] OK, EVERYBODY,
WHY DON'T WE START
BY INTRODUCING OURSELVES?

252
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,858
I'M TOYA. I'M A SAMURAI,
AND I'M LEVEL 29.

00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,595
LET ME HANDLE
THE FRONT LINES, OK?

254
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,096
I'M SERARA.

255
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,998
I'M A DRUID AND A HEALER.

256
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,633
AND I'M AT LEVEL 25.

257
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:23,804
I'M NOT GOOD AT ATTACKING STUFF,
BUT LEAVE THE HEALING TO ME!

258
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,472
I'M ISUZU,
AND I'M A BARD CLASS.

259
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,975
I'LL BE HELPING WHEN IT'S
TIME TO ATTACK SOMETHING.

260
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,178
I'M AT LEVEL 24.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,981
I'M MINORI.
I AM A SHRINE MAIDEN.

262

AND MY SPECIALTY IS
CASTING DEFENSIVE MAGIC.

263
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,353
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH SERARA

264
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,189
TO KEEP ALL OF YOU HEALTHY
AND OUT OF THE CATHEDRAL.

265
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,526
I'M AT LEVEL...
(MOANS SOFTLY)

266

...AT LEVEL 21.

YOU'RE LEVEL 21? HMPH!

268
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,798
DO ME A FAVOR AND
DON'T SLOW ME DOWN.

269
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,399
HMPH. WHO ARE YOU?

270
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,871
MM‐HMM. I AM NONE OTHER THAN
THE MIGHTY RUNDELLHAUS CODE.

271
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,172
BUT IF YOU FIND
YOURSELF IN A HURRY,

272
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,473
YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL ME RUDY.

273
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:01,808
[TOYA] WHAT'S
YOUR CLASS?

274
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,409
[RUDY] ISN'T MY APPAREL
AND APPEARANCE

275
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,811
THE DEAD GIVEAWAY?

276
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,279
I'M A SORCERER, OF COURSE.

277
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,249
YOU SURE TALK A LOT, DON'T YOU?
WHAT'S YOUR LEVEL?

278
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,851
(RUDY CHUCKLES)

279
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,285
23, MY FRIENDS.

280
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,921
[TOYA] SO WHY ARE YOU GIVING
MY SISTER A HARD TIME?!

281
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,189
THERE'S NO NEED TO FEAR.

282
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,024
MY GRACEFUL YET
DEVASTATING TECHNIQUE

283
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,026
WILL ANNIHILATE
OUR ENEMY.

284
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,128
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STAND
BACK AND SUPPORT ME, OK?

285
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,297
[TOYA] SORCERERS DON'T
FIGHT UP FRONT, STUPID!

286
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,167
[RUDY] TRY NOT TO GET
CAUGHT UP IN THE SEMANTICS.

287
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,902
HA HA!

288
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,171
[SERARA] UM, HEY.
SO IF IT'S OK,

289
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,139
WHY DON'T WE WORK ON
OUR STRATEGY?

290
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,408
[TOYA] WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING ANYWAY?

291
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,811
[ISUZU] YEAH. I REALLY
DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA.

292
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,445
[MINORI] HEY, GUYS, I KNOW.

293
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,147
MAYBE WE SHOULD START
WITH OUR BASIC FORMATION

294
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,549
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT‐

[RUDY]
THERE'S NOTHING TO IT!

296
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,387
WE JUST NEED TO GET FIRED UP
AND READY FOR COMBAT!

297
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,022
I DON'T KNOW...

THAT'S RIGHT, BABY!

299

I'M ABOUT TO KICK
SOME MONSTER BUTT!

[MINORI] MAYBE NOT.

301
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,364
LET'S TAKE THAT DUNGEON!
THAT'S RIGHT! WHO'S THE MAN?!

302
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:02,335
YES, BUT ALSO REMEMBER TO
BE ELEGANT IN ALL THINGS.

303
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,772
BUT A MAN MUST BE CRANKED UP
AND RAGING TO WIN THE DAY!

304
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,709
COME ON, NOW!
LET'S DO THIS! WHOO!

WHY ARE BOYS SUCH BOYS?

308

RIGHT. LET'S GO.
(SERARA WHIMPERS)

[NAOTSUGU] TOYA, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU PROMISED ME?

310
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:25,992
[TOYA] SENSEI?

311
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,762
[NAOTSUGU] THE JOB OF
A FRONT‐LINE TANK IS

312
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,430
TO ABSORB ALL THE ENEMY HITS

313
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,533
AND TO ALWAYS TRUST THE
REST OF HIS GROUP.

314
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:36,970
TOYA, AS A MAN, YOU MUST
PROMISE TO BE AWESOME.

315
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,772
I REMEMBER, SENSEI.

316
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,807

WHAT'S WRONG, HMM?

00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,815
OH, I, UH, IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

320
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,884
LISTEN, IF YOU EVER
HAVE A PROBLEM,

321
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,285
YOU MUST STEP FORWARD.

322
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,956
BUT NOT WITH YOUR LEGS;
WITH YOUR HEART.

323
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,626
WITH MY HEART? RIGHT!

[TOYA] WHAT'S GOING ON?
[RUDY] MONSTERS NOW?

328
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,312
[MINORI] CALM DOWN, DANG IT!
WE NEED SOME LIGHT FIRST!

329
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,583
[RUDY] YOUR WISH
IS MY COMMAND.

330
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:25,451
[ISUZU] I HOPE THE ENEMY
DOESN'T USE THAT AS A BEACON.

331
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,088
[RUDY] WELL, I'M HOPING
THEY'LL DO EXACTLY THAT!

332
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,656
ARE YOU KIDDING?

333
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,593
[MINORI] MOST OF THE ENEMIES
HERE ARE OF THE UNDEAD VARIETY.

334
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,027
[SERARA] THAT'S RIGHT.

335
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,428
THE UNDEAD CAN SEE
US IN THE DARK.

336
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,297
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF WE HAVE LIGHT.

337
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,466
BUT WE'RE NOT BETTER OFF
FUMBLING AROUND WITHOUT IT.

LOOK AT THAT!

[SERARA] THIS ISN'T A
COMPETITION, YOU SHOWOFF!

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR
LIGHT GOES OUT, HUH?!

343
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,279
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE MORE THAN ONE!

344
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,283
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING
MY LIGHT WAS WEAK OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

345
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,687
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
'CAUSE I'M AWESOME! HA HA!

[ISUZU] UH, NOT GOOD.

348
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,699
[MINORI] IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF
THE GROUPS THAT WENT BEFORE US

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,868

RIGHT FOR BEGINNERS

00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,676
AND THE LEFT FOR
INTERMEDIATE PLAYERS?

354
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:26,379
[TOYA] LOOKS LIKE THE GROUP
AHEAD OF US WENT LEFT.

355
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,682
LET'S GO THIS WAY. COME ON.

356
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,283

JUST DON'T THINK I'M GONNA TAKE
THE EASY PATH EVERY TIME, OK?

358
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,793
HOLD UP. HEY, RUNDELLHAUS?

359
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,996
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CAST
YOUR MAGIC FROM THE BACK.

ABOUT, MISS MINORI?

THE ENEMY IS IN SIGHT.

362
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,504
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO WASTE
WAITING ON EVERYONE ELSE

00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:53,774
WHILE I CAN CAST MY SPELLS
FROM THE FRONT OF OUR FORMATION.

I GUESS I'LL JUST HELP HIM
IF HE GETS INTO TROUBLE.

366
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,317
I CAN'T HEAL AS WELL AS SERARA,
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BOTH HEALERS.

367
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,554
BUT MY MAGIC CAN CANCEL A

ITS POWERFUL ATTACKS,

BUT THEY HAVE A LONG
COOL DOWN PERIOD.

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,730
TIMING THEIR ATTACK IS
THE TRICKY PART.

00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,959
ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO.

449
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,298
[TOYA] RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

450
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,933
[RUDY] HUH?

451
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:46,673
[RUDY] THIS IS SO LAME!
I MEAN, THIS IS SO NOT AWESOME!

452
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,715
[RAYNESHIA] (SIGH)

453
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,483
[KILIVA] I MUST SAY, YOUR
ARMY'S EXTREMELY FORTUNATE

454
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,285
TO HAVE A COMMANDER
LIKE YOU AT THE HELM.

455
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,854
YOUR STRENGTH IS AMAZING.

456
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:03,156
IT RIVALS THAT OF
THE EASTERN KNIGHTS.

457
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,091
[KRUSTY] THAT'S AWFULLY
FLATTERING OF YOU.

458
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:06,492
[KILIVA] SO HOW ABOUT IT?

459
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,994
I BROUGHT SOME FINE
SPIRITS FROM MY HOMELAND.

460
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:11,965
THE SUN'S SETTING. WHY DON'T
YOU JOIN ME FOR A DRINK?

461
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:12,999
[KRUSTY] HUH?

462
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,569
AH. HM.

463
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,271
HMM...

464
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,641
[KRUSTY] I'M SORRY, LORD KILIVA,

465
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,643
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER
PLANS FOR TONIGHT.

466
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:25,311
[KILIVA] HUH? YOU HAVE
ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT?

467
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,815
OH, PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.
I UNDERSTAND.

468
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:32,485
WELL, THERE'S NO WAY
I'D INTERFERE WITH THAT.

469
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:39,092
[KRUSTY] PLEASED TO
MEET YOU, MILADY.

470
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,495
I'M THE ADVENTURER
THEY CALL KRUSTY.

471
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,565
UH...

472
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,891
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
THE WINTER ROSE OF EASTAL.

473
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:20,894
LONG, SILVERY HAIR, A DELICATE
CURVE TO HER NECK,

474
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:23,597
AND A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT IN
HER BLUE‐GRAY EYES.

475
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:26,833
HER NAME IS
RAYNESHIA EL‐ARTE COWEN.

476
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:31,237
AND SHE DREAMS OF LYING IN A
BED ALL DAY IN HER PAJAMAS.

477
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:35,241
[SHIROE] ALWAYS LOOK
30 SECONDS AHEAD.
