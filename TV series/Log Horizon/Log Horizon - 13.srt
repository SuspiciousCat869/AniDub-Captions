[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
IN OUR NEW WORLD,

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,107
IN ADDITION TO ADVENTURERS
AND PEOPLE OF THE LAND,

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,943
THERE ARE ALSO GROUPS
CALLED DEMI‐HUMANS.

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,545
FOR EXAMPLE, THE GOBLINS.

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:15,481
THEY HAVE LIMITED INTELLIGENCE
BUT ARE HARDY AND BREED QUICKLY.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,684
AND ABOVE ALL,
THEY'RE CRUEL AND WICKED.

7
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,620
(GOBLIN HISSES)

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,525
AN INDIVIDUAL GOBLIN IS NO MATCH
FOR AN ADVENTURER OF EVEN
INTERMEDIATE STRENGTH.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:28,829
HOWEVER, THEIR NUMBERS
AND VARIETY SHOULD NOT
BE UNDERESTIMATED.

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:33,667
YOU CAN FIND MOST GOBLINS
IN THE NORTHEAST PART
OF THE ISLAND CHAIN.

11
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,266
[SHIROE] OBVIOUSLY,
SOME OF THESE CONFLICT.

12
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,301
AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
REALLY BAD FORM ON OUR PART

13
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,604
IF WE SHOW UP AT
ONLY ONE OF THESE.

14
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,706
[KRUSTY] THERE'S THE
BANQUET WITH LORD DALTE,

15
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,709
THE EVENING PARTY WITH MOSTLY
YOUNG KNIGHTS ATTENDING,

16
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,679
AND A DINNER MEETING WITH
COUNT KIRINO OF TSUKUBA

17
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,581
AND THE ACADEMICS GUILD.

18
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,984
YEAH, I'D BE OUT OF MY LEAGUE
WITH THAT ACADEMICS GUILD.

19
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,318
[KRUSTY] SAME HERE.

20
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,721
ACADEMICS. MY KIND OF PEOPLE.

21
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,659
AND SO, WHY DON'T YOU
GO SEE THE KNIGHTS, KRUSTY?

22
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,395
I'M SURE THE DANCE
WILL AGREE WITH YOU.

23
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,567
[KRUSTY] THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA, ACTUALLY.

24
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,770
RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE I'LL TAKE
THE BANQUET WITH LORD DALTE.

25
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,606
(AKATSUKI GROWLING)
[HENRIETTA] YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK, KRUSTY?

26
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,141
YOU DO REALIZE THAT YOU'LL BE
SPENDING MOST OF YOUR TIME

27
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,078
FLATTERING LORDS
AND NOBLE LADIES?

28
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,315
[KRUSTY] LATELY, I FOUND A
SHIELD FOR ALL MY SHORTCOMINGS
THAT'S SO EFFECTIVE,

29
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,084
IT'S NEARLY UNBREAKABLE.

30
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,554
I'LL BE BETTER
THAN OK, THANK YOU.

31
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,756
[ALL] A SHIELD?

32
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,898

(DOOR OPENS)

34

UH, NO, ELISSA.

37
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,409
I'M NOT WEARING
THOSE SILK PAJAMAS.

38
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,311
THOSE PAJAMAS ARE EVIL.

39
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,514
ARE YOU REALLY GOING
TO DO THIS AGAIN?

40
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,181
[ELISSA] YOUR FLANNELS, MILADY.

41
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,783
(RAYNESHIA SQUEALS)

42
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,020
THESE ARE PERFECT, AND I KNEW
YOU WERE GONNA BRING THEM!

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,555
THANK YOU!

44
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,524
[ELISSA] YOU NEED TO WEAR THE
SILK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

45
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,325
I'M THE ONE WHO'S
GETTING YELLED AT.

46
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,227

EVENTUALLY.

00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,430
YOU DO KNOW THAT ALL THE
GENTLEMEN IN MAIHAMA

49
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,800
REFER TO YOU AS THE MELANCHOLY
TWILIGHT PRINCESS?

50
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,270
WELL, A REAL GENTLEMAN WOULDN'T
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER
PLANS FOR TONIGHT.

HAVE ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT?

[RAYNESHIA] OK. SO WHAT DID
YOU MEAN BY "YOUR PLANS"?

63
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,808
[KRUSTY] THAT WAS TO
GET RID OF MY SHADOW.

64

I'M SORRY IF IT CAUSED YOU
ANY DISTRESS, OF COURSE.

HE'S NOT A BAD GUY, PER SE,
BUT HE IS ANNOYING.

HOW ANNOYING I AM, RIGHT?

"HE'S GONNA BOTHER ME,
ISN'T HE?"

[KRUSTY] CARE TO
JOIN ME FOR TEA?

[KRUSTY] IF THE TWO OF US
WERE TO TAKE TEA TOGETHER,

82
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,490
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY PROVIDE
BOTH OF US AN EXCUSE

TO SKIP SOME OF THE EVENTS
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PLANNED.

AROUND HIM, PRINCESS.

TELL EXACTLY WHAT I'M THINKING.

WHAT THEY'RE LIKE.

WANT TO REMIND YOU OF THIS,

SINCE IT'S SUCH
A BOTHER FOR YOU,

95

YOUR POSITION AS A MEMBER OF

HIT THAT HARD BEFORE
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

119
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,354
I'D BE HONORED TO BE YOUR

WHAT IS, MILADY?

125
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,568
WOULDN'T AN ADVENTURER
LIKE YOU FIND SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TEDIOUS?

126
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,302
[KRUSTY] NOT AT ALL.
[RAYNESHIA] UH...

127
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,872
[KRUSTY] I'D REALLY LIKE
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND,

128
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,474
AND THIS IS A
GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

(CHEERING)

THAT'S A LIE.

SKILLED OUR FIGHTERS ARE.

00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,688
[SCHOLAR] OOH, THAT'S
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.

135
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,723
(KNIGHT LAUGHS)
[RAYNESHIA] SO, AS AN
ADVENTURER,

136
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,759
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
YOUR SPARRING MATCHES?

137
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,427
IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM
COULD BE STRONGER THAN YOU.

138
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,565
[KRUSTY] NO, THEY WERE
ALL VERY TALENTED.

139
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,233
THAT LAST FIGHT
WAS RATHER CLOSE.

140
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,135
I SEE.

141
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:54,340
[KRUSTY] SO IT WOULDN'T BE
EASY TO FIGHT YOUR WAY UP
AND EARN FIRST RANK HERE.

142
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,276
HMM.

143
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,544

144
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,679
[KNIGHTS] HUH?

145
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,113
[RAYNESHIA] HUH? UH, YES?

146
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,315
[KRUSTY] IF IT PLEASES YOU,
WOULD YOU OFFER A REWARD

147
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:07,153
TO THE STRONGEST OF THESE
BRAVE KNIGHTS WHO ARE FIGHTING
FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT TODAY?

148
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,555
[RAYNESHIA] A REWARD?

149
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,591
A SIMPLE REWARD...

150
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,294
THE RIGHT TO ACCOMPANY

BEYOND WHERE THEY ARE?!

HAS HAD ON PRODUCTIVITY ALONE
IS POSITIVELY AMAZING.

302
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,323
AH.

303
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,459
[DALTE] EVERYTHING FROM
THE AMOUNT OF CARE WE TAKE
ON THE FARMS HARVESTING

304
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,230
AND TRANSPORTING PRODUCE AND
MEATS TO MARKET HAS CHANGED.

305
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,698
[MICHITAKA] THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

306
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,835
[DALTE] WE DO STILL HAVE
ONE NAGGING PROBLEM, HOWEVER.

307
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,570
OH, YEAH?

308
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,540
[DALTE] RAISING THIS NEW
TASTY FOOD AND SHARING
IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY

309
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,977
TO AS MANY MARKETS AS WE CAN
DELIGHTS A GREAT MANY PEOPLE.

310
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:49,282
AND OF COURSE, THIS HAS
BENEFITED OUR DOMAIN IN THE
FORM OF AMAZING NEW PROFITS.

311
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,953
HOWEVER, TRANSPORTING IT OVER
THE LAND TENDS TO INVITE...

312
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,355
[MICHITAKA] ...MONSTERS, RIGHT?

313
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,490
[DALTE] INDEED...

314
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:01,394
AND SO I HAVE A REQUEST,
GUILD MASTER MICHITAKA.

315
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,764
YOU WANT US TO FIGHT
OFF SOME GOBLINS.

316
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:08,001
NOT EXACTLY. WE HAD
SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS
VIOLENT TO ASK OF YOU.

317
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,369
[MICHITAKA] HMM?

318
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:14,107
HMM. WE'RE SEEKING MARITIME
TRANSPORT KNOW‐HOW.

319
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:18,044
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

320
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,486
[LORD] PRINCESS RAYNESHIA'S
SAD EXPRESSION...

321
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:28,889
SHE MUST BE TROUBLED BY
THE WORLD'S FUTURE.

322
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,256
I FEEL FOR HER.

323
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,159
[KRUSTY] I KNOW IT'S
A BOTHER TO YOU...

324
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,396
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO SMILE
AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT.

325
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,000
I KNOW IT HAS TO BE ANNOYING
TO YOU, ALL THAT FLATTERY.

326
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,504
I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A
LITTLE WHILE, AND I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT'S LIKE.

327
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,139
[RAYNESHIA] I‐I REALLY
DON'T THINK YOU DO. HMM.

328
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,075
[KRUSTY] OH...HUH.

329
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,211
[GIRL 1] PRINCESS RAYNESHIA?

330
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,946
I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

331
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,415
IT MUST SEEM AWFULLY
FORWARD OF US.

332
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,218
[GIRL 2] MAY WE JOIN YOU?
WE'D LOVE TO CHAT.

333
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,722
[GIRL 1] WE BROUGHT COOKIES!

334
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:05,659
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
THESE GIRLS ARE NICE ENOUGH
AND ALL, BUT... UGH.

335
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,327
WE SAW YOU
FIGHT OUT THERE.

336
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,930
WHAT YOU DID WITH YOUR
SWORD WAS REALLY AMAZING.

337
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,632
YOU'RE REALLY STRONG,
AREN'T YOU?

338
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,000
[KRUSTY] NO. I STILL
HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.

339
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,468
OH, DON'T
BE SO MODEST.

340
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,538
YOU WERE SO GOOD,
YOU TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

341
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:21,542
[KRUSTY] I'M UNWORTHY OF PRAISE
FROM LADIES AS LOVELY AS YOU.

342
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,176
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

343
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,811
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] GREAT.

344
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,949
WHY IS HE SO POLITE AND FUN WITH
THEM AND A COMPLETE SNOT TO ME?

345
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,684
KRUSTY, YOU'RE
JUST SO AWESOME!

346
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:34,755
OF ALL THE ADVENTURERS,
YOU'RE THE MOST COOL,
NOBLE, AND HANDSOME!

347
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:39,225
YEAH. EVERYBODY'S
BEEN TALKING
ABOUT YOU, KRUSTY.

348
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,862
EMBARRASSED AND FLATTERED
AT THE SAME TIME.

349
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:43,329
[GIRL 1] NO, NO.

350
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,232
IT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT YOUR
HANDSOME, DIGNIFIED ELEGANCE

351
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,369
IS WHY THE PRINCESS HAS LETTING
YOU BE AROUND HER TONIGHT.

352
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,471
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA?

353
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,374
[RAYNESHIA] UH, YES, ABSOLUTELY!

354
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,243
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
AND WHAT DID I JUST AGREE TO?

355
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,546
[GIRL 1] PRINCESS RAYNESHIA
IS SO BEAUTIFUL,

356
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,315
IT'S A PRIVILEGE
JUST BEING WITH HER.

357
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,751
[KRUSTY] SHE'S VERY KIND
AND COMPASSIONATE.

358
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:09,790
SHE'D HAVE TO BE TO LET A
BARBARIAN LIKE ME STAY IN
HER COMPANY FOR VERY LONG.

359
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,625
UHH... UHH...

360
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,294
[KRUSTY] ESPECIALLY SINCE
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH
THE MANNERS OF THE COURT.

361
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:20,066
HER KIND SOLICITATIONS ALLOW ME
TO AVOID BEING LOOKED UPON
AS A COMPLETE PHILISTINE.

362
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,369
IT IS AN HONOR OF
WHICH I AM UNWORTHY.

363
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,972
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] AH...

364
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,810
OH, MR. BAD PERSON,
YOU ARE BAD...
THE WORST BAD PERSON EVER!

365
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,780
OH, COME ON! WE'VE
GOT TO INTRODUCE YOU
AROUND TO EVERYBODY!

366
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,482
AND ONCE EVERYONE IN THE
COURT GETS TO KNOW YOU,

367
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,553
I'M SURE THEY WON'T THINK YOU'RE
A PHILA‐WHATCHAMACALLIT.

368
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:43,557
[KRUSTY] NO. I'M A BARBARIAN
WHO KNOWS ONLY WAR.

369
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:47,961
AND UNTIL I CAN REPAY
THE PRINCESS FOR THE
KINDNESS SHE'S SHOWN ME,

370
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,531
I SIMPLY CANNOT LEAVE HER SIDE.

371
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,398
[GIRLS] OHH!

372
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,201
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
YOUR EVIL KNOWS
NO BOUNDS, DOES IT?

373
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,704
[GIRL 1] OH, A KNIGHT
SERVING HIS LADY!

374
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,173
[GIRL 2] IT'S SO SWEET!

375
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,409
[RAYNESHIA] LEAVE IF YOU WANT.

376
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,512
IF THE PRETTY PALACE FLOWERS
HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,

377
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,048
DON'T LET ME STOP YOU
FROM TAKING OFF.

378
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,750
TA.

379
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,285
[KRUSTY] I'M AFRAID I
ALREADY HAVE MY HANDS
FULL WITH ONE FLOWER.

380
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,887
STUFFING HER FACE.

381
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:18,491
OH, RIGHT. I GUESS I DON'T NEED
TO TELL YOU ABOUT GIRLS, DO I?

382
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,360
[KRUSTY] DEPENDS
ON THE GIRL.

383
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,495
[RAYNESHIA] OH... HUH?

384
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,898
[KRUSTY] I HAVE A LITTLE SISTER
BACK WHERE I COME FROM.

385
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,934
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF PRINCESS
IN HER, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

386
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:33,106
[RAYNESHIA] UH, SO YOU'RE
SAYING THAT I'M KIND OF
LIKE YOUR SISTER?

387
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,608
YEAH.

388
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,344
YOU CAN'T SEE HER RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET HOME?

389
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,414
BOTH WOULD DEFINITELY BE
A CHALLENGE FOR ME.

390
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,417
YOU REALLY MISS HER,
THEN, DON'T YOU?

391
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,387
[KRUSTY] I COULDN'T SAY.

392
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,291
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
YOU'RE LYING AGAIN.

393
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,494
[KRUSTY] YOU REMIND ME
OF HER QUITE A BIT...

394
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:57,631
YOU CATCHING A NAP ON A TABLE,
EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T LADY‐LIKE.

395
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,165
UHH...

396
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,135
[KRUSTY] SHE'D LAY AROUND
THE HOUSE ALL DAY IF YOU
DIDN'T GET HER UP,

397
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,904
AND FORGET ANY OF
THOSE FANCY TALKS.

398
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,272
[RAYNESHIA] HEY, YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME!

399
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,908
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY SAY THAT?

400
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:10,310
[KRUSTY] BECAUSE YOU'RE
EXACTLY LIKE SHE IS.
[RAYNESHIA] UHH...

401
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,078
[KRUSTY] IT'S AMAZING, REALLY.

402
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:16,216
BEING AROUND YOU HAS
SOMEHOW MADE THIS WHOLE
AFFAIR A LOT EASIER ON ME.

403
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,718
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

404
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:21,154
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO PAY YOU
BACK DURING THE CONFERENCE?

405

ONE HAND WASHES THE OTHER, HUH?

406

[KRUSTY] TIT FOR TAT.

407
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,664
[RAYNESHIA]
ALL RIGHT. IT'S A DEAL.

408
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,180
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
KISS MY HAND, DUMMY!

WERE YOU THERE?!

416
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,082
NOT LONG. YOU THIRSTY?

00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,623
THE GUYS FROM THE ACADEMIC
GUILD FINALLY LET ME GO.

THEY KEPT PESTERING
ME TO LET THEM DO
RESEARCH ON ADVENTURERS.

421

[AKATSUKI] OK...

THE RIGHT. IT'S CUTE.

424
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,035
[SHIROE] SO, DID YOU
LEARN ANYTHING NEW?

425
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,005
[AKATSUKI] WELL...
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND SEE
US AS POTENTIAL ENEMIES,

426
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:47,508
BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE
PLANNING ANYTHING TO HURT US.

427
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,510
THEY JUST HAVE THEIR WORRIES.

428
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,111
[SHIROE] I GUESS
THAT'S GOOD.

I THINK WHAT FRIGHTENS THEM
THE MOST IS OUR POWER, MY LORD.

430
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:59,786
NEITHER OF US HAS A REAL
GOOD IDEA AS TO WHAT THE
OTHER IS TRULY CAPABLE OF.

431
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:04,558
SO THEY EITHER REALLY LIKE US
OR THEY'RE GONNA KILL US ALL.

432
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:07,160
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?
