DAYS BASED ON THOSE SALES.

292
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,130
AND 4 MONTHS IS
WAY TOO LONG.

293
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,934
[MARIELLE] THAT MIGHT BE,
BUT I KNOW WE, LIKE, TURNED

00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,671
LOOK, I KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

296
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,640
I KNOW OUR POTENTIAL
CUSTOMER BASE.

297
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,977
[SHIROE] THERE ARE OVER 15,000
PLAYERS THAT WOULD EAT A
CRESCENT BURGER EVERY DAY.

298
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:08,348
[HENRIETTA] THE PROBLEM IS
NO MATTER HOW HIGH THE
DEMAND HAPPENS TO GROW,

299
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:12,819
WE CAN ONLY FEASIBLY SERVE
AROUND A THOUSAND CUSTOMERS
A DAY AND NOTHING MORE.

300
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,388
OUR GUILD JUST
ISN'T BIG ENOUGH.

301

(MARIELLE SIGHS)

302
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,791
THAT'S PRETTY
MUCH IT.

303
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,325
AND IF YOU REMEMBER,
MARIELLE,

304
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,994
THIS WASN'T ABOUT STAYING
IN BUSINESS AND MAKING MONEY.

305
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,996
OH, THAT'S
RIGHT! HA HA!

306
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,899
I GUESS ALL THOSE GOLD PIECES
WERE STARTING TO BLIND ME.

(LAUGHING)

308
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,937
I'LL JUST GO DEPOSIT EVERYTHING
WE EARNED TODAY IN THE BANK.

309
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,438
[SHIROE] THANKS.
[HENRIETTA] UH‐HUH.

310
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,174
[MARIELLE] OK, SHIROE, SINCE
WE CAN'T GET ALL THE MONEY

311
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,376
WITH THE CRESCENT BURGER,
DO WE DO YOUR OTHER PLAN?

312
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,913
YOU KNOW, SO, LIKE,
WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH.

313
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,248
[SHIROE]
OH, YEAH, IT'LL WORK.

314
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,285
BUT, LIKE, I REALLY
DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

315
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,822
REMEMBER, HENRIETTA'S
GOT YOU COVERED ON
THE HARD PART.

316
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,123
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

317
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,459
[HENRIETTA] YES.
LEAVE IT TO ME, OK?

318
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,495
IN EXCHANGE...

319
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:56,830
UH!

(HENRIETTA LAUGHING)

321
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,401
[HENRIETTA] WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?!

322
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,070
[AKATSUKI] OH, MY LORD HAS GIVEN
ME A SECRET MISSION TO EXECUTE!

323
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,773
DON'T TRY STOPPING ME! AH!

324
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,843
[HENRIETTA] SHIROE WAS KIND
ENOUGH TO LEND YOU TO ME.

325
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,444
ISN'T THAT JUST WONDERFUL?

326
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:15,749
MY LORD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SOLD ME OUT AGAIN!

327
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,384
NOW, HURRY. PUT THIS ON!

328
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,055
[AKATSUKI] NO WAY!
I'M NOT SOME LITTLE DOLL
FOR YOU TO DRESS UP!

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

330
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,892
[HENRIETTA] AH, AH, AH!

331
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,528
YOU CAN'T ENTER THAT ROOM.

332
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,129
[AKATSUKI]
WHAT'S THAT?

333
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,298
[HENRIETTA] THIS ZONE BELONGS TO
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE.

334
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,068
(BUZZING)
AND THAT WAREHOUSE ONLY
PERMITS GUILD MEMBERS.

335
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,904
AND I'M SORRY, SWEETIE,
BUT ARE YOU A GUILD MEMBER?

336
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,107
I GUESS I'LL
HAVE TO...

00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,678
(BUZZING)
[AKATSUKI] ARE YOU
FREAKING KIDDING ME?

338
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,012
[HENRIETTA]
IT'S USELESS.

339
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,815
I SET IT SO THAT SKILLS
CAN'T BE USED HERE.

340
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,918
AND I CAN ALSO SET COMBAT
PERMISSIONS INDIVIDUALLY.

OUT ON THE CUTENESS!

YOU SEEN SHORYU?
[HENRIETTA] HM?

348
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,806
HE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN DONE ALREADY.

349
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:17,210
HE WANTED THE BIG
GAME, SO HE PROBABLY
ISN'T BACK YET.

350
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,013
LIKE, REALLY? I HOPE
HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

[MARIELLE] THANKS FOR
YOUR HELP, EVERYONE.

ARE REALLY A BLESSING.

WELL, I HATE TO CAST

366

WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,227
[MINORI] IS IT OK?
[TOYA] HMM?

383

SERIOUSLY? IS ALL
THIS REALLY OK?

[SHIROE]
THIS IS STRANGE, CHIEF.

385
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,371
BACK WHEN I WAS PLAYING,

386
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,373
ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS
WERE BACKGROUND ART.

387
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,210

ZONES ARE ALL FOR SALE.

THAT'S NOT ALL EITHER.

THE WORLD IS FOR SALE.

THE PRICES ARE JUST
OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH.

392
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,889
[NYAN‐TA] AND IN LIGHT
OF THE FACT THAT YOU
NEED A SMALL FORTUNE

AROUND HERE,

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,677
MASTER SHIROE, MASTER NYAN‐TA,
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE.

399
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,680
[SHIROE] HEY, SOJIRO.
[NYAN‐TA] HEY, LITTLE MAN.

400
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,616
I HEARD YOU WENT AND STARTED
YOUR OWN GUILD, HMM?

401
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,319
[SOJIRO] YUP. IT'S CALLED
THE BRIGADE OF THE WEST WIND.

00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,621
[SHIROE] IT'S SMALL,

403

BUT SOJIRO'S BRIGADE
OF THE WEST WIND

404
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,726
IS JUST AS POWERFUL AS THE
BIGGEST GUILDS OUT THERE.

405
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,727
[NYAN‐TA] MEOW?

406
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,162
[SOJIRO] NOT REALLY.

407
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,464
WE WERE JUST GETTING OUR
FEET WET STARTING THE GUILD.

408
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,668
THEN THE APOCALYPSE CAME AROUND
AND REWROTE ALL OUR PRIORITIES.

409
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:30,370
I HONESTLY HADN'T BEEN KEEPING
UP WITH THINGS AS MUCH

410
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,607
OR LOGGING IN AS OFTEN
SINCE THE TEA PARTY BROKE UP.

411
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:37,911
ARE YOU STILL KEEPING
COMPANY WITH THAT DELIGHTFUL
NAZNA AND MISS SAKI?

412
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,580
YEAH! NAZNA'S IN MY GUILD.

413
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,382
AND SHE'S JUST AS EASYGOING
AS SHE EVER WAS.

414
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,651
SAKI WAS ALSO IN
THE GUILD WITH US,

415
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,254
BUT I GUESS SHE DIDN'T LOG
IN DURING THE DAY OF
THE APOCALYPSE.

416
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,356
SO WHILE I'M STILL
THINKING ABOUT IT,

417
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,925
WOULD YOU HAPPEN
TO BE A...

418
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,494
ARE YOU STILL AS POPULAR WITH
THE GIRLS AS YOU USED TO BE?

419
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:57,263
[SOJIRO] HA HA. AH,
COME ON. I DON'T KNOW.

420
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,533
[NYAN‐TA] AH! TO BE
YOUNG AGAIN. HA HA.

421
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,401
[SOJIRO] SO TELL ME
SOMETHING, SHIROE,

422
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,303
YOU FINALLY CALLED.

423
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,206
WHAT INSPIRED YOU
TO GET IN TOUCH?

424
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,908
[SHIROE]
WELL, YOU SEE‐

425
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,442
[SOJIRO]
I GUESS WHAT
I MEAN IS,

426
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,412
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE
ME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

427
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,781
HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

428
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:20,020
[SOJIRO]
BECAUSE, WELL, I REMEMBER
ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME,

429
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,355
BUT THEN YOU KIND OF
SAID "NO," YOU KNOW?

430
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,124
[SHIROE] YEAH, BUT
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

431
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,460
I LIKE YOU FINE, SOJIRO.

432
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,896
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE SPENDING ALL THAT
TIME BEING INVOLVED

433
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,264
WITH A GUILD
BACK THEN.

434
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,266
[SHIROE]
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

435
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,036
THE APOCALYPSE MADE THIS
PLACE OUR REAL WORLD.

436
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,672
AND SO THE WAY
WE LIVE HERE IS
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

437
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,041
THAN IT WAS WHEN
IT WAS JUST A GAME.

438
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:46,279
[SHIROE] I CHOSE TO USE THE
POWER I HAVE TO PROTECT
PEOPLE WHO DON'T.

439
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,549
I HAVE MADE A
GUILD OF MY OWN.

440
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,350
WE'RE STARTING OUT,
AND WE'RE KIND OF SMALL.

441
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,486
BUT IT'S NOT A BAD THING
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

442
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,489
BUT I'LL ONLY HAVE
A PLACE FOR MYSELF

443
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,325
AFTER I'VE GIVEN OTHER
PEOPLE THE CHANCE.

444
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,462
I THINK THAT'S FAIR.

445
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:05,265
OH.

446
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,968
SO THAT BRINGS ME BACK
TO WHY YOU CALLED ME.

447
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:09,603
[NYAN‐TA]
WELL, MY FRIEND,

448
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:13,139
WHAT WE WANT AT THE
MOMENT IS YOUR OPINION
OF AKIHABARA, HMM?

449
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:17,844
[SOJIRO]
AH. IT'S LIKE A...
A PRISON.

450
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,580
HONESTLY?

451
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,815
[SOJIRO] IT'S NOT
JUST AKIHABARA.

452
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,185
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU
LOOK AT IT, THE WHOLE
WORLD'S A PRISON.

453
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,420
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T
EVEN DIE HERE.

454
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,455
[SHIROE]
WELL, I KNOW WE CAN FIX IT.

455
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,825
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

456
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,062
YEAH, I'M IN.

457
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,598
HUH. YOU SURE?

458
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,666
DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE AGREEING TO FIRST?

459
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,568
[SOJIRO] I DON'T THINK
THAT'LL BE NECESSARY.

460
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:45,071
I JUST HAVE A FEELING IT'S
GONNA WORK OUT SOMEHOW.

461
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:49,442
A SAMURAI'S JOB IS TO
FIGHT ON THE FRONT LINES
REGARDLESS OF THE PLAN.

462
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,612
PLUS, BACK IN OUR TEA PARTY
DAYS, OUR STRATEGISTS ALWAYS

463
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:55,048
SEEMED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING
AMAZING TO GET US THROUGH.

464
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,783
SOJIRO...

465
00:21:56,883 --> 00:22:00,020
[NYAN‐TA] YOU'RE ONE OF THE
GOOD ONES, LITTLE MAN.
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

466
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,789
[SOJIRO] COME ON,
YOU GUYS. HA HA!

467
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,593
I GOT MORE
BURGER MEAT HERE.

468
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,094
[CUSTOMER]
3 CRESCENT BURGERS.

469
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,530

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,431
LET ME COME AROUND AND GET
YOUR ORDER WHILE YOU WAIT.

471
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:13,166
YOU'RE SO CUTE!

472
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,701
OH, PLEASE ADD ME
TO YOUR FRIENDS' LIST.

473
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,403
HEY, HOLD YOUR HORSES. HE SAID
HE WAS GONNA COME TO YOU.

474
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,939
SERIOUSLY, BOSS?

475
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,241
ARE YOU REALLY JUST GONNA
SIT OUT HERE ALL DAY LONG

476
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,077
HOCKING BURGERS FOR
THIS SHIROE FELLA?

477
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,646
[SOJIRO]
OF COURSE NOT.

478
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,648
THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO IT THAN THIS.

479
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:34,087
I HAVE FAITH IN HIS PLAN.
I KNOW HE CAN MAKE THIS RIGHT.

480
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,828
[SHIROE] NOW THEN, TIME FOR
THE PLAN'S SECOND STAGE.

481
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,658
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]

KARASHIN OF SHOPPING STREET 8.

RODERICK OF THE RODERICK
MERCHANT GUILD.

484
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:25,866
MASTERS OF THE LARGEST CRAFTING
GUILDS GATHER INTO ONE PLACE.

485
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,101
THEIR TRADING PARTNERS
ARE THE CRESCENT MOONS,

486
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,770
MARIELLE AND HENRIETTA.

487
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,739
AND THE SHADOW THAT
MANIPULATES THEM?

488
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,676
[SHIROE]
THIS IS OUR REALITY.
