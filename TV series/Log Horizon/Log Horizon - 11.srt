(PANTING)

2
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,845
[MAN] CATCH YOUR
BREATH THERE, BOY.

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,914
(BOY EXHALES)

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,415
[MAN] LOOKS LIKE
IT'S EAST.

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,885
HEY, POPS, HAVE
YOU EVER SEEN AN
ADVENTURER UP CLOSE?

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,621
[POPS] HMPH.

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,724
[BOY] I HEARD A RUMOR
ONCE THAT AN ADVENTURER
YOUNGER THAN ME

8
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,193
SKIPPED RIGHT OVER THIS
MOUNTAIN, HUMMING A TUNE.

9
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,863
I'D REALLY LOVE TO BE ABLE
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,665
[POPS] DON'T BOTHER.

11
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,366
WHAT CAN THEY DO?

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,369
CAN THEY LIVE AS ONE
WITH THE LAND?

13
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,905
ADVENTURERS CREATE NOTHING.

14
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,608
THEY SIMPLY FIGHT
AND SHED BLOOD.

15
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,010
HUH?

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,746
[BOY] WHAT IS IT, POPS?
[POPS] SHH.

17
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,213
[BOY] OHH...

18
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,385
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

19
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,487
[POPS] OH, NO.

20
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,656
THAT LOOKS BAD.

21
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,492
WE HAVE TO GET BACK
AND TELL THE VILLAGE.

22
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,394

23

[NYAN‐TA] OH, YEAH!

26
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,778
I DEFINITELY NEED TO BRING
THE WHOLE GUILD HERE NEXT TIME.

00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,252
(TOYA GRUNTS)

28
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,054
COME GET SOME!

HEAD SPLITTER!

30
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,091
I DID IT!

31
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,427
(ELECTRICAL SOUND)
HUH? HEY, I'M STUCK!

32
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,329
HELP ME!

33
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,532
PURIFICATION BARRIER!

34
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,200
[TOYA] HUH?!

35
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,003
ASSASSINATION!

[MINORI] HUH...

39
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,843
[TOYA]
SORRY, GUYS. I, UH‐

40
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,613
[NAOTSUGU] SAMURAI ATTACKS HAVE
A LONG COOL DOWN, LITTLE MAN.

41
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,182
AND AFTER YOU CAST A
STRONG SPELL, YOU MIGHT
NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE.

42
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,618
BET YOU FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

43
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,053
[TOYA] I REMEMBERED IT,
REALLY. I JUST...

44
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,989
SHIROE ASKED US TO
WATCH OUT FOR YOU
DURING YOUR TRAINING.

45
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,390
DON'T EXPECT US
TO GO EASY ON YOU.

46
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,459
[TOYA AND MINORI]
THANK YOU, SENSEI.

[NAOTSUGU]
NEXT TOPIC.

48
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,731
MAN TO MAN, TOYA.
YOU SEE, CHICKS ARE LIKE‐

49
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,332
(NAOTSUGU WAILS)

50
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,168
[TOYA] LIKE WHAT?
[AKATSUKI] NAOTSUGU IS A MORON.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

51
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,537
[MINORI] SENSEI...

52
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,271
[NAOTSUGU] AS FOR YOU, MINORI,
WE'LL DO OUR BEST,

53
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,975
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE CAN TEACH YOU ABOUT
BEING A SHRINE PRIEST.

54
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,276
[MINORI] THAT'S OK.

55
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,279
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING
I NEED TO KNOW.

56
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,081
(GRUMBLES)

57
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,382
[NYAN‐TA] SHIROECHI?

58
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,817
[SHIROE] UH, HEY, CHIEF.

59
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,820
YOU PULLED YOURSELF ANOTHER
ALL‐NIGHTER, DIDN'T YOU?

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,690
NOT TRUE. I MANAGED
A LITTLE BIT OF SLEEP.

61
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,659
[NYAN‐TA] TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE NICE DAY.

62
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,228
GO OUTSIDE. DO SOMETHING
ELSE FOR A WHILE.

63
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,998
SEE SOME OF
AKIHABARA'S NEW STUFF.

64
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,969
[SHIROE] I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS
OCCUPYING MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

65
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,338
[NYAN‐TA] AND BY THAT,
YOU MEAN SOME WAY TO
GET US ALL HOME, HUH?

66
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,907
YEAH, THAT, TOO.

67
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,543
BUT EVEN IN A WORLD LIKE THIS
THAT USED TO BE A GAME FOR US,

68
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,580
THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE
BEING POWER STILL WORKS.

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,782
[NYAN‐TA] WHAT DO YOU
HAVE HERE, HMM?

70
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,585
[SHIROE] IF A COOK PREPARES
FOOD WITH HIS OWN HANDS,

71
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,121
AND A CRAFTSMAN MAKES
THINGS WITH NOTHING BUT
TOOLS AND HIS WITS,

72
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,858
THEN WE'VE ALREADY SEEN
THAT WE CAN DO THINGS
THE GAME NEVER COULD.

73
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,195
[NYAN‐TA] AH, SO YOU'RE
TRYING TO SEE IF YOU
CAN GET THE SAME RESULTS

74
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,664
FROM YOUR SKILLS
AS A SCRIBE, HUH?

75
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,000
I WAS ABLE TO DRAW UP
A SIMPLE CONTRACT.

76
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,336
I WONDER IF THERE ARE
OTHER APPLICATIONS FOR IT.

77
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,171
(CHIME)
HMM?

78
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,573
HEY, HENRIETTA.

[HENRIETTA]

HANDLE THIS ANYMORE!

80
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,911
SAVE ME!

81
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:11,945
[SHIROE] HUH?

82
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,580
I WANT TO GO!
I WANT TO GO!

83

[SHIROE] OH, WOW.
[HENRIETTA] UGH!

84
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,250
SO I GUESS ALL OF US
GOT A CALL, HUH?

85
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,719
[TOYA] SURE DID, MAN.

86
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,386
[NYAN‐TA] ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S
ALL THE COMMOTION IN HERE?

87
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,755
WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE‐

88
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:22,789
IT'S SUMMER.

89
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,425
IT'S SUMMER IN THE
ELDER TALES WORLD!

90
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,893
AND SUMMER IS ALL
ABOUT THE BEACH,

91
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,564
SNOW CONES, WATERMELON,
RAMEN, AND CURRY RICE!

92
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,265
LIKE, TOTALLY, RIGHT?

93
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,900
LET ME GO TO THE BEACH!

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,002
[MARIELLE] I WANT TO
HAVE A SNOW CONE...
[HENRIETTA] STOP THIS!

95
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,840
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE
IS ONE OF THE ROUND TABLE'S
11 ESTEEMED GUILDS,

96
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,242

TO BE ITS GUILD MASTER.

(MARIELLE WHIMPERS)

98
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,912
LOOKS LIKE AKIHABARA STILL
HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

99
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,816
WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T LEAVE
IT RIGHT NOW, SHOULD WE?

100
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,385
[MARIELLE]
I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD.

101
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,921
(CRYING) I'M STILL
WORKING REALLY HARD!

102
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,092
ALL I REALLY WANT IS SOME
REST AND RECREATION!

103
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,194
[HENRIETTA] YOU COME DOWN HERE
THIS INSTANT, MARIELLE!
[NYAN‐TA] I WOULD DARE SAY

104
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:05,398
THAT THE LADY IS IN A
RATHER DIRE NEED OF A
CHANGE OF PACE, HMM?

105
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,568
THE BEACH, HUH?

106
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,539
[ISUZU] WHAT'S THIS?
A NEW QUEST?

107
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,741
OK, WAIT.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

PLAYERS UNDER LEVEL 40?

110
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,719
HOW DELIGHTFULLY
BOURGEOIS OF OUR NEW
LEVEL‐90 BENEFACTORS.

111
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,855
HUH! HA HA HA!

112
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:33,827
IT'S TIME! THEY FINALLY
CREATED A STAGE LARGE
ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE ME.

113
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:37,063
AT LONG LAST, EVERYONE
WILL WITNESS MY PROWESS!

114
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:42,669
EVERYONE WILL BOW
TO THE MAGNIFICENT NAME
"RUNDELLHAUS CODE"!

115
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,571
[MARIELLE]
THIS IS A SUPER IDEA.

116
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,373
[HENRIETTA]
IT'S PERFECT EXCUSE
FOR A VACATION.

[HENRIETTA] MARIELLE!

119
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,012
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT TRAINING NOOBS,

120
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,515
AND MARIELLE NEEDED TO GET
OUT OF THE GUILD BUILDING.

121
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,082
TWO BIRDS,
ONE STONE, BRO.

122
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,452
FOR DARK, SINISTER SHIROE,
COMING UP WITH A PLAN LIKE THIS

123
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,222
IS REALLY NO
BIG DEAL AT ALL.

YES, I AM.

UM... I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU ARE, TOO?

130
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,775
I WILL BE ASSISTING THE OTHERS

[ALL]
SHE'S SO OBVIOUS.

133
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,981
[NYAN‐TA] COOL.

134
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,117
[TOYA] SHIROE AND ALL HIS
FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE THERE.

135
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,385
[MINORI] YEAH.

136
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,521
[TOYA] I'VE GOT TO DO
THE BEST I CAN. HA!

137
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,256
[TOYA] YAH!

138
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:40,527
[MINORI, THINKING]
I GUESS PART OF ME WAS
ALWAYS DOWN ON MYSELF

139
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,263
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO
DO ANYTHING FOR TOYA.

140
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:48,001
I REALLY THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOMETHING I COULD'VE DONE
OR SHOULD'VE DONE FOR HIM,

141
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,572
AND I JUST COULDN'T OR
DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

142
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,974
BUT THAT JUST ISN'T
THE CASE ANYMORE.

143
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,142
NOW IT'S UP TO ME TO
MAKE SURE SHIROE KNOWS

144
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:00,647
HE DID THE RIGHT THING BY
SAVING US AND LETTING
US JOIN HIS GUILD.

145
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,482
HMM.

146
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,421
[KAYU]
MAN, NOTHING'S
BITING TODAY.

147
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,823
HUH?

(HOOFBEATS)

149
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,127
WHAT'S GOING ON?

150
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,598
[AKATSUKI] SO THIS IS
WHERE THE TRAINING CAMP
WILL BE HELD, MY LORD?

151
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,701
[SHIROE]
THE TOWN OF CHOSHI IN
THE ZANTLEAF REGION.

152
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,003
[HENRIETTA]
KARASHIN HAS ALREADY GONE
AND LOOKED AT THE AREA,

153
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:27,273
AND HE HAS ALREADY MANAGED
TO SPEAK WITH THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND THERE, AS WELL.

154
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,009
WAY TO HANDLE
BUSINESS, MAN.

155
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,945
[HENRIETTA] SHORYU OF
OUR GUILD AND REZARICK
FROM THE BLACK SWORDS

156
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,747
WILL BE PARTICIPATING
AS TRAINERS.

157
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,682
[SHIROE] THAT'S FINE, BUT‐
[NAOTSUGU] UH.

158
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,585
NOW ALL I NEED IS SOME SPF
50 TO KEEP THE SUN OFF!

159
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,186
IT'S TOO
EARLY FOR THAT.

160
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,288
YOU KNOW THE CAMP ISN'T
UNTIL NEXT MONTH, MARIELLE.

161
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,926
I HAVE A SUMMER DRESS FOR YOU,
MY DARLING AKATSUKI!
[AKATSUKI] OH, COME ON!

162
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,761
[NAOTSUGU] MAYBE WE NEED
TO PUSH UP THE DATE.

163
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,696
[SHIROE] YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
[HENRIETTA] I SWEAR IT!

164
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,397
(SHORYU GASPS)
(CHIME)

165
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,366
[HENRIETTA]
DID YOU FIND SUNSCREEN?

166
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,937
[SHIROE] NO. THERE WERE A LOT
OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GATES
I HADN'T SEEN BEFORE.

167
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,471
[HENRIETTA] HUH?

168
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,073
[MAN 1] WHAT IS GOING ON?

169
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,509
[MAN 2] DO YOU REMEMBER
THINGS LIKE THIS IN THE GAME?

170
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,010
[MAN 1] NO, NOT REALLY.

171
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,279
[SHORYU] THAT'S THEM.
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, OK.

172
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:11,317
LIKE, WHY DOES THAT DUDE
WITH THE FUNKY HAT
LOOK FAMILIAR TO ME?

173
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,686
[NAOTSUGU] WHAT THE HECK?

174
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,888
[AKATSUKI] WHAT'S
GOING ON, MY LORD?

175
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,857
[SHIROE] THEY'RE ALL
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

176
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,892
[MARIELLE]
SO THAT MEANS...

177
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,227
[SHIROE]
A HERALD OF ROYALTY.

178
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,099
[HERALD] I AM THE EMISSARY
OF DUKE SERJIAD COWEN,

179
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,469
HIGH LORD OF EASTAL'S
LEAGUE OF FREEDOM CITIES.

180
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,942
I HAVE COME HERE TO GAIN
AUDIENCE WITH THE LEADER OF
THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.

181
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,880
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
IN "ELDER TALES,"
JAPAN IS CALLED YAMATO.

182
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,483
IT'S DIVIDED INTO
5 MAJOR TERRITORIES.

183
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,852
THE LEAGUE OF FREEDOM
CITIES OF EASTAL

184
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,289
IS AN ALLIANCE OF LORDS
THAT RULE EASTERN JAPAN,

185
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,127
AND EASTAL HAS SENT AN
EMISSARY TO THE ROUND TABLE.

186
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:57,698
THEY WANT US TO ATTEND
THEIR NEXT GATHERING
OF ALLIED NOBLES,

187
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,934
AND CURIOUSLY, THERE'S
ALSO A DANCE INVOLVED.

188
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,102
(HOOFBEATS)

189
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,605
[KRUSTY] AND I SUPPOSE YOU
ANTICIPATED THIS, TOO?

190
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:09,876
[SHIROE] THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
SHOULD BE WELL AWARE OF OUR
ESTABLISHING THE ROUND TABLE.

191
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,513
SO, YES, THIS MOVE
ISN'T UNEXPECTED.

192
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,917
THEY SAID THEY WERE
PREPARED TO GRANT TITLES
OF NOBILITY TO SOME OF US.

193
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,019
IT'S NOT AN
EASY CHOICE,

194
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,788
WHETHER OR NOT WE GO THERE
TO REPRESENT OURSELVES.

195
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,456
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
NOT EASY?

196
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,827
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN
START NETWORKING WITH
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND,

197
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,662
AND WE SHOULDN'T PASS IT UP,

198
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:32,398
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A
CHANCE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT
THIS WORLD THAN WE DO.

199
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,167
SO WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE?

200
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:38,371
[SHIROE] WE MAY VERY WELL GET
CAUGHT UP IN THEIR POLITICS.

201
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,175
IF WE DON'T PARTICIPATE, THAT
POSSIBILITY GOES AWAY, BUT...

202
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,879
[KRUSTY] WE LOSE A CHANCE
TO GAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION.

203
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,181
[SHIROE]
THAT'S THE TRADEOFF.

204
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,951
[KRUSTY] IS THERE A CHANCE
OF WAR WITH THEM?

205
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,319
[SHIROE]
IT'S NOT LIKELY.

206
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,021
THERE'S NO ONE IN THEIR
RANKS THAT WE KNOW OF

207
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,724
WHO'S ANYWHERE NEAR AS
STRONG AS AN ADVENTURER...

208
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,126
CERTAINLY NOT LEVEL 90s LIKE US.

209
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,227
[KRUSTY] ALL RIGHT.

210
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,430
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN MIND? I'M LISTENING.

211
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,833
HMM.

212
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,348
[MARIELLE] OHH, I CAN SMELL
THE SALT ON THE AIR!

213
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,085
[NAOTSUGU] IT'S WAY DIFFERENT
FROM AKIHABARA, ISN'T IT?

214
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,054
[TOYA] CHECK IT
OUT, MINORI. THERE!

215
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,090
[MINORI] WOW!

216
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,726
[NYAN‐TA] HMM.

217
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,529
SOME TREES, BUT MOSTLY
MEADOW AROUND HERE.

218
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,963
[SERARA] YEAH!

219
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,966
[TOYA] OH, YEAH.
THOSE LOOK GOOD!

220
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,036
[MINORI] NOW, TOYA, DON'T
TAKE ANY WITHOUT ASKING.

221
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,871
THAT WOULD BE
SIMPLY VULGAR,

222
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,472
BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
FROM COMMONERS?

223
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,175
[TOYA] WHAT'D YOU SAY?!
[MINORI] TAKE IT EASY, TOYA.

224
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,712
[ISUZU] YOU'RE AS
LIVELY AS EVER, I SEE.

225
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,413
[MINORI]
HEY, ISUZU!

226
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,215
YOU KNOW, BACK IN
THE REAL WORLD,

227
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,151
YOU'D NEVER THINK OF
HOLDING A TRAINING CAMP
INSIDE THE GAME LIKE THIS.

228
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,452
(MINORI LAUGHS)

229
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,121
[MINORI AND TOYA] HUH?

230
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,625
[TOYA] IS SHE ONE OF
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
WHO LIVE AROUND HERE?

231
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,260
[ALL] HI!

232
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,368
[TOYA]
ARE THEY SERIOUS?!

233
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,470
[ISUZU]
ISN'T THIS A SCHOOL?

234
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,206
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE
GONNA BE STAYING
EVERY NIGHT? AWESOME!

235
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,510
AND TONIGHT WE'RE HAVING
A BARBECUE OUTSIDE!
(CROWD CHEERS)

236
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,113
[TOYA] I SURE WISH
BROTHER SHIROE WOULD'VE
COME WITH US, MINORI.

237
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,915
[MINORI] YEAH.

238
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,819
HE HAS AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE
WITH ONE OF THE GOVERNMENTS
OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

239
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,988
[MINORI]
HE'S GOT TO BE THERE.

240
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,391
I WONDER IF THE KIDS IN
CAMP ARE DOING OK.

241
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,996
HEY, I LEFT MY BRAND‐NEW
STEAM ENGINE BEHIND TO
GO ON THIS TRIP OF YOURS.

242
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,532
[MICHITAKA] KEEP YOUR HEAD
IN THE GAME, MASTERMIND.

243
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,934
[SHIROE]
OK. I GOT IT.

244
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,870
[KARASHIN]
I UNDERSTAND.

245
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,271
WE NEED TO SEND A PARTY THERE

246
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,574
TO SEE IF WE CAN GET MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT THEM.

247
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:56,710
[ISAAC] IT'S REALLY CUTE THAT
THEY WANT TO MAKE US NOBLES,

248
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,045
LIKE THEY'RE BETTER THAN
US IN THE FIRST PLACE.

249
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,781
WHO DOES THOSE NPC'S
THINK THEY ARE?

250
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:04,084
FOR ONE THING,
THEY'RE NOT JUST
SOFTWARE ANYMORE.

251
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,187
I THOUGHT WE
DISCUSSED THAT FACT
AT LENGTH ALREADY.

252
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,389
[ISAAC]
SORRY. IT'S JUST HABIT.

253
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,325
[SHIROE] WE'RE ALL IN
AGREEMENT ABOUT GOING TO
THE CONFERENCE IN EASTAL.

254
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,929
WE SHOULD BE SURE TO PUT
OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD
WHILE WE'RE THERE.

255
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,164
SO WHO'S GONNA REPRESENT
US AT THE MEETING?

256
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,367
THOSE DAYS OVERLAP WITH
THE TRAINING CAMP, YOU KNOW.

257
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,105
UH, I'M IN CHARGE OF THAT
TRAINING CAMP, SO I'M OUT.

258
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,041
[KARASHIN] WELL, SINCE D. D. D.
HAS THE MOST MEMBERS IN IT,

259
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,744
MAYBE KRUSTY SHOULD
REPRESENT US.

260
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,012
OK.

261
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,247
BUT D. D. D. ARE
PRIMARILY WARRIORS.

262
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,216
CRAFTING AND COMMERCE
SHOULD GO, TOO.

263
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,651
(KARASHIN GASPS)

264
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,886
[RODERICK] UH, YOU SEE,
WE'RE WORKING ON THE
OCTOPEDE RIGHT NOW

265
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,588
AND THE STEAM ENGINE TO RUN IT.

266
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,824
[KARASHIN] YEAH, AND I'VE
GOT A LOT OF OTHER STUFF
GOING ON MYSELF.

267
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:47,160
[MICHITAKA] AND I'M JUST GETTING
TO THE PART WHERE I MAKE
THIS THING MORE POWERFUL.

268
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,161
AN IMPASSE.

269
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,296
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
TO DO ABOUT IT.

270
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,932
[ALL] ROCK, PAPER...

271
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,333
[MICHITAKA] OH, CRAP.

272
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,502
[RODERICK] HA! YEAH!
AHEM, IT'S DECIDED, THEN.

273
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,871
[KARASHIN] MICHITAKA WILL
REPRESENT THE MERCHANT GUILDS.

274
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,272
[MARIELLE]
THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.

275
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,775
[KRUSTY] NO. THE TEAM'S
NOT COMPLETE YET.

276
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,946
I NEED SOMEONE WITH A KNACK
FOR POLITICS AND STUDYING
THE OPPOSITION.

277
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,447
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

278
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:08,649
[ALL] STARE...

279
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:11,051
[SHIROE] OK. I GOT IT.
[AKATSUKI] HMM.

280
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,786
SO THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED?

281
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,455
[SHIROE] YOU ALWAYS HAVE
THE OPTION OF BEING
A TRAINER AT THE CAMP.

282
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:18,725
A SHINOBI SHOULD
FOLLOW HER MASTER NO
MATTER WHERE HE GOES.

283
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:19,960
[SHIROE] REALLY, NOW?

284
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,529
AND WHY EXACTLY ARE
YOU HERE, HENRIETTA?

285
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,864
[HENRIETTA]
I TOLD YOU...

286
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,166
I AM MERELY
PARTICIPATING AS
AN OBSERVER.

287
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,969
[SHIROE]
OK, MISS OBSERVER, SO WHAT'S
STICKING OUT OF YOUR BAG?

288
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,203
(HENRIETTA GASPS)

289
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,205
[HENRIETTA] OH, UH,
JUST SOME FABRIC.

290
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,075
IT MOST DEFINITELY IS NOT
A SUMMER DRESS FOR AKATSUKI!

291
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,844
[SHIROE] METHINKS THE LADY
DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH.

292
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,245
YOU SLY DOG, YOU.

293
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,014
MAN, SHIROE,
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

294
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,816
[SHIROE] IT ISN'T
LIKE THAT, GUYS.

295
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,019
[KRUSTY] SO TELL ME,
WHAT INFORMATION ARE WE
CULLING FROM THESE PEOPLE?

296
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,354
SOME THINGS HAVE TO
HAVE MORE VALUE.

297
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,624
[SHIROE] EVERYTHING
WE CAN, I GUESS.

298
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,392
BUT IF I HAD TO
SET A PRIORITY,

299
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,128
IT'D BE ON WHETHER OR NOT
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
HAVE CHANGED AT ALL.

300
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,930
[MICHITAKA]
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

301
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,166
BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN
ELDER TALES WAS NOTHING
BUT A GAME ENVIRONMENT,

302
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,536
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
WERE MADE BY THE
SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS

303
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:06,106
TO BE A WHOLE LOT WEAKER
THAN THE ADVENTURERS.

304
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,074
NOW, OF COURSE, THERE
WERE IN‐GAME EXCEPTIONS

305
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,410
LIKE THE PRECURSORS
AND THE ROYAL GUARD,

306
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:13,947
BUT RUN‐OF‐THE‐MILL NPCs
NEVER GOT STRONGER THAN
THE SOFTWARE LET THEM.

307
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:18,318
[MICHITAKA] WHEN ADVENTURERS
LIKE US DIE, WE JUST COME
BACK TO LIFE IN THE CATHEDRAL,

308
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,254
BUT PEOPLE OF THE LAND
BITE IT FOR GOOD.

309
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,057
[SHIROE] SO FAR, BUT WE CAN'T
BE SURE IF THE APOCALYPSE

310
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,992
HAS CHANGED THEM, AS WELL,

311
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,361
LIKE THE REST OF THIS "GAME."

312
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,964
[MARIELLE] SORRY TO DRAG YOU
ALONG WITH ME LIKE THIS.

313
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,766
[MINORI] NO, IT'S FINE.

314
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:36,102
[SHIROE] FOR ONE THING,
THEY AREN'T SIMPLE
NON‐PLAYER CHARACTERS ANYMORE.

315
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,971
THEIR EVOLUTION IS OBVIOUS.

316
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,206
NPC'S WERE A PROGRAMMED
PART OF THE GAME

317
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,208
DESIGNED TO HELP SEND
THE PLAYER ON QUESTS

318
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,746
THAT RESULT IN A PLAYER
RECEIVING GOLD, INVENTORY ITEMS,

319
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,047
AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE.

320
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,915
THE MAGIC BAG IS
ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

321
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,753
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE
REWARD FOR ONE OF THE
BASIC QUESTS EVERYONE DOES.

322
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,454
IT HOLDS EVERYTHING.

323
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,623
HOWEVER, FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,
PEOPLE OF THE LAND

324
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:00,794
ARE NO LONGER GIVING ANY QUESTS
TO ANY ADVENTURERS ANYMORE.

325
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,363
[MISA] AND THAT MEANS
NONE OF THE NEW PLAYERS
WILL BE ABLE TO DO

326
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,433
EVEN THE SIMPLEST
QUESTS TO GET THEIR
INVENTORIES KICKSTARTED.

327
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:11,204
[SHIROE] THE POTENTIAL
BACKLASH FROM THAT COULD BE
EXTREMELY FAR‐REACHING.

328
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,674
[HENRIETTA] DID YOU TELL
MARIELLE ABOUT THIS?

329
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,108
[SHIROE] YEAH, I DID.

330
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,778
UH, WE'RE FACT‐FINDING?

331
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,345
[MARIELLE]
YEAH, SHIROE ASKED ME.

332
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,182
HE SAID TO "TALK TO
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

333
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,885
AND LEARN AS MUCH AS YOU
CAN BY TALKING TO THEM..."

334
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,419
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

335
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,089
[MINORI] OH. SO THAT'S WHY YOU
SPOKE TO THE VILLAGE ELDER?

336
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,557
[MARIELLE] WELL, THAT
WASN'T THE ONLY REASON.

337
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,893
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
I WAS JUST BEING POLITE.

338
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:37,097
THAT'S ONE WORTH NOTING...
SO SHIROE SENT YOU.

339
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,866
OH, WE DEFINITELY CAN'T
MESS THIS UP, THEN!

340
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,068
[MARIELLE] YOU'RE A
GOOD GIRL, YOU KNOW THAT?

00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,615
AS EXPECTED, WE'RE ATTRACTING
A LOT OF ATTENTION TO OURSELVES.

439
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:24,450
WE'RE GETTING ATTENTION,
BUT NO ONE'S TALKING TO US.

440
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,287
[HENRIETTA] OUT OF
RESPECT FOR SERJIAD?
[SHIROE] NO.

441
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,190
[SHIROE, THINKING]
MORE THAN LIKELY, WE'RE GETTING
THE EXCLUSIVE EAR OF THE DUKE

442
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,493
BECAUSE INASMUCH AS
WE'RE CURIOUS ABOUT
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND,

443
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:37,263
THEY ARE EQUALLY AS CURIOUS
AND APPREHENSIVE ABOUT US.

444
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,033
THEY'RE NERVOUS, VERY NERVOUS.

445
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,402
THEY'RE PLAYING THE SAME
GAME WE ARE, ESSENTIALLY:

446
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,070
VERBAL FENCING,
ENGAGE US IN CONVERSATION

447
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,041
WITHOUT REVEALING TOO MUCH
ABOUT THEMSELVES IN THE PROCESS.

448
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,743
DODGE, WEAVE, PARRY.

449
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,378
THIS IS GONNA BE
A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK.

450
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,117
(MURMURING)

451
00:21:57,217 --> 00:22:00,386
[MICHITAKA] WHOA.
[KAYU] HEY, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A REAL PRINCESS BEFORE.

452
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,725
[SERJIAD] THAT'S MY
GRANDDAUGHTER IN THE CENTER
WEARING THE LAVENDER.

453
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,093
[MICHITAKA]
AND SHE'S GORGEOUS.

454
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,662
[KRUSTY]
WHAT'S HER NAME?

455
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:12,065
[SERJIAD]
HMM. RAYNESHIA.

456
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,636
(BUGS CHIRPING)

457
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:17,638
[NAOTSUGU] AND TOMORROW
FOR GROUP TRAINING,

458
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:21,742
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GO
INSIDE THE DUNGEON ITSELF.

459
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,710
[TOYA AND RUNDELLHAUS]
DUNGEON!

460
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,147
[NYAN‐TA] THIS PARTICULAR
DUNGEON IS CALLED
THE FOREST OF LAGLANDA.

461
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:30,483
[TOYA] ALL RIGHT!
[RUNDELLHAUS] YOU GUYS
ARE IN FOR A REAL TREAT.

462
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:31,752
[NAOTSUGU] BY THE WAY,

463
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,754
YOU'RE GONNA BE GOING IN
THERE WITHOUT US.

464
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,756
[TOYA] HUH?
(RUNDELLHAUS CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

465
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:38,725
[TOYA]
WITHOUT TRAINERS?
REALLY?

466
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,894
OH, SHIROE...

467
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:18,291
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
A BOUNTIFUL BANQUET CAN ALSO
BE A PLACE OF POLITICS

468
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:20,060
WHERE OPPOSING
GROUPS COLLIDE.

469
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,096
THE NOBLES TRY TO GAIN
CONTROL OF THE ADVENTURERS,

470
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:26,266
WHILE SHIROE AND
THE ROUND TABLE ARE
FORCED TO NEGOTIATE.

471
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:32,238
MEANWHILE, MINORI, TOYA,
AND THEIR COMPANIONS
FACE A HARSH REALITY.

472
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,108
[SHIROE] ALWAYS LOOK
30 SECONDS AHEAD.
