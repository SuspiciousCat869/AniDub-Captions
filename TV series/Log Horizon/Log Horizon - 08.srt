00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:07,708
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
IN ELDER TALES, A QUEST
IS A TYPE OF MISSION.

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,209
THERE ARE MANY TYPES,
RANGING FROM

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,345
SIMPLY FINDING MISSING PERSONS
TO GRAND ADVENTURES,

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:15,215
EACH WITH ITS OWN UNIQUE REWARD‐

5
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,051
EXPERIENCE, GOLD
AND OTHER ITEMS,

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,621
PLUS MAGICAL KNOWLEDGE
AND CRAFTING RECIPES.

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,155
(FLUTES BLOWING)

8
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,090
OUR GRIFFIN‐SUMMONING
FLUTES HAPPEN TO BE

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,061
ONE OF THE COMPLETION
REWARDS FOR A HUGE QUEST.

10
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,558
[KARASHIN] HMM.

11
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,160
OK. WE NEED TO GO
ON A SUPPLY RUN HERE.

12
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,695
WE'RE A LITTLE UNDERSTOCKED
AT THE MOMENT.

13
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,731
[TARO] YOU KNOW, EVER
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE,

14
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,566
THERE AREN'T A LOT
OF FOLKS OR GUILDS

15
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,235
WHO WANT TO FIGHT
FOR INGREDIENTS
LIKE THEY USED TO.

16
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,604
FIGHTING IN YOUR
OWN BODY IS PRETTY
SCARY NOWADAYS.

17
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,372
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU CAN DIE,

18
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,241
BUT I CAN
SEE WHY THEY'RE
TAKING UP CRAFTING

19
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,044
AND MAKING IT
HARD FOR US TO
FILL THE WAREHOUSE.

20
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,380
[KARASHIN] THE LARGER GUILDS
ARE ALWAYS GONNA HAVE
THE BUYING POWER.

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,783
[TARO] THE RODERICK MERCHANT
GUILD AND MARINE AGENCY

22
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,520
HAVE ASSIMILATED A LOT OF
THE SMALLER MERCHANT
GUILDS RECENTLY.

23
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,523
[KARASHIN] AND, OF COURSE,
WE CAN'T EXACTLY SIT
ON OUR LAURELS,

24
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,559
EVEN IF WE'RE THE NUMBER 3
CRAFTING GUILD.

25
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,994
WE GOT TO TAKE FULL
ADVANTAGE OF THIS CHANCE

26
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,829
WHILE IT'S STILL
WITHIN OUR REACH.

27
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,197
[TARO] "CHANCE"?

28
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,232
[KARASHIN] MM‐HMM.

29
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,940
AH...

30
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,042
[AKATSUKI] RRGH...
UH! LET ME GO!

31
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,679
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T
HAVE TIME TO BE YOUR
LITTLE PLAYTHING,

32
00:02:58,779 --> 00:02:59,746
AND THAT'S FINAL.

33
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,882
[MARIELLE] YOU LOOK
SO RELAXED, HENRIETTA.

34
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,283
MY HEART'S BEATING
SO FAST.

35
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,951
I'M NOT RELAXED AT ALL,

36
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,154
AND THAT'S WHY I'M
TRYING TO CALM MYSELF BY
SNUGGLING MY AKATSUKI.

37
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,256
I AM NOT YOUR
RELAXATION THERAPY‐

38
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,458
I'M GOING INTO BATTLE
SOON, HONEY PIE,

39
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,395
AND I NEED YOU TO HELP
ME STAY STRONG.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,001
[BOTH] HM...

41
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,268
(DOOR OPENS)

42
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,604
[KARASHIN] HEY, SORRY
I KEPT YOU WAITING.

43
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,039
I MUST HAVE SCREWED UP
PRETTY BAD, MARIELLE.

44
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,641
YOU LOOK KIND OF
UPSET RIGHT NOW.

45
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:28,709
OH, YOU'RE SO SILLY.

46
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,310
IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
HASN'T IT, KARASHIN?

47
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,112
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU AND MARIELLE

48
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,047
HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

49
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,283
[KARASHIN] WE WENT ON A
COUPLE OF HUNTS TOGETHER
WHEN WE STARTED PLAYING,

50
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,852
BUT THEN YOU
STARTED YOUR THING,

51
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,354
AND I WAS DOING MY STUFF,
AND WE JUST GOT TOO BUSY, RIGHT?

52
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,056
[MARIELLE] WE BOTH STARTED
GUILDS, DIDN'T WE?

53
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,359
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
BE DOING WELL WITH
OVER 700 MEMBERS.

54
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,094
YOU TOTALLY HAVE
US BEAT THAT WAY.

55
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,663
OH, COME ON.

56
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,932
THERE ARE MERCHANTS GUILDS OUT
THERE A LOT BIGGER THAN MINE‐

57
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,300
MARINE AGENCY AND RODERICK.

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,404
SO WHY DID YOU
WANT TO MEET ME?
I'M ALL EARS, OF COURSE.

59
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,543
[MARIELLE, THINKING]
AH, HE'S ALREADY GOT
HIS GAME FACE ON...

60
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,478
UH, AHEM, I'D LIKE YOUR HELP
WITH INGREDIENT STOCKS,

61
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,881
SPICES AND WHATNOT
FOR THE CRESCENT BURGER.

62
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:12,252
KIND OF LIKE THE
WHOLE REAL‐WORLD
DISTRIBUTION‐CHANNEL THING.

63
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,121
SPECIFICALLY, WE NEED
YOUNG DEER MEAT, LETTUCE,

64
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,823
TOMATOES, FLOUR, POTATOES...

65
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,259
[KARASHIN, THINKING] LOOKS LIKE
SHE NEEDS A BIGGER SUPPLY CHAIN

66
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,627
FOR HER RESTAURANT.

67
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,596
ONCE YOU EAT AT CRESCENT MOON,
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH

68
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,999
HOOKED ON IT FOR LIFE
ON FLAVOR ALONE.

69
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,001
MAN, I NEED TO
GET IN ON THIS.

70
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,136
YOU NEED A
SUPPLY CHAIN.

71
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,739
WHAT PRICE POINT
ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

72
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,074
(TEARING PAPER)

73
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,310
(WHIRRING)

74
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,613
'K. LET ME
THINK ABOUT IT.

75
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,281
THE GUILD COULD
ACTUALLY TURN OUT

76
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,016
A PRETTY TIDY
PROFIT ON THIS.

77
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,685
HOWEVER...

78
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,987
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY
GOOD DEAL FOR THEM.

79
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,656
THAT MIGHT BE, BUT YOU KNOW
HE ISN'T GOING TO JUST ROLL OVER

80
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,058
FOR THE FIRST THING
YOU PUT IN FRONT OF HIM.

81
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,629
[MARIELLE, THINKING] OH, YEAH.
HE'S GONNA TRY AND GET A BETTER
DEAL FOR HIMSELF AND HIS GUILD.

82
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,263
[KARASHIN] SO ANYWAY,
I WANT TO MAKE SURE

83
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,498
THAT ALL OF THIS IS GOING

84
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,867
INTO OPERATING YOUR
RESTAURANT, CORRECT?

85
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,368
THAT'S RIGHT.

86
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,170
[KARASHIN] RUMOR HAS IT
YOU'RE DOING PRETTY WELL.

87
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,639
THAT'S NICE TO HEAR.

88
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,340
[MARIELLE] GOODNESS KNOWS OUR
CHEFS ARE REALLY PLEASED

89
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,475
WITH THE FEEDBACK
THEY'RE GETTING.

90
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,779
YOU GOT TO TELL ME,
MARIELLE, IS IT A
NEW RECIPE, OR WHAT?

91
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,350
[MARIELLE]
NO. OUR CHEFS ARE
JUST THAT GOOD. HA HA!

92
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,186
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO SAY, WASN'T IT, SHIROE?

93
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,388
SERIOUSLY, I THINK
I'M GONNA CRACK HERE.

94
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,957
[SHIROE]
LISTEN TO ME.

95
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,260
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
YOU JUST NEED TO
KEEP ON SMILING.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,762
[MARIELLE] "SMILING"?

97
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,732
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU.

98
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,400
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
ON SMILING, MARIELLE,

99
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,503
YOUR PARTNER WILL
HANDLE THE REST.

100
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,339
[HENRIETTA]
MM‐HMM.

101
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,307
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
MAYBE, BUT SHE LOOKS
LIKE SHE NEEDS

102
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,843
SOMEONE TO THROW HER
A LIFE PRESERVER.

103
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,745
[KARASHIN] I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA GIVE THIS DEAL

104
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,681
SOME SERIOUS CONSIDERATION, BUT
THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE.

105
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,783
A DIRECT PARTNERSHIP
BETWEEN SHOPPING STREET 8

106
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,318
AND CRESCENT MOON WOULD
REALLY GROW YOUR BUSINESS.

107
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,620
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE‐

108
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,221
[HENRIETTA] SORRY TO
INTERRUPT, MR. KARASHIN,

109
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,457
BUT IT'S TIME FOR THE
NEXT PART OF THE MEETING.

110
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,725
[KARASHIN] NEXT PART?

111
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,093
[HENRIETTA] MM‐HMM.
THE REST OF OUR GUESTS

112
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,327
SHOULD BE HERE
IN SHORT ORDER.

113
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,596
[MARIELLE]
I'M SORRY.

114
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,130
SINCE WE ALREADY,
LIKE, KNOW EACH OTHER,

115
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,066
I HAD YOU COME IN
A LITTLE EARLY.

116
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,435
[MARIELLE] BUT HENRIETTA SAYS WE
SHOULD NEGOTIATE THIS FAIRLY.

117
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,672
SO WHAT DOES
ALL THIS MEAN?

118
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,374
THE MARINE AGENCY AND
THE RODERICK MERCHANT GUILD

119
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,276
WILL BE COMING TO JOIN
OUR LITTLE MEETING.

120
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,512
WE HAVE OTHER
THINGS TO DISCUSS.

121
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,181
[KARASHIN]
WAIT. WHAT OTHER THINGS
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

122
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,183
[MARIELLE]
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR INVESTORS.

123
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,352
WE'RE, LIKE, WANTING
TO EXPAND OUR
BUSINESS INTERESTS.

124
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,854
AAH...

125
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,757
WE SHOULD
TOTALLY ASK
KARASHIN TO STAY!

126
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,026
WE NEED A SECURE
DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL

127
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,427
FOR OUR INGREDIENTS.

128
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,496
OTHERWISE, THIS DOESN'T
STAND A CHANCE OF WORKING.

129
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,264
HEY, WAIT A SECOND!

130
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,535
I MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING
TO ADD TO THAT DISCUSSION.

131
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,337
WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENT
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

132
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,172
WHAT I MEAN IS‐

133
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,810
WE'VE ALREADY LET YOU IN
ON THE FIRST PART OF OUR
DISCUSSION, MR. KARASHIN.

134
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,412
THE REST OF THIS
DIALOGUE MIGHT ALSO
HAVE VALUE TO YOU.

135
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,047
[KARASHIN]
OH, I TOTALLY AGREE.

136
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,883
LET'S JUST FINALIZE
THE TERMS I ALREADY
DISCUSSED WITH YOU.

137
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,385
WE'LL GET ANYTHING
YOU WANT IN ANY
BULK YOU WANT,

138
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,689
AND WE'LL LOCK IT IN
AT THIS RATE, OK?

139
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,157
(WHIRRING)

140
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,293
HMM. 30,000.

141
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,531
30,000?! OK, OK.

142
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,099
ON BEHALF OF THE
SHOPPING STREET 8,

143
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,901
I ACCEPT THE TERMS
OF YOUR DEAL.

144
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,270
[MARIELLE] THAT'S GREAT!
COME ON, HENRIETTA.

145
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,840
WE CAN, LIKE,
LET HIM STAY FOR THE
INVESTOR MEETING, RIGHT?

146
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,208
OF COURSE.
THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

147
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,244
[MARIELLE] HEE HEE HEE!

148
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,247
[KARASHIN]
HEH HEH HEH...

149
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:31,017
[MAN]
OK. LET'S SEE. WHAT'S YOUR
TAILORING LEVEL AT NOW?

150
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,619
[MINORI] LEVEL 32.

151
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,955
[MAN] THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO MAKE LEVEL‐30 LEATHER ARMOR.

152
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,558
STICK TO LEATHER APRONS TODAY
AND RAISE YOUR LEVEL SOME MORE.

153
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:41,227
[MINORI] YES, SIR.

154
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,999
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER]
SINCE THEN, SHIROE HAS
CONTACTED ME QUITE OFTEN.

155
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,903
HE'S GOT A LOT OF
FRIENDS, AND WE'RE
HERE IN THE SAME WORLD.

156
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:54,440
THIS SAME MAKE‐BELIEVE
WORLD COME TO LIFE.

157
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,478
WE'RE IN THE SAME PLACE,
BUT THE ONE I'M IN

158
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:02,048
IS A DREAM THAT'S TURNED
INTO A NIGHTMARE.

159
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:08,622
[SMASH] RRGH! WHAT THE
HELL IS GOING ON?!

160
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,057
[TOYA]
MINORI, YOU MADE IT OK.

161
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,327
[MINORI] WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
HAPPENED TO US, TOYA?

162
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:19,499
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER] THAT DAY,
THE DAY REALITY AND ELDER TALES
SWITCHED PLACES...

163
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,669
[TOYA] (PANTING)

164
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,138
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER]
ALL I COULD DO WAS CRY

165
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:30,276
AND PRAY THAT SOMEONE
WOULD SWOOP IN AND GET
ME OUT OF THIS MESS.

166
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,378
[TOYA] HUH?

167
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,615
[MINORI] (CRYING)

168
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,753
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER] TOYA WAS
ALREADY STARTING TO ACCEPT IT.

169
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:45,191
WALKING AROUND ALL OVER
THE PLACE AND RUNNING.

170
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,594
I CAN'T BLAME HIM.

171
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,532
RUNNING WAS NEW FOR HIM,
A BRAND‐NEW EXPERIENCE.

172
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,467
[TOYA]
CHECK IT OUT, MINORI.
HEY, LOOK AT THIS!

173
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,503
I GUESS WE STILL GET
THESE THINGS.

174
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,639
IS THAT COOL, OR WHAT?

175
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,875
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER]
IT TURNS OUT, WE WERE STILL
GETTING OUR EXP POTIONS

176
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,711
FROM THE SYSTEM
AS A BEGINNER BONUS.

177
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,648
AND, OF COURSE, TOYA WASN'T
GOING TO JUST SIT AND WAIT

178
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,883
WHEN HE HAD A CHANCE
TO DRINK THE HOLY WATER

179
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,519
AND TEST IN A FIGHT
OF SOME KIND.

180
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,555
AND WHEN YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
SHOWS YOU THAT KIND

181
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,290
OF ENTHUSIASM IN A PLACE
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE,

182
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,561
YOU START FOLLOWING
HIM REGARDLESS.

183
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,062
BUT THEN...

184
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,666
[SMASH] THEY'RE ON YOUR 4, MAN.
DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY!

185
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:29,269
[MINORI] HUH! WHA‐? OOH! UH!

186
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,004
MINORI! UH!

187
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,573
(SLAM)

188
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:33,974
[MINORI] UH! TOYA!

189
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,442
[SMASH] I TOLD YOU,
ALL YOU HAD TO DO TO LIVE

190
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,545
WAS DROP EVERYTHING
IN YOUR INVENTORY.

191
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,781
MAN, IT ALL SEEMS SO REAL,

192
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,183
IT DOESN'T EVEN FEEL
LIKE A VIRTUAL SIMULATION.

193
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,587
WELL, A GAME'S A GAME.
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.

194
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,489
[TOYA]
YOU. WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?!

195
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,057
(SLAM)

196
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,063
[MINORI] OH...

197
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,232
I'M ALIVE?

198
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,434
OH...

199
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,169
[TOYA] MINORI!

200
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,173
[MINORI] TOYA.

201
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,009
(RAIN FALLING)

202
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,612
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER]
SHIROE TOLD US THAT IF YOU
HAVE SOMETHING THAT MATTERS,

203
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,046
KEEP IT IN THE BANK.

204
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,550
HIS WARNING DIDN'T REALLY
MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE

205
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,620
UNTIL AFTER WE'D
ALREADY LOST EVERYTHING.

206
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,823
BUT BY THEN, WE JUST
WANTED SOMEONE TO HELP,

207
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,692
ANYONE, NO MATTER
WHO IT WAS...

208
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,328
[SHRADER] WHAT'S
WRONG WITH YOU TWO,

209
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,564
COUPLE OF NUBES IN TOWN?

210
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,432
AIN'T YOU GOT ANY FRIENDS?

211
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,101
IT CAN BE DANGEROUS
OUT HERE, YOU KNOW?

212
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,837
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER]
SO WHEN HE SHOWED UP,

213
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,073
WE THOUGHT WE'D FOUND A
WAY OUT OF OUR TROUBLE.

214
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,912
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER]
SHIROE ALWAYS HAD THE POWER
TO MAKE IT IN THIS WORLD.

215
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,248
HE DIDN'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE.

216
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:52,118
ME? ALL I COULD DO WAS CRY
MYSELF TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT

217
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,821
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
HACK IT ON MY OWN.

218
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,123
SO WHAT'S CHANGED?

219
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:03,964
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY I
LOST EVERYTHING IN THE
FIRST PLACE, RIGHT?

220
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:08,168
ANYWAY, THAT'S THE REASON

221
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,003
I THINK SHIROE SHOULD
JUST LEAVE US HERE

222
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,406
AND NOT EVEN BOTHER
WITH RESCUING US.

223
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,242
SOME BIG SISTER I AM.

224
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,945
(WHIMPERING)

225
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,754
[MICHITAKA] WELL,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

226
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:33,126
A COUPLE OF LOST LADIES,
AND THE SO‐CALLED MASTERMIND
BEHIND SHOPPING STREET 8.

227
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,494
[RODERICK] HMM.

228
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:35,862
HELLO THERE.

229
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,998
I'M MARIELLE, THE GUILD
MASTER OF CRESCENT MOON,

230
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,200
AND HENRIETTA OVER HERE
IS MY HEAD CLERK.

231
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,735
HANG ON THERE.

232
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,904
[HENRIETTA]
MARIELLE, I AM MUCH MORE THAN
A CLERK, AND YOU KNOW IT.

233
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,272
IT'S TRULY A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, GENTLEMEN.

234
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,641
MY NAME IS HENRIETTA.

235
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,410
WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY IS
THAT I'M OUR TREASURER.

236
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:55,115
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
NOW THEN, THE MASTER OF THE
MARINE AGENCY, MICHITAKA.

237
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,786
AND RODERICK, MASTER OF
THE RODERICK MERCHANT GUILD.

238
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,888
I HAVE TO NEGOTIATE
THE PROPER AGREEMENT

239
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,290
WITH THESE TWO,
OR WE'RE SUNK.

240
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,693
THIS IS MY BATTLE.

241
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,629
IF I FALL BACK OR FAIL HERE,

242
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,564
I WON'T BE ABLE TO
FACE THE OTHERS.

243
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:14,000
I MUST MAKE THIS WORK.

244
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,236
[HENRIETTA] NOW, BEFORE WE
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS,

245
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,639
YOU'RE PROBABLY A LITTLE
CURIOUS AS TO WHY WE INVITED

246
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,007
SHOPPING STREET 8
TO JOIN US HERE FIRST.

247
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,310
WE'VE ASKED KARASHIN'S GUILD
TO PROVIDE A SUPPLY CHAIN

248
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,779
OF INGREDIENTS FOR US.

249
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,313
WAIT A MINUTE.

250
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,750
YOU HAVEN'T DONE A DEAL WITH
THIS GEEK ALREADY, HAVE YOU?!

251
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,752
NO. THERE WOULDN'T
BE A REASON TO CALL US

252
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,787
IF SHE ALREADY FINALIZED
A DEAL WITH HIM.

253
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,623
[RODERICK] WE'RE HERE
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

254
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:41,261
[HENRIETTA, THINKING] WELL NOW,
MICHITAKA IS A RESPECTED LEADER,

255
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,765
BUT HE ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT
I WOULD REFER TO AS SUBTLE.

256
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,200
RODERICK IS A LOT
LIKE SHIROE, I SUPPOSE,

257
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,736
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY OF SHIROE'S CHUTZPAH

258
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,137
OR JOIE DE VIVRE.

259
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,373
OF COURSE WE HAD SOMETHING
ELSE IN MIND, GENTLEMEN.

260
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,108
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
IT'S A PROPOSAL THAT'S

261
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,043
MORE THAN WORTH THE TIME
YOU'RE SPENDING,

262
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,213
AND WE'D LIKE TO OFFER IT TO
BOTH OF YOU WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

263
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,048
HMM.

264
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,917
[SHIROE] THE ONLY THING WE CAN
SELL THAT'LL GIVE US THE MONEY

265
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,487
WE NEED TO RAISE IS OUR NEW
METHOD OF FOOD PREPARATION.

266
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:08,955
THAT'S REALLY
ALL THERE IS.

267
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,857
[MARIELLE]
OK, BUT ISN'T THAT...

268
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,358
[SHIROE]
PRECARIOUS.

269
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,961
THAT'S WHY WE COULDN'T SELL
CRESCENT BURGERS FOREVER.

270
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,030
SOMEONE'S BOUND TO
STUMBLE ON THIS NEXT.

271
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,432
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPERATIVE
WE MOVE QUICKLY

272
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:23,003
AND WE DON'T TIP OUR HAND
UNTIL WE'RE DONE NEGOTIATING.

273
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,905
[MARIELLE] LIKE, TOTALLY,
BUT WE JUST CAN'T GO

274
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,640
BARGING IN THERE
AND NOT HAVE SOMETHING

275
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,875
TO GIVE THEM
IN RETURN, CAN WE?

276
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,844
[SHIROE] THAT WOULD BE ONE
PLACE WHERE WE TRULY HAVE

277
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,713
A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE.

278
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,648
ADVANTAGE HOW?

279
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:39,085
[SHIROE] OUR ADVANTAGE IS
THAT THEY WANT PROFITS
FROM OUR LITTLE BURGER SHOP.

280
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:43,524
[HENRIETTA] RIGHT. CRESCENT MOON
IS THE BAIT ON THE HOOK,

281
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,693
AND THEY'LL BITE AS LONG
AS THERE'S PROFIT INVOLVED.

282
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,962
[HENRIETTA AND SHIROE]
OF COURSE WE MUST MAINTAIN

283
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:52,332
THE NEGOTIATING INITIATIVE.

284
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,702
[SHIROE] KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, AND
THIS TIME, WE HAVE THE POWER.

285
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,605
THE POWER TO CHOOSE WHAT WE
REVEAL TO THEM AND HOW MUCH

286
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,306
IS GOING TO BE
THE KEY TO THIS.

287
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,710
HOWEVER, WE CAN'T GO
TELLING ANY LIES, EITHER.

288
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,146
[HENRIETTA]
THAT'S EASY TO SAY WHEN
I'M GOING TO BE HOLDING

289
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,515
A CARROT OUT THERE FOR THEM
TO SNAP AT THE WHOLE TIME.

290
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,552
[SHIROE]
IF WE'RE GONNA COME BACK
TO THIS TABLE IN THE FUTURE,

291
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:13,119
WE HAVE TO BE TRUSTWORTHY.

292
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,189
MM, I BETTER GET TO SNUGGLE
WITH MY WITTLE, BITTY

293
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,093
AKATSUKI FOR A WHOLE WEEK, OR
THIS WON'T BE WORTH IT AT ALL!

294
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,929
AHEM, THE CRESCENT MOON
ALLIANCE, WITH HELP,

295
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,666
IS EMBARKING ON A
MAJOR OPERATION.

296
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,568
[MICHITAKA]
"MAJOR OPERATION"?

297
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,335
[HENRIETTA] YOU COULD THINK
OF IT AS A CHALLENGE

298
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,138
ON WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
A VERY GRAND SCALE.

299
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,240
HOWEVER, WE CONSIDERED
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES

300
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,543
AND REALIZED THAT WE
WEREN'T GOING TO DO THIS

301
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,044
WITHOUT ANOTHER GUILD.

302
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,313
OK, SO YOU
NEED OUR HELP.

303
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:45,519
ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.
SO IT'S A QUEST.

304
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:46,987
[HENRIETTA] HMM.

305
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,422
[HENRIETTA, THINKING] OH, YAY.
THEY'RE NOT GETTING IT.

306
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,257
(MARIELLE GASPS)
[HENRIETTA]
IT'S NOT LIKE LYING

307
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,193
IF THEY'RE BRAIN
DEAD, RIGHT, SHIROE?

308
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:57,664
SO WHAT KIND OF
ASSISTANCE DO YOU NEED
FROM ALL OF OUR GUILDS?

309
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,266
BEFORE I GIVE YOU
THE PARTICULARS
OF WHAT WE NEED,

310
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,570
I SHOULD PROBABLY
EXPLAIN OUR ORGANIZATION
A LITTLE BIT FIRST.

311
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,440
[MICHITAKA]
YEAH. I'M OPEN TO HEARING
YOUR STRATEGY, ANYWAY.

312
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,709
[RODERICK] INDEED.

313
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,644
[HENRIETTA] YOU MIGHT ALREADY
BE FAMILIAR WITH THE MAN

314
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,013
OVERSEEING OUR
OPERATION, SHIROE.

315
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,414
[MICHITAKA] WHAT?
[KARASHIN] HUH?

316
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,883
THE VILLAIN BEHIND
GLASSES IS INVOLVED?!

317
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,119
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
THE FIRST BITE, LITTLE FISH.

318
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,854
[MARIELLE]
YOU USED GRIFFINS?

319
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:25,992
[HENRIETTA]
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN YOUR
RAPID ROUND‐TRIP TO SUSUKINO.

320
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,629
[MARIELLE] YOU CAN ONLY GET
SUMMONING FLUTES LIKE THAT

321
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,732
FROM DARN NEAR KILLING YOURSELF!

322
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:35,836
[HENRIETTA]
I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TEA
PARTY STRATEGIST HAVING ONE.

323
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,872
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
THEY ALWAYS WANT REALLY
CHALLENGING QUESTS.

324
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,441
LOOKS LIKE HIS
REPUTATION PRECEDED HIM.

325
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,110
JUST THEIR KNOWING THAT SHIROE
IS LEADING THIS OPERATION

326
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,879
IS GOING TO LEND A LOT
OF WEIGHT TO ANYTHING

327
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,314
I BRING UP WITH
THESE GUYS NOW.

328
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,050
KIND OF MAKES ME
WONDER WHAT HE DID

329
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,986
TO GET CALLED "VILLAIN
IN GLASSES," ANYWAY.

330
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,254
[SHIROE] AH‐CHOO!

331
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,989
[AKATSUKI]
PARDON, MY LORD.
ARE YOU SICK?

332
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,724
OUR BODIES ARE
MADE BY SOFTWARE,

333
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,325
SO I REALLY
DON'T THINK SO.

334
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,995
[HENRIETTA] LET'S MOVE ON TO
THE MATTER AT HAND, SHALL WE?

335
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,396
I'M CERTAIN THAT,
MOVING FORWARD,

336
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,032
KEEPING SURPRISES
TO A MINIMUM WILL HELP.

337
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,001
IT'S NOT LIKE WE NEED
PEOPLE FOR A QUEST.

338
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,903
WHAT WE REALLY
NEED IS CASH.

339
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,104
[MICHITAKA]
YEAH. THAT FIGURES.

340
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,906
[RODERICK]
AND JUST HOW MUCH?

341
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,777
[HENRIETTA] RIGHT NOW,
THE CURRENT FIGURE WE'RE
LOOKING AT IS...

342
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,545
5 MILLION, ALL IN GOLD.

343
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,646
HUH?!

344
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,814
5 MILLION?!

345
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,415
HMM...

346
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:24,350
[KARASHIN, THINKING]
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
A QUEST OF ANY KIND

347
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,453
THAT COST THAT MUCH
MONEY TO BUY INTO IN
ANY VERSION OF THE GAME.

348
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,024
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE...
IS IT THE NOVASPHERE PIONEERS?

349
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,026
WITH THE EXPANSION
PACK IN PLACE,

350
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,396
IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE
DEVELOPERS CREATED NEW
LEGENDARY‐CLASS QUESTS

351
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,132
FOR ALL OF US WHO
ARE ALREADY AT LEVEL 90.

352
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,834
[KARASHIN, THINKING] CAN YOU
IMAGINE WHAT THE REWARD WOULD BE

353
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,904
FOR FINISHING THIS QUEST?

354
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,305
[HENRIETTA] IT'S GONNA BE
WORTH A LOT OF MONEY

355
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,541
ONCE WE'RE DONE
WITH OUR LITTLE PLAN.

356
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:50,276
COME TO THE HOOK, LITTLE FISH.
COME TO THE HOOK.

357
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,312
YOU WANT THIS TO
HAPPEN SO BADLY,

358
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,380
I THINK IT'S TIME THAT MY
FRIEND IN THE LIFE PRESERVER

359
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,584
IS READY TO GIVE YOU
THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE.

360
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,986
[MARIELLE] UH?

361
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,255
[MARIELLE] TRY THIS.
IT'S A NEW RECIPE.

362
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,025
IT'S ONE OF OUR NEW SWEET
AND DELECTABLE DESSERTS

363
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,860
MADE FROM THE EGGS
OF THE GIANT ROKE.

364
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,895
IS THIS CUSTARD?

365
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,496
OH, WOW!

366
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,099
[MICHITAKA]
OH, YOU REALLY MADE ALL
OF THIS FROM ROKE EGGS?

367
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,035
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,
CONSIDERING THAT A ROKE

368
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,604
IS A POWERFUL MONSTER
AT LEVEL 85 OR BETTER.

369
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,507
TO COOK THE EGGS OF A ROKE
AND TURN IT INTO THIS,

370
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,610
YOU'D NEED A PREVIOUSLY
UNKNOWN, LEVEL‐90 RECIPE.

371
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,178
NOW, OF COURSE, WE'RE
PREPARED TO GIVE YOU

372
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,280
SOMETHING IN RETURN
FOR THE MONEY.

373
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,150
ONCE WE'VE BROUGHT OUR
OPERATION TO A CONCLUSION,

374
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,118
WE'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO GIVE ALL 3 OF YOU

375
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,254
THE FULL DETAILS
ABOUT OUR PLAN.

376
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:38,124
ADDITIONALLY, WE'RE PREPARED
TO HAVE A SCRIBE MAKE COPIES

377
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,193
OF ALL THE COOKBOOKS
WE'RE CURRENTLY USING

378
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,062
AS WELL AS ALL OF THE COOKING
METHODS WE'VE LEARNED

379
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:47,067
OVER THE COURSE OF OUR
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
OF ALL OUR RECIPES.

380
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,669
[MICHITAKA, THINKING]
DOES THAT MEAN...

381
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,871
[RODERICK, THINKING]
... THEY'RE OFFERING
US ALL THE RECIPES

382
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,438
CRESCENT MOON IS USING?

383
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,075
[KARASHIN, THINKING]
THERE REALLY IS
A SPECIAL RECIPE.

384
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,377
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.

385
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:01,782
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE ALL I NEED
IS TO REEL THESE LITTLE FISH IN.

386
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,984
THROUGH ASSET LIQUIDATION
AND THE PAST FEW DAYS

387
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,086
OF REFRESHMENTS SALES
AT CRESCENT MOON,

388
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,354
WE CURRENTLY HAVE
500,000 OF OUR OWN.

389
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,491
THAT SAID, WE WOULD BE LOATHE
TO ASK ANY ONE GUILD

390
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,460
TO COME UP WITH THE
REMAINING 4 AND A HALF
MILLION ON THEIR OWN

391
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,230
AND MAKE THEM FINANCIALLY
VULNERABLE IN THE PROCESS.

392
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,365
NATURALLY, WE THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE MORE REASONABLE

393
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,637
TO ASK ALL 3 OF YOU FOR
1 AND A HALF MILLION
APIECE. GOOD?

394
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:26,773
BUT THAT'S LIKE LIQUIDATING
100 PLAYERS' ASSETS.

395
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:30,243
THE RODERICK MERCHANT
GUILD AGREES TO YOUR
PROPOSAL, MISS MARIELLE.

396
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,946
SAME HERE!
SHOPPING STREET 8
DOES, AS WELL!

397
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,214
[MICHITAKA] OH, YEAH?

398
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,683
MY MARINE AGENCY'LL
PONY UP THE CASH.

399
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,920
AND IF YOU'D LIKE,
WE'D ALSO BE INTERESTED

400
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,788
IN BEING YOUR ONLY
SPONSOR, TOO.

401
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,324
[MARIELLE] (LAUGHS)
[KARASHIN] NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK!

402
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,226
[RODERICK] YOU'RE NOT TAKING
ALL THE PROFIT FOR YOURSELF.

403
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,496
[MARIELLE] GENTLEMEN, LET'S
TAKE IT EASY, FOR ME, PLEASE?

404
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,169
[TOYA] DID YOU HEAR
FROM HIM AGAIN?

405
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,337
[MINORI] HMM?

406
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,072
[TOYA]
FROM BROTHER SHIROE.

407
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,674
[MINORI] SHH.

408
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:03,243
[TOYA] UH, LISTEN.

409
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,045
I DIDN'T SAY BEFORE,

410
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,247
BUT I SAW HIM OUTSIDE
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO...

411
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,182
(MINORI GASPS)

412
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,084
[TOYA] BUT, YOU KNOW,
I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF

413
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,019
TO ASK HIM FOR HELP.

414
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,888
[MINORI] WHY NOT?

415
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,489
[TOYA] I DON'T KNOW.

416
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,092
HE WAS SO COOL AND
NICE AND EVERYTHING.

417
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,361
HE'S SUPER SMART.

418
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:24,865
HE'S JUST AMAZING,
RIGHT? I JUST...

419
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:27,367
[MINORI] YEAH.

420
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,235
[MINORI, THINKING]
HE'S RIGHT.

421
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,373
BUT WE HAVE NO RIGHT
TO ASK HIM TO GET
US OUT OF THIS.

422
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:36,610
[TOYA] SO TELL ME, DO YOU
THINK I COULD BE LIKE HIM?

423
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,512
[MINORI] HUH?

424
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:42,148
[TOYA] I'VE GOT NO BUSINESS
ASKING HIM TO COME SAVE US.

425
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,885
BUT, HEY, WHAT IF I...

426
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,120
WHAT IF I COULD
BE LIKE SHIROE?

427
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,955
[MINORI] UH...

428
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,025
(MARIELLE SIGHS)

429
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,127
[MARIELLE]
THAT'S IT. I'M DONE.

430
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:57,097
MAGIC'S GONE.
HEALTH IS GONE.

431
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,700
[HENRIETTA]
MY BODY WON'T MOVE!
(DOOR OPENS)

432
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,668
[MARIELLE] HUH?
[HENRIETTA] THAT SMELL.

433
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,103
[HENRIETTA] AKATSUKI!

434
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,237
YOU'RE NOT
SMELLING ME.

435
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,839
THAT'S PROBABLY
THE PIE.

436
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,008
WHEN YOU'RE TIRED,
LADIES, SWEETS
DO THE TRICK.

437
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:10,110
[NYAN‐TA]
MM, YEAH.

438
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:15,516
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST,
AND AFTER ALL YOU WENT
THROUGH, TOO, OH, THANK YOU.

439
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,483
[NAOTSUGU] SHIROE KIND OF
ASKED US TO, SO...

440
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:21,021
[NYAN‐TA] HE SAID YOU'D
PROBABLY BE TIRED WHEN
YOU GOT BACK, AND‐

441
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,222
[HENRIETTA] (GASPS)
HE SAID THAT?

442
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,924
SO WHAT'S SHIROE
DOING, ANYWAY?

443
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:25,692
WE REALLY NEED
TO LET HIM KNOW.

444
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:29,129
[NYAN‐TA]
WELL, HE'S ALREADY WORKING
ON OUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT, HMM.

445
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,797
AND I THINK
IT'S SAFE TO SAY,

446
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,267
MASTER SHIROE ALREADY HAS A LOT
OF CONFIDENCE IN YOU, BABE.

447
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,503
[MARIELLE AND HENRIETTA] HA HA!

448
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,338
I SWEAR, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE HE PLANNED

449
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,508
EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT THIS
DAY DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL.

450
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:45,946
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T BEAT
THE VILLAIN IN GLASSES.

451
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,948
[SHIROE] AH‐CHOO!

452
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,087
[ISAAC]
LET'S BREAK IT INTO TEAMS

453
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,089
FOR TONIGHT'S
SPARING MATCH, PEOPLE.

454
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:57,958
[MAN 1] YES, SIR!
[MAN 2] RIGHT!

455
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,994
[REZARICK] WHAT'S THE
CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE
INVITING US TO, ANYWAY, BOSS?

456
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,565
[ISAAC] SOME DOPEY SHINDIG
ABOUT DISCUSSING THE
FUTURE OF AKIHABARA,

457
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:06,600
WHICH IS TO SAY,
THEY DIDN'T SAY MUCH AT ALL.

458
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,468
THAT GIRL MARIELLE,
SHE TRIED GETTING

459
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,937
THE SMALLER GUILDS TOGETHER,
BUT THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT

460
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,338
SO GREAT FOR
HER, DID IT?

461
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,675
I'M NOT REALLY
CONCERNED ABOUT HER,

462
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,644
BUT THE GUY SHE'S
WORKING WITH, NOW,
THAT BOTHERS ME.

463
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:21,314
[REZARICK]
YOU MEAN THE GUY WHO STARTED
THE LOG HORIZON GUILD?

464
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,250
[ISAAC]
YEAH, THAT GUY.

465
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,021
THE VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES,
TEA PARTY BOY.

466
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,325
[MISA]
MILORD, DOES THIS MEAN
WE'RE CANCELING THE NEXT RAID?

467
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,627
[KRUSTY]
YES. WE ARE.

468
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,562
IT'S THE SAME DAY,
AND I NEED TO BE THERE.

469
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:38,632
[MISA]
IS THIS CONFERENCE
REALLY THAT IMPORTANT?

470
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,467
[KRUSTY] THE CONFERENCE DOESN'T
INTEREST ME THAT MUCH...

471
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,569
OH.

472
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,471
BUT THE PEOPLE BEHIND
IT HAVE MY ATTENTION.

473
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:53,246
[SHIROE]
WE'RE DOING THIS TOMORROW.

474
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:57,884
I TOLD YOU I WAS
COMING FOR YOU, AND
I'M KEEPING MY PROMISE.

475
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,321
BE READY, OK?

476
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,361
[MINORI, THINKING]
TOYA SAID HE WANTED
TO BE JUST LIKE SHIROE.

477
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:13,466
HE WANTS TO OPEN NEW
PATHS JUST LIKE HIM.

478
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:18,338
AND IF TOYA WANTS
TO BE SOMEONE GREAT...

479
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:22,876
THEN SO DO I.

480
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:26,747
(MINORI COUGHS ONCE)

481
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:38,559
[MARIELLE]
OK, SHIROE. YOU'RE UP.

482
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:41,494
[SHIROE]
YES. MY BATTLEFIELD...

483
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:44,965
...IS READY.

484
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:18,725
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
12 GUILD MASTERS HAVE COME
TOGETHER AT THE GUILD BUILDING.

485
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:21,862
THE BATTLE BEGINS AS SHIROE
FIGHTS WITHOUT A WEAPON.

486
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:25,265
THE NEW PLAYERS TRAPPED
BY HAMELIN, MINORI AND TOYA,

487
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:27,668
ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN
THEIR FIGHT, AS WELL.

488
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:32,372
THEY MUST ALL WORK
TOGETHER IN ORDER TO
OPEN THE DOOR OF HOPE.

489
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,776
[SHIROE]
THIS IS OUR REALITY.
