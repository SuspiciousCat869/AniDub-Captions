1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,541
[MAN 1] THE SILVER SWORD
GUYS ARE HERE, TOO?

2
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,676
[MAN 2] LOOK, ANOTHER ONE!
[MAN 3] SERIOUSLY?

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:14,080
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] THERE
ARE MANY GUILDS WITH MANY
DIFFERENT GOALS.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,184
THE WARRIOR GUILDS USUALLY
SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,520
TRYING TO GET STRONGER.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,691
IN AKIHABARA,
THE MAJOR ONES ARE D. D. D.,

7
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,661
THE BLACK SWORD KNIGHTS,

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,563
HONESTY,

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,398
THE BRIGADE OF THE WEST WIND...

10
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:34,601
[RUSHING WIND]

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,870
... AND SILVER SWORD.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,207
THERE ARE ALSO CRAFTING GUILDS,
WHOSE TIME IS PRIMARILY OCCUPIED

13
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,344
BY AMASSING ITEMS OR
SELLING THEM IN TOWN.

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,347
MARINE AGENCY.

15
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,450
RODERICK MERCHANT GUILD.

16
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,953
SHOPPING STREET 8.

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,955
GLENDALE.

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,057
RADIO MARKET.

19
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,192
AND THERE'S THE SUPPORT GUILD,

20
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,162
MARIELLE'S CRESCENT
MOON ALLIANCE...

21
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:08,034
AND NOW... LOG HORIZON.

22
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,170
[BYSTANDER 1] SO ALL THE
MAJOR GUILD MASTERS ARE

23
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,738
HERE AT THE SAME PLACE
AT THE SAME TIME?

24
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,641
[BYSTANDER 2] I GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

25
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,921
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] IT'S A GOOD
SIGN THAT EVERYONE CAME.

26
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,725
ASKING SOJIRO TO HANDLE
THE INVITATIONS WAS A GOOD CALL.

27
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,667
[SHIROE] THANK YOU ALL FOR
TAKING THE TIME TO COME TODAY.

28
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:25,806
WELCOME. I'M SHIROE,
GUILD MASTER OF LOG HORIZON.

29
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:29,142
[ISAAC] WHY DON'T WE
KEEP THE INTRODUCTIONS
SHORT AND SWEET, OK,

30
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,112
FORMER STRATEGIST OF
THE TEA PARTY?

31
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,581
[SHIROE] THANK YOU FOR
YOUR RECOGNITION, ISAAC.

32
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,283
I'M FLATTERED THAT
YOU REMEMBER ME
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

33
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,485
HOW COULD I FORGET?

34
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,188
[WILLIAM MASSACHUSETTS]
WELL, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

35
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,625
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
I'M DOING HERE.

36
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,894
[SHIROE]
YOU ARE ALL HERE BECAUSE
WE BELIEVE YOUR GUILDS HAVE

37
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,831
THE ABILITY TO AFFECT
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS

38
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,566
IN THE CITY OF AKIHABARA.

39
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,635
WE HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN THIS
WORLD EVER SINCE THE EVENT

40
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,604
MOST OF US HAVE REFERRED
TO AS "THE APOCALYPSE."

41
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,875
CURRENTLY, WE DON'T HAVE
A FORESEEABLE WAY
OF RETURNING HOME.

42
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,744
IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS,

43
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,413
THIS CONFERENCE WAS CALLED
TO KEEP THINGS IN THE CITY
FROM GETTING ANY WORSE.

44
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,617
YOU DON'T ASK FOR
MUCH, DO YOU?

45
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,687
[KRUSTY] OK, SHIROE, ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT ORCHESTRATING

46
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,290
ANOTHER ALLIANCE OF
THE SMALLER GUILDS?

47
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,392
IT'S POSSIBLE.

48
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,927
HOWEVER, IT'S MY
UNDERSTANDING

49
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,229
THAT CONFERENCE
ENDED IN FAILURE.

50
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,598
I THINK WE'RE ALL
AWARE OF THE ISSUES

51
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,801
THAT CAUSED THAT MEETING
TO CAVE IN ON ITSELF.

52
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,871
[AKANEYA] FOREMOST OF WHICH WAS
THE NOTION THAT SMALLER GUILDS

53
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,373
NEEDED TO UNITE IN ORDER TO GET
WHAT THE LARGER GUILDS HAD.

54
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,908
AND THE DISCUSSION
TURNED INTO,

55
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,043
"THIS GUILD WANTS THIS" AND,
"THAT GUILD NEEDS THAT."

56
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,246
SO THERE REALLY WASN'T ANY
UNDERLYING UNIFICATION AT ALL.

57
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,148
SO IF I'M UNDERSTANDING
THIS CORRECTLY,

58
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,950
THE PURPOSE OF THIS
CONFERENCE IS TO PREVENT

59
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,687
OUR FUTURE INTERESTS FROM
CONFLICTING WITH EACH OTHER?

60
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,691
RIGHT. THAT'S NOT VERY
LIKELY, IS IT, NOW?

61
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,560
[NYAN‐TA]
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE
ASSUMING THAT THIS WOULD BE

62
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,797
A CONTINUATION OF THE FIRST
FAILED GUILD ALLIANCE.

63
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,232
[HENRIETTA] CORRECTING THEM
QUICKLY WOULD PROBABLY BE

64
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,701
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION.

65
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,036
[SHIROE] THAT'S NOT OUR
INTENTION THIS TIME.

66
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,172
MY GOAL IS ULTIMATELY
TO IMPROVE LIFE
HERE IN AKIHABARA.

67
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,774
THAT'S ALL.

68
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,644
ALL RIGHT. YOU GO AHEAD
AND DISCUSS THAT.

69
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,714
SILVER SWORD IS A
FIGHTING ORGANIZATION.

70
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,882
AND WE HAVE NO INTEREST
IN PETTY POLITICS.

71
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,485
WE'LL STILL COME BY
TO SELL OUR WINNINGS TO
THE MERCHANTS, OF COURSE.

72
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,522
JUST DO US A FAVOR...

73
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,925
DON'T ASK US TO COME
IN HERE AND FIX THE
CITY FOR YOU AGAIN.

74
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,528
[MARIELLE] HM...

75
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,897
[MASSACHUSETTS] YOU WANT TO LIVE
HERE AND TRY TO DEAL WITH ALL
ITS LITTLE ISSUES,

76
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,666
THEN FEEL FREE.

77
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,537
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF
CHARMING THAT YOU THINK
YOU CAN TALK IT ALL OUT.

78
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:40,774
BUT I KNOW A WASTE OF
TIME WHEN I SEE ONE.

79
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,710
[MASSACHUSETTS]
REGARDLESS, WE'RE
NOT INTERESTED.

80
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,279
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO IT WITHOUT US.

81
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,581
[DOOR CLOSES]

82
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,850
IT LOOKS LIKE
SILVER SWORD IS OUT.

83
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,753
[NYAN‐TA]
YEAH, WE EXPECTED AS
MUCH FROM THAT FOOL.

84
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,756
WELL, UH, IT'S SUCH AN
IMPORTANT DAY FOR EVERYONE.

85
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,158
BUT I DON'T SEE A LOT OF
PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW HERE.

86
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,395
I HAVEN'T SEEN
AKATSUKI OR NAOTSUGU
OR EVEN SHORYU OR HIEN.

87
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,530
WHERE ARE THEY?

88
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,898
[HENRIETTA] COME
TO THINK OF IT...

89
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,433
[NYAN‐TA]
I'M SURE THEY'RE
JUST PREOCCUPIED.

90
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,571
[ISUZU] SO ARE THE
RUMORS REALLY TRUE,

91
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,673
THAT WE CAN MAKE
AN ESCAPE OUT
OF THIS PLACE?

92
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,975
YEAH, I GOT WORD
THIS MORNING.

93
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,579
[SHIROE] AS SOON
AS TOYA AND HAMELIN'S
HUNTING PARTY LEAVE,

94
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,681
FOLLOW THEM OUT
OF YOUR GUILD HALL.

95
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,183
GET ALL YOUR NEW
PLAYERS TO FOLLOW.

96
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,686
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS
WALK OUT THE DOOR.

97
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,021
A FEMALE ASSASSIN
NAMED AKATSUKI

98
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,656
WILL BE IN THE MAIN HALLWAY.

99
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,358
HER BACKUP, AND YOURS,
IS A LEVEL 90 GUARDIAN

100
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,662
WHO'S WATCHING
THE CATHEDRAL. NAOTSUGU.

101
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,832
I WISH I COULD BE THERE.
DON'T WORRY.

102
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:43,203
THE ENTIRE GUILD BUILDING
IS UNDER MY CONTROL.

103
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,805
(ONE COUGH)

104
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,141
HE SAID ALL WE NEED TO DO TO
ESCAPE IS TO GET OUT THE DOOR.

105
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,710
SO LET'S JUST RUN
LIKE CRAZY, OK?

106
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,545
[YOUNG PLAYERS]
ALL RIGHT! YOU GOT IT!

107
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,948
OK, BUT WHAT DID HE MEAN BY
"THE GUILD BUILDING WAS
UNDER HIS CONTROL"?

108
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,218
I DON'T KNOW. BUT HE
SAID ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS RUN OUT THE DOOR.

109
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,286
[MILD LIGHTNING BOLT] HEY!
[BOTH] HUH?

110
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,689
[MILD LIGHTNING BOLT]
WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING
YOUR MOUTH ABOUT?

111
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,925
[MINORI] UH, NOTHING, SIR.
[ISUZU] UH, NOTHING.

112
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,160
[SHIROE]
CONTINUING ON...

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,063
I'VE CALLED THIS MEETING TO
CREATE A COUNCIL TO DISCUSS

114
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,899
AND POSSIBLY RESOLVE THE
SOCIAL ISSUES IN THIS CITY,

115
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:18,204
A "ROUND TABLE"
CONFERENCE,
IF YOU WILL.

116
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:22,776
OUR IMMEDIATE GOAL SHOULD
BE TO IMPROVE THE CITY'S
ATMOSPHERE AND SAFETY.

117
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,712
AFTER THAT, WE SHOULD
RECONVENE WHEN IT'S NECESSARY

118
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,614
TO DISCUSS ISSUES
AS THEY ARISE.

119
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:32,085
[SERARA] HMM...
[HENRIETTA] THIS IS THE PART
WHERE IT STARTS GETTING SERIOUS.

120
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,420
[KRUSTY]
BEFORE WE GET TO THAT,

121
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,191
WHY DID YOU SPECIFICALLY
INVITE WHO YOU DID TODAY?

122
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,926
[SHIROE]
OF COURSE.

123
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,062
FIRST, WARRIOR GUILDS.

124
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,329
BLACK SWORD KNIGHTS,

125
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,698
HONESTY,

126
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,099
D. D. D.,

127
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,001
THE WEST WIND BRIGADE.

128
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,003
YOU'RE THE STRONGEST
AND HAVE INVESTED

129
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,873
QUITE A BIT OF TIME AND
TALENT IN THE CITY ALREADY.

130
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,309
SILVER SWORD HAS CHOSEN
TO DISREGARD THIS.

131
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,079
MARINE AGENCY,
RODERICK MERCHANT GUILD,

132
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,347
AND SHOPPING STREET 8
WERE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT

133
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,083
THE CRAFTING GUILDS.

134
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,587
CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE,
GLENDALE, AND RADIO MARKET

135
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,089
AREN'T JUST HERE
OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.

136
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,325
THEIR VOICE IS THE
VOICE OF ADVENTURERS
IN SMALLER GUILDS

137
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,060
AND THOSE WHO
HAVEN'T JOINED ONE.

138
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,562
IT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

139
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,330
[EINS]
AND QUITE NECESSARY.

140
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,635
COMBINED, THE GUILDS
ONLY REPRESENT AROUND
6,000 PLAYERS IN THE CITY.

141
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,505
HMM, AND THAT MEANS
TECHNICALLY 9,000 PLAYERS

142
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,640
IN THE CITY DON'T HAVE
A VOICE AT THIS TABLE.

143
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,908
BUT WITH THE SMALLER
GUILDS HERE,

144
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,310
THEY CAN HAVE AT LEAST
A VOICE BY PROXY.

145
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,678
[KRUSTY] AND YOU?

146
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,814
[SHIROE] I'M HERE AS ORGANIZER
OF THIS CONFERENCE

147
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,882
AND AUTHOR OF ITS PROPOSALS.

148
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,852
LOG HORIZON ONLY
HAS 4 MEMBERS,

YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO HAVE
ANY SORT OF INPUT.

TO KEEP THE PEACE?

DID NOTHING.

SOME FORM OF RULES

LIKE IT OR NOT,

THAT MORE THAN A FEW

ARE GONNA LOOK
AT THIS LITTLE LAW

00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:30,190
WHY DON'T WE START BY
GETTING YOU A BATH AND
A COUPLE OF HOT MEALS?

445
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,058
(MINORI CRIES)

446
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:36,162
[ISAAC] OK. YOU GOT US ALL
EARS NOW. TELL US WHAT YOU WANT.

447
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,598
WE'D LIKE TO HELP OUT,

448
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,032
BUT WE'RE NOT
GONNA AGREE ON MUCH

449
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,202
IF WE HAVE THE THREAT OF
BLACKMAIL HANGING OVER US.

450
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,670
HELP US OUT, SHIROE.

451
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,272
[SHIROE] COME ON, GUYS.
THINK ABOUT IT.

452
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,842
NOBODY HAS A SENSE OF SAFETY
OR SECURITY RIGHT NOW.

453
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,546
DON'T WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION
TO OURSELVES TO KEEP THE PEACE?

454
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,882
I HAVE TWO GOALS FOR
THIS COUNCIL OF OURS.

455
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,251
THE FIRST THING IS TO
CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE

456
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,153
WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T
AFRAID OF SOME BULLY

457
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,488
BREATHING DOWN THEIR
NECK ALL THE TIME.

458
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:06,927
[WOODSTOCK W] HMM...
[SHIROE] AND ONCE THAT'S DONE,
CREATE LAWS THAT ARE BINDING

459
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:11,598
ON EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE,
VISITS HERE, OR TAKES
UP BUSINESS HERE.

460
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,601
DOES ANYONE HAVE AN
ISSUE WITH THAT?

461
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,971
(CHIME)

462
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:21,575
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD, THE OPERATION
ON HAMELIN WAS A SUCCESS.

463
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,776
HM...

464
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:26,379
[ISAAC] YOU BETTER START
TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY!

465
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,250
YOU WANT THIS TO
HAPPEN SO BAD? FINE.

466
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,986
THEN THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO KNOW IN RETURN.

467
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,488
YOU AND YOUR GUILD
OBVIOUSLY PUT THIS
THING TOGETHER.

468
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:39,459
SO LET'S GO OVER
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL
AND WORK IT OUT.

469
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,629
[SHIMMER]

470
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:17,658
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
SHIROE HAS SUCCEEDED IN
LIBERATING THE NEW PLAYERS.

471
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,826
BUT HIS BATTLE CONTINUES.

472
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,763
HIS GOAL IS TO CREATE A
PLACE WHERE HE BELONGS,

473
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:25,431
BUT IT WILL BE FOR MORE
THAN HIMSELF ALONE.

474
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,934
HE HAS FRIENDS AND PEOPLE
IN NEED OF PROTECTION.

475
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:32,539
AND EVERYONE NEEDS A PLACE
WHERE THEY CAN SIT UNDER
THE STARS AND EAT CURRY.

476
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,676
[SHIROE]
THIS IS OUR REALITY.
