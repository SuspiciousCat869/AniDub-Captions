2
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:10,420
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
SO, THIS IS AKIHABARA.

3
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,461
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE
BIT MUCH FOR YOU.

4
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:15,532
NO, IT'S NOT.

5
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:18,236
YES, I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO HANDLE IT.

6
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:21,475
AND I'M SURE THE
NOBLES WOULD AGREE.

7
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:25,652
[KRUSTY] PRINCESS, I NEED TO
TAKE CARE OF SOME BUSINESS
OVER AT MY GUILD.

8
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:28,691
MY FRIENDS WILL ACCOMPANY
YOU UNTIL I COME BACK.

[SHIROE] WE HAVEN'T INTRODUCED
OURSELVES YET, HAVE WE?

10
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,001
I AM SHIROE OF
LOG HORIZON.

11
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,905
THIS IS OUR NINJA,
AKATSUKI.

12
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:37,240
HMM.

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,411
IT'S TRULY AN HONOR TO
MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

14
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:42,852
SO, WHAT SHOULD I DO TO
GET STARTED WITH THIS
PROJECT OF MINE, ANYWAY?

15
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:48,731
[SHIROE] UH, TO START WITH,
WE NEED TO GET YOU OUT
OF THE STREET, OK?

16
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:51,102
HUH?

17
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:26,392
(MICHITAKA GROANS)
THEY LEFT ME IN CHARGE,

18
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:29,431
BUT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANYTHING
INTERESTING FOR ME TO DO.

19
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:32,672
I HOPE SHIROE AND THE
PRINCESS ARE HAVING FUN.

20
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,245
A BLACKSMITH ISN'T VERY
GOOD AT DOING NOTHING.

21
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,984
I GOTTA FIND MYSELF
SOMETHING TO FIX.

22

(WOMEN GIGGLING)
HUH?

AWW, POOR SOUJIRO'S
LOOKING SLEEPY.

28
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:54,750
THEN MAYBE I'LL
SING HIM A LULLABY.

29
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,856
[WOMAN] NO, I WILL!
[WOMAN 2] NO, I WILL.

30
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:59,960
[NAZUNA] BE CALM. THIS IS
JUST PART OF THE JOB!

31
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,962

WHAT EVENT SHE'S GOING TO.

40
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:34,061

WE HAVE ALL BEEN
ANXIOUSLY AWAITING

44
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,860
THE ARRIVAL OF THE FAMOUS
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,966
[SHIROE] THANKS.
[KARASHIN] I AM KARASHIN,
THE TRADER.

46
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,334
IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU.

THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE, SIR.

49
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:02,117
SO, A REAL PRINCESS, HUH?

50
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:04,454
MORE LOVELY THAN I'D HEARD.

52
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:08,864
[SHIROE] HMM. I THINK WE NEED
SOMETHING WITH IMPACT.

53
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:11,435
THE FIRST IMPRESSION
SHOULD BLOW THEM AWAY.

54
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:12,972
DO YOU HAVE ANY
VALKYRIE MAIL?

55
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:16,078
[KARASHIN] WE DO, AND WE HAVE
ABOUT 7 DIFFERENT STYLES.

56
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:20,186
BETWEEN MODEL VARIATIONS
AND OUR OWN ORIGINAL DESIGNS,
WE HAVE PLENTY OF OPTIONS.

00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:22,625
[SHIROE] THE TOUGH PART'S GOTTA
BE GETTING HER A DECENT WEAPON.

58
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,194
WE GOTTA GET HER
SOMETHING UNDER LEVEL 4.

59
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:25,764
[ASHLIN] UH, UM?
[RAYNESHIA] HUH?

60
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,969
[TARO] OH, WOW!
IT'S A REAL PRINCESS!

61
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,204
[LILIANA]
SHE LOOKED RIGHT AT US.

62
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:31,108
[ASHLIN] SHE'S SO CUTE!

63
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,277
(RAYNESHIA GIGGLES)

64
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:34,048
[ALL] OH MY GOD, SHE SMILED!

65
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,719
[KARASHIN] THIS IS A
SINGLE‐HANDED WEAPON
WITH HIGH ATTACK POWER.

66
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,424
[SHIROE] WE NEED SOMETHING
FLASHY, BUT NOT TOO FLASHY.
[TARO] PRINCESS, ARE YOU HUNGRY?

67
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:42,631
[RAYNESHIA] SURE.
UM, I COULD EAT.

68
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:44,001
[TARO] THEN HERE, HAVE THIS.

69
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,238
YOU EVER EATEN
A CRESCENT BURGER?

70
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:51,850
OH, MAN. YOU TOTALLY GOT THESE
HERE WITH PERFECT TIMING.

71
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,319
[LILIANA] SHIROE ASKED
ME TO BRING THEM OVER

72
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,890
AS SOON AS THE
PRINCESS GOT HERE.

73
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,258
[ASHLIN] CRESCENT
BURGERS ARE, LIKE,

74
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:59,031
THE YUMMIEST

(RAYNESHIA GIGGLES SOFTLY)

76
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:02,470
[TARO] SHE ATE IT!

77
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:04,374
[ASHLIN] SHE TOTALLY
EATS LIKE A PRINCESS!

FOOD AROUND HERE.

[SHIROE] CAN YOU HELP HER
WITH THIS, AKATSUKI?

87
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,442
[AKATSUKI] RIGHT.

[LILIANA] WE'LL BE
GLAD TO HELP, TOO.

89

YOU GUYS HELP ME OUT

96
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:39,111
I THINK IT'S SHOWING OFF
TOO MANY OF MY CURVES.

97
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:41,850
AND IT'S MAKING SOME OF THEM
EVEN CURVIER, YOU KNOW?

98
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,154

100
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,329

[SHIROE] EVERYONE, THANK YOU
FOR MAKING IT OUT HERE EARLY

(RAYNESHIA WHIMPERS)

117
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,622
[SHIROE] WE HAVE
SIGHTED AND ENGAGED

118
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,994
AN ARMY OF UP TO
20,000 GOBLINS

IN THE NORTHERN
KONTO HILLS.

120
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:42,470
THEIR ADVANCE IS
THREATENING THE LEAGUE
OF FREEDOM CITIES EASTAL.

121
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:46,345
IF WE STAY HERE, THERE'S
A GOOD CHANCE EASTAL WILL
SURVIVE THE ASSAULT.

122
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,652
HOWEVER, THEY WILL LOSE 30%
OF THEIR ARMIES IN THE BATTLE.

123

[RAYNESHIA] OH!
(CROWD MURMURING)

124

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

126
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,175
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] EVERYONE
HERE KNOWS BATTLE STRATEGY.

127
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:04,649
THEY CAN READ MAPS, AND THEY'RE
PLOTTING MOVES ALREADY?

128
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:09,024
HOW DO THEY KNOW ALL THIS?
THEY'RE REALLY THAT INTELLIGENT?

129
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:10,927
THE ADVENTURERS HERE,

130
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:13,299
THEY REALLY ARE MORE
THAN FOOT SOLDIERS.

131
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,207
DOES THAT MEAN THEY
MIGHT EVEN KNOW MORE THAN
OUR MILITARY OFFICERS,

132
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:20,013
OR THE MEMBERS OF
GRANDFATHER'S COURT?

133
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:24,054
OK, SO, WHAT DOES
THAT MAKE NOBLES?

134
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:27,561
WHAT ARE COMMONERS AND SERFS,
FOR THAT MATTER?

135
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,364
OF COURSE, IT'S SAFE TO SAY

DEFENDING AKIHABARA
FROM AN ARMY OF GOBLINS

137
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:34,742
WOULD NOT BE ALL
THAT DIFFICULT.

138
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:37,548
AND WE'RE NOT OBLIGATED
TO HELP ANYONE.

139
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:41,022
WE COULD JUST LET EASTAL
HANDLE IT THEMSELVES.

140
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:42,357
[RAYNESHIA] UH!

HOWEVER, THERE'S SOMEONE HERE

00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:51,442
WHO I THINK WE SHOULD
LISTEN TO FIRST.

145
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:52,911
[RAYNESHIA] HUH?

146
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,517
ALL RIGHT, THEN. YOU'RE UP.

UH! OH, MY GOD.

153
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,742
WHAT... WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?

(RAYNESHIA INHALES, SIGHS)

156
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:45,817
EVERYONE. IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

157
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:48,356
I AM AN ENVOY
FROM MY GRANDFATHER,

158
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:50,226
THE HIGH LORD SERJIAD COWEN,

159
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:52,430
THE LEADER OF EASTAL'S
FREEDOM CITIES.

160
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,537
I AM PRINCESS RAYNESHIA
EL‐ARTE COWEN.

161
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:59,344
I AM HERE TO MAKE A
REQUEST OF YOU TODAY.

162
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:02,150
IT GOES BEYOND MASTER
SHIROE'S EXPLANATION.

163
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,123
ALL OF THE YAMATO ISLAND
CHAIN IS IN GRAVE DANGER,

164
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:07,595
AND WE CAN NO LONGER
CALL UPON OUR GUARDIANS,

165
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:08,963
THE IZUMO KNIGHTS.

166
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,834
THIS SITUATION HAS PUT
US IN THE POSITION

167
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:14,542
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE
ASSAULT FROM THE GOBLIN
ARMIES ON OUR OWN.

168
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:16,546
I'M ASHAMED TO
ADMIT THIS TO YOU,

169
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:18,517
BUT EVEN MY GRANDFATHER
AND HIS COURT

170
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:23,092
HAVE NOT COME TO AGREE
ON WHAT THE PROPER COURSE
OF ACTION SHOULD BE.

171
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:25,296
EVEN MORE THAN THAT...

172
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:27,300
DURING OUR RECENT
DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCE,

173
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,641
WE ACTUALLY TRIED TO FORCE YOU
TO PERFORM OUR OWN DUTIES

174
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,310
TO PROTECT OUR CITIES.

175
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,150
WE WERE PREPARED TO DEMAND
THIS FROM ALL OF YOU.

176
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,254
AS IF THE ADVENTURERS,
LIKE ALWAYS,

177
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:38,990
WERE JUST GOING TO
ACCEPT OUR ORDERS

178
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:41,729
TO FIGHT FOR US
WITHOUT QUESTION.

179
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:44,067
FOR THIS, I AM...

180
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,808
I AM TERRIBLY SORRY
FOR THIS ASSUMPTION.

181
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:51,649
AND ALSO, I MUST APOLOGIZE
TO YOU ONCE AGAIN,

182
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:55,290
BECAUSE I HAVE ANOTHER SELFISH
REQUEST TO MAKE OF ALL OF YOU.

183
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:00,333
WE HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER
IN THE WAY OF COMPENSATION
FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO ASK.

184
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,139
WHEN I LOOK AROUND AT ALL
OF YOU, I START TO UNDERSTAND.

185
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,942
THERE'S NOTHING
I REALLY CAN OFFER.

186
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,646
YOU'RE ALREADY SO PROSPEROUS.

187
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:09,619
YOU'RE ALREADY FREE IN THE
TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD.

188
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:12,658
AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANYTHING BETTER THAN THAT.

189
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:16,465
BUT PLEASE, AS A DAUGHTER
AND HEIR OF THE COWEN FAMILY,

190
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:20,273
I HAVE A DUTY TO MY PEOPLE
TO PROTECT OUR CITY.

191
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:22,678
I'M NOT VERY BRAVE...

192
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:23,580
I'M LAZY...

193
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,817
AND AN ORNAMENT WITH A TITLE.

194
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:31,929
BUT IN SPITE OF THAT,
I'M GOING TO FIGHT!

IN THE END, I HAVE NO CHOICE.

198
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,659
ALL I CAN OFFER IS MY THANKS,

199
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,231
AND I CAN ONLY HOPE IT'S ENOUGH.

200
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:50,734
WILL YOU FIGHT BY MY SIDE,

201
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,472
IN THE NAME OF YOUR GOODWILL,
PEACE, AND FREEDOM?

202
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:58,950
IF SO, I WILL DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO PROTECT THE
FREEDOM OF ALL ADVENTURERS.

203
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,658

AM THE STRATEGIST.

ALL FLUSTERED ABOUT NOW?

THE HECK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

226
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,843
A NOBLE SHOULDN'T STAND UP IN
FRONT OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

HER WEAKNESSES!

DID VERY WELL.

SURE IT WORKED?

230
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:28,697
LET'S GO. OK?

231
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:30,266
[RAYNESHIA] UHH.

232
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,639
[SHIROE] IN THIS OPERATION,
OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS SPEED.

233
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:50,741
[TAKAYAMA] WHY IS THAT?

234
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:52,109
WE CAN'T BE SURE
WHAT THE GOBLINS

235
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,849
WILL DO AFTER THIS,
BUT I HAVE A GUESS.

236
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:57,320
ONCE THEY'RE DONE EATING
THEIR FILL IN THE MOUNTAINS,

237
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,890
THEY'RE PROBABLY
HEADED HERE.

238
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,961
[AKATSUKI] THEN THE CITY
WOULD BECOME A WAR ZONE.

239
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:03,933
[TAKAYAMA] YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S
JUST ONE POSSIBILITY, RIGHT?

240
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,374
KNOWING WHAT THEY WANT
TO HIT GIVES THEM THE
ADVANTAGE, FOR NOW.

241
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:08,677
THAT'S A FACT.

242
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:10,847
SO, WE HAVE TO MOVE
FASTER THAN THEM.

243
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:13,251
[TAKAYAMA] IN THAT CASE,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE
THE ADVENTURERS

244
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,122
LEAVE AS SOON AS THEY'RE READY.

245
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:16,057
[SHIROE] YES.

246
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:17,961
[AKATSUKI]
I UNDERSTAND,
MY LORD.

247
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:21,335
THAT WOULD BE WHY WE'RE USING
THE STEAMSHIP, ISN'T IT?

248
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,607
[SHIROE] IT MIGHT NOT BE IDEAL
TO GET EVERYTHING DONE,

249
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:28,115
BUT IT WILL GET FIRST
BATTALION TO NARASHINO
PORT AS FAST AS WE CAN.

250
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,821
WE CAN COME BACK
FOR MORE AFTERWARDS.

251
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:34,494
KRUSTY, I'LL LEAVE
THE OCYPETE TO YOU.

252
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:37,801
[KRUSTY] RIGHT. AND
YOU'RE DOING WHAT?

253
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,039
I HAVE SOMETHING
GOING ON.

254
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,344
[MICHITAKA] THE MIDRAUNT
EQUESTRIAN PARK?

255
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:43,713
[SHIROE, VOICE‐CHAT] YES.

256
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,984
THERE ARE ONLY WILD
ANIMALS IN THAT AREA,

257
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:47,319
AND NONE OF THOSE MONSTERS.

258
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,360
THE LOCATION'S IDEAL
TO SET UP A HEADQUARTERS.

259
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,364
[MICHITAKA]
HOW MANY PEOPLE?

260
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,533
[SHIROE] AROUND 1,200.

261
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,571
[MICHITAKA] 1,200? JEEZ.

262
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,173
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT THAT MANY.

263
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,879
[SHIROE] THE PRINCESS TOOK
A CHANCE AND IT PAID OFF.

264
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:01,616
[MICHITAKA] I GUESS SO.

265
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,522
[SHIROE] WE'LL BE THERE
THIS AFTERNOON AND WE
CAN WATER OUR HORSES.

266
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,224
AND ONCE THAT SHIP DROPS ANCHOR,

267
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:09,999
WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO
BELONGS IN WHAT GROUPS
AND WITH WHAT SKILLS.

268
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,707
[MICHITAKA] I'LL CONTINUE
TO KEEP AN EYE ON OUR
NOBLEMEN FRIENDS.

269
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:16,646
SORRY YOU'RE HAVING
TO DO ALL THIS ALONE.

270
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,416
[SHIROE] NOT AT ALL.
THANK YOU.

271
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:22,958
[MICHITAKA] UHH. I WANTED
THE CHANCE TO SEE THE
OCYPETE LEAVE PORT.

272
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:24,695
[HENRIETTA] MICHITAKA?
[MICHITAKA] HUH?

273
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,432
[HENRIETTA] SOMEONE'S
HERE FOR YOU.

274
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,168
A VISITOR?

275
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:35,249
[SERJIAD] MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S
ACTIONS RISK SPLITTING THE
SOLIDARITY OF THE LEAGUE.

276
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:37,286
[MICHITAKA] I ASSUME THEY'RE
CONCERNED THAT THE COWEN FAMILY

277
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:40,794
HAS BEEN WORKING SECRETLY
WITH THE ROUND TABLE
ON A SEPARATE DEAL?

278
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:42,163
[SERJIAD] INDEED.

279
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:45,403
WELL, I'M SURE THE PRINCESS
HAD NO SUCH DESIGNS.

280
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:48,208
I'M AFRAID HER INTENTIONS
ARE NOT RELEVANT.

281
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:52,349
THE LORDS WILL ALLOW
THEIR PERCEPTIONS TO
LEAD THEIR ACTIONS.

282
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,722
[MICHITAKA] I UNDERSTAND.
AND THEY PROBABLY BELIEVE

283
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:57,528
THAT MAIHAMA IS TRYING
TO ESTABLISH MORE POWER

284
00:14:57,628 --> 00:15:00,132
WITH AKIHABARA AT ITS SIDE.

285
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,871
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY, CORRECT?

286
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:05,075
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON THE MATTER?

287
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,779
WHERE DO YOUR PEOPLE STAND?

288
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,317
WHERE DO WE STAND?
UHH. HUH.

289
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:12,658
MM. WHY DON'T WE LISTEN TO
WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND FIRST,

290
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,060
LORD SERJIAD?

291
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,764
[HENRIETTA] WE DON'T KNOW
IF THE ROUND TABLE'S

292
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,668
IN A POSITION TO ACCEPT
A PROPOSAL LIKE THAT.

293
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:19,805
[MICHITAKA] HEH.
[SERJIAD] HMM.

294
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:21,543
I CAN SEE YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

295
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:23,913
[MICHITAKA] LOOK, I'M SORRY,
BUT I GOTTA SAY THIS.

296
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:25,382
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET ANYWHERE

297
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,788
IF WE KEEP QUESTIONING
EACH OTHER'S INTENTIONS.

298
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:30,025
HONESTLY, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO GET FROM ALL THIS?

299
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,497
[SERJIAD] HMM.
FIRST I'D LIKE TO SEE

300
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,167
THE GOBLINS EXTERMINATED.

301
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,308
THE PROTECTION OF OUR
PEOPLE IS A NECESSITY.

302
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,514
ALL RIGHT. I CAN
APPRECIATE THAT.

303
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:43,587
SO, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU
THINK WE SHOULD DO HERE?

304
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:47,995
[SERJIAD] WELL, I HAVE
ABANDONED THE IDEA OF HAVING
THE ROUND TABLE JOIN THE LEAGUE

305
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,032
AS A MEMBER OF NOBILITY.

306
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,401
[HENRIETTA AND MICHITAKA] HUH?
[SERJIAD] IN FACT,

307
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:53,840
I WOULD LIKE TO
APOLOGIZE FOR OFFERING YOU

308
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,144
A NOBLE TITLE IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

309
00:15:56,244 --> 00:15:59,383
IT WAS RUDE OF ME TO
OFFER SUCH A POSITION.

310
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:01,421
I UNDERSTAND NOW
THAT THE ROUND TABLE

311
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:03,893
AND THE COMMUNITY OF
AKIHABARA ARE FORCES

312
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:06,933
THAT RIVAL EASTAL IN
BOTH STRENGTH OF FORCE

313
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,170
AND ITS STABILITY OF STRUCTURE.

314
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,307
IN THE END, IT WOULD
NEVER HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE

315
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:16,251
TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR PEOPLE A
COHESIVE PART OF OUR ALLIANCE.

316
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,423
SO, HOW DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
PROCEED, MOVING FORWARD?

317
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:22,698
[SERJIAD] I WOULD THINK IT BEST
TO MAKE A NON‐AGGRESSION PACT

318
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:24,935
AND CREATE A FORMAL TRADE TREATY

319
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:28,341
AND USE IT AS THE BASIS
FOR FURTHER RELATIONS.

320
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:31,214
IF WE COULD TAKE
EACH OTHER'S HANDS
AS SIMPLE NEIGHBORS?

321
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:33,151
THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY
GOOD PLACE TO START.

322
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:37,459
THERE'S ONE THING...
THE ISSUE WITH THE GOBLINS
IS GOING TO BE A RECURRING ONE.

323
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:41,636
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
CONCERNING THE INEQUALITY
BETWEEN OUR TWO DEFENSES?

324
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:46,846
[SERJIAD] THE INEQUALITY
BETWEEN ADVENTURERS
AND PEOPLE OF THE LAND?

325
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:48,583
HMM.

326
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:49,752
HMM.

327
00:16:50,987 --> 00:16:53,125
[MICHITAKA] UHH...
[HENRIETTA] OH. OH.

328
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,962
[MICHITAKA] WELL, WE DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW.

329
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,666
WITHOUT KRUSTY,
THE PRINCESS, AND SHIROE,

330
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,401
WE CAN'T REALLY MAKE
THOSE SORTS OF DECISIONS,

331
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:00,506
SO, LET'S WAIT
FOR THEIR INPUT.

332
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:03,111
WHY DON'T WE JUST TABLE THAT
DISCUSSION FOR ANOTHER TIME?

333
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,817
(MICHITAKA AND HENRIETTA LAUGH)

334
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,086
[SERJIAD] HMM.

335
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:09,423
UHH. I'M SURE
SHIROE CAN FIND A WAY

336
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,796
TO WORK ALL OF
THE LOGISTICS OUT.

337
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,967
RIGHT. VERY WELL.

338
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,505
THEN I SHALL HAVE MY
GRANDDAUGHTER HANDLE THIS.

339
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:20,747
RAYNESHIA CAN TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
NEGOTIATIONS MOVING FORWARD.

340
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:24,487
(CROWD CHEERING)

341
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:30,399
(FIREWORKS REPORT)

342
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:39,685
(SIGH)

343
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:41,487
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

344
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,160
RUNNING INTO THAT MEETING AND
RAISING MY VOICE TO EVERYONE?

345
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,770
THEN I GO AND HUMILIATE
GRANDFATHER AND THE FAMILY
AND JUST GO RUNNING OFF?

346
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,682
THEN I GAVE A SPEECH IN FRONT
OF A BUNCH OF STRANGERS IN
THESE EMBARRASSING CLOTHES.

347
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,723
I GOT SO SWEPT UP, I JUST
SAID WHATEVER CAME TO MIND.

348
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:03,198
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WANTS
TO FORGET ALL ABOUT THIS
AND GO BACK TO HER COMFY BED.

349
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,369
THAT... THAT'S REALLY
NOT TRUE, YOU KNOW.

350
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:07,608
YOU'RE NOT SOUNDING
VERY CONFIDENT.

351
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,677
MM.

352
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:11,347
[KRUSTY] AND YOU LOOK
KIND OF MISERABLE.

353
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:13,720
[RAYNESHIA] I SAID
WHAT I NEEDED TO.

354
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,259
BUT I'M AWARE OF THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE RISKING YOUR LIVES TODAY,

355
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,363
SO, IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT
I SHOULD JOIN THE FIGHT

356
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:22,203
AND SHARE THOSE RISKS
WITH ALL OF YOU.

357
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:23,907
[KRUSTY] HMM.

358
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,777
EVER SINCE
I WENT TO AKIHABARA,

359
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:29,985
I GUESS I'VE BEEN...
I'VE BEEN FEELING DOWN.

360
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,054
[KRUSTY] FEELING DOWN?

361
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:32,691
[RAYNESHIA] I WAS LOST THERE...

362
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,464
NOT RECOGNIZING
ANYTHING OR KNOWING
WHAT YOUR WORLD WAS LIKE.

363
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:39,739
I REALLY WAS A BIRD IN
A GILDED CAGE, WASN'T I?

364
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,577
WHERE I COME FROM,

365
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:46,051
WOMEN DON'T HAVE ANY REAL
POLITICAL POWER TO SPEAK OF.

366
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:47,688
BUT OF COURSE, THERE I WENT,

367
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:50,125
PROMISING TO PROTECT
PEOPLE'S FREEDOMS.

368
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:52,798
NO ONE IS EVER GOING
TO LET ME DO THAT.

369
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,706
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU WERE THE FIRST
TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY FREEDOM

370
00:18:56,806 --> 00:18:58,475
AND TAKE ME INTO
BATTLE WITH YOU.

371
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:01,716
SO, I WANT TO PROTECT
THEIR FREEDOM IF I CAN.

372
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:05,489
I WANT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING.

373
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:11,635
OF COURSE, IF I END
UP DYING OUT THERE,

374
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:14,440
WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T
DO WON'T MATTER.

375
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:20,152
[KRUSTY] YOU'LL BE FINE.
[RAYNESHIA] HUH? WHAT?

376
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,891
[KRUSTY] LISTEN, IT'S MORE‐
[TAKAYAMA] THE FORMATIONS
ARE IN POSITION

377
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,027
AND READY, MY LORD.

378
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:26,031
[KRUSTY] RIGHT. THANK YOU, MISA.

379
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,101
WE'LL TALK MORE LATER.

380
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:36,351
[MARIELLE] OH, GOODY, GOODY.
WELCOME BACK!

381
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,088
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE!

382
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:39,357
YEAH, YEAH,
I MISSED YOU, TOO,

383
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:41,061
BUT I CAN'T BREATHE,
MARIELLE!

384
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,263
YOU GUYS WERE
GREAT OUT THERE.

385
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:43,498
I'M, LIKE, REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

386
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,969
[TOYA] YEAH, WELL,
WE DO WHAT WE CAN.

387
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:48,008
WELL, I SUPPOSE WE DID
ALL RIGHT, DIDN'T WE?

388
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:49,945
THANKS A LOT,
MISS MARIELLE.

389
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:52,083
[NAOTSUGU] COME ON. GO AHEAD
AND DO SOME BRAGGING.

390
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:55,089
[TOYA] I DON'T THINK SO.
WE STILL HAVE A LOT MORE
FIGHTING TO DO.

391
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:58,662
[NAOTSUGU] I GUESS WE CAN
SAY WE MADE IT THROUGH
THE FIRST MISSION, ANYWAY.

392
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:01,736
WE DID MANAGE TO KEEP CHOSHI
FROM GETTING TOTALLY CLOBBERED.

393
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:04,140
[MARIELLE] THE CAMP COUNSELORS
REALLY DID A SUPER JOB,

394
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,748
BUT THE NEW PLAYERS TOTALLY MADE
AN IMPACT IN THE BATTLES.

395
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:10,987
I WAS, LIKE, WONDERING
HOW I WAS GONNA ASK THEM
TO JOIN THE FIGHT,

396
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:12,524
BUT I REALLY DIDN'T NEED TO.

397
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:14,729
IT TURNED OUT THAT THEY
WANTED TO GO OUT THERE

398
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,297
AND GO FIGHT ON THEIR OWN.

399
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:18,201
DARN TOOTIN'
THEY DID.

400
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,805
WHEN IT COMES
DOWN TO IT,

401
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:22,343
IT WAS SUPER SHOCKING
TO ME TO FIND OUT

402
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:26,217
ALL THOSE PEOPLE OF THE
LAND HAVE THOUGHTS AND
FEELINGS JUST LIKE US.

403
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:27,788
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

404
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:30,425
THE WHOLE THING CAUGHT
ME BY SURPRISE, TOO.

405
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,865
BUT HEY, SHIROE SAW
IT BEFORE WE DID.

406
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,302
THEY REALLY ARE
HUMAN BEINGS, RIGHT?

407
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,841
AND ALL OF US
REALLY ARE GUESTS.

408
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:41,347
WE HAVE TO REALLY CHANGE THE
WAY WE LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE.

409
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:42,951
IT'S LIKE THE MORE
GAMES YOU'VE PLAYED,

410
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,991
THE HARDER IT IS TO ACCEPT
ALL THIS AS REALITY.

411
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:48,361
(CROWD CHATTER)
[MARIELLE] AND ALL THESE KIDS
NEVER KNEW THE OLD GAME

412
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:49,664
LIKE WE DID.

413
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,367
SO, IT WAS EASY FOR THEM
TO JUST LOOK AT THEM

414
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,639
LIKE THEY WERE REAL PEOPLE.

415
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,275
TOTALLY.

416
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,817
OK. EVERYONE,
WE'VE ALMOST DONE IT.

417
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,287
LET'S ALL PROTECT
THE TOWN OF CHOSHI.

418
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:03,458
ALL RIGHT! I KNOW
YOU CAN DO IT,

419
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,931
SO, LIKE, LET'S GIVE IT
OUR BEST, EVERYONE!

420
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,335
(CROWD CHEERING)

421
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,805
[TOYA] YEAH!
LET'S DO IT!

422
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:10,974
[MINORI]
COME ON, GUYS!

423
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:12,644
[RUDY] I HAVE
SO GOT THIS.

424
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:15,115
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE AN ADVENTURER!

425
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:16,919
[ISUZU] HMM?

426
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:18,556
BUT RUDY...

427
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,139
[KRUSTY] STAND BY FOR
FORMATION ASSIGNMENTS!

428
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,377
(CROWD CHEERS)

429
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:31,047
[TAKAYAMA] OK, HERE'S THE PLAN.

430
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:32,885
WE WILL BE FIGHTING
IN LEGION RAIDS.

431
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:36,692
WE WILL FORM 4 GROUPS
CONSISTING OF 24 MEMBERS EACH,

432
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,529
MAKING 96 IN ALL.

433
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,633
IS 96 GOING
TO BE ENOUGH?

434
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,469
WITH A FORCE
THAT LARGE,

435
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,207
IT'S HARD TO FIGHT
AS A SINGLE UNIT,

436
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:47,446
AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
GRASP THE OVERALL BATTLE.

437
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:51,622
[TAKAYAMA] IT WILL REQUIRE A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE TO COMMAND THEM.

438
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:54,628
BUT IN THAT RESPECT,
MY LORD IS THE BEST THERE IS.

439
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:57,466
[TAKAYAMA] TO BE HONEST,
IT IS WHERE HE EXCELS.

440
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:02,443
IN YAMATO, HE'S ONE OF
FEWER THAN 20 PEOPLE TO HAVE
COMMANDED AN ENTIRE ARMY.

441
00:22:02,544 --> 00:22:05,816
HIS EXPERIENCE, INSTINCTS,
AND POWERS OF CONCENTRATION

442
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,558
ALL COMBINE IN A WAY TO MAKE
HIM THE ULTIMATE COMMANDER.

443
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:11,562
[RAYNESHIA]
I UNDERSTAND,
I GUESS.

444
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,732
[TAKAYAMA] ONE MORE THING.
[RAYNESHIA] HUH?

445
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,371
[TAKAYAMA] I AM GIVING YOU
A GUARD OF 12 MEN.

446
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:18,141
BUT EVEN SO, PLEASE REFRAIN

447
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:20,580
FROM DOING ANYTHING
FOOLISH, MY LADY.

448
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,283
YOU DO UNDERSTAND ME, YES?

449
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,853
YES, I DO.

450
00:22:23,953 --> 00:22:26,224
[KRUSTY] WE'RE GETTING OFF AT
THE ABANDONED NARASHINO PORT.

451
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:29,463
FROM THERE, WE'RE GOING TO
THE WEST SIDE OF KASUMI LAKE,

452
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:32,369
SO WE HAVE 15 MILES TO COVER.

453
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:34,407
THEN, WE HEAD NORTH.

454
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:36,077
AND AS FAR AS THE GOBLINS GO...

455
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:37,446
[RAYNESHIA] UH.

456
00:22:37,547 --> 00:22:39,818
SPARE NONE OF THEM.

457
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,925
(CROWD CHEERS)

458
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:46,197
(THUNDER)

459
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:20,052
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
THERE WAS A YOUNG PERSON
WHO WANTED TO CHANGE.

460
00:24:20,152 --> 00:24:24,761
THEY THOUGHT AND THOUGHT,
AND FOUGHT AS HARD AS THEIR
SOUL AND STRENGTH WOULD ALLOW.

461
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,331
THEY WANTED TO PROTECT SOMEONE,

462
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,569
AND THAT'S ALL THEY
EVER REALLY WANTED.

463
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:31,976
EVEN IF THAT MEANT
SACRIFICING THEIR OWN LIFE.

464
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:34,113
NEXT TIME ON "LOG HORIZON."

465
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:37,153
[SHIROE] ALWAYS LOOK
30 SECONDS AHEAD.
