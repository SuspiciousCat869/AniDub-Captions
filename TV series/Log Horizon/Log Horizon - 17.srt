[NAOTSUGU, VOICE‐CHAT]
WE'VE ALMOST CLEARED THIS AREA.

3
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:10,043
WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED A SQUAD
OR TWO, SO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,177
[MINORI] UNDERSTOOD.

5
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,946
THERE'S A MESSAGE FROM NAOTSUGU.

6
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,148
LOOKS LIKE GOBLINS MIGHT
BE HEADED THIS WAY.

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,184
I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF I SEE
ANYTHING COMING. TOYA!

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,353
[TOYA] I'LL DRAW THEM OUT
WHEN THEY GET HERE, GOT IT?

9
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:25,258
[RUDY] THAT'S CRAZY. JUST
HOW FAR CAN MISS MINORI SEE WHEN
IT'S DARK LIKE THIS ANYWAY?

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,795
[SERARA] SHE'S USING SOME
MAGIC EYE DROPS THAT
NAOTSUGU LENT HER.

11
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:32,999
SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE
LIKE A CAT FOR A FULL DAY.

14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,274

THEY'RE ATTACKING THEM?

16
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,344
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NAOTSUGU?

17
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,913
THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE GONNA
LEAD IN THE EVACUATION!

18
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,481
THOSE KIDS CAN'T
DO IT ON THEIR OWN!

19
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,018
RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
NOT TRYING TO HOLD THEM OFF.

20
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,087
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
FIGHTING THEM INSTEAD.

21
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,455
[MARIELLE] WHAT?
[NAOTSUGU] LOOK...

22
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,891
THE GOBLINS DON'T HAVE A
PLACE TO FALL BACK TO.

23
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,492
AND THEY HAVE
NOTHING TO PROTECT.

24
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,261
SO WE NEED TO TAKE
THE FIGHT TO THEM.

25
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,863
DIRECTLY. THAT'S THE PLAN.

WHEN WE START
BEATING ON THEM.

29
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,970
THEY'RE STUPID AND CLUMSY
AND HAVE NO TRAINING,

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,471
LIKE GOBS ALWAYS ARE.

31
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,640
AS LONG AS THEY'RE GONNA KEEP
ON FIGHTING LIKE GOBLINS,

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,610
OUR BEST CHANCE IS TO
HIT THEM HARD AND FAST.

33
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,181

ABOUT IT, IT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY GOOD STRATEGY.

FOR BACKUP. WE GOT THIS, RIGHT?

36
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,459
IT'S GONNA
BE A LONG NIGHT.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,963
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DOING THIS ALONE,
THOUGH, ARE WE?

38
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:41,768
I'VE KIND OF GOT TO ADMIT IT,

40
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,141
NAOTSUGU AND HIS GROUP ARE
PREPARING A SURPRISE ATTACK.

41
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,245
[MICHITAKA] WHAT? BUT WE HAVEN'T
EVEN FINISHED DISCUSSING
EVERYTHING HERE YET.

42
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,347
IF YOU WERE OUT THERE
SEEING IT HAPPEN,

43
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,183
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT WHETHER
WE WERE NEGOTIATING.

44
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,921
OF COURSE. BUT HE DOES HAVE
A POINT ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT
BE PERCEIVED AS...

00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,856

46
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:08,795
WE HAVE TO AGREE ABOUT
THIS BEFORE THE NEXT
CONFERENCE CONVENES.

47
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,489
[SERJIAD] A PLOT?

48
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,326
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE
GOBLIN ATTACK IS ACTUALLY

49
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,729
BEING ORCHESTRATED BY
THE ADVENTURERS?

50
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,965
[TAIHAKU] IF THE
ADVENTURERS HAD ACTED TO
WEAKEN THEM FROM THE START,

51
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,400
THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE
HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

52
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,002

OF THEIR APOCALYPSE AT ALL.

[KASHIWAZAKI]
BARON KRENDITT,

55
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,343
RIGHT NOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
NO ONE WITHHOLD THEIR THOUGHTS.

56
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,779
THAT DOES US ABSOLUTELY
NO GOOD WHATSOEVER.

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,182
I WOULD THINK THAT'S
WHY WE'VE HELD THIS
CONFERENCE WITHOUT THEM.

58
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,887
[TAIHAKU] WELL, IN ALL
LIKELIHOOD, WE'RE PROBABLY GOING
TO LOSE CHOSHI BY NIGHTFALL.

59
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,924
AND THEN, IF THEY CONTINUE,
LORD KILIVA'S TERRITORY
IN TSUKUBA IS NEXT.

(KILIVA GROANS)

61
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,360
OR PERHAPS FURTHER.

SO WAIT, ARE THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND STILL HAVING
THEIR SECRET LITTLE MEETING?

64
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,408
PROBABLY. AND I THINK
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY

65
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,578
TO DO THIS WITHOUT
OUR INVOLVEMENT.

66
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,546
[SHIROE] THEY OBVIOUSLY
HAVEN'T DECIDED.

67
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,548
AND THEIR PRIDE'S
ON THE LINE HERE.

68
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,216

RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY THEY

69
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,585
DON'T WANT TO OWE
US ANYTHING.

70

[KRUSTY] IF HISTORY
TELLS US ANYTHING,

71
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,254
THEY ALREADY HAVE
SOMEONE FOR THIS JOB.

72
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,123
[SHIROE] RIGHT. A GROUP
EVEN MORE POWERFUL

75
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,263
[KRENDITT] SO IT'S
JUST AS WE FEARED.

76
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,200
YES. THE IZUMO KNIGHTS
DISAPPEARED.

77

AS TROUBLING AS IT IS,

86
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,890
WE MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THE
SITUATION AND MOVE FORWARD.

87
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,328
[KILIVA] WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE OUR
ONLY HOPE IS FOR ALL THE LORDS

88
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,564
TO UNITE AND ATTACK
THE GOBLINS TOGETHER.

STRATEGICALLY SPEAKING,

90
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,435
SURROUNDING THEM IS PROBABLY
THE MOST FEASIBLE PLAN,

91

FORCING THEM TO LAY SIEGE
TO A WELL‐DEFENDED CITY.

92

AND WHEN THEY ARE TIRED,

93
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,677
WE SURROUND THEM WITH A LARGE
COMBINED ARMY AND THEN ATTACK.

94
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,912
WELL, NOW... BASED ON
WHERE THEY WERE HEADED,

95
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,316
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ONLY WAY
TO ENTRAP THEM IS TO SACRIFICE
A CITY IN THE PROCESS.

THIS THING WITH THE GOBLINS...

148
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,295
I'VE NEVER SEEN FATHER
LOOK SO SERIOUS BEFORE.

149
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,131
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO GET HURT?

150
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,400
[NOBLEMAN WITH EPAULET]
IT WILL HAVE TO BE TSUKUBA.

151
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,068
IT IS A WELL‐DEFENDED CITY,

152
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,238
AND IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO
LAST QUITE A LONG TIME.

153
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,173
[KASHIWAZAKI] SO WHO'S
BREAKING THE NEWS TO KILIVA?

154
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,443
HE ISN'T GOING TO SIMPLY LOSE
A FEW VILLAGES AROUND TOWN.

155
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,747
I DON'T THINK MANY OF
HIS PEOPLE WILL SURVIVE.

156
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,418
WE'VE ALL BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT,

157
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,086
BUT NONE OF US
HAVE SAID IT YET.

158
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,089
WE MUST TRULY CONSIDER BRINGING
IN THE ADVENTURERS ON THIS.

159
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,027
OF COURSE. I MEAN, IF THEY DIE,
THEY SIMPLY RETURN TO LIFE.

160
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,864
AND THE DOWNSIDE IS, WELL, WE
WOULD BE LARGELY IN THEIR DEBT.

161
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,967
I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY WE
CANNOT TELL THEM ANYTHING

162
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,003
BUT GET AS MUCH INFORMATION
FROM THEM THAT WE CAN.

163
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,306
AS FAR AS THE SITUATION WITH
THE KNIGHTS IS CONCERNED,

164
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,242
WE MUST KEEP THAT
TO OURSELVES.

165
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,045
[RAYNESHIA] UH!
[KASHIWAZAKI] I DON'T KNOW A
THING ABOUT THOSE ADVENTURERS.

166
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,882
SO IF I HAVE TO LIE TO A FEW OF
THEM TO KEEP THEIR PROTECTION,

167
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,317
I WILL DO SO WITHOUT HESITATION.

168
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,087
[MICHITAKA] SO THEY FINALLY
BROKE DOWN AND CALLED US, HUH?

169
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,090
[KRUSTY] LOOKS LIKE THE WEST
WIND BRIGADE MADE IT IN, TOO.

170
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,694
YEAH. SOUJIRO JUST LET
ME KNOW ABOUT IT.

171
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,665
[SOUJIRO] IT'S HUGE.

172
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,099
[SHIROE] THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

173
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,836
THEY CAN'T GET IN UNTIL
THE CONFERENCE IS OVER.

174
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:34,240
[KRUSTY] WELL, HELLO, PRINCESS.
ISN'T IT PAST YOUR BEDTIME?

175
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,509
[RAYNESHIA]
HM. UH, LOOK, I‐

176
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:38,144
SOMETHING HAS
YOU CONCERNED.

177
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,347
YOU LOOKING FOR A WARM GLASS
OF MILK OR SOMETHING?

178
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,215
AH!

179
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,084
(GROANS)

180
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,187
[RAYNESHIA] SAY WHAT YOU
WANT ABOUT ME BEING LAZY,
EVEN A COWARD,

181
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,890
AND THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYTHING EXCEPT SLEEPING...

182
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,859
BUT I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF
THE HIGH LORD'S FAMILY.

183
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,795
AND I DON'T ALWAYS SLEEP EASILY.

184
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,997
[KRUSTY] SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

185
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,398
SERIOUSLY, THEN...

186
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,635
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND THAT WOULD
KEEP YOU UP SO LATE TONIGHT?

187
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,269
[RAYNESHIA] AH. HM.

188
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,574
[RAYNESHIA] I REMEMBER
YOU SAYING ONCE

189
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,343
THAT FREEDOM REQUIRES
A PERSON TO BE RESOLUTE.

190
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,778
[KRUSTY] THAT'S TRUE.

191
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,580
[RAYNESHIA] WELL, I HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU SAID.

192
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,783
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

193
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,428
[MINORI] YES, WE'RE FINE,
REALLY.

194
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,297
IT LOOKS LIKE WE TOOK CARE OF
ALL THE GOBLINS AROUND HERE.

195
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,068
AND WE'RE GETTING A CHANCE
TO REST RIGHT NOW.

196
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,605
THEY'RE STILL HEADING
NORTH‐NORTHWEST, YES? RIGHT.

197
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,675
ABOUT 3 CLICKS.
ROGER THAT.

198
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:45,111
YOU AND NYANTA TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELVES, OK?

199
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,350
[RUDY] MAGE'S GAUNTLETS?

200
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,086
[MINORI] NYANTA IDENTIFIED THEM
AND TOLD ME WHAT THEY WERE FOR.

201
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,055
THEY'RE JUST THE THING
FOR PEOPLE WHO USE

202
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,057
OFFENSIVE MAGICAL ATTACK SPELLS.

203
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,560
YOU CAN USE THEM ONCE YOU'VE
GOTTEN TO LEVEL 25.

204
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,229
[TOYA] LEVEL 25? JEEZ. HOW GOOD
CAN SOMETHING THAT PUNY BE?

205
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,666
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE THE
FIRST ITEM FOR ALL OF US

206
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,601
TO ACQUIRE BY WORKING TOGETHER.

207
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,003
HM. YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

208
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,606
[ISUZU] WE SPENT ALL THAT TIME
IN THE DUNGEON TO GET THEM.

209
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,374
THAT MAKES THEM PRETTY
COOL IF YOU ASK ME.

210
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,642
I MEAN, COME ON!

211
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,611
[RUDY] YUP,
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

212
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,245
[TOYA] OK! SO WHAT
DO WE DO WITH THEM?

213
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,516
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN ALL USE
THEM AT THE SAME TIME.

214
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:23,850
[ALL] HMM.

215
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,418
[ISUZU] GUYS...
[GROUP] HUH?

216
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,088
I KNOW! WHY DON'T WE
GIVE THEM TO RUDY?
[RUDY] HUH?

217
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,592
[ISUZU] THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE FOR PEOPLE WHO USE
ATTACK MAGIC, RIGHT?

218
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,093
[MINORI] YEAH, THEY ARE.

219
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,962
AND SINCE WE ONLY
HAVE ONE SORCERER...

220
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,099
WOW! I DON'T KNOW
IF I DESERVE IT.

221
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,669
[TOYA] THAT ISN'T LIKE YOU,
RUDY, ALL MODEST AND STUFF.

222
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,404
[RUDY]
OH SHUT IT, TOYA!

223
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:45,839
ARE YOU GUYS SURE?

224
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,474
I WANT TO DESERVE THEM.

225
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,813
AH...

226
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,681
[ISUZU] THEY LOOK
REALLY GOOD ON YOU.

227
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,282
[RUDY] HUH?
(CHUCKLES)

228
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,385
[MINORI] IT'S TIME TO GO. WE
NEED TO MOVE DOWN TO THE RAVINE.

229
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,222
AND LET'S REMEMBER OUR PATROL
OVERWATCH TECHNIQUES.

230
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,025
[RUDY] OK, I SWEAR
BY THESE GAUNTLETS,

231
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,060
I'LL BEAT EVEN
MORE GOBLINS!

232
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,995
[ISUZU] DON'T GET
TOO EXCITED.

233
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,497
[RUDY] COME ON! YOU GOT
TO HAVE SOME ENTHUSIASM.

234
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,266
[ISUZU] HM.

235
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,403
[ISUZU] SURE. LET'S GET 'EM.

236
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,808
[KRENDITT] GENTLEMEN, THANK
YOU FOR JOINING US HERE.

237
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,177
THE LORDS OF EASTAL APPRECIATE
YOUR PARTICIPATION

238
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,080
IN THIS MEETING, OF COURSE.
BUT OUR CURRENT...

239
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,783
[MICHITAKA] GOOD GRIEF.
THIS ISN'T GETTING US ANYWHERE.

240
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,319
[SHIROE] I'M GUESSING
HE'S WAITING FOR ONE
OF US TO SPEAK UP, YES?

241
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,189
BOTH OF US AND THE NOBLES WANT
INFORMATION ABOUT EACH OTHER

242
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,158
WITHOUT SACRIFICING
OUR OWN SECRETS.

243
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,828
SO, OF COURSE, WE SHOULD GO
WITH THE PLAN WE DISCUSSED.

244
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,664
IF I OFFER TO SEND
IN OUR OWN TROOPS,

245
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,033
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TELL US WHAT THEIR
TACTICAL SITUATION IS.

246
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,037
[SHIROE, THINKING] ALL RIGHT,
GENTLEMEN, THIS GAME OF CAT
AND MOUSE IS FUN, BUT...

247
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,775
CAN ANYONE HERE SUMMON
THE KNIGHTS OF IZUMO?

248
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,810
WE NEED TO WORK WITH THEM.

249
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,446
ALL RIGHT. I'LL
TAKE THAT AS A "NO."

250
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,618
WELL, THEN IT APPEARS TO
ME AS IF THE IZUMO KNIGHTS
ARE FAILING YOU.

251
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,086
THEY SHOULD BE
RUSHING TO YOUR AID.

252
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,954
[KRENDITT] THE IZUMO KNIGHTS
WON'T SHOW UP HERE

253
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,490
TO SIMPLY ERADICATE A
FEW SNARLING MONSTERS!

254
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,493
ADVENTURERS HAVE FAR MORE
EXPERIENCE WITH GOBLINS.

255
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:17,197
AFTER ALL, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOUR PEOPLE AREN'T IN
TROUBLE, TOO, YOU KNOW.

256
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,900
[KRUSTY] SO YOU'RE ASKING US TO
SEND PEOPLE TO HELP YOU FIGHT.

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,935
[KRENDITT] WELL,
YOU KNOW, I...

258
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,437
[MICHITAKA] ALL RIGHT. LOOK,
I THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF

259
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,407
THIS CONFERENCE WAS TO SHARE
THOUGHTS ON HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

260
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:31,377
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE
JUST INTERESTED IN GRILLING US!

261
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,848
[NOBLEMAN WITH EPAULET]
EXCUSE ME. THE AKIHABARA
KNIGHTS ARE SAID TO BE BRAVE

262
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,517
AND UNMATCHED IN COMBAT!

263
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:39,219
[SHIROE] IF BY "KNIGHTS,"
YOU ARE REFERRING TO
MILITARY OFFICERS

264
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,955
WHO ARE ALWAYS AT THE
READY TO FIGHT BATTLES...

265
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,490
THEN THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
A MISUNDERSTANDING, SIR.

266
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,227
AS A GROUP, WE ADVENTURERS
DO NOT HAVE AN ARMY.

267
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,831
THEN TELL ME, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU ADVENTURERS GOOD FOR?

268
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,699
WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

269
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,100
[KILIVA]
GIVE ME A BREAK!

270
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,802
YOU ADVENTURERS HAVE
BEEN BLESSED WITH

271
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,638
SPECIAL ABILITIES
FROM THE GODS!

272
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,305
YOU HAVE A DUTY
TO PROTECT THE LAND!

273
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,308
[MICHITAKA] OH, YEAH?
WELL, THAT'S NEWS TO ME, PAL.

274
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,745
THAT IS UTTER NONSENSE,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

275
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,246
YOU ARE INVINCIBLE!

276
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,148
AND DESPITE SUCH AN
INCREDIBLE GIFT,

277
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,084
YOU BLINDLY ABANDON
THE RESPONSIBILITIES
THAT COME WITH IT!

278
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,053
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELVES.

279
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,756
[MICHITAKA] SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

280
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,824
[KILIVA] GUH...

281
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,259
[MICHITAKA] FIRST OF ALL,
LAST I CHECKED,

282
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,427
NONE OF US ARE CITIZENS
OF THE FREEDOM CITIES!

283
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,830
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE NEVER BOTHERED
TO INVITE US TO ATTEND

284
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,799
ONE OF YOUR LITTLE
CONFERENCES HERE BEFORE!

285
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,400
SOUND ABOUT RIGHT?!

286
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,436
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF PLAN
YOU GUYS HAVE UP TO THIS POINT,

287
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,807
BUT THE ADVENTURERS HAVE NO
OBLIGATION TO BE ANY PART OF IT!

288
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,577
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE
WITH THAT, BARON KRENDITT?!

289
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:40,647
[KRENDITT] MR. MICHITAKA,
THE POINT WE'RE TRYING
TO GET ACROSS...

290
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,183
THAT IS TO SAY...
(TAIHAKU GROWLS)

291
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,052
GENTLEMEN, IN SPITE OF
WHAT SOME OF US HAVE SAID,

292
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,389
WE ARE NOT HERE TO REQUEST OR
DEMAND FIGHTERS FROM AKIHABARA.

293
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,457
REALLY? YOU'RE TELLING
ME THAT WE WERE INVITED

294
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,460
TO THIS CONFERENCE TO LISTEN
TO LORD KILIVA'S REQUEST,

295
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,764
AND THE LEAGUE OF FREEDOM
CITIES DISAGREES WITH HIM?

296
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,399
THAT'S A BIT PRESUMPTUOUS.

297
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,636
WHAT? ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF ACTING FOR MY OWN BENEFIT?

298
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,172
THAT IS AN INSULT TO ME AND
EVERYONE ELSE AT THIS TABLE!

299
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,341
[TAIHAKU] IT IS NOT
THE WILL OF THE LEAGUE.

300
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,277
BUT MANY OF US DO, INDEED,
SHARE LORD KILIVA'S CONCERN

301
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,113
ABOUT WHAT YOUR ROLE
IN THIS MIGHT BE.

302
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,749
WILL THE MIGHTY AND ALL‐POWERFUL
WARRIORS OF AKIHABARA

303
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:20,854
SIT THIS ONE OUT AND STAND
IDLY BY WHILE YAMATO FACES
CERTAIN DISASTER?

304
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,923
WE ARE NOT YOUR
STINKING GUARD DOGS.

305
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,025
[MICHITAKA] "OH, YOU GUYS
HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

306
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,460
GO AND KILL THE
GOBLINS FOR US."

307
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,929
WHAT KIND OF CRAP IS THAT?

308
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,931
JUST SENDING PEOPLE OUT
TO THE BATTLEFIELD TO DO

309
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,498
YOUR WORK FOR YOU IS DISGUSTING.

310
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,069
AND IT WON'T GAIN THE TRUST
OF THE PEOPLE OF AKIHABARA!

311
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,675
SORRY ABOUT THE TABLE.

312
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:46,046
[SHIROE, THINKING] MICHITAKA,
ALL OF US ADVENTURERS RISK
LOSING OUR MEMORIES WHEN WE DIE.

313
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,549
ANYONE WOULD GET UPSET
ABOUT THAT, NOT JUST YOU.

314
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,986
AND WHILE WE DID WANT
YOU TO PLAY THE VOICE
AGAINST SENDING TROOPS...

315
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,288
YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE JUST A
BIT OVERBOARD THERE, BUDDY.

316
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,092
I THINK MICHITAKA MIGHT
HAVE JUST BOXED US IN.

317
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,497
(FOOTSTEPS)
[AKATSUKI] HUH?

318
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:08,702
[SERJIAD] HM?

319
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,072
[SERJIAD] RAYNESHIA...

320

(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

321
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:26,386
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
OK, DEEP BREATHS HERE.

322
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,021
YOU ARE LOOKING
EXQUISITE, MADAM.

323
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,957
LIKE A FAIRY ON A LAKE
REFLECTING IN THE MOONLIGHT.

324
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,594
(LAUGHTER)

325
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:37,564
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.
I DON'T BELONG.

326
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,465
WHAT AM I DOING?

327
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,668
(EXHALES)

328
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,403
I JUST WANT TO GO TO BED.

329
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:47,508
I WANT TO WEAR MY PAJAMAS
AND JUST WISH THIS AWAY.

330
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:51,044
[KRUSTY] THE WARM MILK'S
IN THE KITCHEN, PRINCESS.

331
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,015
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] UH! NO!
NO, GET OUT OF MY HEAD!

332
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,617
I DID NOT JUST HEAR THAT.

333
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:00,787
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I ALREADY KNOW I'D
RATHER BE ASLEEP, BUT...

334
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,725
[SERJIAD] RAYNESHIA...

335
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:05,992
MASTER KRUSTY.

336
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:10,163
HM? YES, YOUR MAJESTY?

337
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,165
[RAYNESHIA] I AM
GOING TO AKIHABARA.

338
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,535
AND I NEED YOU TO TAKE ME.
[KRUSTY] HUH?

339
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:15,969
[NOBLEMAN] WHAT?
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS...

340
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,037
[KRENDITT] WHAT IS
THE MEANING OF THIS?

341
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:17,938
[KRUSTY] I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

342
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,172
WHY AKIHABARA?

343
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,174
[RAYNESHIA] TO RAISE
A VOLUNTEER ARMY.

344
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,676
[TAIHAKU, THINKING]
RIDICULOUS.

345
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,310
WHAT CAN ONE GIRL DO?

346
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,012
[KRENDITT, THINKING] SPEAKING
TO A FOREIGN BAND OF FIGHTERS

347
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,447
WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION?

348
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,683
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
PERMISSION TO DO THAT.

349
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,885
[KASHIWAZAKI, THINKING]
A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
THE ROUND TABLE

350
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,486
WILL BE ACCOMPANYING HER...

351
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,889
THAT COULD CHANGE
THINGS DRASTICALLY.

352
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,726
ARE YOU SURE? THAT'S
GOING TO BE AN ENORMOUS
UNDERTAKING, YOU KNOW?

353
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:40,894
[RAYNESHIA] YES.

354
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,262
AND WHY EXACTLY ARE
YOU INTERESTED?

355
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,330
YOU SAID THAT
ADVENTURERS WERE FREE.

356
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,033
THEY ARE FREE TO DO
AS THEY WISH.

357
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,503
I MAY BE NOTHING BUT
A STUPID GIRL TO YOU...

358
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,105
WHO ISN'T SUPPOSED TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT POLITICS.

359
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,641
HOWEVER, I WAS TAUGHT FROM
A VERY YOUNG AGE THAT YOU

360
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,143
SHOW RESPECT WHEN YOU ASK
FOR SOMETHING YOU WANT.

361
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,779
AND AS A MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY,

362
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,447
MY FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER
INGRAINED THIS IN ME.

363
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:02,783
THAT'S WHY.

364
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:05,819
I THINK IT'S IMPROPER THAT WE
SHOULD BE HIDING THE TRUTH.

365
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,189
THE FOREMOST TRUTH BEING WE
CAN'T FIND THE IZUMO KNIGHTS!

366
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,657
(REPRESENTATIVES
SPEAKING AT ONCE)

367
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,093
[TAIHAKU] TOLD THEM
OUR SECRET, OF COURSE!

368
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,395
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO
BREAK UP A PARTY, DON'T YOU?

369
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,197
WHEN I TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY,

370
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,499
I WANT YOU TO
APOLOGIZE WITH ME.

371
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,803
ALL RIGHT. WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU PLANNING, PRINCESS?

372
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:26,006
[RAYNESHIA] I GUESS
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS READ
MY MIND NOW, CAN YOU?

373
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,208
WELL, THERE IS NO PLAN.

374
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,044
IN FACT, I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA PULL THIS OFF,

375
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:34,114
BUT AS A MEMBER OF
THE COWEN FAMILY,

376
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,283
I CERTAINLY DO NOT WISH TO
BE INSULTING TO EVERYONE.

377
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,720
(CLAP RESOUNDS)
(CHATTER STOPS)

378
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,290
[RAYNESHIA] GRANDFATHER?
[SERJIAD] YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

379
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,026
[RAYNESHIA]
THE ADVENTURERS ARE FREE.

380
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,062
THEY HAVE MORE FREEDOM THAN ANY
OF US COULD EVER HOPE TO HAVE.

381
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,766
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE AMONG
US WHO IS ANYWHERE NEAR AS
STRONG AS AN ADVENTURER IS,

382
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:56,603
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE
JUST GET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THEM WHENEVER WE WANT.

383
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,005
WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO EXPLOIT ANYONE ELSE.

384
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:03,109
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW POWERFUL THEY ARE
OR HOW WEAK WE ARE.

385
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,245
THE TIME TO ASK
THEM IS NOW.

386
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,348
BUT I NEED TO GO TO AKIHABARA
WITH AN OPEN HEART.

387
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:12,252
MASTER KRUSTY SAID THAT EVERY
SINGLE ADVENTURER HAS FREEDOM.

388
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,621
SO IF ANY OF THEM WOULD
AGREE FREELY TO HELP US,

389
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,157
THEN WHY WOULD WE NOT
ENCOURAGE THAT TO HAPPEN?

390
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,259
EVEN IF I JUST FIND A DOZEN,

391
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,928
IT HAS TO BE WORTH THE TIME
I SPEND THERE, RIGHT?

392
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,397
MY GRANDFATHER TAUGHT ME
THAT THE REAL ART OF SHOWING

393
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,168
SOMEONE RESPECT ISN'T ABOUT
FANCY OR FORCEFUL TALKING.

394
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,703
I WILL GO THERE.

395
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,973
AND I'LL TALK TO EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF THEM IF I HAVE TO.

396
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,375

[KRUSTY] IT'S FINE. I THINK
SHE WAS JUST NERVOUS.

400
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,486

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,094
[SHIROE] SHE'S MADE
HER DECISION.

405
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:58,599
THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU GOING
TO ABIDE BY IT, "MASTER" KRUSTY?

STILL A LITTLE SCARY, HUH?

00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,656
[MINORI, THINKING]
HE'S RIGHT...

414
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:25,158
IT'S STILL DANGEROUS
OUT HERE FOR US.

415
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,594
WE REALLY HAVEN'T DEFEATED
VERY MANY ENEMIES.

416
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,363
WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL,
ALL OF US.

417
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,233
[TOYA] WHAT SCARES ME IS
HITTING SOFT GROUND, ROOTS,

418
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,035
AND ROCKS WHILE I'M
TRYING TO FIGHT.

419
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,738
[ISUZU] TELL ME ABOUT IT. IT'S
SO EASY TO LOSE YOUR BALANCE.

420
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:41,041
[SERARA] I'M ALWAYS ANXIOUS
BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW WHEN
THE ENEMY WILL APPEAR.

421
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:44,210
[TOYA] I THINK WE'RE ALL A BIT
MORE WEARY OF GOBLINS AT NIGHT,

422
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,779
BUT AT LEAST WE CAN
SMELL THEM COMING.

423
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:48,915
[RUDY] YEAH, AND
IT'S NOT A GOOD SMELL.

424
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,083
IT'S SUPER NASTY.

425
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,518
[TOYA] IT SURE IS.

426
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,954
BUT IN A WEIRD WAY, IT MAKES
ME WANT TO GO OUT THERE

427
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,522
AND FIGHT EVEN HARDER!

428
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,724
[ISUZU] YEAH! I CAN
GO ALONG WITH THAT.

429
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,392
[RUDY] THIS IS
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT...

HELPING THOSE IN TROUBLE,
LEAVING NO MAN BEHIND.

WE REALLY DON'T NEED TO
OVERTHINK THIS ALL THAT MUCH.

WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR NOW
IS GO OUT AND PROTECT THE
PEOPLE WE CARE FOR.

AND BE DONE WITH IT.

I'LL JUST DO MY JOB.

00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,281
AND THAT'S TO KEEP
EVERYBODY SAFE.

437
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,117
(GRIFFIN SCREECHES)

438
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,653
(RAYNESHIA WHIMPERING)

439
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,656
(SHIROE CHUCKLES)
[AKATSUKI] IS THERE
SOMETHING AMUSING, MY LORD?

440
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,526
[SHIROE] KRUSTY IS TOTALLY
BESIDE HIMSELF RIGHT NOW.

441
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,028
HE WAS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED.

442
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,899
I NEVER EXPECTED THE
PRINCESS TO STAND UP TO
THOSE NOBLES LIKE THAT.

443
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,433
I'M IMPRESSED.

444
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,235
IT'S ABOUT RESPECT.

445
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:43,870
[AKATSUKI] RESPECT?
[SHIROE] RIGHT.

446
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,438
WE COULD HAVE MADE ALL
THE PROMISES WE WANTED TO

447
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,907
BACK AT THE CASTLE,

448
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,776
AND NO ONE IN AKIHABARA WOULD
HAVE GONE ALONG WITH IT.

449
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:53,413
SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT
WE'RE ALL FREE.

450
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:56,583
SO TO WIN THEM OVER
AND CONVINCE THEM,

451
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,251
SHE MIGHT HAVE TO
SPEAK TO EACH ONE.

452
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,321
BUT, YEAH, SHE REALLY
SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND

453
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,756
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH US.

454
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:04,290
AND SHE KNOWS SHE HAS TO BE
RESPECTFUL WHEN SHE ASKS

455
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,926
FOR OUR HELP.

456
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:09,162
[AKATSUKI] OH, RIGHT. BUT
WOULDN'T THAT BE A BIT OBVIOUS?

457
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:10,731
[SHIROE] YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

458
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,567
IN FACT, IT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT
WE ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT IT

459
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,302
WHEN WE WERE AT THE TABLE
DEMANDING RESPECT.

460
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,271
WE ALMOST BLEW IT.

461
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,074
(WHIMPERING)

462
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,342
[RAYNESHIA] WHAT ARE
THOSE LIGHTS?

463
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,511
[KRUSTY] THAT'S AKIHABARA.

464
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:29,850
[RAYNESHIA] IT'S NIGHT.
THE LIGHT IS SO WARM.

465
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,286
(GRIFFIN CRIES)
(RAYNESHIA SCREAMS)

466
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,622
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
IMAGINE HOW AMAZING IT'D
BE IF SHE WAS THE ONE

467
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:38,224
WHO ENDS UP SAVING THE
FREEDOM CITIES OF EASTAL

468
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,561
FROM THE RUT THEY'RE STUCK IN.

469
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,898
THAT LAZY, COWARDLY PRINCESS.

470
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:17,223
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
SHE FINDS HERSELF IN
A TOWN SHE DOESN'T KNOW

471
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,727
WITH THINGS SHE'S NEVER SEEN,
THINGS SHE'S NEVER HEARD,

472
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,996
AND PEOPLE SHE'S NEVER MET.

473
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:26,800
SHE LEARNS HOW BIG THE WORLD
IS AND HOW TINY SHE IS.

474
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,570
SHE CRIES OUT WITH ALL HER
RESOLVE AND HER HOPE,

475
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,738
AND HER WORDS DRIVE THE
ADVENTURERS TO ACTION,

476
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,840
NEXT TIME ON "LOG HORIZON."

477
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,910
[SHIROE] ALWAYS LOOK
30 SECONDS AHEAD.
