1
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,272
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE CREATORS OF
"ELDER TALES" AMBITIOUSLY

2
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:10,210
MADE THE WORLD A ONE‐HALF‐SCALE
MODEL OF THE EARTH.

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,114
THE HALF GAIA PROJECT.

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,083
IN THIS WORLD, THE LAND WE
CONSIDER JAPAN IS KNOWN AS

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,486
THE CRESCENT ISLANDS OF YAMATO.

6
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:25,258
AND WE REFER TO THE FAR NORTH
AS THE EZZO EMPIRE.

7
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,391
[NAOTSUGU] BRIGANDIA'S THE
GUILD THAT'S BOSSING PEOPLE

8
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,227
AROUND IN SUSUKINO, RIGHT?

9
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,564
[AKATSUKI] THOSE GUYS HAD
A BAD REPUTATION BACK WHEN
THIS WAS JUST A GAME.

10
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:14,234
[NAOTSUGU] SHEESH. THEY GOT
TO BE LOVING ALL THESE
NEWBS TO PICK ON.

11
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,736
[SHIROE]
YES, THANK YOU.

12
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,203
HUH?

13
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,338
[SHIROE] LATER.

14
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,840
[NAOTSUGU]
HEY. WHAT IS IT?

15
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,407
[SHIROE] MARIELLE'S GONNA
DO WHAT SHE CAN TO GET

16
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,810
IN TOUCH WITH SERARA
AND GET BACK TO US ON IT.

17
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,178
WORKS FOR ME.

18
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,713
[AKATSUKI]
I'M CONCERNED.

19
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,382
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY DANGEROUS
MEETING THEM IN THE CITY.

20
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,752
WE'RE BOUND TO RUN
INTO BRIGANDIA.

21
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:35,355
[SHIROE] AND IF WE'RE OUT
IN THE OPEN AND WE'RE
CLOBBERED IN A FIGHT,

22
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:39,325
WE'D REVIVE BACK IN THE
AKIHABARA CATHEDRAL.

23
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:43,997
BUT SHE WOULD REVIVE
AT THE SUSUKINO CATHEDRAL.

24
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,431
[AKATSUKI]
I UNDERSTAND.

25
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,334
[NAOTSUGU] AND THE PROBLEM
IS SHE'S ON A BRIGANDIA

26
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,071
GUY'S FRIEND LIST, RIGHT?

27
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,639
[SHIROE] YEAH.

28
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,308
[SHIROE] SHE'S MANAGED TO FIND
A PRIVATE ZONE TO HIDE IN

29
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,878
SO THEY CAN'T FIND HER,

30
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,479
BUT THE SECOND SHE GOES OUT,

31
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,849
WHOEVER THAT GUY IS CAN USE HIS
HUD TO FIND WHEREVER SHE GOES.

32
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,519
[NAOTSUGU] SO WHEN IT'S
TIME FOR HER, SHE HAS
TO KEEP ON RUNNING.

33
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,420
[SHIROE] AKATSUKI, I'D LIKE
YOU TO KEEP YOURSELF HIDDEN

34
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,023
WITH SNEAK AND SILENT MOVE
IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE.

35
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,592
[AKATUSKI] YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY, "PLEASE."

36
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,893
[SHIROE] UH.

37
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,428
HEH.

38
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,731
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] SNEAK
ENABLES SELF‐CONCEALMENT,

39
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,201
WHILE SILENT MOVE ALLOWS
MOTION WITHOUT ANY SOUND.

40
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,804
THEY'RE TRACKER CLASS SKILLS.

41
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,774
[NAOTSUGU] ALL RIGHT!
LET'S LAY THE SMACKDOWN
ON THESE DUMMIES!

42
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,882
[BEEPING]

43
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:40,621
HA. WHEREVER YOU'RE HIDING,
LITTLE GIRL, I'LL FIND YOU.

44
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,757
[LONDARK] HOW LONG ARE
YOU GOING TO OBSESS
OVER THAT GIRL?

45
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,359
[DEMICAS] YOU GOT TO KEEP
A SHORT LEASH ON YOUR PETS.

46
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,095
AFTER ALL, YOU GOT TO LET
THEM KNOW WHO THE BOSS IS!

47
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,164
[RINGING]

48
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,265
[MAN] DEMICAS.

49
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,000
[DEMICAS] WHAT IS IT?

50
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,105
WELL, SIR, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
STRANGERS COMING THROUGH TOWN.

51
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,473
[DEMICAS] STRANGERS?

52
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,342
[MAN] I'VE NEVER SEEN
THESE GUYS BEFORE.

53
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,143
[DEMICAS] HUH?

54
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,011
[BEEPING]

55
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,247
[DEMICAS] HEH HEH HEH.

56
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,215
[SHIROE] LOOKS LIKE
THEY JUST SAW US.

57
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,618
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH? JUST
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

58
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,421
ALL THESE BAD VIBES ARE
MESSING WITH MY MOJO.

59
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,995
[SHIROE]
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE HERE.

60
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,997
STAND WATCH, AKATSUKI.

61
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,231
[AKATSUKI] WILL DO.

62
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,233
[SHIROE]
NAOTSUGU, HANG OUT HERE.

63
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,269
[NAOTSUGU] ROGER.

64
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,276
[SERARA]
UH, HMM. HMM.

65
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,513
I'M SERARA OF CRESCENT
MOON ALLIANCE.

66
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:44,585
UH, I SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR COMING FOR ME.

67
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,587
HUH?

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,655
MEOW.

69
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,159
HEY. IS THAT
REALLY YOU, CHIEF?!

70
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,795
[NYAN‐TA] MMMYEAH.

71
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:55,729
UH!

72
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,863
[NYAN‐TA] WELL NOW,

73
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,534
IF IT ISN'T MY OLD PARTNER
IN CRIME, SHIROECHI.

74
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,203
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN HOW THAT
PARTY OF YOURS GOT HERE

75
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,305
SO QUICKLY, MMMYEAH?

76
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,307
UM, I, UH...

77
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,275
[SHIROE] YEAH, IT DOES.

78
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,277
I SHOULD INTRODUCE MYSELF.

79
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,913
I'M SHIROE. IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

80
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,749
[NYAN‐TA] THIS ONE IS
EXTREMELY PERCEPTIVE.

81
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,785
IF MY BOY HERE'S LEADING
THE PARTY, THERE'S NO DOUBT

82
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,689
IN MY MIND IT'S GONNA WORK, AND
THAT'S A MATTER OF FACT, HMMM.

83
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,792
I SEE YOU'RE STILL MAKING
WITH THE CAT TALK, HUH?

84
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,693
STILL AT IT.

85
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,461
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

86
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,297
SHOW ME A CAT NOW WHO
DOESN'T TALK LIKE THIS,

87
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,766
AND I'LL SET
THEM STRAIGHT.

88
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,236
UH, DO THE TWO OF YOU, LIKE,
REALLY KNOW EACH OTHER?

89
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,639
MMM, SOMETHING LIKE
THAT, BABY. HEH HEH HEH.

90
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,175
SHIROECHI USED TO CHECK
ME DILIGENTLY FOR FLEAS.

91
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,645
[SHIROE] I MOST
CERTAINLY DID NOT!

92
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,781
I CAN GO BACK
TO AKIHABARA.

93
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:51,217
THAT'S GREAT, BUT
WHAT ABOUT NYAN‐TA?

94
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,319
[SHIROE] I'VE GOT
NAOTSUGU WITH ME.

95
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,422
THERE'S ALSO A GIRL
WITH US... AKATSUKI.

96
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,959
SHE'S A LEVEL
90 ASSASSIN.

97
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,460
SHE'S SCARY GOOD.

98
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,730
SO YOU BROUGHT
NAOTSUGUCCHI, DID YOU?

99
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,799
[NYAN‐TA]
AND A NEW FRIEND, TOO?

100
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,300
MEOW.

101
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,635
[SHIROE]
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,

102
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,237
YOU'D PROBABLY BE BETTER
OFF COMING WITH US.

103
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,607
[NYAN‐TA] HEH.
WORKS FOR ME, BABY.

104
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,642
SUSUKINO'S A
MESS, YOU KNOW?

105
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,078
MAYBE IT'S A SIGN FROM
ABOVE TELLING ME TO GO

106
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,913
WITH YOU TO AKIHABARA.

107
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,215
[SERARA] HUH?
DOES THAT MEAN...?

108
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,950
[NYAN‐TA]
YOU KNOW IT.

109
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,218
THAT'S AWESOME!

110
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,220
[RINGING]

111
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,488
[SHIROE] AKATSUKI?

112
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,692
HMM. FROM WHERE?

113
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,827
[AKATSUKI] THEY'RE
COMING FROM THE NORTH.

114
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,462
THEY'RE SEARCHING THE TOWN
AS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH IT,

115
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,132
BUT THEY'RE GONNA
BE ON TOP OF YOU
IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

116
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,803
THE BOSS SEEMS TO BE A
HUGE WRESTLING FIGHTER
OF SOME KIND.

117
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,871
HE'S DRESSED LIKE
A MONK, BUT...

118
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,374
[SHIROE] HUH? A BEAR
CARVED OUT OF WOOD?

119
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,376
[NYAN‐TA] THAT'S
BRIGANDIA'S LEADER,

120
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,412
GUILD MASTER DEMICAS.

121
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,814
[SERARA] HUH?

122
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,182
(WHIMPERS)

123
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,051
(CHIME)

124
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,285
NAOTSUGU.

125
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,121
I'M HERE, MAN.

126
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,524
GOT IT. ROGER.

127
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,258
[SHIROE] THANKS.

128
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,492
LET'S GET GOING.

129
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,862
WE SHOULD TAKE THE
BACK WAY OUT OF HERE.

130
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,333
HMM?

131
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,068
LONDARK.

132
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,803
ALL RIGHT THEN.

133
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,272
THE OUTSIDERS REALLY
ARE HERE FOR SERARA.

134
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,841
[MAN] YES.

135
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,577
THE INTERCITY TRANSPORT
GATES STILL AREN'T WORKING,

136
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,880
SO THEN HOW DID
THEY GET HERE?

137
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,116
HUH! INTERESTING.

138
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,019
[LAUGHTER]

139
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,521
[SERARA WHIMPERING]

140
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,057
[SHIROE] IT'S FINE. THEY'RE
NOT GONNA TRY ANYTHING YET.

141
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,458
[SERARA] HUH?

142
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,761
[SHIROE] WE STILL CAN'T
FIND INSIDE A TOWN.

143
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,696
THEY'LL WAIT UNTIL WE'RE
OUTSIDE TO ATTACK,

144
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,298
SO WE SHOULD BE
PREPARED FOR THAT.

145
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,169
[SERARA] SO THEN HOW
WILL WE ESCAPE?

146
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,971
[SHIROE]
HMM. WE JUST LEAVE.

147
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,306
YOU SEE, YOUR NEW FRIENDS
FROM THE BRIGANDIA GUILD

148
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,008
WANT US ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE GATES.

149
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:55,942
AAH!

150
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,844
THAT MAKES THINGS
EASIER ACTUALLY.

151
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,412
YEAH, BUT...

152
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,448
SHIROE, UM, IF WE
GO OUT THE GATE,

153
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,484
THEY MIGHT
ATTACK US, RIGHT?

LET'S GO, GUYS,
BACK TO AKIHABARA!

462
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,741
LAST ONE THERE HAS
TO WASH MY CODPIECE!

463
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:26,146
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD!

464
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:27,147

00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:30,083
WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU?

00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,857
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
ON THEIR WAY BACK
TO AKIHABARA,

471
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,760
SHIROE AND HIS FRIENDS ENJOY
A MOMENT OF PEACE.

00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,395
AND THEN NYAN‐TA

473
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:26,767
A SECRET ABOUT THIS WORLD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING
THEY THOUGHT THEY KNEW.

474
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,835
MEANWHILE, YOUNG CHILDREN
IN THE CITY ARE SPENDING

475
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:32,806
THEIR DAYS BEING EXPLOITED
WITH NO WAY OUT.
