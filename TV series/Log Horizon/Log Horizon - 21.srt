WITH HIS ARMY OF GOBLINS.

140
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,107
THEY BEGAN DESTROYING
VILLAGES AND CASTLES,

141

EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO RUIN

AND DEFEATED THE MONSTERS

00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,540
BUT DURING THE RAGING BATTLE,

146
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,740
ONE OF THESE HEROIC WARRIORS
LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS
OF THE MONSTERS.

147
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,607
[SHIROE] HUH?

148
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,107
[APRETTA]
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

149
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:58,107
[FEVELLE] I THOUGHT THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE IMMORTAL.

150
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,907
[WOMAN] THE ONE WHO DIED WAS NOT
ONE OF THE IMMORTAL VISITORS.

151
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:03,740
HE WAS MERELY ONE OF
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND...

152
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,373
A BOY WHO LONGED TO BE A HERO.

153
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:08,673
[APRETTA]
OH, MY GOODNESS.

154
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,807
[WOMAN] THE HEROES DID
NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

155
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,040

POWERFUL WIZARD TO SAVE HIM.

156

BUT NOT EVEN THEIR WISEST
AND MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE LEADER

157
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:20,573
KNEW HOW TO RESTORE ONE OF
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

158

[BOY IN VEST] KEEP GOING!
[BOY IN JACKET] YEAH!
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?!

159
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,507
[WOMAN] SO THE WISE WIZARD
THOUGHT AND THOUGHT,

160
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,040
AND HE CAME UP WITH SOMETHING.

161
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,907
HE CREATED AN ENTIRELY
NEW FORM OF MAGIC,

162
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,973
ONE THAT HAD NEVER EXISTED
IN THIS WORLD BEFORE.

ARE IN ORDER, SHIROE.

[SHIROE] HMM? FOR WHAT?

177
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:16,973
THE CREATION OF A
NEW TYPE OF MAGIC.

178
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,607
UHH. HOW'D YOU
HEAR ABOUT THAT?

179
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:21,040
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,

180
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,840
I SENSED A MAGIC UNKNOWN
TO ME IN THE EAST.

181
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,007
AND I SAW ITS LIGHT
FILL THE SKY.

182
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,140
IT WAS WORLD‐CLASS MAGIC,

183
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,740
THE LIKES OF WHICH CAN
ALTER THE LAWS, THE FATES,

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,007
AND THE VERY EXISTENCE
OF THE WORLD.

185
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:38,307
YES, YOU ARE INDEED EVERY
BIT THE MAN I THOUGHT
YOU WERE, SHIROE.

00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,807
[SHIROE] YEAH, MAYBE, I GUESS.

187
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,573
BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT
WAS POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU.

[REGAN] YOU HONOR ME.

189
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:47,740
INCIDENTALLY, I ALSO FELT THE
PRESENCE OF A POWERFUL MAGIC

JUST RECENTLY AS WELL.

192
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,140
[REGAN] IT WOULD SEEM TO ME
THAT SOMEONE BESIDES YOURSELF

193
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,407
HAS ALSO LEARNED HOW TO
CREATE A NEW FORM OF MAGIC.

MINAMI, SUSUKINO, NAKASU.

201
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:32,606
IT'D HAVE TO BE REASONABLE
TO ASSUME THAT AKIHABARA

202
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:36,806
WASN'T THE ONLY ADVENTURER CITY
TO EXPERIENCE A MAJOR CHANGE

HAVE GONE TO AKIHABARA.

WITH THE GUILD OF BRIGANDIA
HOLDING DOMINION OVER

THAT THE FESTIVAL IS SIMILAR TO

289
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,839
WHEN YOU ARRIVED IN
TOWN YESTERDAY...

290
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,772
THAT MY FELLOW ADVENTURERS
AREN'T EXACTLY AS CONCERNED

291
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,172
WITH POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
AS YOUR PEOPLE.

292
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:20,339
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF TEA PARTIES OR
FANCY AFFAIRS LIKE THIS.

293
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:23,272
THE LIFESTYLE'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE LAID‐BACK IN AKIHABARA.

294
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:27,372
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF
TIME TO TAKE THOSE EPIC
NAPS YOU LOVE SO MUCH.

295
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:28,839
YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

296
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:30,672
[RAYNESHIA] UM, SO THEN...

297
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:32,539
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
COULD IT REALLY BE THAT I'M

298
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,539
FINALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE
MY 3 DAYS OF LAZINESS AT A TIME?

299
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,306
DAYS I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BATHE?

300
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,872
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I'D
GO AS LONG AS 3 FULL DAYS.

301
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,439
[RAYNESHIA] UH!

302
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,739
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] GET OUT
OF MY HEAD, YOU UPPITY FREAK!

303
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,506
[RAYNESHIA] HMM.

304
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:48,772
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] I'VE GOT
TO REMEMBER TO KEEP MY GUARD
UP WHEN I'M AROUND HIM.

305
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:50,306
(MUSIC ENDS, APPLAUSE)

306
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:52,806
HE'S NOTHING LESS THAN A
MONSTER THAT CAN READ MINDS.

307
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:57,339
YES, HE'S A
MIND‐READING MONSTER.

308
00:15:57,906 --> 00:15:59,572
[GIRLS] SO HOT!

309
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:01,672
3 MEALS AND A NAP?

310
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:04,639
SO I CAN FINALLY RETURN TO
MY LIFE OF INDULGENCE.

311
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:05,639
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT?

312
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:08,006
[KRUSTY] YEAH, IF YOU
CAN PULL IT OFF.

313
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:10,872
I MEAN, YOU HAVE A
KNACK FOR FINDING WAYS

314
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:12,572
TO RUIN IT FOR YOURSELF.

315
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,639
[RAYNESHIA] RUIN IT?
[KRUSTY] YEAH.

316
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:15,839
[RAYNESHIA] HM.

317
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:20,872
[SERARA] UH, NYANTA?

318
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:23,539
[NYANTA] WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU,
LITTLE LADY? WHAT'S HAPPENING?

319
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,006
[SERARA] I‐I...
I WAS THINKING...

320
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:27,439
[NYANTA] YEAH?

321
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:30,939
I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO YOU
FOR SAVING ME IN SUSUKINO.

322
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,706
IT WAS REALLY NICE AND ALL.

323
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:35,872
BUT...

324
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:39,306
[SERARA] THE CRESCENT MOON
ALLIANCE HAS DONE A LOT FOR ME.

325
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:44,806
AND I... I NEED TO LOOK AFTER
ALL THE NEW PLAYERS. SO...

326
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,239
UM...

327
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:51,172
SO... SO I, UH, YOU KNOW, I...

328
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:54,606
[SERARA, THINKING] I WANT TO
BE WITH NYANTA, BUT...

329
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:57,972
[SERARA] UH, I...

330
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:00,072
I CAN'T STAY IN LOG HORIZON.

331
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:02,206
[NYANTA] AH. COME ON, NOW.

332
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:06,872
SILLY, YOU REALLY ARE SUCH
A GOOD GIRL. YOU KNOW THAT.
[SERARA] AH...

333
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:09,339
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR
THIS OLD KITTEN TO HAVE

334
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,806
A DANCE WITH YOU, HMM?
IF YOU'D BE SO KIND?

335
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:15,972
(SERARA GIGGLING)

336
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:18,072
[SERARA] OF COURSE!

337
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:20,506
[MINORI] WHY DON'T I
GET US A DRINK?

338
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,406
[TOYA] SURE.

339
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:24,972
[MINORI] SO WHERE'S SHIROE?

340
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:26,306
[MALE ELF] THAT SHIROE.

341
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,006
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT HOW
HE TRICKED THE PRINCESS

342
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:29,272
INTO JOINING THE BATTLE?

343
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:30,572
[FEMALE ELF]
MOST DEFINITELY.

344
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:32,272
I HEARD HE DRAGGED HER
ONTO THE BATTLEFIELD

345
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:34,639
AND USED HER TO MAKE DEMANDS
OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

346
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:37,039
[MALE ELF] EVEN HIS FRIENDS
CALL HIM A VILLAIN.

347
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,339
[FEMALE ELF] IT'S NOT LIKE
HIS GUILD SHOULD EVEN BE
ON THE ROUND TABLE ANYWAY.

348
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,706
[MALE PLAYER 1] YEAH, I KNOW
GUYS LIKE THAT...

349
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:43,172
[MALE PLAYER 2] THEY SKULK
AROUND THE SHADOWS,

350
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,906
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
PEOPLE'S WEAKNESSES.

351
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:53,997
[AKATSUKI] YOU AREN'T
GOING, MY LORD?

352
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:56,530
[SHIROE] HMM,
I THINK I'LL PASS.

353
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,830
LET KRUSTY HAVE THE
LIMELIGHT THIS TIME.

354
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,230
PRETTY SURE I'D ONLY MAKE
EVERYONE UNCOMFORTABLE, ANNOYED,

355
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,897
AND ALL AWKWARD ANYWAY.

WHAT IS IT?

359
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:08,363
IT'S NOTHING.

360
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,163
IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE NOTHING.

[AKATSUKI] OK. WHAT'S
THAT SMIRK FOR?

364
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,797
[SHIROE] I'M NOT SMIRKING!

365
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,330
[AKATSUKI] NO, I SAW A SMIRK.
YOU WERE SMIRKING.

366
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,830
[SHIROE] UH, I DON'T
THINK I WAS SMIRKING.

367
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,563
[AKATSUKI] GRR. YES, YOU WERE.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?!

YOU'RE BEING WEIRD.

[AKATSUKI] I'M SORRY.

370
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,397
IT'S JUST THIS TIME,
I HARDLY DID ANYTHING.

371
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,863
[SHIROE] HUH?

372

I MEAN OUTSIDE
OF THE BATTLE.

I THINK THE ONLY THING
I MANAGED TO ACCOMPLISH

374
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:43,330
WAS TO SLOW YOU DOWN.

375
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,963
[SHIROE] AH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

376
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:52,063
I MEAN, AKATSUKI, YOU'VE BEEN
WITH ME ALL THIS TIME.

377
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:56,497
EVER SINCE WE GOT HERE,
YOU'VE BEEN MY BODYGUARD

AND GOT ME INFORMATION I NEEDED.

379
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,763
YOU WERE THERE WHEN
I SPOKE TO REGAN.

380
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:04,963
AND YOU HELPED ME KEEP THE
SECRET ABOUT OUR MEMORIES.

381

YOU EVEN WENT WITH ME WHEN
I WENT TO SAVE RUNDELLHAUS.

382

OF THIS WITHOUT YOU.

WOULD BE HONORED.

CARE TO DANCE?

BACK TO AKIHABARA.

A GRANDIOSE ANNOUNCEMENT,

WHISPER ABOUT OUR LOST MEMORIES.

ONLY LOSE PART OF THEM, RIGHT?
