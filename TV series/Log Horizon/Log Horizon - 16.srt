1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,170
(GROWLING)

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,741
[KAWARA] TIGER ECHO FIST! HYAH!

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,342
[SOUJIRO] HYAH! UGH!

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,278
I CAN'T AGGRO THAT
MANY STINKING FISH.

5
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:15,982
HEY, WEST WIND, YOUR
AOE SPELL... HOW MUCH
TIME DO YOU NEED?

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,586
[KAWARA] MY NAME'S KAWARA,
YOU IDIOT. AND IT'S ABOUT
20 SECONDS.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,754
HOW ABOUT YOU?

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,623
[SHIGERU]
I WISH I COULD SAY FASTER.

9
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:26,092
[SOUJIRO, THINKING] FOR A
PICKUP GROUP, OUR TEAMWORK
REALLY ISN'T THAT BAD.

10
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,362
BUT THERE ARE JUST SO MANY.
(SAHUAGIN GROWLS)

11
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,431
[SHIGERU] WE NEED TO HOLD OUT
UNTIL THE NEW KIDS CAN REACH

12
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,499
THE SAFE ZONE INSIDE THE FOREST!

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,968
[KAWARA] THAT'S RIGHT.

14
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,704
I'M NOT GOING BACK TO
MY MASTER A FAILURE!

15
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:41,575
HM.

16
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,941
THERE'S WAY TOO MANY.
THIS IS THEIR SIXTH PATROL.

17
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,509
WHAT THE HELL'S
UP WITH THAT?

18
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,577
IT'S STRANGE.

19
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,311
THE ENCOUNTER RATE FOR
GOBLINS IN THIS AREA

20
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,480
SHOULD NOT BE THIS HIGH.

21
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,886
HMM.

22
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,633
EVERYONE'S IN QUITE
A HURRY, MY LORD.

23
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,134
HMM.

24
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:53,574
[SERJIAD] WHAT? DID YOU
SAY "GOBLINS"?

25
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,742
[NYANTA] AN ARMY OF
A FEW THOUSAND GOBLINS IS

26
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,913
ON THE MOVE JUST BEYOND
THE NEXT RIDGE, HMM.

27
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,414
[REZARICK] THAT MANY?

28
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,517
[NAOTSUGU] ANY NEWS FROM THE
PEOPLE WE LEFT ON THE BEACH?

29
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,220
[NYANTA] I CAN'T REACH MARIELLE
OR SHORYU ON THEIR TELEPATHICS.

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,189
THEY'RE NOT ON MY FRIEND LIST.

31
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,057
(BEEPING)
[NAOTSUGU] NOW THAT
YOU SAY IT, CHIEF,

32
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:15,028
I DON'T THINK I ADDED
ANYONE FROM CRESCENT MOON
TO MY LIST EITHER.

33
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,763
HMM, WE BLEW THAT
ONE FOR SURE.

34
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,000
I CAN'T REACH THE OTHER
MEMBERS OF THE BLACK
SWORD KNIGHTS EITHER.

35
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,169
MAN, THIS IS A
DOOKIE SANDWICH.

36
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,372
OK, NOW, TELL ME, WHAT
DID THE ARMY LOOK LIKE?

37
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,242
THE ONES I SAW MARCHING DOWN
THE CENTER OF THE VALLEY

38
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,244
WERE A MAJOR RAIDING FORCE, HMM.

39
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:36,316
I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ARMY
THAT SIZE IN ALL THE
TIME I'VE BEEN A PLAYER.

40
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:41,387
THERE WERE ALSO HOBGOBLINS
AND TROLLS AND DEMON BEASTS.

41
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,489
I REALLY COULDN'T TELL
YOU ANYTHING MORE THAN

42
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,727
THEY SEEMED TO BE
HEADED WEST‐BY‐SOUTHWEST
WHEN I SAW THEM.

43
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,430
[MINORI] SO THE GROUPS
WE FOUGHT MUST HAVE BEEN
SCOUTING PATROLS, RIGHT?

44
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,365
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

45
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,868
[TOYA] AND WHERE'S
THEIR ARMY NOW?

46
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,905
[RUDY] OVER THAT MOUNTAIN?

47
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,907
[MINORI] WE SHOULD HAVE
EVERY ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF

48
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,710
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE
ON OUR FRIENDS LIST.

49
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,978
I MEAN, DON'T WE?

50
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,179
[ISUZU] YEAH.

51
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,480
[MINORI] OK. CAN YOU
CALL THEM AND ASK

52
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,616
WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER THERE?

53
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:14,521
(BEEPING)
RIGHT. I'LL GO AHEAD AND LET
SHIROE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

54
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,624
[SHIROE] ALL RIGHT.
KEEP ME IN THE LOOP ON THIS.

55
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,727
[NAOTSUGU] WILL DO.
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

56
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,463
UM, MY LORD?

57
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:27,433
[NYANTA] A MASS OF BLUE
GOBLINS FROM THE COAST?

58
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,935
[NAOTSUGU] SAHUAGIN?

59
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,872
WE USUALLY DON'T SEE THOSE
UNTIL WE'RE FURTHER SOUTH.

60
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,406
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

61
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,509
I'M NOT SURE.
MAYBE A COINCIDENCE.

62
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,043
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

63
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,613
THEY JUST TOLD ME THAT
EVERYONE WHO IS ON THE COAST IS

64
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,549
NOW TRYING TO MAKE THEIR WAY
BACK TO THE SCHOOL BUILDING.

65
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,752
IT LOOKS LIKE WE NEED A PLAN
OF ACTION, NAOTSUGU‐CHI.

66
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,789
WELL, IF PUSH COMES TO
SHOVE, WE COULD ALWAYS USE

67
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,357
A RETURN SPELL TO GET
BACK TO AKIHABARA.

68
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,794
IF WE DO DECIDE TO DO THAT,
JUST REMEMBER IT'LL TAKE

69
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,830
US SEVERAL DAYS TO COME
BACK HERE TO ZANTLEAF.

70
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,966
[NYANTA] THEN WE SAVE THAT
AS OUR LAST RESORT.

71
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,303
[NAOTSUGU] MARIELLE'S IN
CHARGE OF THE TRAINING
CAMP BACK AT THE BEACH.

72
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,572
WE'LL TRY MEETING UP WITH HER.

73
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:10,110
(CHIME)
[ISAMI] THEY'RE CALLING.
[SOUJIRO] OK, DO IT.

74
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,745
[ISAMI] ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

75
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,915
THANK YOU FOR STANDING BY FOR
THIS EMERGENCY TELEPATHY CALL,

76
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,282
CONNECTING YOU WITH SHIROE,

77
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,719
THE LEADER OF THE
LOG HORIZON GUILD.

78
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,521
[SHIROE] I'VE TAKEN THIS
UNUSUAL ACTION OF CONVENING

79
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,289
A TELEPATHIC CONFERENCE
BECAUSE THE MEMBERS OF

80
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,225
THE ROUND TABLE
CANNOT MEET IN PERSON.

81
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,761
AND THE SITUATION FACING
US IS VERY URGENT.

82
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,697
I KNOW THIS MAY NOT BE IDEAL,
BUT I NEED ONE PERSON

83
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,066
AT EACH LOCATION
TO CREATE A RELAY.

84
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,738
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ALL
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.

85
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,874
I DO PLAN ON DEVELOPING THIS
NETWORK FURTHER IN THE FUTURE.

86
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,710
[SHIROE] ANYWAY, LET'S GET
EVERYBODY UP TO SPEED.

87
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,912
THIS MORNING ON THE
ZANTLEAF PENINSULA,

88
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,584
WE CONFIRMED ATTACKS BY
MULTIPLE RACES OF DEMI‐HUMANS.

89
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,820
[SHORYU] DOWN AT
THE COAST, THERE ARE
SEVERAL HUNDRED SAHUAGIN.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,689
AND THAT'S A
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE.

91
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,825
[SHIROE] AND WE ALSO OBSERVED
A LARGE RAIDING FORCE OF GOBLINS

92
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,326
IN THE FOREST.

93
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:04,130
THEIR TOTAL NUMBERS
STAND AT 10,000.

94
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,833
[ISAAC] 10,000?! REALLY?!

95
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,268
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

96
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,204
I BELIEVE THERE MIGHT EVEN BE
MORE OF THEM WAITING IN RESERVE.

97
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,575
MASTER SHIROE, DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA WHY THIS IS HAPPENING?

98
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,343
AND WHAT MIGHT BE THEIR
MOTIVATION FOR DOING THIS?

99
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,980
YES, BUT IT'S ONLY
A THEORY FOR NOW.

100
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,149
[SHIROE] DO YOU REMEMBER THE
"GOBLIN KING'S RETURN"?

101
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,485
"THE GOBLIN KING'S RETURN"?

102
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:29,856
[KRUSTY] IF I REMEMBER
CORRECTLY, THAT WAS A REGULAR
EVENT FOR BUILDING EXPERIENCE.

103
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,791
[SHIROE] RIGHT.

104
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,893
THE GOBLIN CASTLE, SEVENTH FALL,

105
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:37,964
LIES DEEP WITHIN THE FOREST
OF THE OUU TERRITORY.

106
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,168
TWICE A YEAR, THE GOBLIN KING
IS RECORONATED THERE.

107
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:46,372
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, PLAYERS
ARE GIVEN A WEEK TO SLAY HIM.

108
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,242
IF THEY DEFEAT THE KING
BEFORE THE CORONATION,

109
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,011
THEY CAN ACQUIRE RARE ITEMS.

110
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,047
SINCE MOST OF THESE
ITEMS WERE VERY POWERFUL,

111
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,450
AND IT WAS AN EASY EVENT FOR
REGULAR PLAYERS TO ACHIEVE,

112
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,654
IT WAS ONE OF THE GAME'S
MOST POPULAR EVENTS.

113
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,557
THE GOBLIN KING IS
USUALLY THE MAIN CHIEF.

114
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:07,193
THE LEADER OF ONE OF THE OUU
AREA'S MOST POWERFUL CLANS.

115
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,063
IN OTHER WORDS, BY ATTACKING
GOBLIN BASES AND STRONGHOLDS

116
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,066
AROUND THE ENTIRE AREA,
YOU COULD WEAKEN THEM,

117
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,436
THUS WEAKENING THE POTENTIAL
GOBLIN KING HIMSELF.

118
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,804
IN THEORY, OF COURSE.

119
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,773
[SHIROE] THERE WAS
SOMETHING ELSE, THOUGH.

120
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,642
I IMAGINE EVERYONE ELSE
FORGOT ABOUT IT.

121
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,144
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK IT
EVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

122
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:29,482
YOU MEAN WHAT THE ADMIN
SAID WOULD HAPPEN IF THE
GOBLIN KING WAS EVER CROWNED.

123
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,184
IT'D BE CHAOS.

124
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,487
ALL OF THE GOBLIN CLANS WOULD
STOP FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES,

125
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:39,225
UNIFY, AND THEN START ENGAGING
EVERYONE AS ONE MASSIVE ARMY.
[SHIROE] HMM.

126
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,794
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

127
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,463
[NYANTA] I REMEMBER THAT, HMM?
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH.

128
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,666
THAT'S RIGHT.
SINCE WE SHOWED UP,

129
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,401
WE'VE PUT SO MUCH EFFORT
INTO MAKING THIS WORLD LIVABLE,

130
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,936
WE FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT.

131
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,338
[ISAAC] I KNOW ME AND MY GUYS
HAVE BEEN SPENDING MOST OF

132
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,774
OUR TIME LEVELING UP.

133
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,376
WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN
THINKING OF TAKING ANY QUESTS

134
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,878
FROM THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND.

135
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,046
SO THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENED, HUH?

136
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,549
OK, THEN DOES THAT MEAN
THE GOBLIN FORCES ARE CURRENTLY

137
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,085
AT THEIR FULL STRENGTH,
MASTER SHIROE?

138
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:08,989
WE HAVE TO ASSUME THAT
THAT'S THE SCENARIO THAT'S
CURRENTLY FACING US.

139
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:13,226
THE GOBLIN KING HAS A UNITED
ARMY FAR STRONGER THAN WE'VE
EVER SEEN IN THE PAST.

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,096
AND WHAT'S WORSE, WE REALLY
DON'T KNOW THE ORIGINAL SIZE

141
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,998
OF THE 6 MAJOR GOBLIN CLANS.

142
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,900
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,835
WE WERE OUTNUMBERED AT ZANTLEAF,

144
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,870
BUT IF WE RAISED AN
ARMY OF OUR OWN,

145
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,640
WE COULD EASILY
WIPE THEM ALL OUT.
[MICHITAKA] HMM.

146
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,342
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT
IS THE EASTAL LORDS.

147
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,946
NONE OF THEIR COMBINED
ARMIES HAVE THE STRENGTH TO
HANDLE THIS ONE ON THEIR OWN.

148
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,048
[ISAAC] YEAH, LIKE I
CARE ABOUT THEM.

149
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,450
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ASKED
US FOR HELP ANYWAY.

150
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,885
[SOUJIRO] WHEN THIS
WAS STILL A GAME,

151
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,588
THERE WAS AN ARMY
WITH AMAZING POWER.

152
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,456
UH, WHO WERE THEY AGAIN?

153
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,659
[HENRIETTA] THE IZUMO KNIGHTS.

154
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,528
[MICHITAKA] YEAH.

155
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:52,098
THEY WERE HEROES BORN STRAIGHT
FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

156
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,035
AND THE IZUMO KNIGHTS ARE
FAR STRONGER THAN ANY OF US.

157
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,970
THE ULTIMATE WEAPON OF
THE HUMAN RACE.

158
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,574
[MICHITAKA] SUPPOSEDLY, THERE
ARE 13 BANDS OF KNIGHTS ALL
OVER.

159
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,543
AND EVERY TIME THEY GET
INVOLVED IN A FIGHT,

160
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,177
IT'S FOR THE FATE OF THE WORLD.

161
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,380
THE IZUMO KNIGHTS ARE SUPPOSEDLY
THE DESIGNATED GUARDIANS

162
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,915
FOR THE YAMATO ARMIES.

163
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,017
THEN WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

164
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:15,288
WE SHOULD SINCE WE
DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY
REALLY EXIST OR NOT.

165
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,356
HUH?

166
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,191
SOMEONE GETS HIS
NEWS FAST.

167
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,529
AT THIS POINT, A LARGE BATTLE
WITH THE GOBLINS IS UNAVOIDABLE.

168
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,566
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO DIE OUT THERE.

169
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,268
WE HAVE THE LUXURY
OF COMING BACK TO LIFE.

170
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,637
PEOPLE OF THE LAND
AREN'T SO LUCKY.

171
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,274
PLEASE, MY LORD.

172
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,977
[ELISSA] PRINCESS?

173
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,680
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA?

174
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,382
LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN'T
SHOW UP TODAY, DID HE?

175
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,750
[RAYNESHIA] HUH?

176
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,152
[ELISSA] YOUR FRIEND, KRUSTY.
[RAYNESHIA] WHAT?

177
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,354
[ELISSA] THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE BEEN SEEING EACH
OTHER FOR BREAKFAST

178
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,856
LATELY, PRINCESS.

179
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,958
IT'S ONLY NATURAL FOR YOU
TO EXPECT HIM TO SHOW UP.

180
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,426
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
[BOTH] HMM?

181
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,895
(DOOR CREAKS OPEN)

182
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,698
[RAYNESHIA] WHAT IS IT, FATHER?

183
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,100
[PHENEL] RAYNESHIA,
I NEED YOU TO LISTEN.

184
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,868
HUH?

185
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,071
THE GOBLIN ARMY IS APPROACHING
THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY...

186
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,873
10,000 OF THEM.

187
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,474
FATHER!

188
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,978
[PHENEL] AND, OF COURSE,
THEY WILL BUILD UP THOSE
FORCES BEFORE ATTACKING.

189
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,147
OUR WORST FEARS
HAVE BEEN REALIZED.

190
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,249
[ELISSA] THERE ARE 30,000
PEOPLE IN MAIHAMA.

191
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,353
AND OUT OF THAT, BARELY 2,000
WORK IN SECURITY FORCES.

192
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,690
I AM RETURNING TO MAIHAMA
TO SHORE UP ITS DEFENSES.

193
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,325
WAIT! I'M COMING
WITH YOU!

194
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,194
YOU WILL REMAIN HERE IN THE
PALACE AND KEEP YOURSELF SAFE.

195
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,632
[RAYNESHIA] HUH?
[PHENEL] YOUR GRANDFATHER
IS STAYING HERE, TOO.

196
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,266
BUT WHY WOULD HE?

197
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,103
[PHENEL] THE ISSUE IS
LARGER THAN MAIHAMA'S
SAFETY, RAYNESHIA.

198
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,907
ALL THE LORDS MUST REACH
A CONSENSUS OF ACTION
WITH THIS CONFERENCE.

199
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,408
AND AS THE HIGH LORD
OF EASTAL,

200
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,912
MY FATHER MUST REMAIN HERE
TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.

201
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,850
AND YOU WANT ME TO
STAY BEHIND AND HELP?

202
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,254
[PHENEL] IT'S FOR
THE BEST, RAYNESHIA.

203
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,255
(DOOR CLOSES)

204
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,990
DON'T LEAVE ME.

205
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,070
[MARIELLE] ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE ALL HERE!

206
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,340
I WAS THINKING WE'D HAVE
CURRY TONIGHT. YUMMY, RIGHT?

207
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,475
(SHORYU GROANS SOFTLY)

208
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:16,777
[NAOTSUGU] MARIELLE.
[SHORYU] HUH?

209
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,645
[MARIELLE] NAOTSUGU!
[SERARA] MARIELLE!

210
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,347
[MARIELLE] OH, GOOD!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE!

211
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,049
IT'S LIKE THE BEST NEWS EVER.

212
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,285
YOU'RE STILL REALLY A
LITTLE KID, AREN'T YOU?

213
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,720
[SERARA] YEAH, BUT‐

214
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,055
[MARIELLE] THANKS, NAOTSUGU.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS...

215
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,625
[NAOTSUGU] HM?
[MARIELLE] FOR NOT
ANTICIPATING THE ATTACK.

216
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,993
WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

217
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,128
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS
YOUR FAULT, MARIELLE.

218
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,964
HMM, IF ANYTHING,
EVERY SINGLE ADVENTURER

219
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,068
OUT THERE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS DISASTER, HMM?

220
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,170
YEAH, I GUESS.

221
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,206
NONE OF US THOUGHT
IT THROUGH, OK?

222
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,775
LET BRAINIAC SHIROE
FIGURE THIS THING OUT.

223
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,677
EVEN IF IT MEANS
GAMING THE SYSTEM,

224
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,279
HE'LL FIND A WAY FOR US
TO KICK THIS PUPPY.

225
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,881
(MARIELLE LAUGHS)

226
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,150
SHE'S SMILING...

227
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,020
YOU REALLY SHOULD CONSIDER
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES, MARIELLE.

228
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,155
IT'S STARTING TO GET
CHILLY‐CHILL OUTSIDE.

229
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,690
[MARIELLE] EH?
[NAOTSUGU] THAT'S RIGHT.

230
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,759
[MARIELLE] OH!
GIVE ME A SECOND.

231
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,028
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?
[NYANTA] MEOW.

232
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,037
AND I'M BACK, OK? HUH?

233
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,641
[NAOTSUGU] PUT OUT THESE FIRES.
[MARIELLE] WHAT'S HAPPENING?

234
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,875
[NAOTSUGU] OVER THERE.

235
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,078
[NYANTA] EASILY A
THOUSAND TORCHES, HMM?

236
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,953
[MARIELLE] A GOBLIN ARMY?
[NAOTSUGU] THAT'S RIGHT.

237
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,490
I NEED A MAP, GUYS. HURRY!

238
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,962
[MARIELLE] HOW'S IT
LOOKING, GUYS?

239
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:45,999
[NYANTA] HMM, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE A PROBLEM, HMM?

240
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,100
YEAH?

241
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,969
WELL, MAYBE IT'S NOT
EXACTLY ACCURATE TO SAY

242
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,105
THAT THE GOBLIN PROBLEM IS OURS,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

243
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,775
LOOK, JUST COME OUT
AND SAY IT, MR. RETIREE.

244
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,011
[NYANTA] IT LOOKS LIKE
THE GOBLINS ARE PREPARING

245
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,548
EN MASSE TO LAY SIEGE
TO THE TOWN OF CHOSHI.

246
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,983
AH...

247
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,823
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS
ISN'T THE GIANT ARMY I SAW.

248
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,659
IT'S A BIT MORE OF A
MEDIUM‐SIZED DIVISION, HMM?

249
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,196
THE MAIN ARMY IS
STILL WAY UP NORTH
JUST OUT OF OUR REACH.

250
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,831
WHAT DO THEY WANT
WITH THE TOWN?

251
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,500
THEY WANT TO STRIP
THEM TOTALLY BARE

252
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,135
BECAUSE AS BIG AS
THEIR FORCE IS,

253
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,338
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR FOOD FOR
THE REST OF THEIR ARMY.

254
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,673
(MARIELLE GASPS)

255
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,809
[MINORI] YEAH, BUT CHOSHI
DOESN'T HAVE ANY FORTIFICATIONS.

256
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,110
[MARIELLE] NO, THEY DON'T.

257
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,778
[MINORI] IF WE JUST
SIT BACK AND WATCH,

258
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,247
THEY WON'T EVEN LAST
UNTIL MORNING.

259
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:38,184
WE CAN'T RETURN TO AKIHABARA
WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING.

260
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,921
[TOYA] WE NEED TO HELP THEM.
[NAOTSUGU] HM.

261
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,957
THAT'S RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP,

262
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,926
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN JUST
STAYING HERE, ISN'T IT?

263
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,895
[ISUZU] DON'T BE CRAZY.
[MINORI] ISUZU?

264
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,430
THIS ISN'T THE DUNGEON.

265
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,265
I MEAN, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW MANY OF THOSE THINGS

266
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,867
WE'RE UP AGAINST.

267
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,203
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
TRUE, MISS ISUZU.

268
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,307
BUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN
CHOSHI DON'T EVEN KNOW
THE GOBLINS ARE COMING.

269
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,582
AND YOU WANT TO SIT
HERE AND DO NOTHING.

270
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,185
I WANT TO LET THE GROWNUPS
TAKE CARE OF THIS, OK? PLEASE?

271
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,354
ARE YOU SAYING WE'RE
JUST A BUNCH OF KIDS?!

272
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,056
[ISUZU] THAT'S NOT IT!

273
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,258
[RUDY] WE'VE BEEN
DOING SOME PRETTY GOOD
LEVELING UP, ISUZU.

274
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,093
[SERARA] OH, JUST
STOP IT, YOU GUYS.

275
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,829
[MINORI] I MUST SAY THAT I AGREE
WITH RUNDELLHAUS ON THIS ONE.

276
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,765
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT

277
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,399
WHETHER WE'VE
LEVELED UP OR NOT.

278
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,801
BUT, MINORI...

279
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:31,371
I'M ASKING YOU, PLEASE
LET US GO TO CHOSHI.

280
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,907
[ADULTS] HMM...

281
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,009
[SOUJIRO] NO MATTER HOW
BIG THEIR ARMY IS,

282
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,012
THEIR NUMBERS DON'T
POSE MUCH THREAT.

283
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,282
WITH OUR 1,500 MEN, WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO DESTROY THEM.

284
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,450
[ISAMI] YEAH, BUT YOU
HEARD ISAAC DURING
OUR LAST CONFERENCE.

285
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,020
IF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
HAVEN'T ASKED US FOR HELP,

286
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,556
HE THINKS WE SHOULDN'T
BOTHER OFFERING.

287
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,192
ISAAC NEEDS A GOOD REASON TO
FIGHT BEFORE JUST JUMPING IN.

288
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,795
[SOUJIRO] UH, YEAH, THAT'S
PROBABLY TRUE, I GUESS.

289
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,198
AND SHIROE DIDN'T REALLY SEEM
VERY MUCH LIKE HIMSELF, DID HE?

290
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,232
HUH?

291
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,801
NORMALLY HE'D JUST MAKE
A QUICK DECISION

292
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,469
AND JUST GO WITH
IT, YOU KNOW?

293
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,407
[SHIROE] I'VE ASKED
SOUJIRO'S WEST WIND
BRIGADE TO JOIN US HERE.

294
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,376
HE WON'T HESITATE TO HELP US
OUT IF WE GET ATTACKED.

295
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,313
[MICHITAKA] ALL OF
THE REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE NOBLES ARE HERE.

296
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,782
WE CANNOT LEAVE IT UNPROTECTED.

297
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,383
THEY'RE SMALL
BUT POWERFUL.

298
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,085
AND THAT'S GOOD.

299
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,488
THE LAST THING WE NEED TO
DO IS ALARM THE NOBILITY.

300
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,790
I'M ALL FOR IT.

301
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,291
HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

302
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,660
YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD
HAVE OFFERED IT TO US

303
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,294
AS A QUEST OR SOMETHING.

304
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,896
I'M SURE THAT ISN'T
STOPPING THEM

305
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,698
FROM TALKING ABOUT IT
AMONGST THEMSELVES.

306
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,334
[MICHITAKA] WITHOUT INCLUDING
US IN THE CONVERSATION?

307
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,702
NOT GOOD, PEOPLE.

308
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,506
[KRUSTY] SO THEN DO WE PROPOSE
SOMETHING TO THEM, STRATEGIST?

309
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,544
BEFORE WE DO, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU.

310
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:44,845
[MICHITAKA] WHAT IS IT?

311
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,580
[SHIROE] IT'S ABOUT
DEATH IN THIS WORLD...

312
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,081
HOW IT REALLY WORKS.

313
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,683
(AKATSUKI GASPS)

314
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,653
[SHIROE] DEATH ALWAYS BRINGS
US BACK TO THE CATHEDRAL HERE.

315
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:56,757
BUT THE PRICE OF RESURRECTION
HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN EXPERIENCE
POINT PENALTY.

316
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,692
THAT'S AN EASY PRICE
TO PAY IN A GAME.

317
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,495
BUT THE PROBLEM JUST HAPPENS
TO BE THAT IT DOESN'T WORK
THE SAME WAY NOW.

318
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:03,564
[KRUSTY] HMM.

319
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,498
[SHIROE] FROM THE
INFORMATION I'VE GAINED,

320
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,134
THE DEATHS OF OUR BODIES ON
THE BATTLEFIELD HAS A REAL

321
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,970
ELEMENT OF RISK TO IT NOW.

322
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,172
I'LL SPARE YOU THE GORY DETAILS.

323
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,976
BUT IT SEEMS THAT EACH DEATH
COSTS YOU SOME OF YOUR MEMORIES.

324
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,377
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

325
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,411
OUR MEMORIES?

326
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,313
(KRUSTY GASPS)

327
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,583
[MICHITAKA] SO EXACTLY
HOW MUCH WILL GET LOST?

328
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:23,917
[SHIROE] I'M NOT SURE.

329
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,886
[MICHITAKA] WELL, WHICH
MEMORIES DO WE LOSE?!

330
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:26,887
[SHIROE] I'M NOT SURE.

331
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,789
WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING, THEN?!

332
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,024
I DON'T KNOW!
WELL, NOT YET ANYWAY.

333
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:34,494
[SHIROE] HOWEVER,
THE FACTS ARE UNDENIABLE.

334
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:37,130
WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS.

335
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,767
I GET IT. IT'S THE ONLY
EXPLANATION THAT I'VE HEARD

336
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,304
FOR ALL THESE MEMORIES I'VE
LOST SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

337
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,472
[KRUSTY] I'M CONVINCED.
[MICHITAKA] HUH?

338
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,676
D. D. D. IS A WARRIOR GUILD
FIGHTING ALL THE TIME.

339
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,478
BEFORE THE INITIATIVE TO
ESTABLISH THE ROUND TABLE

340
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,181
AND BRING PEACE TO AKIHABARA,
I ORDERED MY GUILD TO UNDERGO

341
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,317
RIGOROUS COMBAT TRAINING.

342
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,052
I DIED A FEW TIMES OUT THERE.

343
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,654
I REALLY DIDN'T
THINK MUCH OF IT.

344
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,489
BUT OVER TIME, I CAN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE THAT SOME MOMENTS OF

345
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,091
MY LIFE ARE MISSING.

346
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,793
THAT'S SO SAD.

347
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,394
THAT'S HORRIBLE, MAN.

348
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,664
CAN YOU TELL WHAT
MEMORIES ARE MISSING,

349
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,232
SHORT‐TERM OR LONG‐TERM?

350
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,600
WELL, THAT'S
HARD TO SAY.

351
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,236
I MEAN, THEY ARE MEMORIES
I LOST, AFTER ALL.

352
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,205
BUT THEY DO ALL HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

353
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:20,707
AH...

354
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,176
[KRUSTY] I'VE DIED TWICE
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE.

355
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,446
I'VE ONLY LOST A FEW MEMORIES,
BUT I'M ALMOST POSITIVE

356
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,582
THEY ARE ALL FROM
THE REAL WORLD.

357
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:32,118
IT'S LIKE MY FORMER LIFE IS
STARTING TO DRIFT AWAY.

358
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,755
NOW, I KNOW MY MEMORY
IS PRETTY SHARP,

359
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:38,525
BUT OCCASIONALLY I HAVE
THESE MOMENTS, LIKE
REMEMBERING I HAD A CAT

360
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,293
BUT NOT HIS NAME OR
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.

361
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,796
IT'S ODD TO
SAY THE LEAST.

362
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,165
THIS IS ONLY MY
EXPERIENCE WITH IT,

363
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,833
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I GUESS.

364
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,903
A DEATH OR TWO SEEMS TO BE
ONLY MILDLY INCONVENIENT.

365
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:55,175
SO I SUPPOSE EVEN A FEW
DOZEN MIGHT NOT CAUSE
YOU THAT MUCH TROUBLE.

366
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,577
COME ON, KRUSTY.

367
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,444
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING
COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH

368
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,213
WITH THE WORLD YOU CAME FROM.

369
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,148
WE FORGET THE REAL WORLD?

370
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,485
LET'S NOT RUN THE RISK
OF OVERREACTING TO THIS.

371
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,021
JUST TRY NOT TO GET
YOURSELF KILLED.

372
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:12,859
[KRUSTY] OF COURSE, IF WE START
FAILING TO ACT OUT OF FEAR OF
DYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

373
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:17,330
ISN'T THAT LIKE BEING ONLY
HALF‐ALIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

374
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,132
HMM...

375
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,836
[MARIELLE] IT'S WAY
TOO RISKY, YOU GUYS.

376
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,738
[TOYA] WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

377
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:27,307
[RUDY] HOW CAN YOU BE
AN ADVENTURER IF YOU'RE AFRAID?!

378
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,942
[SERARA] CALM DOWN, EVERYBODY!

379
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,679
LISTEN TO ME, WE NEED TO
LET EVERYONE IN EASTAL
HANDLE THIS, OK?

380
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,415
RIGHT NOW I'M THE ONE
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SAFETY.

381
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,383
AND I SAY WE SHOULDN'T
ACT ON OUR OWN.

382
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,852
[NYANTA] THIS IS GOING
TO AFFECT RELATIONS

383
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,387
BETWEEN THE ADVENTURERS
AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

384
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,024
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME TO COME.

385
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,325
[REZARICK] AND WE HAVE
NO OSTENSIBLE REASON

386
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,993
TO SAVE THEM, DO WE?

387
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,529
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK
AT THE BIG PICTURE

388
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,164
AND KEEP YOUR FEELINGS
IN CHECK ON THIS ONE.

389
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,466
NO MATTER HOW HARD
IT IS TO DO SO.

390
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:57,003
[RUDY] ALL RIGHT!
I'LL GO IF NOBODY ELSE WILL.

391
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,872
[ISUZU] COME ON, RUDY!
IT'S DANGEROUS.

392
00:18:58,972 --> 00:18:59,840
[RUDY] YEAH, BUT‐‐

393
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,576
WE ARE A PARTY, AREN'T WE?

394
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:05,746
[ISUZU] IF WE JUST GO
OUT THERE AND WE'RE NOT
ALL IN THIS TOGETHER,

395
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,080
WE'RE GOING TO GET HURT,

396
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,849
JUST LIKE BACK IN THE DUNGEON.

397
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:10,383
BUT WE CAN'T DO NOTHING!

398
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,218
[MINORI] HM.
[TOYA] AH.

399
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,690
HERE'S A THOUGHT, HOW ABOUT
YOU LET US GO AS AN ADVANCE
SCOUTING PARTY?

400
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,696
[RUDY]
A SCOUTING PARTY?

401
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,798
THAT WAS A STROKE
OF GENIUS, MISS MINORI.

402
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:27,868
[SERARA] WE CAN AT LEAST
HELP THEM EVACUATE, CAN'T WE?

403
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:33,373
[MINORI] SERARA, I ONLY
SAID THAT SO THEY'D
AGREE TO LET US TAKE OFF.

404
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,975
[TOYA] SO THAT MEANS...

405
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:38,011
[MINORI] I THINK WE SHOULD DO
WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT THE CITY.

406
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,113
[SERARA] HM.
(TOYA CHUCKLES)

407
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,314
BUT WHY?

408
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,750
NO ONE ASKED US.
AND THERE'S NO REWARD.

409
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,153
AND IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS,
AND I WANT TO LIVE.

410
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,656
THERE ARE A LOT OF
REASONS NOT TO HELP.

411
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,224
I GET IT.

412
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,160
[MINORI] BUT I ONLY NEED ONE
GOOD REASON TO HELP.

413
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,697
YEAH, I SEE YOUR POINT.

414
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,498
CHECK IT OUT.

415
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,938
(FIRE SMOLDERING)

416
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,145
[SERARA] NO, NO, NO.
[RUDY] WE'RE SO CLOSE.

417
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,947
GOBLINS HAD TO
BE BEHIND THIS.

418
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,181
[TOYA] IS ANYONE THERE?!

419
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,350
(CREATURES HISSING)
[TOYA] UGH.

I'VE GOT YOUR BACK,

(COINS JINGLING)

429
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,784
[TOYA] YOU STILL NEED A REASON?

430
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:54,254
HOW ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT
THING 'CAUSE IT'S RIGHT?

431
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:59,125
IF YOU WANT TO HELP SOMEONE,
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

432
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,461
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE AN ADVENTURER.

433
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:04,230
THAT'S RIGHT.
I BELIEVE IT NOW.

434
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,300
YOU CANNOT BE AN
ADVENTURER AND RUN AWAY.

435
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,271
[RUDY] WE CAN'T JUST
MARCH BACK HOME TO AKIHABARA
WITHOUT SAVING THIS TOWN.

436
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,239
[ISUZU] SO HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT A TOWN

437
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,343
WITHOUT ANY WALLS FROM AN ENTIRE
ARMY OF GOBLINS, MR. TOUGH GUY?

438
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,012
FIGHTING SPIRIT, OF COURSE!

439
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,214
[ISUZU] WE'RE BACK TO YOUR
STUPID NONSENSE AGAIN?
[RUDY] UH!

440
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,683
[ISUZU] USE YOUR HEAD
FOR A CHANGE!

441
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,351
[RUDY] I AM!
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

442
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,922
THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, ISUZU.

443
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,625
A PARTY OF FIVE DOESN'T STAND
A CHANCE DEFENDING A TOWN

444
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,326
AGAINST A DIVISION OF GOBLINS,

445
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,261
NOW MATTER HOW STRONG
WE'VE BECOME.

446
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,931
AND, BESIDES,
EVEN IF WE SUCCEED,

447
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:40,266
HOW MANY OTHER TOWNS FALL?

448
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:43,469
SO THAT'S WHY WE
WON'T PROTECT THEM.

449
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,438
[RUDY] WHAT?!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

450
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,973
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?!

451
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,542
HM!

452
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,111
[NYANTA] MINORI‐CHI HAS
THE RIGHT IDEA, BABY.

453
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:53,213
[NAOTSUGU] WE CAME TO MAKE
SURE YOU LITTLE KNUCKLEHEADS

454
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,015
WEREN'T GETTING
YOURSELVES INTO TROUBLE.

455
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:58,585
AFTER ALL, US OLD FOLKS HAVE
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOUR SAFETY.

456
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,187
[SERARA] NYANTA!
[TOYA] MASTER NAOTSUGU!

457
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,558
UM, I'D LIKE TO ASK
PERMISSION...

458
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:08,762
GIRL, AN ADVENTURER DOESN'T
REQUIRE PERMISSION FROM ANYONE.

459
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:10,831
I CAN ALREADY TELL THAT
YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH

460
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:14,300
FOR YOURSELF AND HAVE REACHED
YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.

461
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,105
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
CHOOSING SOMETHING EASY
THIS TIME, MINORI‐CHI.

462
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,774
[TOYA] WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

463
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:23,376
WE'RE GOING OUT THERE
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO TO STOP US!

464
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,712
MINORI'S GOT AN IDEA
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS!

465
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,848
[NAOTSUGU]
YEAH, YEAH. I GET IT.

466
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,883
BUT IF YOU'RE SO
CONFIDENT IN THAT IDEA,

467
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:32,753
WHY DON'T YOU DO US A FAVOR
AND TELL US ABOUT IT FIRST?

468
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:37,558
[MINORI] SURE. IT'S OBVIOUS
WE CAN'T PROTECT THE TOWN.

469
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,960
INSTEAD WE GO ON OFFENSE.

470
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,494
(CLANG)

471
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:44,130
AND WE ATTACK
THE GOBLINS INSTEAD.

472
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,290
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
MINORI AND THE OTHERS
BEGIN THEIR BATTLE

473
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,792
AGAINST THE GOBLIN ARMY.

474
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,494
WE HAVE NO REASON BUT TO HELP
PROTECT THOSE AROUND THEM.

475
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,429
THAT IS THE FREEDOM
OF AN ADVENTURER.

476
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,331
BUT FREEDOM REQUIRES RESOLVE.

477
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:28,434
WHEN A GIRL BREAKS OUT OF HER
SHELL AND MAKES HER DECISION,

478
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,671
HER BODY WILL RISE INTO THE SKY,

479
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,639
NEXT TIME ON "LOG HORIZON."

480
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:35,509
[SHIROE] ALWAYS LOOK
30 SECONDS AHEAD.
