[NAOTSUGU, MUFFLED]
SO THE BIG‐SCALE FESTIVAL
STARTS TOMORROW, HUH?

3
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:13,212
EVERYBODY'S PRETTY FREAKING
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,379
[NYANTA] WELL, IT'S OUR FIRST
FESTIVAL IN AKIHABARA, HUH?

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,612
SINCE WE ALL DECIDED TO
MAKE THIS HAPPEN, HMM.

6
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:21,779
MANY OF THE GUILDS DECIDED TO
PITCH IN AND MAKE IT GREAT.

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,345
YOU AIN'T LYING.

8
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:24,945
(SMASH LAUGHING)
[NAOTSUGU] JUST HEARING
THERE'S A FESTIVAL

9
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:27,545
MAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE
WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING.

10
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:28,779
[MARIELLE] AH.

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,145
[NAOTSUGU]
DECORATIONS?

12
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:32,045
[NYANTA] YOU GOT YOURSELF
QUITE A HAUL THERE.

13
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:35,012
[MARIELLE] I, LIKE, CAN'T EVEN
FIT THEM INTO MY MAGIC BAG!

14
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:36,845
[NAOTSUGU] I HEARD THAT THE
CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE IS

15
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:39,279
GONNA BE SELLING WINTER
CLOTHES OR SOMETHING.

16
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,079
[MARIELLE] WE'RE ALSO
DOING A FASHION SHOW.

17
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,012
[NAOTSUGU] SWEET!
[NYANTA] OH, I LIKE THAT.

18
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:46,045
[MARIELLE] WE'RE DOING IT
ALL TOMORROW, SO, LIKE,

19
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:48,112
WE'VE GOT TO GET
EVERYTHING READY TODAY.

20
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:49,879
DON'T WORK TOO
HARD, MARIELLE.

21
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,645
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE BRINGING
BACK THE CRESCENT BURGER, HMM?

22
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:55,179
[MARIELLE] YOU'VE GOT IT!

23
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,245
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GONNA DO
WHILE ALL THIS IS GOING ON?

24
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:59,779
[NYANTA] I'LL BE CONTENT
JUST ROAMING AROUND,

25
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,445
BROWSING THE SHOPS. MYEAH.

26
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:04,145
[NAOTSUGU] WELL, I'M
GONNA EAT. AND THEN I'M
GONNA EAT SOME MORE!

27
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:05,912
AND AKATSUKI
AND THE OTHERS?

28
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,379
[NYANTA] I DON'T THINK THEY'VE
MENTIONED ANY PLANS, HMM?

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,879
[NAOTSUGU] WELL, I'M SURE
THEY'LL FIND SOMETHING TO DO.

30
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,145
[KANAKO] HERE YOU GO.
TAKE ONE. HERE YOU GO.

31
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:19,445
BRING A FRIEND AND
COME AS A COUPLE.

32
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,579
HM!

33
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,945
ALL RIGHT! I'VE GOT
TO INVITE SHIROE!

34
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,286
[SHIROE] YOU ARE AS BIG A PART
OF THIS AS ANY ONE OF US.

35
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:11,686
I MEAN IT.

36
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:14,853
HM...

37
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,019
(SHIROE YAWNS)

38
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,253
(WIND BLOWS)

39
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,253
[SHIROE] AHH!

40
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:29,753
(GROWLS)

41
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:34,186
COME ON! ARE YOU
FREAKING KIDDING ME?! AAH!

42
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,553
HELLO, SHIROE.

43
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,019
[SHIROE] UH!

44
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,553
[HENRIETTA] ARE YOU SHUTTING
YOURSELF UP IN HERE AGAIN?

45
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:49,986
[SHIROE] BETWEEN HANDLING
OUR PAPERWORK AND TRYING
TO LEARN MORE,

46
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:53,586
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER BEEN SO BUSY.

47
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,753
[SHIROE] HMM...
[HENRIETTA] OK, WELL, ARE YOU
EATING ENOUGH, SLEEPING ENOUGH?

48
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,986
[SHIROE] YEAH, I'M
DOING WHAT I CAN.

49
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:03,653
I TOOK A 15‐MINUTE NAP,
AND I ATE ALMOST 2 HOURS AGO.

50
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,753
[HENRIETTA] UH, OKEY‐DOKEY!
THAT'S FINE, THEN!

51
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:08,219
HERE IS THE INFORMATION
YOU REQUESTED. AHEM.

52
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,519
[SHIROE] THANKS FOR THAT.

53
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:11,119
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO
PUT YOU OUT, THOUGH.

54
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,419
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GIVE ME
A CALL, AND I WOULD HAVE COME.

55
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,719
[HENRIETTA] SO YOU SAY,
BUT WOULD YOU HAVE REALLY
ACTUALLY DONE IT?

56
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,386
YOU SEE, I'VE HEARD YOU'VE
BEEN LOCKED IN THIS ROOM
HERE FOR AGES UPON AGES.

57
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:23,019
SO I WANTED TO CHECK AND MAKE
SURE YOU WERE STILL ALIVE.

58
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:26,986
OK, YOU GOT ME. HOW'S THAT
SCALE FESTIVAL LOOKING?

59
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,819
[HENRIETTA] KARASHIN
IS DOING GREAT.

60
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,619
I MEAN, HE'S REALLY
TAKEN CHARGE OF THE EVENT.

61
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:32,986
[SHIROE] THE GUY
DOES GOOD WORK.

62
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,753
[HENRIETTA] YOU SHOULD
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR

63
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:37,486
AND TRY TO TAKE A BREAK
DURING THESE NEXT 3 DAYS.

64
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:39,919
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
I REALLY SHOULD.

65
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,486
THE FESTIVAL IS BOUND
TO BE PRETTY LOUD.

66
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,353
I CAN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

67
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,686
[HENRIETTA] OH, THAT
IS JUST NONSENSE!
[SHIROE] HUH?

68
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:51,319
[HENRIETTA] THIS IS A WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO BECOME
CLOSER TO YOUR GUILDMATES.

69
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,086
AND SINCE LOG HORIZON
IS OFFICIALLY ONE OF THE
GUILDS OF THE ROUND TABLE,

70
00:04:56,186 --> 00:05:00,319
YOU WILL BE OUT THERE MAKING
THE EVENT FUN AND DELIGHTFUL
AND SUPER!

71
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,686
UH, I GUESS
I'LL TRY.

72
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,519
THAT'S IT.
BE A GOOD BOY.

73
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:04,986
AGH, SURE!

74
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:07,819
[HENRIETTA] AKATSUKI AND
MINORI ARE SO FREAKING CUTE,

75
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,886
I'M LOSING MY MIND!

76
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:12,186
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE
ABLE TO CONTROL MYSELF!

77
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:13,053
WHAT'S THAT?

78
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:14,619
IT'S AN ADORABLE
AKATSUKI DOLL

79
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,153
ADORABLE AKATSUKI
GAVE ME!

80
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,719
(AKATSUKI SHUDDERS)
[SHIROE] IT'S SO CREEPY.

81
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,753
AS LONG AS I HAVE BOTH
OF MY AKATSUKIS,

82
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,453
I DON'T THINK I'LL
EVEN NEED TO EAT!

83
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:25,019
[HENRIETTA] THEY SAY THAT A MAN
DOES NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE.

84
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,886
BUT WITH BREAD AND FANTASIES,

85
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,653
YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH ALMOST
ANYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO DO!

86
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:30,386
WHOA, OH, WHOA!

87
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:33,353
(SHIROE CHUCKLES)

88
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,319
[SHIROE]
SHE'S GOT A POINT.

89
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,986
I GUESS IT WOULDN'T HURT FOR ME
TO GET OUT THERE AND BE SOCIAL.

90
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:41,786
I'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE
TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT OIL

91
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,986
AFTER ALL THOSE REPORTS COME
IN AFTERWARDS ANYWAY.

92
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:48,219
BESIDES, I'M STILL WAITING FOR
SOMETHING TO GO DOWN IN MINAMI.

93
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,386
[AKATSUKI] UH, M‐MY LORD?

94
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:53,119
[SHIROE] UH, AAH!
OH! HEY THERE!

95
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,619
WHAT'S THE MATTER?!
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?!

96
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,619
WELL, UM, NO.
WOULD YOU...

97
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:01,519
LIKE A RED BEAN BUN?

98
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,086
[SHIROE] EHH...

99
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:06,819
[SHIROE] AH...

100
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,619
IT'S BEAUTIFUL TODAY!

101
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,719
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVEN'T
SEEN THE SUN IN FOREVER.

102
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,053
[AKATSUKI] THIS IS FOR YOU.
[SHIROE] HUH? YOU SURE?

103
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:16,953
[SHIROE] PEOPLE ARE CHARGING AN
ARM AND A LEG FOR THOSE HERE.

104
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,619
[AKATSUKI] I GOT THEM FOR YOU.

105
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,386
[SHIROE] THANK YOU.

106
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:24,419
[SHIROE] AH! MM!

107
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,253
[BOTH] MM!

108
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:31,153
[SHIROE] THAT'S GOOD!
IT'S BEEN A REALLY LONG TIME.

109
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:32,986
HUH?

110
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,786
WH‐WHAT'S WRONG?

111
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:37,886
[AKATSUKI] YOU'VE GOT BEAN
PASTE ON YOUR FACE.

112
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,753
[SHIROE] HUH? OH.
HEH, THANKS!

113
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:42,219
[AKATSUKI] YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING
A LITTLE PALE LATELY.

114
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,519
[SHIROE] WHATEVER. I'M FINE.
[AKATSUKI] OH, REALLY?

115
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,186
[SHIROE] MM‐HMM.

116
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,153
[AKATSUKI] SO, MY LORD...

117
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:53,186
SO WHAT'S BEEN
BOTHERING YOU ANYWAY?

118
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:56,253
WHAT? UH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO DURING THE FESTIVAL?

119
00:06:56,353 --> 00:07:01,286
THE FESTIVAL? HONESTLY, I'M
PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO HELP OUT.

120
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:04,153
AT LEAST, I THINK THAT'S
WHAT HENRIETTA SAID.

121
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:05,753
OK.

122
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,019
[AKATSUKI]
I HAVE A QUESTION.

123
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,486
[SHIROE] HMM?

124
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,419
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD, ARE
YOU A FAN OF EATING CAKE?

00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,119
AT THE FESTIVAL TOMORROW.

128
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,686
YOU WANT TO GO EAT SOME
YUMMY CAKE WITH ME?

129
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,419
[SHIROE] IT'S A
CAKE BUFFET?

130
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,486
WELL, I FIGURED YOU
WERE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO LIKES SWEET THINGS.

131
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,419
FROM THE WAY HE EATS
HIS RED BEAN BUNS,

132
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,786
I WOULD SAY YES.

133
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,853
WELL, I CERTAINLY
DON'T DISLIKE THEM!

134
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,653
[AKATSUKI]
WE SHOULD GO,
MY LORD.

135
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:38,119
AND, WELL, IF WE GO AS
A COUPLE, IT'S FREE!

136

00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,653
UH, WHAT YOU GOT
GOING ON THERE?

149
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:13,486
HMM. I'LL BE GOING OUT
WITH SHIROE TOMORROW,

150
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,653
BUT I DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT TO WEAR.

151
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:18,019
YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH HIM? SERIOUSLY?

152
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,619
HE NEVER LETS HIMSELF
GO OUT ANYWHERE!

153
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:23,953
(NAOTSUGU SNORING)

154
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,986
MAYBE HE COMES OUT FROM
BEHIND THAT DESK OF HIS

155
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:28,353
AND LETS HIMSELF HAVE SOME
FRESH AIR ONCE A WEEK.

156
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:29,719
SO WHERE ARE YOU
GUYS GONNA GO?

157
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:30,986
WE'RE GOING TO
A CAKE BUFFET.

158
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,253
WAIT! YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

159
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:34,786
DOES HE EVEN
LIKE CAKE?

160
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:36,986
[MINORI] I THINK SO. IT SAYS
IF YOU WIN THIS CONTEST,

161
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:39,253
YOU GET 2 TICKETS TO
THE TWILIGHT BANQUET

162
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,586
WITH PRINCESS RAYNESHIA ON
THE SECOND DAY OF THEIR EVENT.

163
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:44,053
[ISUZU] WHAT? REALLY?

164
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:46,753
[MINORI] YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
PEOPLE DON'T TRUST SHIROE.

165
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,886
THEY SAY THEY CAN'T TELL
WHAT HE'S REALLY THINKING.

166
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,653
THEY ALWAYS FEEL LIKE
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

167
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:53,553
BUT HE'S A
REALLY NICE GUY.

168
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:55,786
AND IT BUGS ME WHEN
THEY SAY THAT ABOUT HIM.

169
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:57,753
AND I WANT TO SHOW
THEM HE'S A LOT MORE

170
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,519
THAN JUST A VILLAIN
BEHIND GLASSES.

171

(ISUZU CHUCKLES)

172
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,386
OH! THIS IS
JUST TOO GOOD!

173
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:04,886
[ISUZU] YOU'VE GOT
TO LET ME HELP!

174
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,253
I SHALL BE YOUR
FASHION COORDINATOR!

175
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,286
OH, THAT'S SO
NICE OF YOU.

176
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:11,819
THANKS, ISUZU!

177

(AKATSUKI GROANS)

178
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,619
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
WHY DOES MINORI HAVE TO PUT

179
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,886
SO MUCH STINKING
PRESSURE ON ME?

180
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:20,953
SHE'S JUST A MIDDLE‐SCHOOLER,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

181
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,653
UGH. HE TREATS ME LIKE
A MIDDLE‐SCHOOLER SOMETIMES.

182
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,219
IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

183
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:31,153
BUT IS IT MY LORD'S FAULT FOR
TREATING ME LIKE A KID? IS IT?

184
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:32,653
WELL...

185
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:35,519
I COULDN'T DO
THIS WITHOUT YOU.

186
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:38,353
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
MY LORD NEVER JUDGED ME
BASED ON MY APPEARANCE

187
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,786
OR EXPERIENCE LEVEL.

188
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:43,619
HE JUST ACCEPTED ME.

189
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:47,819
HE ACCEPTED ME FOR
EXACTLY WHO I AM.

190
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,286
MY LORD SAID THAT
HE'D ATTEND THE BUFFET

191
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:51,653
WITH BOTH MINORI AND ME.

192
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:54,653
BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR JUST COUPLES ONLY.

193
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:57,953
SO WE SHOULD END UP
ALONE AT SOME POINT.

(GASPS)

195
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:00,753
WAIT A SECOND. IS THIS...

196
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:03,719
IS THIS A DATE?! AAH!

197
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,686
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

198
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:07,653
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
WHAT EVER SHOULD I WEAR?!

(CLATTER)

200

[NYANTA] WHO'S BRINGING
ALL THAT RUCKUS?

201
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,986
[NAOTSUGU] WHO KNOWS?
IT'S AKATSUKI. SHE'S CRAZY.

[MARIELLE] ARE YOU OK?

206
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:24,619

I JUST FELT A DISTURBANCE!

207

NEEDS MY ASSISTANCE!

AKATSUKI, I'M COMING!

209
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,686
[AKATSUKI] I SHOULD
PICK SOMETHING MYSELF.

210
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,219
[KARASHIN] NO, NO, NO.

211
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,019
THAT'S GONNA BE WAY
TOO EXPENSIVE.

212
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,886
NO, I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT.

213
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:40,453
THE COUNCIL DOESN'T REALLY
LIKE TO PLAY FAVORITES.

214
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:42,486
YOUR LOCATION IS
DETERMINED BY LOTTERY.

215

AND THAT'S NOT
GOING TO CHANGE.

216
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:47,653
SO, UH, YOU'RE DOING
ALL THIS BY YOURSELF?

217
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:49,086
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

218
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:51,686
THIS WHOLE THING'S LIKE
A GIANT BUSINESS CONVENTION.

219

WHAT IS ALL
THIS STUFF?

220
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,953
I ASKED FOR EVERYONE
WHO'S INTERESTED TO
SUBMIT THEIR PROPOSALS.

221
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,019
I WANT TO CHECK FOR
ANY DANGEROUS ITEMS.

222
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:01,353

A LOT OF CRAP.

FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE

AS A TEAM AND GO TO THE FINALS,

RIGHT, AKATSUKI?

YEAH.

I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE
EATEN HERE TWICE ANYWAY.

00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:04,589
[SHIROE] WAIT! ARE YOU CRAZY?!
THOSE CAKES ARE HUGE!

298
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:08,189
IT'S JUST A LITTLE PRESENT
FOR YOU FROM MY GUILD.

299
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:11,856
[SHIROE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH...

300
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,022
[SHIROE] OK...

301
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,856
[SHIROE] MIGHT AS WELL
START AT THE BEGINNING.

302
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,922
[MINORI] LET'S DO THIS!
[AKATSUKI] LET'S DIG IN.

303
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,222
[ALL] MM!

304
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:27,589
IT'S GREAT!

305
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,356
[AKATSUKI] YEAH, MY LORD.
DO YOU REALLY LIKE IT?

306
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:30,556
[SHIROE] WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?!

307
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,422
I'M SERVING YOU,
MY LORD.

308
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,722
OK, BUT NOT A WHOLE
FREAKING CAKE!

309
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:36,722
[MINORI] OH, LET ME GO AHEAD
AND CUT IT UP FOR YOU.

310
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,889
[SHIROE] THAT ISN'T GONNA
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

311
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:42,156
[MALE] THAT'S NOT FAIR.
HE GOT TO BRING 2.

312
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,256
[FEMALE] UNBELIEVABLE...

313
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:44,756
[MALE] IS HE TRYING
TO SHOW OFF?

314
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:46,589
[SHIROE, THINKING] OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT HOW THIS LOOKS?

315
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,589
THERE'S NO NEED TO GET THE
GIRLS TOO INVOLVED IN THIS.

316
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,589
I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T
GET UPSET RIGHT NOW.

317
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:55,789
BUT I SHOULD MINIMIZE
THE DAMAGE AND RETREAT.

318
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,989
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD...
(SHIROE GASPS)

319
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,156
[AKATSUKI] HERE YOU GO.

320
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:02,289
[SHIROE] UH! YOU REALLY
WANT ME TO KEEP EATING?

321
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:05,456
[AKATSUKI] OF COURSE,
MY LORD. SAY "AHH."

322
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,422
(SHIROE MOANS)

323
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:09,922
COME ON OR IT'S
GONNA FALL OFF.

324
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:13,922
[AKATSUKI] IS IT GOOD, MY LORD?
[SHIROE] MM‐HMM!

325
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:18,356
[MINORI] MASTER SHIROE,
SAY "AHH."

326
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,056
(SHIROE GROANS)

327
00:15:20,156 --> 00:15:21,522
TRY THIS ONE, TOO!

328
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,056
[SHIROE] UH...

329
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,856
[MINORI] IS IT GOOD?
(AKATSUKI GROANS SOFTLY)

330
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:26,922
[SHIROE] OH, YEAH,
IT'S GOOD, BUT...

331
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:28,922
[SHIROE, THINKING]
I SWEAR I'D RATHER FIGHT

332
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:33,089
A DOZEN RAID BOSSES AT ONCE
AND RISK DYING A DOZEN TIMES.

333
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:34,489
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD...

334
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:37,356
THERE'S STILL
MORE. AHH!

335
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:40,089
AND ANOTHER. AHH!

336
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,656
HELP ME...

337
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:45,022
[AKATSUKI] AHH!
[MINORI] AHH!

338
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:46,322
[GIRLS] AHH!

339
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,456
[SHIROE] FOR THE LOVE
OF GOD, STOP THE CAKE!

340
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:51,156
(SHIROE GROANS)

341
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:53,289
[KANAKO] THANK YOU!
COME BACK AND SEE US. BYE...

342
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,689
[MINORI]
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

343
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,789
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D HAVE
TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

344
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,456
[SHIROE] WE COULDN'T
EAT THEM ALL,

345
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:00,556
SO I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT
OF CHOICE ABOUT THAT.

346
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:03,289
ARE YOU GOING HOME
TO REST, MY LORD?

347
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:04,489
[SHIROE] I WAS GOING
TO LOOK AROUND A BIT,

348
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,122
BUT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

349
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:08,722
(SHIROE GROANING)

350
00:16:08,822 --> 00:16:12,422
[MINORI] UM, YOU TWO
GO ON WITHOUT ME.

351
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,722
I NEED TO MAKE A STOP
BEFORE GOING BACK.

352
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,889
[ROBOT] I LIKE YOUR OUTFIT.
[MALE] THANK YOU!

353
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:20,789
[ROBOT] IT LOOKED REALLY GREAT.
I LIKE IT. I LIKE YOUR OUTFIT.

354
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:22,522
[MINORI, THINKING] I'M SAD WE
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO MEET

355
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:24,822
THE PRINCESS AT THE
TWILIGHT BANQUET,

356
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:27,689
BUT SHIROE WENT AND
ATE ALL THAT CAKE.

357
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:29,556
I'VE GOT TO THANK
HIM SOMEHOW.

358
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,556
DANDELION BARLEY TEA IS GOOD
FOR INDIGESTION, RIGHT?

359
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:42,456
(SHIROE MOANING)

360
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,389
[SHIROE] MY STOMACH...

361
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:47,256
WHO HEARD OF 3 PEOPLE
EATING 12 WHOLE CAKES?

362
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,489
SOMEBODY'S GONNA PAY FOR THIS.

363
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:51,522
WAIT. I KNOW.

364
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,456
[SOUJIRO] A CAKE BUFFET?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

365
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,322
[SHIROE, VOICE‐CHAT]
OH, YEAH. AND IT'S REALLY
AWESOME. YOU SHOULD GO.

366
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:58,722
IT'LL BE FREE.

367
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:01,656
[SOUJIRO] THAT SOUNDS GREAT!
I'LL DEFINITELY GO.

368
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,322
I MEAN, WHO
DOESN'T LIKE CAKE?

369
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,989
THANKS FOR LETTING
ME KNOW, SHIROE.

370
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,689
[SHIROE] OF COURSE!

371
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:11,122
[SHIROE, THINKING] WITH ALL
HIS GIRLS, HE'LL WEIGH 600
POUNDS BEFORE HE'S DONE.

372
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,656
EVEN WITH ALL THE ATTENTION
THOSE GIRLS GIVE HIM,

373
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:19,756
SOUJIRO DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A
PROBLEM RUNNING HIS GUILD.

374
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,556
AND NAOTSUGU AND CHIEF NYANTA,

375
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:25,822
THEY HAVE THOSE LEADERSHIP
QUALITIES I LOOK FOR IN
A GUILD MASTER, TOO.

376
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:28,322
THERE'S A PRESENCE
TO IT I DON'T HAVE.

377
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,956
MAYBE HENRIETTA'S RIGHT,

378
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,689
AND THE OPPORTUNITY'S RIGHT
HERE IN FRONT OF ME.

379
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,722
JUST MAKE THE TIME AND
SPEND IT WITH EVERYONE.

380
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,122
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD.
[SHIROE] HUH?

381
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:40,056
[SHIROE] WHAT?! WHEN THE
HECK DID YOU GET HERE?!

382
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:44,956
[AKATSUKI] A SECOND AGO.
[SHIROE] OH. IS SOMETHING WRONG?

383
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:46,189
[AKATSUKI] NO.

384
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:48,322
THERE IS NOTHING
WRONG, MY LORD.

385
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,856
(FIREWORK REPORT)

386
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:53,756
[AKATSUKI] THE TOWN IS EVEN
MORE LIVELY THAN USUAL.

387
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,989
[SHIROE] THAT'S WHAT
FESTIVALS ARE FOR.

388
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:57,522
WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE,

389
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:01,056
I WOULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED THINGS
BEING LIKE THIS AT ALL.

390
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,222
[AKATSUKI] YEAH.

391
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:09,422
[SHIROE] YOU'RE KIND OF QUIET.
[AKATSUKI] I'M ALWAYS QUIET.

392
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,922
I'M A NINJA.

393
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,289
[SHIROE] NOT LIKE THIS.

394
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:16,355
MY LORD...

395
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:17,455
HM?

396
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,689
DO YOU, WELL,
DO YOU...

397
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,522
DO YOU NOT
REALLY LIKE CAKE?

398
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:22,955
UH...

399
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:27,589
OR DID... OR DID YOU
NOT HAVE ANY FUN?

400
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,022
[SHIROE] I WOULDN'T
SAY THAT.

401
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:31,855
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY
WE DIDN'T ADVANCE.

402
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:33,655
[AKATSUKI]
THAT DOESN'T
MATTER TO ME.

403
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:36,489
IT WAS MINORI
WHO WANTED TO GO.

404
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,589
[SHIROE] I GUESS.

405
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:43,189
[SHIROE] LET ME ASK YOU,
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAD
A PROBLEM WITH THE CAKE.

406
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,589
[AKATSUKI] HM?
[SHIROE] IT SEEMS LIKE I
WAS DOING ALL THE EATING.

407
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:48,422
I DON'T THINK EITHER
OF YOU HAD ANY OF IT.

408
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:50,322
I GUESS I...

409
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:53,489
I WASN'T THERE FOR THE WHOLE
CAKE‐EATING PART OF IT.

410
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:55,255
[SHIROE] OK...?

411
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:58,089
[AKATSUKI] I FIND IT DIFFICULT
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH YOU, MY LORD.

412
00:18:58,189 --> 00:19:00,022
[SHIROE] I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, YOU KNOW?

413
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:03,055
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GIVE ME
A LOT TO WORK WITH, AKATSUKI.

414
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:04,955
[AKATSUKI] THAT'S NOT TRUE!

415
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:07,322
I HAVE ALL SORTS OF
THINGS TO DISCUSS.

416
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:10,522
[SHIROE] OK, PICK A SUBJECT
FOR US AND LET'S TALK.

417
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:13,022
[AKATSUKI] UH, HMM...

418
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:15,855
[SHIROE, THINKING] MAYBE I
SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED IT.

419
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:22,355
[SHIROE] UM, I DIDN'T MEAN...
I'M SORRY. HEY! WAIT!

420
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:30,455
[AKATSUKI] I LIKE TO
DO THIS. IT'S FUN.

421
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:32,255
[SHIROE] UH...

422
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:35,789
[SHIROE] THIS IS
REALLY FUN FOR YOU?

423
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:39,822
[AKATSUKI] IT IS FOR ME.
[SHIROE] UM...

424
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:41,722
[SHIROE, THINKING]
IS THIS PART OF THE WHOLE

425
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,555
LORD AND SERVANT THING SHE
LIKES DOING WITH ME?

426
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:46,855
(AKATSUKI CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

427
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:50,655
[SHIROE] SO THIS IS FUN? REALLY?
[AKATSUKI] YES, IT IS.

428
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,489
[SHIROE] OKEY‐DOKEY...

429
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:57,255
(FOOTSTEPS AND PANTING)

430
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,555
[MINORI, THINKING]
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

431
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:11,422
WHY?

432
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:17,355
[MINORI, THINKING] AKATSUKI...

433
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:20,389
SHE LIKES HIM.

434
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,855
SHE REALLY LIKES HIM.

435
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:29,322
AND I...

436
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:32,322
WHAT DO I DO?

437
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,122
I LIKE HIM, TOO.

438
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:43,789
(SOBBING)

439
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,555
IT ISN'T FAIR!
SHIROE IS MINE!

440
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,122
NOT FAIR...

441
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:56,022
I CAN'T SAY THAT.
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

442
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,989
BUT STILL, IT STILL HURTS.

443
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:04,989
[TOYA] MINORI?

444
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,122
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT
HERE ALL BY YOURSELF?

445
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:11,522
OH. HEY, WHAT'S THE
MATTER WITH YOU?

446
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:13,389
TOYA...

447
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:18,789
[TOYA] MINORI, YOU GOT
TO TELL ME WHAT'S UP.

448
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:21,155
[MINORI] LISTEN, TOYA...

449
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:25,689
I THINK I'VE GOT A
CRUSH ON MASTER SHIROE.

450
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,422
OH, YEAH. I'M SURE.

451
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:29,822
[TOYA] SERIOUSLY?

452
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,422
AND YOU JUST NOW
FIGURED THAT OUT?
[MINORI] HUH?

453
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,455
[TOYA] THAT WAS PRETTY
OBVIOUS TO THE REST OF US.

454
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,755
[MINORI] NO WAY!

455
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,522
WELL, WHAT'S NOT TO
LIKE ABOUT HIM?

456
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:41,622
HE'S A REALLY SMART GUY, AND HE
ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT ALL OF US.

457
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:43,189
I COULD SEE YOU
LIKING HIM A LOT.

458
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,122
[MINORI] DIDN'T I
KEEP IT TO MYSELF?

459
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,522
[TOYA] NOT LIKE YOU CAN KEEP
ANYTHING FROM YOUR TWIN BROTHER.

460
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,689
I KIND OF THINK MASTER SHIROE'S
PRETTY COOL, TOO, YOU KNOW?

461
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,522
[MINORI] HUH? TOYA!
YOU LIKE HIM, TOO?!

462
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:56,189
[MINORI] AHH!
[TOYA] NO WAY!

463
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:00,155
[MINORI] THIS IS
A PROBLEM.

464
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:01,022
[TOYA] WHY?

465
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,755
[MINORI] WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, WHY?

466
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,789
[TOYA] I DON'T THINK
IT'S A PROBLEM.

467
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,222
[MINORI] HUH?

468
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:09,789
IT'S ONLY A CRUSH, RIGHT?
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

469
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:11,822
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

470
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:18,689
[MINORI]
I'M NOT SO SURE.

471
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:21,455
[TOYA] IT WON'T HURT
FOREVER. I PROMISE.

472
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:23,222
[MINORI] HMM.

473
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:28,689
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NATURAL, RIGHT?

474
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,255
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO HURT.

475
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:35,255
I HAVEN'T LOST ANYTHING.
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

476
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:39,922
I GUESS I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF, DO I?

477
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:42,122
[TOYA] EXACTLY.

478
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:44,322
[MINORI] YEAH!

479
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:17,822
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
THE GIRL SIMPLY ADMIRED HIM.

480
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,855
SHE WANTED TO
BE LIKE HIM...

481
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:21,355
TO FOLLOW HIM.

482
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:22,889
TO STAND BEHIND HIM.

483
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:24,422
THAT WAS ALL.

484
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:27,889
BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR
THOSE FEELINGS TO GROW DEEPER.

485
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:29,689
MINORI IS IN LOVE
WITH SHIROE,

486
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:31,822
NEXT TIME ON "LOG HORIZON."

487
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:34,889
[SHIROE] WE WILL
CHANGE THE WORLD.
