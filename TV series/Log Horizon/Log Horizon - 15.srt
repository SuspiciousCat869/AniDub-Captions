1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,808
(MARIELLE GASPS) THE SECOND
GROUP OF INSTRUCTORS IS HERE.

2
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:11,712
THIS SUMMER CAMP IS TOTALLY
GOING OFF WITHOUT A HITCH.

3
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,114
I'M SO HAPPY.

4
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,280
(WATER FLOWING)

5
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,396
[MINORI] SERIOUSLY.
LET'S USE THE EXTRA TIME

6
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,666
TO DISCUSS OUR STRATEGY
AND GO A LITTLE LATER.

7
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,000
NOW, LOOK HERE, MINORI.

8
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,703
WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU THINK
WE'RE DOING OUT HERE ANYWAY?

9
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,040
WE NEED TO GET AS MUCH
EXPERIENCE AS WE CAN
TO RAISE OUR LEVELS,

10
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,475
AND WE NEED TO GO TO
THE DUNGEON TO DO THAT.

11
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,145
OF COURSE. BUT HERE'S THE
THING ABOUT IT...

12
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,948
WE'VE BARELY LASTED
3 HOURS A DAY IN THERE.

13
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,750
OK... WHAT'S
YOUR POINT?

14
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,352
MY POINT IS IF WE'RE ONLY
GOING TO LAST THAT LONG,

15
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,822
WE MIGHT AS WELL GO LATER IN THE
DAY SINCE WE'RE GETTING BEAT.

16
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,357
YEAH? AND
WHY IS THAT?

17
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,360
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T WORKED
OUT A STRATEGY YET!

18
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,762
[SERARA] MINORI‐CHAN...

19
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,496
[RUDY] SO WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO THIS MORNING?

20
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,667
[MINORI] LET'S TRY TAKING
IT EASY FOR A CHANGE.

21
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,303
[RUDY] MISS MINORI, YOU
CANNOT BE SERIOUS ABOUT THAT!

22
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,106
[ISUZU] CALM DOWN, RUDY.
SHE'S SERIOUS.

23
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,141
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE ON
TO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

24
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,777
[RUDY] UHH.

25
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,445
[MINORI] I DIDN'T EXACTLY
MEAN TAKE IT EASY, ANYWAY.

26
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,182
BUT WE NEED TO TAKE THE
TIME TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

27
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,517
WE DID THAT.

28
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,119
WE ALREADY INTRODUCED
OURSELVES TO EACH OTHER.

29
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,654
OH NO, WE DIDN'T.

30
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:08,655
WHAT?

31
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,391
NOT IN A WAY THAT COUNTS.
NOT REALLY.

32
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,928
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ALL THAT
HELPFUL ABOUT ANY OF YOU.

33
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,899
YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES...
WHAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE.

34
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,701
[MINORI] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
WANT TO STAND AT THE FRONT

35
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,903
OR STAY AT THE BACK
OF THE FORMATION.

36
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,339
KNOWING THESE THINGS IS
IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT
ME TO HELP, ANYWAY.

37
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,441
SO, LET ME KNOW.

38
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,044
I'M NOT THAT POWERFUL,

39
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,679
AND I CAN'T REALLY HELP YOU,

40
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,015
NOT UNLESS YOU
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

41
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,751
AND WHEN I SAY
EVERYTHING, I MEAN IT.

42
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,152
EVERYTHING?

43
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,187
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL.

44
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,024
OK. LET ME GIVE
YOU AN EXAMPLE.

45
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,426
WHAT'S THE NAME OF
YOUR FIRE MAGIC?

46
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,530
HMM. IT IS THE ORB OF LAVA.

47
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,633
AMAZING. AN INCREDIBLE
BALL OF MOLTEN MAGMA.

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,368
[MINORI] RIGHT. SO THAT
REALLY DOESN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

49
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,137
OTHER THAN YOU LIKE IT.

50
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,374
RUNDELLHAUS, WHY DO YOU USE
THE ORB OF LAVA INSTEAD
OF ANYTHING ELSE?

51
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,176
WHY DO YOU KEEP
USING IT INSTEAD OF

52
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,279
SOME OF YOUR OTHER
ATTACK SPELLS?

53
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,449
I USE IT BECAUSE IT'S
EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE, OK?

54
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,484
AND WHY IS
IT EFFECTIVE?

55
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,986
HUH.

56
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,555
OH, COME ON NOW.

57
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,857
IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE
OF THE MOST POWERFUL SPELLS

58
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,659
I'VE EVER MASTERED.

59
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,360
MY CASTING TIME
IS REALLY INSANE.

60
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,129
TWO SECONDS AND IT'S GONE.

61
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,165
THAT AND ITS
COOL‐DOWN TIME IS 18.

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,735
SERIOUSLY, I COULD JUST
STAND THERE AND CAST IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

63
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:33,006
I MEAN, IT'S A MAJOR ATTACK
SPELL I COULD CAST EVERY
20 SECONDS, ALL THE TIME.

64
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,643
NOW, HANG ON A SECOND...

65
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,514
ONE OF THE WAYS A SAMURAI
GETS THINGS DONE IS
BY TAUNTING HIS FOES.

66
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,415
NEVER HEARD OF
THAT BEFORE.

67
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,385
[TOYA] YEAH. TAUNTS
DISTRACT THE ENEMY.

68
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,122
WHEN THEY'RE PROVOKED,
I CAN HIT THEM WITH AN ATTACK,

69
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,025
LIKE THE THUNDER SLASH,
WHICH IS POWERFUL.

70
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,360
BUT IT'S ONLY GOOD
FOR 3 METERS.

71
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,730
ANOTHER ATTACK OF MINE,
THE SAMURAI'S CHALLENGE,

72
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,431
HAS EVEN LESS RANGE.

73
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,401
[RUDY] OK, SO
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

74
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,770
THEY'RE JUST EXAMPLES OF
WAYS TO TAUNT THE ENEMY.

75
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,207
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY DO
ANY REAL DAMAGE OR ANYTHING
DURING THE FIGHT,

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,678
BUT AN ENEMY OF LOW INTELLIGENCE
WILL THINK THAT THEY'VE TAKEN
A WHOLE BUNCH OF HITS.

77
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,713
LIKE SKELETONS?

78
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,781
YOU USE TAUNTS TO
DRAW THEIR ATTENTION?

79
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,919
THAT'S RIGHT. THE SAMURAI
HAS HIGH DEFENSIVE
CAPABILITY IN A FIGHT.

80
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,489
SO I'M SUPPOSED TO KEEP
THEM FOCUSED ON ME INSTEAD
OF THE REST OF YOU.

81
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,660
[TOYA] NOW, SAMURAI'S CHALLENGE
TAKES TWO SECONDS TO LAND.

82
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,095
THAT'S JUST LIKE
RUDY'S ORB OF LAVA.

83
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,398
BUT IT DOESN'T AFFECT ANYTHING
PAST THE REACH OF MY SWORD.

84
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,167
[RUDY] RIGHT.
I GET IT.

85
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,202
IF BOTH OF US ATTACK
AT THE VERY SAME TIME

86
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,171
WHEN WE'RE IN RANGE
OF THE ENEMY.

87
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:42,242
MM‐HMM. YOUR ORB OF LAVA
WILL HIT THE ATTACKING
SKELETONS FIRST.

88
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,812
AND THEN WE END UP LOSING
THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING
THEM COME AFTER ME.

89
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,715
AND THAT'S WHY ALL THE ENEMIES
HAVE BEEN GOING AFTER YOU.

90
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,484
SO THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO
TELL ME NOT TO USE IT?!

91
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,554
I'M TELLING YOU TO
WAIT TWO SECONDS!

92
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,589
THE LOSS OF TWO
SECONDS CAN BE FATAL

93
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,191
IN A GLORIOUS,
ELEGANT BATTLE!

94
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,326
[ISUZU] OK, LET ME THINK...

95
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,896
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO TRY OUT...

96
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,297
THE FUGUE OF COWARDS.

97
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,699
WHAT IS THAT?

98
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,401
[RUDY] SOUNDS COWARDLY,
JUDGING BY THE NAME.

99
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,270
IS THAT A SKILL
OF YOURS, MISS ISUZU?

100
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,607
[ISUZU] WELL, THE FUGUE OF
COWARDS IS A DEFENSE SONG
THAT I JUST PICKED UP.

101
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,476
IT'S A SONG THAT PROVIDES
CONTINUOUS SUPPORT.

102
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,211
[SERARA] IT'S CONTINUOUS?

103
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,582
[ISUZU] IN OTHER WORDS,
IT KEEPS ON GOING AFTER
I START PLAYING IT.

104
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,017
IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE
A NON‐WARRIOR CLASS,

105
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,319
THE FUGUE OF COWARDS
MAKES THE DAMAGE YOU DEAL

106
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,854
APPEAR LOWER THAN
IT ACTUALLY IS

107
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,856
AND THE ENEMY MISJUDGES
ITS STRENGTH.

108
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,191
[TOYA] YOU HAVE
A SKILL LIKE THAT?

109
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,392
[RUDY]
SERIOUSLY?

110
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,894
[ISUZU] SURE,
BUT YOU KNOW,

111
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,395
I JUST LEARNED IT, SO,

112
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,931
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S ALL
THAT AMAZING, REALLY.

113
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,533
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS USELESS.

114
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,568
IT DOESN'T DO ANY
DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY

115
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,870
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO HELP TO HEAL ANYBODY.

116
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,305
[TOYA] NO, IT'S GREAT.

117
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,608
[RUDY] YOU KNOW,
THAT COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL.

118
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,410
I'M GLAD YOU SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

119
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,848
MISS MINORI, IT WOULD
APPEAR I MIGHT OWE YOU
A BIT OF AN APOLOGY.

120
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:59,119
I HUMBLY ADMIT MY IGNORANCE,
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING,
AND FOOLISHNESS.

121
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,422
IT'S FINE. IT'S NOT LIKE I
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, EITHER.

122
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,824
SO, THEN, LET'S TAKE SOME TIME

123
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,993
AND GO OVER ALL THE SPELLS
YOU KNOW, RUNDELLHAUS.

124
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,429
WHAT DO YOU LIKE AND
DISLIKE ABOUT THEM?

125
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,864
WHEN DO YOU USE THEM?

126
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,198
WHEN WOULD YOU
LIKE TO USE THEM?

127
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,534
TELL YOU ALL OF THEM?

128
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,236
THAT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT
OF TIME, MISS MINORI.

129
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,171
WE JUST MADE
THE TIME, RUDY.

130
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,472
SO TELL US ABOUT IT.

131
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,642
THAT'S RIGHT.
LET'S HEAR 'EM!

132
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,044
OK. LET'S START WITH
WHAT YOU ALREADY TOLD ME

133
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,880
AND WORK THROUGH THE
REST OF WHAT YOU GOT.

134
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,423
THEIR PATROL'S
COMING UP, GUYS.

135
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,459
[ISUZU] LOOKS LIKE THERE'S FIVE.

136
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,728
THEY'LL BE HERE IN
ABOUT 10 MEASURES.

137
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,867
[TOYA, THINKING]
OK. 10 MEASURES IS...

138
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,502
ABOUT 20 SECONDS.

139
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,205
LET'S DO THIS
LIKE WE SAID.

140
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,711
[TOYA, THINKING]
IT'LL BE FINE. I CAN DO THIS.

141
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,946
[SERARA, THINKING] YESTERDAY,
WE SPENT ALL DAY TALKING

142
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,448
INSTEAD OF GOING
INTO THE DUNGEON.

143
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,285
[ISUZU, THINKING] I KNOW
WHAT EVERYONE'S SKILLS ARE

144
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,420
AND WE CAN MAKE
THEM WORK TOGETHER.

145
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,022
[RUDY, THINKING]
I SPENT A LOT OF VALUABLE TIME

146
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:12,526
LISTENING TO WHAT EVERYBODY SAID
ABOUT OUR TALENTS YESTERDAY.

147
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,460
THIS HAD BETTER WORK.

148
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:18,298
[MINORI, THINKING]
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

149
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:24,337
[MINORI] FORMATION STYLE,
THE OPERATOR, THE FIELD
MONITOR, AND PATROL COLUMN.

150
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,872
SO, THE NEXT THING
WE HAVE TO DO

151
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,309
IS MEMORIZE THE BASICS OF
PARTY COMBAT I JUST WENT OVER.

152
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,077
[RUDY] I'VE
GOT IT IN MY HEAD,

153
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,615
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH IT NOW THAT I
KNOW ABOUT IT, MINORI?

154
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,449
[MINORI] WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS.

155
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,084
[TOYA] CONTACT!
[MINORI] HUH?

156
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,221
[TOYA] LIGHTNING SLASH!

157
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,156
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER] YOU HAVE
TO BE FAMILIAR WITH YOUR

158
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,991
PARTY'S FORMATION FIRST.

159
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,729
THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT OUR
FRONT‐LINE FIGHTER, OUR SAMURAI,

160
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,731
WILL DRAW THE ENEMY'S ATTACKS.

161
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,099
BUT IF HE DOESN'T GET
SUPPORT FROM THE REST OF US,

162
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,434
HE'S IN BIG TROUBLE.

163
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,937
OK, GUYS, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY!

164
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,238
[ISUZU] UHH!

165
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,207
[MINORI] UHH! OH... OH, UHH.

166
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,309
[RUDY] GET BACK!

167
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,479
UHH! ALL RIGHT,
LOOK HERE, SKINNY...

168
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,350
I'M NOT GONNA WASTE AN ORB OF
LAVA ON JUST ONE OF YOU LOSERS.

169
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,618
LET'S DO THIS!

170
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,988
A LITTLE BIT MORE
ELEGANTLY THIS TIME.

171
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,289
LIGHTNING CHAMBER!

172
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,360
[TOYA] YEAH! UHH!

173
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,229
AAH! BACK OFF! UHH!

174
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,032
TOYA'S HP IS DOWN TO 64%!

175
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,267
HE NEEDS SOME HEALING!

176
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,735
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER]
ONCE YOU KNOW YOUR FORMATION,

177
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,771
YOU HAVE TO WORK
WITH YOUR OPERATOR.

178
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,540
THE OPERATOR MONITORS
EVERYONE'S STATUS,

179
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,709
AND SINCE IT'S A WASTE OF
TIME FOR ME AND SERARA

180
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,044
TO CAST HEALING SPELLS
AT THE SAME TIME,

181
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,246
I CAN FILL THAT ROLE
AND KEEP AN EYE ON

182
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,615
WHO NEEDS HELP OUT THERE.

183
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,250
THANKS A LOT!
I NEEDED THAT! UHH!

184
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,722
[TOYA, THINKING] OH, MAN.
THIS IS REALLY STARTING TO HURT.

185
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,724
[NAOTSUGU] YOUR JOB
AS A FRONT‐LINE TANK

186
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,659
IS TO ABSORB ALL THE ENEMY HITS

187
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,928
AND TRUST YOUR COMPANIONS
TO HAVE YOUR BACK.

188
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:59,065
TOYA, AS A MAN, YOU GOTTA
PROMISE TO BE AWESOME.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,669
[TOYA] I DIDN'T FORGET,
MASTER NAOTSUGU.

190
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,271
RIGHT. YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?!

191
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,608
SAMURAI'S CHALLENGE!

192
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,844
UHH! UHH!

193
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,846
MINORI, WATCH MY BACK!

194
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,516
I'M GONNA NEED SOME
HEAVY‐DUTY MAGIC, YOU GUYS!

195
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,250
[ISUZU AND MINORI] RIGHT!
[RUDY] YEAH!

196
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,953
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER]
IN THIS CASE, I'M ALSO
THE FIELD MONITOR.

197
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,388
AN OPERATOR KEEPS AN EYE
ON THE PARTY'S HEALTH,

198
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,826
BUT A FIELD MONITOR WATCHES OVER
CHANGING BATTLEFIELD CONDITIONS,

199
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,461
ALLOWING THE PARTY
TO CONTINUE FIGHTING.

200
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:32,533
CHECKING AHEAD! I DON'T SEE ANY
ENEMY PATROLS IN THE CORRIDOR!

201
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,001
THEY DON'T HAVE BACKUP.
GO AHEAD AND ENGAGE!

202
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,538
DID YOU MANAGE TO GET
THEM ALL MAD AT US?

203
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,606
[TOYA] NO. I HAD TO USE
SAMURAI'S CHALLENGE

204
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,174
TWICE ON ALL OF THEM.

205
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,578
NOW THEY DEFINITELY WANT TO
BEAT ON ME INSTEAD OF YOU GUYS.

206
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,648
OK. LET'S TEST THAT
DISTRACTION OF YOURS.

207
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,350
[ISUZU] BEAT OF RESONANCE!

208
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,122
ORB OF LAVA!

209
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:00,326
ALL RIGHT. IT'S TIME TO
SEND YOU BACK TO THE
DARKNESS YOU CAME FROM!

210
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,195
YAH!

211
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,165
[TOYA] AWESOME!

212
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,669
[RUDY] FRIGID WIND!

213
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,042
[ISUZU] OHH.

214
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,513
REINFORCED RECTANGLE!

215
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,682
LET'S GET OUR
PATROL FILE GOING!

216
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,584
[MINORI, VOICE‐OVER] CALLING
A SPECIFIC PATROL FILE

217
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,418
ALLOWS EVERYONE
TO WATCH OVERLAPPING

218
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,853
PARTS OF THE BATTLE AREA.

219
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,756
IT ALSO PUTS HEALERS AND
FIGHTERS IN THE RIGHT PLACE

220
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,692
IN CASE A PARTY
GETS ATTACKED AGAIN.

221
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,860
THE IDEA HERE IS
TO BE ABLE TO SEE

222
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,396
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO.

223
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,734
[RUDY] SO, DID WE TRIUMPH?

224
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,503
I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING ELSE.

225
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,404
IT LOOKS LIKE WE REALLY DID!

226
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:45,772
[TOYA] ALL RIGHT!

227
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,074
(ISUZU LAUGHS)
[SERARA] WE DID IT!

228
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,544
HUH. NOW THAT'S
HOW WE DO IT, GUYS.

229
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,245
YOU SEE, MAN, I TOLD YA!

230
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,413
IT TOTALLY WORKED!

231
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,315
(LAUGHTER)

232
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,251
[MINORI, THINKING]
BROTHER SHIROE, I GET IT NOW.

233
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,287
WE JUST NEEDED TO TALK TO EACH
OTHER AND WORK THINGS OUT.

234
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,458
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
LITTLE THINGS THAT'S MORE
IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING.

235
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,230
AND IT MADE OUR IMPROVISED PARTY
A REAL GROUP OF TRUE FRIENDS.

236
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,074
[HENRIETTA] THANKS SO MUCH.

237
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,777
WRITING ON THIS WORLD'S
PAPER IS CHALLENGING.

238
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,512
YOU CAN TAKE AS
MUCH AS YOU NEED.

239
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:29,415
MAKING PAPER AND INK
IS SORT OF IN THE JOB
DESCRIPTION OF A SCRIBE.

240
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,885
BUT I STILL NEED SOME
PRACTICE MAKING THE INK.

241
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,688
WELL, NOW. IF THIS BATCH
IS ANYTHING LIKE THE LAST,

242
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,690
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORK THAT HARD.

243
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,892
WRITING WITH IT ISN'T
MY ONLY OBJECTIVE.

244
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,627
[HENRIETTA] HUH?
[SHIROE] BACK WHEN
YOU WERE PLAYING,

245
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,664
DIDN'T YOU HAVE ANY
MISSIONS WHERE THE
QUALITY OF YOUR DOCUMENTS

246
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,666
AFFECTED THE OUTCOME
OF YOUR QUEST?

247
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,968
WELL, I GUESS I DID.

248
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,737
[SHIROE] A SINGLE DOCUMENT
CAN BE A MAGICAL ITEM,

249
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,339
AND IF YOU WANT THE
DOCUMENT TO BE EFFECTIVE,

250
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:58,111
YOU HAVE TO COMPOSE IT WITH MORE
HIGHLY‐REFINED INK AND PAPER.

251
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,380
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

252
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,217
SO, YOU'RE COPYING THIS MAP TO
RAISE YOUR SKILL IN CARTOGRAPHY.

253
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,888
[SHIROE] NO. I JUST
NEED A BETTER COPY.

254
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,990
ALL THESE PAPYRUS
AND TREE BARK MAPS

255
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,359
KEEP FALLING APART ON ME
BEFORE I'M DONE WITH THEM.

256
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,529
[HENRIETTA] YOU LOOK TIRED.
[SHIROE] HMM.

257
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,265
[HENRIETTA] MAKING ALL THIS
HAPPEN REALLY IS A LOT OF
WORK FOR YOU, AM I RIGHT?

258
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,267
[SHIROE] YEAH, I DON'T
THINK THAT'S THE REASON.

259
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,903
[HENRIETTA] HMM?
[SHIROE] UH, WHAT I MEAN

260
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,338
IS MAYBE I'M TIRED FROM
THE DANCE LAST NIGHT.

261
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,809
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE THE
TWO OF US SHOULD GET IN A
LITTLE MORE PRACTICE TIME

262
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,777
IN CASE THEY HAVE
ANOTHER EVENT.

263
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,312
[SHIROE] I'M GOOD. REALLY.

264
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,649
[HENRIETTA] ANYTIME YOU WANT TO,
JUST GET IN TOUCH WITH ME.

265
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,350
THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR HELP.

266
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,525
I LOOK TIRED? YEAH...

267
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,126
I GUESS SHE COULD BE RIGHT.

268
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,195
MAYBE I'M THINKING WAY
TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS.

269
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,066
HMM.

270
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,440
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] EVERY TIME
WE DIE IN THIS WORLD,

271
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,576
WE LOSE OUR MEMORIES.

272
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,144
SO DOES THAT MEAN...

273
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:08,782
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE
COULD FORGET THE REAL WORLD?

274
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:12,085
[SHIROE, THINKING]
THERE'S SO MUCH WE DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THIS WORLD.

275
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,054
WE CAN'T JUST ASSUME
THERE'S A COMFY CHAIR

276
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,922
AND A SNACK WAITING
FOR US AFTERWARDS.

277
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,323
(BEEPING)
HUH?

278
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,661
(CHIME)
[MINORI] GOOD EVENING,
BROTHER SHIROE.

279
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:22,062
WHAT'S GOING ON?

280
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,765
SO, HOW DID IT GO IN THE
DUNGEON FOR YOU GUYS? OK?

281
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,733
[MINORI] HA! YOU ALREADY
KNOW, DON'T YOU?

282
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,801
WELL, YEAH.

283
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,670
BUT YOU SOUND REALLY HAPPY.

284
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,938
OH. I AM.

285
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,607
I'LL GIVE YOU THE REPORT.

286
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:37,310
WE MET TO DISCUSS OUR STRATEGY
AT AROUND 7:30 THIS MORNING.

287
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,181
WE EXPLORED SEVERAL
OPTIONS AND THEN MADE
OUR WAY TO THE DUNGEON.

288
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,750
WE GOT AS FAR AS THE
END OF THE RIGHT FORK,

289
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,621
AND THEN WE DEFEATED THE BURNING
DEAD AT THE BLAST FURNACE.

290
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,122
NOW THAT'S AMAZING!

291
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,357
BEATING THE BURNING DEAD IS
STILL A PRETTY BIG CHALLENGE

292
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,694
FOR THE SKILL LEVEL
IN YOUR PARTY.

293
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,295
IT'S ONE THING TO
DO IT IN THE GAME,

294
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,099
BUT MAKING THAT WORK WITH A
VETERAN PARTY IS NOT THAT EASY.

295
00:14:59,199 --> 00:14:59,933
YEAH.

296
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,167
[SHIROE] AND THE REST?

297
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,937
UH, THEY'RE ALL IN
THE TENT RIGHT NOW.

298
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,773
[SHIROE] HA. THAT'S
NOT WHAT I MEANT.

299
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,475
HOW DID THEY DO OUT THERE?

300
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,844
[MINORI] WELL, LET'S SEE.

301
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,546
TOYA GOT TO THE
FRONT OF THE PARTY

302
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,014
AND DREW THE
ENEMY'S ATTENTION,

303
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,149
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'VE
ALWAYS TOLD ME TO DO.

304
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,886
BUT THIS TIME WE SET
OUR POSITIONS IN THE
FORMATION IN ADVANCE.

305
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,488
WE ALSO MADE SURE WE
STUCK TO SMALLER CHAMBERS.

306
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,992
THAT WAY, WE COULD FIGHT THE
ENEMY PATROLS ON OUR OWN TERMS.

307
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,594
SO YOU WERE FUNNELING.

308
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,797
[MINORI] RIGHT. WE MADE SURE
WE ELIMINATED THE ENEMIES

309
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,733
WITH RANGED ATTACKS FIRST.

310
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,434
I LET SERARA HANDLE THE HEALING

311
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:37,170
SO I COULD MONITOR EVERYONE
AND WATCH THE BATTLEFIELD.

312
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,372
AND WE ALSO ELIMINATED
ONE ENEMY AT A TIME

313
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,508
INSTEAD OF LETTING
THEM HEAL UP.

314
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,877
DID THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

315
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,012
[SHIROE] YOU'RE DOING
FINE. REALLY.

316
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,181
[SHIROE, THINKING] IT'S LIKE
I CAN SEE THEM IN MY HEAD.

317
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,617
THEY'VE FINALLY MASTERED
THE BASICS I GAVE MINORI

318
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,887
AND STARTED IMPLEMENTING
TEAMWORK TO PULL
IT ALL TOGETHER.

319
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,889
IT SEEMS OBVIOUS,
BUT NOT EVERYONE DOES IT.

320
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:00,193
THERE ARE SO MANY LITTLE
THINGS YOU HAVE TO GET RIGHT
OR IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.

321
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,996
[MINORI] UM, BROTHER SHIROE?
CAN YOU STILL HEAR ME?

322
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,899
[SHIROE] OH, YEAH.
I CAN HEAR YOU FINE.

323
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,433
EVERYONE DID THEIR PART?

324
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:11,104
[MINORI] OH, YEAH. SERARA HAS
A LOT OF DIFFERENT SPELLS

325
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,506
AND THEY'RE ALL AMAZING.

326
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,708
I'M GLAD SHE'S DOING
MOST OF THE HEALING.

327
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,978
BUT ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS
ISUZU CAN DO IS CRAZY.

328
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,747
IT'S A REAL CHORE TO
REMEMBER ALL OF THEM.

329
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,015
(SHIROE LAUGHS)

330
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,884
[MINORI] UH, SHIROE?
ARE YOU LAUGHING?

331
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,754
SORRY. I'M NOT. REALLY. HONEST.

332
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,289
OUR SORCERER, RUNDELLHAUS...

333
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,692
EVERYONE'S STARTING
TO CALL HIM RUDY NOW.

334
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,627
HE'S GETTING BETTER
ALL THE TIME.

335
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,328
HE'S A BIT OF A PRETTY BOY.

336
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,430
[RUDY] HUH?!
[MINORI] BUT CAN BE SORT
OF A BONEHEAD SOMETIMES.

337
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:41,167
[SHIROE] HA HA! SO HE'S HANDSOME
BUT NOT THAT BRIGHT. GOT IT.

338
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,236
YEAH, BUT HE'S GOOD
TO HAVE AROUND,

339
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,438
EVEN IF HE'S KIND
OF FULL OF IT.

340
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,542
ANYWAY, HIS MAGIC
IS REALLY POWERFUL.

341
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:50,410
WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.

342
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,745
(SHIROE LAUGHS)

343
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,954
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] WE STILL
HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT HOW
THIS WORLD REALLY WORKS.

344
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,123
BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE.

345
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,993
I JUST NEED TO REMEMBER TO
STAY POSITIVE, LIKE MINORI.

346
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:10,296
I'LL GET THIS DONE,
ONE THING AT A TIME.

347
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,575
YOU'VE INCONVENIENCED ME,
MASTER KRUSTY.

348
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,343
I HAVE?

349
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,712
YOU'VE ASSUMED YOU COULD
JUST CALL ME OUT HERE.

350
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,082
A REAL INVITATION FROM
A GENTLEMAN REQUIRES GRACE.

351
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,184
NOT JUST "HEY, LADY,
COME AND SEE ME."

352
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,754
[KRUSTY] HONESTLY,
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THIS.

353
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:34,988
[RAYNESHIA] HUH?

354
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,489
YOU ALWAYS STRUCK
ME AS A PERSON

355
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,893
WITH A CERTAIN DISDAIN
FOR FORMALITY.

356
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,461
LIKE OUR NAP
THE OTHER DAY.

357
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:42,395
[RAYNESHIA] UH...

358
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,031
LOOKS LIKE I WAS
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

359
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:48,001
MAY I INVITE YOU
AGAIN TOMORROW?

360
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,770
[RAYNESHIA] AS YOU LIKE.

361
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,771
[KRUSTY] HUH?

362
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,673
I SAID "AS YOU LIKE."

363
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,180
OH, MAN, THIS IS
SO MUCH BETTER.

364
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,682
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA
TAKE FOREVER TO WASH

365
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,349
ALL OF THAT DUNGEON STINK OFF.

366
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,019
IT GETS A LITTLE DIRTY
IN THERE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

367
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,353
I GUESS OUR PARTY
MANAGED TO HAVE

368
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,189
A PRETTY GOOD SHOWING
TODAY, DIDN'T WE?

369
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,924
YEAH. I KINDA
GOT A LITTLE WORRIED

370
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:14,160
THERE FOR A WHILE WHEN MORE OF
THE BURNING DEAD SHOWED UP.

371
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,196
BUT IT TURNED OUT
OK IN THE END.

372
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,398
YOU AND RUDY WORKED
REALLY WELL TOGETHER.

373
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:22,235
SO, I GUESS I SHOULD BE
HAPPY ABOUT THAT, SHOULDN'T I?

374
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,805
OH, I'D SAY YOU SHOULD BE
MORE THAN HAPPY WITH IT.

375
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:27,741
[MINORI] DIDN'T YOU SAY
RUDY SEEMS LIKE SOME
KIND OF A PRINCE,

376
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,109
OR WERE YOU JOKING?

377
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,745
[ISUZU] WELL, YEAH, BUT
DON'T YOU THINK SO, TOO?

378
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,279
I MEAN, KINDA, RIGHT?

379
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,181
LIKE, IF YOU DIDN'T
ALREADY KNOW HIM,

380
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,983
AND YOU RAN INTO HIM
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

381
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,785
WOULDN'T YOU THINK HE'S CUTE?

382
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:39,820
I MEAN...

383
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,454
SO YOU THINK
HE'S CUTE.

384
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,524
NO! NO WAY!

385
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,726
[ISUZU] WELL,
MAYBE A LITTLE.

386
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:48,361
(ISUZU PLAYING LUTE)

387
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,269
COME ON. IT WASN'T WORTH
ANY APPLAUSE, WAS IT?

388
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,871
NO, IT WAS WONDERFUL.

389
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:02,408
YOUR PLAYING WENT SO FAR AS TO
BECOME ONE WITH THE AIR ITSELF.

390
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,677
THANK YOU.

391
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,513
[ISUZU] I WONDER IF EVERYONE'S
GETTING READY TO SLEEP.

392
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,615
[RUDY] WE'RE GETTING
UP PRETTY EARLY TOMORROW.

393
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:12,085
OUR MORNING SESSION IS
GONNA BE OUR LAST RUN
THROUGH THE DUNGEON.

394
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,386
YEAH, IT IS.

395
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,088
TRAINING SURE
WENT FAST.

396
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,322
IT'S BEEN FUN, RIGHT?

397
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,158
[RUDY] YEAH.
FOOD WASN'T BAD,

398
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,826
BUT IT COULD'VE
BEEN BETTER.

399
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:20,927
OH, REALLY?

400
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,629

ENJOYED IT...

00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,097

402
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,666
WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY HAVE?

403
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:30,370
EITHER A HOT SANDWICH,
OR A HOT SANDWICH...
OR A SANDWICH...

404
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,939
AND THEN I BET
ANOTHER HOT SANDWICH?

HECK DID YOU‐

00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,714
YOU LIKE CAVIAR

THEY'RE AWESOME!

410

I LOVE HOW THEY POP

YOU DOING OK?

(ISUZU GIGGLES)

424
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,077
[RUDY] IS IT BECAUSE

YEAH, THAT JUST MIGHT BE IT.

00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,884
BUT YOU KNOW, I COULD SEE
YOU ANY TIME IF I WANTED TO

IF YOU WERE IN A GUILD.

SO THAT'S IT. JUST HAVE
ME HOOK UP WITH A GUILD?

430

IT WOULD DEFINITELY
BE A HEINOUS CRIME

431

TO CONFINE A TALENT
SUCH AS MINE
