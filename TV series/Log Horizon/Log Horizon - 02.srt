00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:14,280
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
SUPPOSEDLY A MAN DIED
WHILE FIGHTING MONSTERS,

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,684
AND JUST LIKE IN THE GAME,
HE REVIVED IN THE CATHEDRAL.

4
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,788
[PEPIN] I'M ALIVE! I‐I TOTALLY
JUST CAME BACK TO LIFE!

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,289
[MAN 1] SERIOUSLY?

6
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,158
[MAN 2] WAIT, SO
DOESN'T THAT MEAN...

7
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,360
[PEPIN] I DIED,
AND I CAME BACK!

[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE MMORPG "ELDER TALES."

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,701
WITHOUT WARNING, AN ESTIMATED
30,000 JAPANESE PLAYERS,

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,837
AND SEVERAL HUNDRED
THOUSAND WORLDWIDE,

11
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:41,141
WERE TRAPPED IN A WORLD
THAT LOOKED JUST LIKE
THE ONE IN THAT GAME.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:46,046
AND IN THIS WORLD,
DEATH IS NOT THE END.

HUH!

17
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,620
[NAOTSUGU]
AND WE'RE DONE
WITH THAT.

18
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,723
[SHIROE] ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S CALL IT QUITS FOR TODAY.

19
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,592
YES, MY LORD.

20
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,426
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE GOOD NEWS SEEMS TO BE

21
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,330
THAT OUR BODIES
ALREADY KNOW ALL THE
BASIC COMBAT MOVES...

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,968
AS IN WE DON'T
HAVE TO USE THE
GAME MENU TO FIGHT.

23
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,136
AS LONG AS WE HAVE
THE INTENT TO FIGHT

24
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,772
AND CAN SEE THE ENEMY
IN FRONT OF US,

25
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,509
WE CAN USE SKILLS
AND MAGIC AS IF WE
WERE USING VOICE INPUT.

26
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,111
HOWEVER, USING THE
SYSTEM AND MASTERING IT

27
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,446
ARE TWO DIFFERENT
THINGS ENTIRELY.

28
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:04,117
AND WE COULD USE
A LITTLE PRACTICE.

29
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,986
HOWEVER, I DON'T KNOW
IF PRACTICING THE WAY

30
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,690
MARTIAL ARTISTS DO IN OUR
WORLD WILL BE ENOUGH.

31
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,258
[AKATSUKI] LORD SHIROE?

32
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,894
[SHIROE] MISS AKATSUKI,
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO

33
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,195
KEEP ON CALLING
ME THAT, OK?

34
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,863
"SHIROE" IS FINE.

35
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,833
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULD STOP REFERRING
TO ME AS "MISS."

36
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,334
[SHIROE] BUT...

37
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,070
THAT'S QUITE THE GAGGLE OF
LADIES YOU'RE BUILDING THERE.

38
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,507
DO ME A FAVOR AND SHUT
YOUR BIG DUMB FACE!

39
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:33,647
MY LORD.

40
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,716
[SHIROE] UH, YEAH?
[NAOTSUGU] HEH.

41
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,652
[AKATSUKI] I'D LIKE TO DO
SOME ADVANCE RECONNAISSANCE
ON THE WAY HOME, OK?

42
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,522
[SHIROE] AND WHY IS THAT?
[AKATSUKI] FOR PRACTICE.

43
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,224
ONE OF MY SKILLS AS AN
ASSASSIN IS DARK VISION.

44
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,360
I ALSO HAVE SNEAK AND
SILENT MOVE IN MY INVENTORY,

45
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,063
AND THE FOREST IS A
PERFECT PLACE TO PRACTICE.

46
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,264
[AKATSUKI]
I SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE.

47
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,766
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

48
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,168
[SHIROE] OK, LET'S MEET
UP AT THE SOUTH GATE.

49
00:03:55,268 --> 00:04:00,173
I WILL ILLUMINATE THE PATH
WITH MAGIC LIGHT SO YOU
CAN SEE US ALONG THE WAY.

50
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,008
[AKATSUKI]
UNDERSTOOD.

51
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,679
[NAOTSUGU] SO AKATSUKI
HAS A SUBCLASS OF TRACKER
ON TOP OF BEING A NINJA?

52
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,248
[SHIROE] I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR
ANY LEAVES MOVING AROUND.

53
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,216
THAT GIRL IS PRETTY GOOD.

54
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,252
MAGIC LIGHT.

55
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:16,222
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE SKILLS AKATSUKI MENTIONED,
SNEAK AND SILENT MOVE,

56
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,191
ARE TRACKER SKILLS.

57
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,393
TRACKER IS ONE
OF THE SUBCLASSES.

58
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,563
"ELDER TALES" HAS A
BUNCH OF SUBCLASSES

59
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,531
FOR AN ADVENTURER
TO CHOOSE FROM,

60
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:29,202
AFTER HE OR SHE HAS CHOSEN ONE
OF THE 12 MAIN COMBAT CLASSES.

61
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,706
MASTERING YOUR PRIMARY
AND SUBCLASS IS VITAL.

62
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,308
[NAOTSUGU] SO I GUESS ASSASSIN
AND TRACKER EQUALS NINJA.

63
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,277
REMIND ME NOT TO
PISS HER OFF.

64
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,345
[SHIROE] YOU ALREADY HAVE.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

65
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:44,150
YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW LONG
WE'VE BEEN HERE.

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,854
[MARIELLE] PUBLIC ORDER
IN THE CITIES IS GOING
TO THE POOPER.

67
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,489
[SHIROE] YES.

68
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,992
IT LOOKS LIKE THE
RECRUITMENT RACE BETWEEN
THE GUILDS IS OVER,

69
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,494
SO WE CAN SAY ALL
THE LOCAL POWER
BASES ARE SET.

70
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,296
WE'LL SEE WHO
STARTS DOMINATING.

71
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,133
ADVENTURERS IN THE LARGER
GUILDS ARE SURE THROWING
THEIR WEIGHT AROUND.

72
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,270
AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE IN THE
SMALLER GUILDS ARE TRYING
TO STAY OUT OF SIGHT.

73
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,642
RIGHT. PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO
ACT LIKE YOU'RE AN ENEMY IF
YOU'RE NOT IN THEIR GUILD.

74
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:12,078
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T JUST
GO FIGHTING IN THE STREET,
NOW, CAN YOU?

75
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,048
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
FIGHTING WASN'T ALLOWED
IN THE MAJORITY OF TOWNS

76
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,651
WHEN ELDER TALES
WAS A GAME.

77
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,120
IF YOU TRIED TO
FIGHT IN A TOWN,

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,890
SPECIAL GUARDS CALLED THE
ROYAL GUARD WOULD APPEAR,

79
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,759
AND THAT WAS IT.

80
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,762
YOU RESISTED THE ROYAL GUARD,
YOU GOT SQUASHED AND REVIVED
IN THE CATHEDRAL.

81
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:32,265
[HIEN] AND THERE ARE STILL
WAYS TO HARASS SOMEONE
AND GET PHYSICAL WITH THEM

82
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,200
WITHOUT THE GUARD
SHOWING UP.

83
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,071
[EISEL] ON TOP OF THAT, PKs
HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE OVER
THE PAST FEW DAYS, TOO.

84
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,540
WHAT'S A PK?

85
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,876
PLAYER KILLINGS, OR AS SOME
PEOPLE SAY, PLAYER KILLER.

86
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,478
[HENRIETTA] THEY ATTACK
PLAYERS RATHER THAN MONSTERS,

87
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,414
THEN STEAL THE ITEMS AND MONEY
THEY DROP AFTER THEY DIE.

88
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,017
IT'S ABOUT THE WORST
THING YOU COULD DO.

89
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,121
[HIEN] MINIMAPS THAT TELL YOU
WHAT ELSE IS AROUND YOU
DON'T WORK OUTSIDE OF TOWN,

90
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,823
AND THERE'S NO ADMIN HERE.

91
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,092
[EISEL] BASICALLY, THERE
ARE PEOPLE TREATING
THIS AS A DEATH MATCH,

92
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,795
ENRICHING THEMSELVES
AT THE EXPENSE OF ANYONE
WHO ISN'T AS AGGRESSIVE.

93
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:06,900
AND ANYONE WHO'S ALREADY
DOING IT IS AHEAD OF THE
GAME AND THE OTHER GAMERS.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,134
BUNCH OF JERKHOLES.

95
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,437
WELL, RIGHT NOW, FORTUNE
IS FAVORING THE "JERKHOLES."

96
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,739
[MARIELLE] HUH?

97
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,407
[SHIROE] HMM? WHAT'S
WRONG, MARIELLE?

98
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,609
(MARIELLE GASPS)

99
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,943
OH, IT'S NOTHING, REALLY!

100
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,279
I MEAN, ISN'T THIS JUST
A TERRIBLE SITUATION?

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,181
[MARIELLE]DON'T YOU
AGREE, NAOTSUGU?
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, GET OFF OF ME!

102
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,550
[NAOTSUGU] COME ON! AH! AH!

103
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,052
[HENRIETTA] OH, I WAS JUST SO
TAKEN BY AKATSUKI'S CUTENESS,

104
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,222
I FORGOT TO TAKE A BREATH
AND THINK CLEARLY ABOUT IT.

105
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,591
REALLY, I DID!

106
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,426
NYAH‐NYAH‐NYAH‐NYAH!
(HENRIETTA LAUGHS)

107
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,562
[NAOTSUGU] EARTH TO SHIROE.

108
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,163
[SHIROE] I'M HERE, I'M HERE.

109
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,968
YOU KNOW, SHIROE, I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU LATELY, MAN.

110
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,504
YEAH?

111
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,672
AND YOU NEED
TO LIGHTEN UP...

112
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,575
[NAOTSUGU] DUDE.
[SHIROE] YEAH, WHATEVER.

113
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,043
[NAOTSUGU]
HEY, SHORT STUFF!

114
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,978
[AKATSUKI] DON'T CALL
ME THAT, YOU BUTTFACE!

115
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,080
[NAOTSUGU] WERE THERE
ANY GOBLINS IN THERE?

116
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,882
[AKATSUKI] THERE WAS ONE
WITH A SKULL ON ITS HEAD.

117
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,151
WEIRD AND SILLY...
MY KIND OF GOBLIN.

118
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,021
[NAOTSUGU] UH, WHAT?

119
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,863
HUH?

120
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,133
[NAOTSUGU] I HEARD
SOMETHING, OR SOMEONE.

121
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,135
WE'VE GOT COMPANY.

122
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,004
HUH! WHOA!

123
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,239
OHH!

124
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,741
THANKS A LOT, SHIROE.

125
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,376
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN QUICK TO
GET ME OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT.

126
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,679
SO WHAT'S THE
PLAN, MASTERMIND?

127
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,715
NAOTSUGU, TAKE UP
A TANDEM FORMATION.

128
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,418
WE'VE GOT PK'S OUT THERE,
AND I'VE GOT A VISUAL ON 4.

129
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,655
[SHIROE] GIVE ME A SEC.

130
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,289
GOT 'EM.

131
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,758
MIND BOLT!

132
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,660
[KATSUOMARU] HUH.
[SHIROE] THERE YOU GO.

133
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,764
OK, CREEPS, YOU GOT A LOT
OF GUTS TURNING INTO PKs.

134
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,132
HUH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET OUT
OF YOUR MOTHER'S BASEMENT

135
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,334
AND HAVE HER TEACH
YOU SOME MANNERS!

136
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,304
[SHIROE, THINKING] AT LEAST ONE
FIGHTER CLASS, TWO THIEVES,

137
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,673
ONE DRESSED LIKE A HEALER.

138
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,608
SO YOU CAN HAND OVER
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE

139
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,277
AND WE WON'T SEND YOUR SORRY
ASSES TO THE CATHEDRAL.

140
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,747
[SHIROE] FROM THE SOUND
OF IT, HE'S BEEN WATCHING
WAY TOO MUCH ANIME.

141
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,483
[SHIROE, THINKING]
HOWEVER, THEY'RE
HUMAN LIKE US.

142
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,118
[SHIROE]
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

143
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,687
KICK THEIR ASS!

144
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,155
I'M NOT BACKING
DOWN FROM FREAKS WHO
ATTACK PEOPLE FOR FUN!

145
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,758
[NAOTSUGU] YOU WANT TO TRY
THAT PK CRAP ON US,

YOU SON OF A...

171
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,787

A GUARDIAN BELONGS TO A

ALLIES BY INTERCEPTING ATTACKS.

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,867
THEY'RE BORED,
THERE AREN'T ANY JOBS
HERE REALLY, SO, YEAH.

293
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,871
[NAOTSUGU] OK, SO THEY
WANT TO GET THEIR ROCKS
OFF BY HURTING OTHER PEOPLE?

294
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,272
THAT'S STUPID.

295
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,441
[SHIROE] PRETTY LAME,
AND DEFINITELY MESSED UP.

296
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,410
SICK, REALLY.

297
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,781
[SHIROE, THINKING]
THING IS, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M DOING ANYTHING EITHER.

298
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,749
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD?
[SHIROE] HUH?

299
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:46,653
UH, ANYWAY, I'M NOT
REALLY SURE IF THINGS
ARE GETTING WORSE, SO FAR.

300
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,188
HMM.

301
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,190
[SHIROE] IT JUST SEEMS THAT WAY,
AND IT PROBABLY HAS TO DO

302
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,959
WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE STILL
THINK THAT THIS IS A GAME WORLD

303
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,295
WITHOUT ANY REAL
PENALTIES TO SPEAK OF.

304
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,099
IF THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD,
THEN MAYBE OUR SENSE
OF PUBLIC ORDER

305
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,267
IS REALLY AN ILLUSION.

306
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,537
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD...

307
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:04,838
(RINGING)

308
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:05,772
UH... YES?

309
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,173
[AKATSUKI] HUH?

310
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,075
[SHIROE] HUH?

311
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,877
[NAOTSUGU] YOU'RE
GOING TO SUSUKINO?

312
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,879
[HENRIETTA] ON THE DAY
OF THE APOCALYPSE,

313
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,048
ONE OF OUR MEMBERS
WAS GOING TO SUSUKINO.

314
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,350
[MARIELLE] SHE'S A YOUNGER
GIRL NAMED SERARA.

315
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,185
[SHIROE] YOU'RE
GOING TO FIND HER?

316
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,655
[NAOTSUGU] AREN'T THE INTERCITY
TRANSPORT GATES STILL DOWN?

317
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,759
FAIRY RINGS ARE THE ONLY
OTHER WAY TO GET THERE
IF YOU HAVE THEM.

318
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,027
[NAOTSUGU]
NOT ME.

319
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,929
RIGHT, BUT WITHOUT
THE ONLINE HELP

320
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,164
OR SOMEONE WHO'S MEMORIZED
THE TIMETABLES,

321
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,967
YOU COULD END UP
TRANSPORTED INTO THE
MIDDLE OF WHO KNOWS WHERE

322
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,936
WITH THOSE FAIRY RINGS.

323
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:39,172
OK, WHY NOT TRY THE RETURN
SPELL "CALL TO HOME"?

324
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,908
DOESN'T LET YOU
RETURN TO THE LAST
5 GREAT CITIES...

325
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:42,776
OH, CRAP.

326
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:44,177
[HENRIETTA] MM‐HMM.

327
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,346
AND THE LAST GREAT CITY
SHE VISITED WAS SUSUKINO.

328
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,414
[NAOTSUGU] LIKE I
SAID, OH, CRAP.

329
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,451
[SHIROE] SO THAT LEAVES
WALKING AND HORSEBACK.

330
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:54,120
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
IN THE REAL WORLD,
THERE ARE 850 KILOMETERS

331
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,524
BETWEEN TOKYO AND SAPPORO.

332
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:02,829
THE "ELDER TALES" WORLD
IS HALF‐SCALE, SO IT
WOULD BE 425 KILOMETERS.

333
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:07,067
AND NATURALLY, THEY'RE
GOING TO RUN INTO PACKS
OF MONSTERS OUT THERE.

334
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,604
[SHIROE] SO WHY ARE YOU
SENDING HELP NOW?

335
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,372
HUH? OH, UM...

336
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,676
[HENRIETTA] WE'VE BEEN
PLANNING TO SEND A RESCUE
TEAM FOR A WHILE NOW.

00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:16,977

338
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,212
AH, DON'T LOOK
AT ME THAT WAY!

339
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,014
YOUR EYES ARE LIKE DAGGERS,

340
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,618
AND YOU KNOW A GIRL
DOESN'T LIKE A GUY WHO
STARES AT HER LIKE THAT!

341
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,087
(MARIELLE COWERS)

(MARIELLE SIGHS)

343
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,256
HERE'S THE THING:

344
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,893
THE PUBLIC SAFETY
ISSUE'S A LOT WORSE
IN SUSUKINO THAN HERE.

345
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,327
[HENRIETTA]
MARIELLE...

346
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,396
[MARIELLE] SOME NASTY...
AND I MEAN REALLY NASTY

347
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,033
PEOPLE ATTACKED
ONE OF OUR FRIENDS.

348
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:45,271
LUCKILY, SOMEBODY JUMPED
IN AND SAVED HER.

349
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,407
[HENRIETTA] AND NOW
HE'S PROTECTING HER.

350
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,175
[MARIELLE] ANYWAY, WE'RE
GETTING READY TO TAKE

351
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,679
OUR MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE
TO SUSUKINO TO BRING HER BACK.

352
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,982
SO I THOUGHT... I WAS
THINKING THAT MAYBE...

353
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,018
COULD YOU WATCH OVER
THE REST OF OUR GUILD?

354
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,452
[HENRIETTA] CAN YOU
DO THIS FOR US?

355
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:02,322
[MARIELLE]
WE'RE TOTALLY
BEGGING YOU.

356
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,728
[SHIROE, THINKING] I DOUBT
THEY CAN GET TO SUSUKINO
ANY FASTER THAN 21 DAYS...

357
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,964
MORE THAN A MONTH, PROBABLY,
TWO FOR THE ROUND TRIP.

358
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:15,669
EVEN IF THEY TAKE THE
CRESCENT MOON'S MOST
POWERFUL PLAYERS, IT'S DICEY.

359
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:20,707
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
THE GAME ONLY ALLOWS
A MAXIMUM PARTY SIZE OF 6,

360
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:24,711
AND EVEN THE BEST 6 DON'T HAVE
A GOOD HEALER AMONG THEM.

361
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:28,882
NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
THEIR PARTY STILL WON'T MAKE IT.

362
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,117
SO WHAT DO THEY DO?

363
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,655
WE'RE STRONG ENOUGH.
WE SHOULD GO.

364
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,157
WE SHOULD, BUT WE ALSO
SHOULDN'T STICK OUR NOSE

365
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:41,928
IN SOME GUILD'S BUSINESS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

366
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:46,132
THEY WOULDN'T WANT THAT,
AND I WOULDN'T BLAME THEM.

367
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,935
SHOULDN'T I AT LEAST...

368
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,971
SHOULDN'T I...

(THUD)
[SHIROE] HUH?

370
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,842
SAY IT, SHIROE.

... BRING HER BACK TO US.

THROUGH. WE DON'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF FAILURE.

381
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:34,014

THAT I ALREADY KNOW
HOW TO RIDE A HORSE,

BE SCRIBE WHEN I SIGNED UP.
