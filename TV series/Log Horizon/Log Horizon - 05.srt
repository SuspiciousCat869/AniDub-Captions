1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:09,075
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] NON‐PLAYER
CHARACTERS ARE PEOPLE IN THE
GAME THAT AREN'T PLAYERS.

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,144
THEIR DIALOGUE IS SET
BY THE PROGRAMMERS,

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,747
AND THEY DON'T HAVE
DISTINCT PERSONALITIES.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:18,418
THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THERE TO
FULFILL ROLES AT CERTAIN
POINTS IN THE GAME.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,689
IN "ELDER TALES," PLAYERS
ARE CALLED ADVENTURERS,

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,160
AND NON‐PLAYERS ARE CALLED
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,733
HOWEVER, THE APOCALYPSE
MAY HAVE CHANGED THAT.

8
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,696
[MARIELLE] SERARA?

9
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,364
YOU'RE OK, RIGHT?

10
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,268
I‐I'M, LIKE, SO GLAD
YOU MADE IT BACK
FROM SUSUKINO, SWEETIE!

11
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,672
[SERARA] YES. I'M SORRY
I WORRIED YOU.

12
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,006
GOOD‐BYE.

13
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,744
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I'M REALLY SAFE NOW, RIGHT?

14
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,580
[SHIROE] YEAH. WE'RE PAST
THE LYPORT CHANNEL NOW.

15
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,282
[NYAN‐TA] AND BRIGANDIA
DOESN'T HAVE ANY GRIFFINS.

16
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,018
THEY'RE WEEKS BEHIND US,
SO DON'T EVEN WORRY.

17
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,787
IT'S ALL GOOD.

18
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,557
UH...

19
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,893
[SERARA] NOW THAT I'M SAFE,
I JUST FEEL KIND OF...

20
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,929
THANK YOU, EVERYONE!

21
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,231
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

22
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,733
(STOMACH GROWLS)
UH!

23
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,504
UH‐OH. LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY'S TUM‐TUM
ISN'T TOO HAPPY.

24
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,173
[AKATSUKI] DO YOU
EVER SHUT UP?!

25
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,975
[NAOTSUGU]
HEY, I FART, TOO.

26
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,410
(LAUGHTER)

27
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,418
[NAOTSUGU] OH, MAN.

28
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,353
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
PITCHED A TENT BEFORE.

29
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,890
[SHIROE]
WELL, START BY LAYING
OUT THE GROUND SHEETS.

30
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,594
UH, I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU SAYING YOU EVER
ROUGHED IT BACK HOME.

31
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,663
THAT'S TRUE, BUT I READ
A BOOK ABOUT IT ONCE.

32
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,132
OF COURSE, I'M BETTING
IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE

33
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,568
THIS EASY FOR ME
IN THE REAL WORLD.

34
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,805
YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S
TRUE ABOUT A LOT OF
THINGS AROUND HERE.

35
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,573
[NAOTSUGU]
IT'S PRETTY CRAZY.

36
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,474
(RUSTLING)

37
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,710
(GASPS)

38
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,778
[SERARA]
WILD DEER?

39
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,381
SO THERE ARE ANIMALS IN THIS
GAME THAT AREN'T MONSTERS.

40
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,583
[NYAN‐TA]
WELL, NOW.

41
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,785
THIS IS WHAT I CALL
A TIME TO SHINE.

42
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,920
(DING)

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,387
[SERARA] AH!

44
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,924
[NAOTSUGU]
THERE WE GO.

45
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,926
WE'VE GOT A
PLACE TO SLEEP.

46
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:50,030
[SHIROE] IT'S KIND OF
SATISFYING, COMPARED TO JUST
HAVING TO LOG OUT AND GO TO BED.

47
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,167
[NAOTSUGU] SINCE WE'RE OUT IN
THE BUSH, WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
FUN DOING IT THE HARD WAY.

48
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,969
[SHIROE]
THAT'S RIGHT.

49
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,706
[SHIROE] BUT OUR FOOD
ISN'T EXACTLY...

50
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,675
[NAOTSUGU] IT LOOKS
SO GOOD, SHIROE,

51
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:05,378
BUT IT STILL TASTES LIKE
ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!

52
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,881
[AKATSUKI] SERARA AND
NYAN‐TA ARE RUNNING LATE.

53
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,115
(NAOTSUGU SNIFFS)

54
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,551
DO YOU SMELL THAT?!

55
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,252
[SHIROE]
WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU?

56
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,820
(NAOTSUGU AND AKATSUKI SNIFF)

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,855
WHAT?

58
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,791
IT SMELLS LIKE
MEAT ROASTING.

59
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,493
(SIZZLING)

60
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,164
[NYAN‐TA] HMM, DID THE SMELL
OF THIS FINE CUISINE ROUSE YOU
FROM YOUR BASE CAMP?

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,165
[SERARA] HEY!

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,833
[NAOTSUGU] TELL YOU WHAT,

63
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,970
I'M WILLING TO GIVE
TASTELESS MEAT A TRY
IF IT SMELLS THIS GOOD.

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,074
(TRIUMPHANT BELLS)

65
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,342
YEAH!

66
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,545
(MOUTH FULL)
THIS IS...
I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT!

67
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,047
[SHIROE] (MOUTH FULL)
THE TEXTURE WHEN
YOU BITE INTO IT...

68
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,482
THE DELICIOUS JUICES!

69
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,318
[NAOTSUGU] THE SWEETNESS
OF THE FAT... AWESOME!

70
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,453
(MOUTH FULL)
JUST THE RIGHT
AMOUNT OF SALT,

71
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,356
AND HE OBVIOUSLY USED
ROSEMARY IN IT, TOO!

72
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,859
IT'S, WITHOUT A DOUBT...

73
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,028
[ALL] REAL FREAKING FOOD!

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,396
[NYAN‐TA] OH, YEAH.

75
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,932
AWESOME! I LOVE YOU!
MORE, PLEASE!

76
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,300
[NYAN‐TA] NOW, NOW.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,235
[SHIROE, AKATSUKI, AND NAOTSUGU]
PLEASE, PLEASE!

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,504
[NYAN‐TA]
PLENTY TO GO AROUND.

79
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,072
SO, HOW THE HECK
DID YOU DO IT ANYWAY?

80
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,373
(SERARA GIGGLES)

81
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,442
WELL, AS YOU KNOW,

82
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,178
YOU CAN PICK THE ITEM YOU
WANT FROM OFF THE MENU.

83
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,614
YOU DIG?

84
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,248
AND IT WILL MAKE
YOU FOOD ITEMS

85
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,518
THAT LOOK JUST LIKE
THE REAL THING.

86
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,353
[SHIROE]
RIGHT. THAT'S JUST
LIKE THE GAME.

87
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,255
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, BUT
YOUR FOOD HAS FLAVOR.

88
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,926
[NYAN‐TA] AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY YOU NEED TO STOP THINKING
OF THIS AS A GAME.

89
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,696
AFTER ALL, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
STILL HAVE THEIR FLAVOR, RIGHT?

90
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,132
[NAOTSUGU] HUH.
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

91
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,433
WELL, THEN.

92
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,336
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
THE SAME THING I DID:

93
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,672
JUST DON'T USE
THE INTERFACE.

94
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,607
FORGET ABOUT TAPPING
YOUR FINGERS IN THE AIR

95
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,577
AND USE YOUR OWN HANDS
TO COOK YOUR DINNER.

96
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,679
IT'S THAT EASY, BABY.

97
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,715
I KNOW. I TRIED TO
DO THAT, TOO, CHIEF.

98
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,283
CHECK IT OUT.

99
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,118
[NAOTSUGU]
BLAM‐O!

100
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,687
PURPLE PUKE STICK!

101
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,989
[SHIROE] BOILING IT TURNS IT
INTO A WEIRD PASTE OF SOME KIND.

102
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,059
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO,
IT ALL TURNS OUT LIKE THIS.

103
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,929
I MEAN, WE JUST FIGURED
THAT THIS WAS THE WAY
IT WAS GONNA BE HERE.

104
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,099
[NYAN‐TA] WELL, IT SOUNDS TO ME
AS IF THE PERSON WHO WAS
PREPARING YOUR FOOD

105
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,171
DIDN'T HAVE A SUBCLASS OF CHEF
OR OTHER SIMILAR COOKING SKILL.

106
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,539
[NAOTSUGU]
OK. SO YOU'RE...

107
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,974
THAT'S RIGHT, HOLMES.

108
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,578
I HAVE MASTERED THE GENTLEMANLY
ART OF BEING A CHEF.

109
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,513
[NAOTSUGU] WHOA.
[SHIROE] MAKES SENSE.

110
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,447
SO SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE
THE SKILL AHEAD OF TIME

111
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,817
TO MAKE A DECENT
MEAL FOR HIMSELF.

112
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,586
[SHIROE, THINKING]
HE'S GOT A POINT.

113
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,088
I'M REALLY STILL STUCK
IN THAT GAMER MENTALITY,

114
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,890
WHICH MEANS...

115
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,925
(NAOTSUGU CHEWS LOUDLY)

116
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,460
[AKATSUKI] MASTER NYAN‐TA?
[NAOTSUGU] "MASTER"? REALLY?

117
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,097
[AKATSUKI] ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE MYSELF PROPERLY.

118
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,364
MY NAME IS AKATSUKI.

119
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,701
MY CLASS IS ASSASSIN,
AND I'M AT LEVEL 90.

120
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,804
[NYAN‐TA] AND YOU DID SOME FINE
WORK BACK THERE, YOUNG LADY.

121
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,173
[AKATSUKI] IT WAS NOTHING.
THE WAY YOU FOUGHT
WAS MASTERFUL.

122
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,677
[NAOTSUGU]
WELL, HOLD UP. I HAD A
PRETTY GOOD FIGHT MYSELF.

123
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,679
YOU ARE A
WORTHLESS TURD.

124
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,147
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

125
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,750
[AKATSUKI] WHATEVER, TURD.
[NAOTSUGU] YOU'RE A TURD.

126
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,719
(SHIROE AND NYAN‐TA CHUCKLE)

127
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,254
[NYAN‐TA] I SEE YOU HAVE
SOME GOOD COMPANIONS...

128
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,989
YOU, TOO,
LITTLE ONE.

129
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,257
HUH! RIGHT!

130
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,893
I GUESS I SHOULD INTRODUCE
MYSELF PROPERLY.

131
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,763
I'M SERARA WITH THE CRESCENT
MOON ALLIANCE GUILD.

132
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,099
I'M A LEVEL 19 DRUID,
AND MY SUBCLASS IS MAID,

133
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,401
AND I... AND I GUESS THAT'S ALL.

134
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,638
BUT, UH, I...

135
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,873
[SERARA]
I'M SORRY FOR THE
TROUBLE I CAUSED WITH

136
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,609
MY POOR HEALING SKILLS
BACK IN SUSUKINO.

137
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,410
[NAOTSUGU] DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, OK?

138
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,646
[SHIROE] HMM.

139
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,614
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR KIND WORDS,

140
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,716
AND THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP, SHIROE.

141
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,051
HUH?

142
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,287
[SERARA] IT REALLY
MEANS SO MUCH TO ME,
I CAN'T TELL YOU!

143
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,956
[SHIROE] UH, NO.

144
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,792
I REALLY DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING THAT WAS ALL
THAT SPECIAL, ALL RIGHT?

145
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,226
HUH?

146
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,463
MY BOY'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE KIND OF FELLA WHO'S
EASY TO EMBARRASS.

147
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,231
I BET I KNOW
ALL ABOUT YOU.

148
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,034
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD
YOU'RE THE THIRD‐CUTEST
IN YOUR CLASS,

149
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,138
AND YOU PROBABLY GOT
MORE SECRET LOVE LETTERS
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

150
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,574
[SERARA]
UH, YEAH.

151
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,842
(NAOTSUGU WAILS)

152
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,545
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD, I HAVE JUST GIVEN
NAOTSUGU A BLOODY NOSE.

153
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,048
[NAOTSUGU] I HAVE HAD JUST ABOUT
ENOUGH OF YOU AND YOUR LITTLE,
PAINFUL PROGRESS REPORTS!

154
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,317
[AKATSUKI]
I'VE ALSO DECIDED
TO EAT HIS DINNER.

155
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,786
AAH!

156
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,588
(CRACKLING)

157
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,055
(NAOTSUGU GROANS)

158
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,290
I CAN'T MOVE!

159
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,992
[AKATSUKI] YOU ATE
TOO MUCH, YOU DUMMY.

160
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,261
[SERARA]
NYAN‐TA, I GUESS YOU AND
MR. SHIROE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER

161
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,863
FOR A REALLY
LONG TIME, HUH?

162
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,832
[NYAN‐TA] DON'T FORGET
ABOUT NAOTSUGUCCHI.

163
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,767
BACK WHEN WE WERE
PLAYING THIS AS A GAME,

164
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,470
WE ALL JUST HAPPENED TO BE
IN THE SAME LOOSE‐KNIT
GROUP OF PLAYERS.

165
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,673
YOU MIGHT'VE EVEN
HEARD OF US...

166
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,875
WE WERE THE DEBAUCHERY
TEA PARTY.

167
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,677
THAT'S RIGHT.

168
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,715
I'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT A
LEGENDARY GROUP THAT COMPLETED
A LOT OF DIFFICULT QUESTS

169
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,551
WHEN THE ADMINS ADDED
THEM TO THE GAME.

170
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,620
[AKATSUKI] THAT WAS MY LORD
AND MASTER NYAN‐TA?

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,722
HEY, DON'T FORGET
ABOUT ME!

172
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:45,692
[SERARA] WOW. SO THAT MEANS
ALL OF YOU WERE IN THE SAME
GUILD TOGETHER ONCE.

173
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,095
[NAOTSUGU]
NAH, IT WASN'T A GUILD...
MORE LIKE A HANGOUT.

174
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,697
[SERARA] OH.

175
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,600
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
US WAS IN A DIFFERENT
GUILD AT THE TIME.

176
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,802
AND WE WEREN'T
ALL THAT ORGANIZED,

177
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,705
BUT WE DID HAVE
SOME GOOD ADVENTURES
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

178
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,674
[NYAN‐TA] I SUPPOSE THAT'S
WHAT MADE US STRONG.

179
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,809
[NAOTSUGU] HMM.

180
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,178
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

181
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,516
I GUESS I DON'T HAVE TO ASK
WHY MY LORD AND HIS FRIENDS
CAN SUMMON GRIFFINS.

182
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,151
THAT'S A HIGH‐LEVEL QUEST,

183
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,721
AND THAT'S HOW THEY WORK
SO WELL TOGETHER.

184
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,923
(AKATSUKI WINCES)

185
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:21,862
I FOUGHT BY MY LORD'S SIDE ON
SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS NOW.

186
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,999
I'M NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WORKING
IN TANDEM WITH HIM LIKE THAT.

187
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,035
I HAVE TO PRACTICE MORE.

188
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,672
[SHIROE] AKATSUKI?
[NAOTSUGU] TUMMY ACHE?

189
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,273
[AKATSUKI] SHUT. UP.

190
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,409
NOW, THEN, IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU JUST LIED TO ME.

191
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,011
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?

192
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,713
THERE'S NO WAY THE
DEBAUCHERY TEA PARTY

193
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,482
COULD'VE HAD SOMEONE
LIKE NAOTSUGU IN IT.

194
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,284
I WAS THERE!

195
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,686
(CRACKLING)

196
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,220
[NYAN‐TA] WHEN ALL
WAS SAID AND DONE,

197
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,855
WE'D GONE ON QUITE
A FEW QUESTS

198
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,824
AND SEEN QUITE A
FEW PLACES, HMM?

199
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,259
[NAOTSUGU]
MADE FRIENDS,
DID QUESTS...

200
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,228
IT WAS A
BLAST, DUDE.

201
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,731
RIGHT.

202
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,068
(GRIFFINS SCREECH)

203
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,744
[NYAN‐TA] MMM.

204
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,446
[SERARA, THINKING]
NYAN‐TA IS SO AWESOME!

205
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:17,651
HE'S HANDSOME, YOUNG, KIND,
AND ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP.

206
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,553
NO, I THINK HE'S OLDER.

207
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:23,089
A HANDSOME MIDDLE‐AGED
MAN? BUT HE'S SO IN SHAPE.

208
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,792
SERIOUSLY, I WONDER
HOW HE DOES IT.

209
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,828
NEXT TO HIM, I LOOK KIND OF FAT.

210
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,230
OK, MAYBE I'M A
LITTLE OVERWEIGHT...

211
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,333
[SERARA] OH, NYAN‐TA,
YOU'RE JUST SO PERFECT...

212
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,968
[NAOTSUGU] SO OBVIOUS.

213
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,671
SO THE LITTLE GINGER'S
INTO OLDER CAT DUDES.

214
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,105
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

215
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,474
I GUESS NYAN‐TA'S
GOT IT GOING ON.

216
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,475
(SHIROE CHUCKLES)

217
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,644
SERARA HAS
GOOD TASTE.

218
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,145
[BOTH] HUH?!

219
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,347
[SHIROE] YOU MEAN YOU'VE GOT
A THING FOR CAT GUYS, TOO?!

220
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,183
[NYAN‐TA] MEOW?
[AKATSUKI] THE MASTER IS
A FIRST‐CLASS SWORDSMAN.

221
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,286
[SHIROE, THINKING]
OK. SWORDSMAN. HMM.

222
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,489
I WONDER IF THE CHIEF'S OK
WITH ALL THEIR GIRLIE STUFF.

223
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,991
[AKATSUKI] UM, MY LORD?

224
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,125
[SHIROE] HMM?

225
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,194
YOU MAY NOT BE ADEPT
WITH A SWORD OR ANYTHING,

226
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,597
BUT YOU DO HAVE OTHER
APPRECIABLE TALENTS.

227
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,165
UH, OH, YEAH?

228
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,500
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU HURT MY
FEELINGS OR SOMETHING, DID YOU?

229
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,069
UH... UH...

230
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,571
OF COURSE NOT.

231
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,140
[SHIROE] HMM?

232
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,177
[NAOTSUGU] WHEN YOU SEE HER
LIKE THIS, SHE REALLY DOES
LOOK KIND OF YOUNG.

233
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,179
[SHIROE] HOW OLD DO YOU
THINK SHE REALLY IS?

234
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,983
[NAOTSUGU] WHO KNOWS?
I MEAN, WE ALL LOOK LIKE
OUR GAME AVATARS HERE.

235
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,986
JUST BASED ON HER LOOKS,
I'D SAY THAT SHE WAS
IN ELEMENTARY‐

236
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,021
OHH! GOD!

237
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,323
[SHIROE]
MIDDLE SCHOOLER, MAYBE?

238
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,092
I WONDER.

239
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,695
I GUESS SHE'D BE THE
SAME AGE AS THE TWINS.

240
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,262
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT TWINS?

241
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,032
[SHIROE] I RAN INTO THEM WHEN
THIS WAS STILL JUST A GAME.

242
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:43,704
THE GIRL WAS A SHRINE MAIDEN,
AND HER TWIN BROTHER
WAS A SAMURAI.

243
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,173
[BOY] MISTER?
MISTER! HEY, STOP!

244
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,410
[GIRL] UM, CAN WE
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

245
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,245
[BOY] A QUESTION!

246
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,648
[GIRL] MY BROTHER WAS JUST
IN A REALLY BIG FIGHT

247
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,650
AND I'M TRYING TO
HEAL HIS WOUNDS,

248
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,952
BUT MY MAGIC
IS TOO WEAK.

249
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,287
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY
ALL THE MAGIC‐Y STUFF?

250
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,591
[BOY] I NEED SKILLS,
TOO, DUDE. CAN YOU TELL
US WHERE TO GET 'EM?

251
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,128
[SHIROE] SO I'M GUESSING
THIS IS YOUR FIRST
TIME TO PLAY, HUH?

252
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,832
[GIRL] YEAH.
[BOY] THAT'S RIGHT.

253
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,835
[NAOTSUGU] REALLY? HAVE YOU
ALWAYS BEEN THAT NICE?

254
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,739
[SHIROE] I USUALLY DON'T LIKE
IT WHEN PEOPLE RUN UP ON ME
FOR ADVICE LIKE THAT.

255
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,140
[NYAN‐TA] TRUE.

256
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,142
[SHIROE] IT WAS THEIR FIRST
DAY PLAYING, YOU KNOW,

257
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,678
AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE
ADVENTURING JUST FOR THE
SAKE OF ADVENTURE.

258
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,214
I EVEN TOOK SOME TIME
OFF FROM MY QUEST TO
SHOW THEM AROUND.

259
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,884
THE TEACHER SYSTEM
REALLY HELPED A LOT.

260
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,753
[AKATSUKI]
"TEACHER SYSTEM"?

261
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,156
[SHIROE] A SYSTEM THAT
ALLOWS HIGH‐LEVEL PLAYERS
TO DECREASE THEIR ABILITY

262
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,025
SO THAT THEY CAN PLAY WITH
THE LOWER‐LEVEL CHARACTERS.

263
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,529
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, BUT
HARDLY ANYONE USED IT.

264
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,897
IT WAS TOO RISKY.

265
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,266
YEAH, WELL, THAT WAS THE
IDEA BEHIND IT, THOUGH.

266
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,268
YOU COULD REENACT HOW YOU
PLAYED AT THE BEGINNING.

267
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,471
SO THE PEOPLE YOU
WERE TEACHING WOULD
EARN THEIR POWER‐UPS.

268
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:52,839
HMM.

269
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,440
YEAH, MAKES SENSE.

270
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:58,078
[NYAN‐TA] THAT'S A PRETTY
BRILLIANT DEDUCTION,
MISS AKATSUKI.

271
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,847
[NAOTSUGU]
OK, SO WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

272
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,116
[SHIROE] THEY'RE STILL
ON MY FRIENDS LIST.

273
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:07,320
THE SISTER IS MINORI, AND HER
YOUNGER BROTHER IS TOYA.

274
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,957
I SAW THEM SHORTLY AFTER
THE APOCALYPSE CAME TO PASS.

275
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,093
PRETTY ROUGH FOR
A COUPLE OF KIDS.

276
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,228
[SHIROE] BUT THEN I WOUND
UP BACK IN AKIHABARA.

277
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,463
EVERYTHING HAD
BECOME SUCH A MESS.

278
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,299
WE GOT SEPARATED
FROM EACH OTHER.

279
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,836
[AKATSUKI] I WAS ALSO TELEPORTED
INTO AN ABANDONED BUILDING.

280
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,538
(WAVES CRASHING)

281
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,107
[NAOTSUGU] MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
TRIED GETTING AHOLD OF THEM.

282
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,911
YOU KNOW, JUST TO MAKE
SURE THEY'RE SAFE...

283
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,813
[SHIROE] YEAH...

284
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,787
[NYAN‐TA] WELL, I'M SURE
HE HAD HIS REASONS.

285
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,422
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

286
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:45,258
[SHIROE] WE WERE GETTING
READY TO HEAD OUT HERE.

287
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,328
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD
THE TIME TO FIND OUT.

288
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,898
LAST TIME I SAW THEM,
THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY
JOINED A GUILD.

289
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,900
[NAOTSUGU]
IS THAT RIGHT?

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,002
[SHIROE] THEY WERE
LEVEL 8 WHEN WE LEFT,

291
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,371
BUT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE A LITTLE HIGHER NOW.

292
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,642
EVERYTHING SHOULD
BE OK IF THEY HOOKED
UP WITH A GUILD.

293
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,810
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE GOT TO KNOW.

294
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,279
[SHIROE] HMM?
[NAOTSUGU] THAT MINORI...

295
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,948
WAS SHE A HOTTIE?

296
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,449
LIKE I WOULD KNOW.

297
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,652
ALL I COULD SEE IN THE
GAME WAS HER AVATAR,

298
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:13,486
AND HER VOICE WASN'T
ANYTHING SPECIAL.

299
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:17,624
OH, COME ON. YOU COULD
TELL A LOT FROM A CHICK'S
VOICE IF YOU LISTEN.

300
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,025
[AKATSUKI]
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

301
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,894
[NAOTSUGU] EXCUSE ME,
I WAS TALKING TO SHIROE!

302
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,429
(SHIROE LAUGHS)
[AKATSUKI] SHUT UP. YOU'RE
MAKING MY TEA TASTE BAD.

303
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,233
[NAOTSUGU] LOOK, DUDES LIKE
CHICKS! IT'S SCIENCE!

304
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,943
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, SHIROE.
THE CLOUDS ARE CLOSING IN ON US.

305
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,411
[NYAN‐TA] I'M WITH
NAUTSUGUCCHI ON THIS ONE.

306
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:41,615
WE NEED TO GET ON THE GROUND
AND UNDER SOME SHELTER.

307
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,983
THIS CAT AIN'T A
FAN OF THE RAIN.

308
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,551
[NAOTSUGU] RIGHT.

309
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:49,189
IF I REMEMBER, THIS ZONE HAS
A VILLAGE JUST PAST THOSE WOODS.

310
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,657
(THUNDER)

311
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,392
(MOO)

312
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,460
[NAOTSUGU] WHERE ARE WE?

313
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,863
[AKATSUKI] THE SOUTH END
OF THE ARB HIGHLANDS.

314
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:57,798
(MOO)

315
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:58,832
SHIROECHI?

316
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,300
YES?

317
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,203
SO HAVE YOU BEEN
ALONE SINCE OUR
LAST EXPEDITION?

318
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,237
HUH?

319
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,940
WITHOUT JOINING
A GUILD, I MEAN.

320
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,374
UM, WELL, CHIEF,

321
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,977
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT
GUILD YOU WERE JOINING?

322
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,413
[SHIROE] UM, YOU KNOW,
THE CAT FOOD GUILD?

323
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,082
[SERARA] THE CAT FOOD
GUILD? WHAT'S THAT?

324
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,152
[NYAN‐TA] A PROUD ORGANIZATION
COMPRISED SOLELY OF PLAYERS

325
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,687
WHO PLAYED AS CAT PEOPLE.

326
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,324
I LOVE SITTING ON THE PORCH,
BUT THE HOUSE WAS GETTING OLD.

327
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,760
OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT, YOU KNOW?

328
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,061
HUH?

329
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,030
[CAT PEOPLE] MEOW...

330
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,665
HOW WONDERFUL!

331
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,035
[NYAN‐TA] IT WAS, RIGHT UP UNTIL
THE TIME THE WEATHER GOT TO IT

332
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,837
AND HALF THE HOUSE COLLAPSED.

333
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,338
[SHIROE]
SO IT BROKE UP?

334
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,574
(HEAVY DOWNPOUR)

335
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,210
[NAOTSUGU] HELLO?

336
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,946
[SHIROE]
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

337
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,014
COULD YOU POSSIBLY
PUT US UP FOR THE NIGHT?

338
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,618
[MAN] OH, MY. ADVENTURERS
AT MY DOORSTEP.

339
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,120
NOW, THAT'S A RARE
SIGHT, INDEED.

340
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,321
[NAOTSUGU]
HOW'S IT GOING?

341
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,457
[MAN] WELCOME TO
THE VILLAGE OF ARB.

342
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:01,161
[SHIROE, THINKING]
WAIT, IS THIS GUY REALLY AN
NPC, A PERSON OF THE LAND?

343
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:04,865
MY NAME HAPPENS TO BE FEDOR,
VILLAGE OMBUDSMAN.

344
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,166
PLEASURE'S MINE.

345
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,301
AH. IT'S VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU.

346
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,237
THAT'S COOL. YOU GOT
A NAME AND EVERYTHING.

347
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,876
[SERARA] WOW!
[FEDOR] NOW, YOU KIDS GO
AHEAD AND USE THIS BARN

348
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,811
FOR AS LONG AS
YOU LIKE, ALL RIGHT?

349
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,079
[SHIROE] THANK YOU.

350
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,080
(NAOTSUGU GASPS)

351
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,682
IT'S REALLY HAY!

352
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,984
MOVE IT. YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR STINK ON
EVERYONE'S BEDDING.

353
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,552
WHATEVER!

354
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,621
UH, COULD I TROUBLE
YOU TO SHOW ME TO
THE HEARTH, HMM?

355
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,023
[FEDOR] IT'S RIGHT
OVER THERE, FELLA.

356
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,093
[SERARA] I'M READY
TO COOK. HOW ABOUT YOU?

357
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,628
[NAOTSUGU] I'M GONNA
NEED MORE THAN THAT!

358
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,663
[AKATSUKI] THIS IS FOR MY LORD!
[NAOTSUGU] COME ON!

359
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,199
[FEDOR] YOUR FRIENDS ARE
QUITE LIVELY, AREN'T THEY?

360
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,301
[SHIROE]
YEAH. HEH.

361
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,871
[FEDOR] OH. SO YOU'RE
GOING TO AKIHABARA?

362
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,773
[SHIROE] YES.

363
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,442
[FEDOR] PEOPLE OF THE LAND
LIKE US DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT
OF TRAVELING, YOU KNOW.

364
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,778
[NAOTSUGU] IF YOU WANT
TO HEAR A STORY OR TWO,
WE'VE GOT PLENTY.

365
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:56,783
[FEDOR] YEAH? I BET
YOU GOT TALES TALLER
THAN A GRIFFIN'S EYE.

366
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,119
[SHIROE] UH...

367
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,054
DON'T JUST STAND THERE
STARING AT OUR GUESTS.

368
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,023
COME ON IN.

369
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,357
DON'T BE AFRAID, NOW.

370
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,426
[KIDS] GOOD AFTERNOON!
[SHIROE] HI THERE.

371
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,929
[NAOTSUGU] OH, YOU
GUYS SURE ARE CUTE.

372
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,030
WHAT ARE YOUR NAMES?

373
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,065
[GIRL] MISCHA.
[BOY] IVAN.

374
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,868
MISCHA AND IVAN?
NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.

375
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,336
[SHIROE] MM‐HMM.

376
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,303
(CRINGING)

377
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,072
[MISCHA] A NINJA?
[IVAN] A NINJA!

378
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,241
[MISCHA] IT'S A NINJA!
[IVAN] DO SOMETHING REALLY COOL!

379
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,743
DO A BACKFLIP!
KICK MY SISTER!

380
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,245
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE TAKEN A
SHINE TO YOUR FRIEND THERE.

381
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,281
THEY'RE ALL THE
SAME SIZ‐ AH‐AH‐AH!

382
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,150
(MOO)

383
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,185
[FEDOR] THEY'RE MY
GRANDCHILDREN.

384
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,088
IT WAS ONE HELL OF A DAY
WHEN THEY WERE BORN.

385
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,389
[SHIROE]
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

386
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,125
10 BELOW, AND THEIR
FATHER ALREADY DECIDED

387
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,461
TO GO OUT IN THE
BLIZZARD TO THE MARKET.

388
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,230
I WAS THE ONLY MAN
HERE, SO HERE I GO

389
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,867
CARRYING THEIR MOTHER TO THE
DOCTOR ON THE OTHER SIDE‐

390
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,268
[IVAN] GRANDPA, COME HERE!

391
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,270
[FEDOR] WHAT IS IT?
[NAOTSUGU] THIS IS CRAZY, MAN.

392
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,274
EVEN THE NON‐PLAYER CHARACTERS
HAVE BACK STORIES THAT MAKE
THEM SEEM REAL, SHIROE.

393
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,976
(CHILDREN LAUGH)
IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER,

394
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,444
I'D SWEAR I WAS TALKING
TO REAL PEOPLE.

395
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,047
[SHIROE] THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE.
[NAOTSUGU] HMM?

396
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,885
[SHIROE] SOFTWARE ENGINEERS
DON'T GIVE THOUSANDS
OF NPCs FAMILIES,

397
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,753
FEELINGS, AND MEMORIES.

398
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,056
WE RUN AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE
ACTING LIKE WE'RE SUPERHEROES,

399
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:15,061
AND IN A WORLD LIKE THIS
WE CAN'T EVEN DIE NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES WE TRY.

400
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,329
SERIOUSLY.

401
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,664
I MEAN, DOESN'T THAT
KIND OF MAKE US

402
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,901
THE FREAKS AND THE
WEIRDOES IN THIS PLACE?

403
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,269
I GUESS SO.

404
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,971
[SHIROE] THEY'RE THE ONES
ACTUALLY LIVING HERE.

405
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,408
IT'S THEIR WORLD. THEY'RE
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

406
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,443
[NAOTSUGU] EVER SINCE
THIS WHOLE THING WENT DOWN,

407
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:33,880
IT SEEMS LIKE I'VE
BEEN SEEING MORE OF
THEM THAN BEFORE.

408
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,218
YOU THINK WE DIDN'T NOTICE
THOSE GUYS BECAUSE WE WERE
PLAYING, YOU KNOW?

409
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,987
[SHIROE]
AND QUESTING?
YEAH, MAYBE.

410
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,422
[SERARA] TA‐DA!

411
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,357
DINNER'S GONNA
BE AWESOME!

412
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,827
[NYAN‐TA]
WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO
VISIT SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS.

413
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:50,463
LUCKY FOR US, THEY WERE
NICE ENOUGH TO SELL US
SOME FOOD, NOW.

414
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,198
[SERARA]
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

415
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,267
THEY ACTUALLY SOLD US
CHEESE AND SAUSAGE!

416
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,569
[AKATSUKI]
SO YOU MEAN...

417
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,604
YOU DIDN'T USE THE
MENU TO MAKE THOSE?

418
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,339
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

419
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:02,475
NO, CHEESE AND SAUSAGE
ARE ACTUALLY INGREDIENTS.

420
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,311
AND THEY'RE REALLY TASTY
WHEN OUR CHEF COOKS 'EM.

421
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,214
[SERARA] WE MANAGED TO GET
BUTTER AND EGGS, TOO!

422
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,617
AND I ALSO GOT SALT
WHEN I WAS IN SUSUKINO.

423
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,253
THAT MEANS WE CAN MAKE
A BATCH OF COOKIES!

424
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,155
[NYAN‐TA]
MMM, RIGHT.

425
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,224
"COOKIES"?
WHAT ARE THOSE?

426
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,197
(RIBBIT)

427
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,466
[IVAN AND MISCHA]
OHH... MMM.

428
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,334
[BOTH] AH!

429
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,473
AH!

430
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,776
[IVAN] WHAT ARE THESE?
[MISCHA] SO GOOD!

431
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,443
[IVAN] YEAH!

432
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,412
(IVAN AND MISCHA GIGGLE)

433
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,381
[MISCHA] THESE ARE GOOD.

434
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,285
[SHRADER] GET MOVING!

435
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,354
WE NEED TO GET BACK BEFORE
THE TRIFFIDS RESPAWN.

436
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,091
OUR HEALER WAS SENT
TO THE CATHEDRAL.

437
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,458
(GROANS)

438
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,228
DO I LOOK LIKE I'M SOME
KIND OF DAMN BABYSITTER?

439
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,964
THIS IS FREAKIN' RIDICULOUS.

440
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,032
[ISUZU] UH!

441
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,333
ARE YOU OK?

442
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,269
SORRY, TOYA. GUESS
I JUST GOT DIZZY.

443
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,871
THAT GUY...

444
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,274
[TOYA] TWO OF US DIED TODAY
BECAUSE OF THAT JERK.

445
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,611
[ISUZU] YEAH, BUT
I HATE TO SAY IT,

446
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,313
WE'RE NOT THAT STRONG
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

447
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,348
[SHRADER] UNBELIEVABLE.

448
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,783
WELL, WE DIDN'T
HIT OUR QUOTA,

449
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,086
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOU
STUPID KIDS ARE TOO WEAK.

450
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,354
[TOYA] THAT'S CRAP.

451
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,657
IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE
LEVEL 8s AND HE'S A 28.

452
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:26,059
THAT'S WHY WE GOT
BEAT UP OUT THERE!

453
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,493
[ISUZU] WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, TOYA?

454
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,962
[TOYA] I STILL DON'T
REALLY GET IT,

455
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,465
BUT HE'S LIKE A MAGNET
FOR MORE POWERFUL MONSTERS.

456
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,035
I CAN'T PROVIDE DEFENSE
IF THEY'RE ATTACKING HIM!

457
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,369
[GIRL] AAH!

458
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,872
[TOYA] THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GETTING DESTROYED!

459
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,142
I GUESS THAT MAKES
SENSE. IT'S NOT FAIR.

460
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,910
OK. I GET IT.

461
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,481
THAT'S WHY SHIROE
USED THE TEACHER SYSTEM
TO LOWER HIS STATS.

462
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,416
[SHRADER] YOU TWO
NEED TO SHUT UP!

463
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,919
YOU'RE GIVING
ME A HEADACHE!

464
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,422
[TOYA] COME ON.
WE'RE ALMOST BACK TO
AKIHABARA. YOU CAN MAKE IT.

465
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,892
[ISUZU] YEAH. OK.

466
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,595
(THUNDER)

467
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,298
[MINORI] IF THEY GAVE YOU
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME,

468
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,734
THOSE WOUNDS WOULD
HEAL ON THEIR OWN.

469
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,336
THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP
RUNNING YOU OUT THERE.

470
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,173
WHAT ABOUT YOUR HANDS?
DO THEY HURT?

471
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,641
[MINORI] MY HANDS...

472
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,943
I JUST GOT TO GET USED
TO THE SEWING, I GUESS.

473
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,311
(FUMING)

474
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,214
MAN, WHY DID WE JOIN THIS
STINKING GUILD ANYWAY?

475
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,816
WE WERE STUCK.

476
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,720
WE WERE LOST, AND WE DIDN'T
BOTHER TO ASK ANYONE ELSE.

477
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,121
(CLOCK STRIKES)

478
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:31,892
[SHRADER] ALL RIGHT, YOU LITTLE
PANSIES, SHOW US YOUR HANDS.

479
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,231
CONSIDER YOURSELVES LUCKY.

480
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:43,036
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE PRETTY
WORTHLESS, YOU CAN STILL
EARN 3 MEALS A DAY.

481
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,540
(SHRADER LAUGHS)

482
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,711
I WONDER WHAT... WHAT
WOULD SHIROE DO ABOUT THIS?

483
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,746
[TOYA] HOW WOULD HE
GET OUT OF HERE?

484
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,080
HUH!

485
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,518
BROTHER SHIROE...

486
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:04,457
[SHRADER] WELL, THAT'S
EVERYONE. LET'S GO.

487
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,193
AND TRY NOT TO GET
YOURSELVES KILLED TODAY.

488
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,394
GOT IT?

489
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,464
[MARIELLE]
THANKS, SHIROE!
THANK YOU!

490
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,767
[SHIROE] YOU DON'T NEED
TO THANK ME, MARIELLE.

491
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,637
[TOYA] I KNOW THAT VOICE.
IT'S GOT TO BE...

492
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,304
[NAOTSUGU]
LET GO OF MY NECK!

493
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,040
[TOYA] BROTHER SHIROE!

494
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,616
[SHRADER]
HEY, SHAKE A LEG, BOY.

495
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,418
YOU WANT TO EAT
TONIGHT, DON'T YA?

496
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,890
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
WE RETURNED TO AKIHABARA,

497
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,593
WHICH SEEMED TO BE REGAINING
A MEASURE OF PEACE.

498
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:21,728
HOWEVER, IT WAS THE KIND
OF PEACE THAT HAPPENS

499
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,430
WHEN THE WEAK RELINQUISH
CONTROL TO THE STRONG.

500
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,466
DO SOME SEE IT
AND DO NOTHING?

501
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,068
IS SHIROE ONE OF THEM?

502
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:29,703
WILL HE ONLY WATCH AS
THE WORLD AROUND HIM

503
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,806
BECOMES MORE WARPED
AND UNBALANCED?

504
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,809
[SHIROE]
THIS IS OUR REALITY.
