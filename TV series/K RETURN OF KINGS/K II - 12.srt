1
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,332
Uh‐‐

2
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,671
Uh!

3
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,312
[sighing]

4
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,348
<i>Misaki Yata of HOMRA.</i>

5
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,317
Uh... yeah. What's up?

6
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,888
I understand that you've
been friends with our
Fushimi since before you

7
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:55,822
joined HOMRA.

8
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,891
He's no friend of mine!

9
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,327
He betrayed me and Mr.
Mikoto by becoming a Blue!

10
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:06,239
It may very well come to be
that he will share my
destiny and have to die.

11
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:10,343
If that happens, then I'm
sorry. I apologize in
advance.

12
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:12,979
What the hell does that
mean?!

13
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:17,383
Didn't he betray you and
turn his back on the Blues
just like he did with us?!

14
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:20,754
And right now... that
double‐crosser's with the
Greens!

15
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,188
<i>By my command.</i>

16
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:22,756
Huh?!

17
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,494
Before the mission at
Christmas... I gave Mr.
Fushimi my orders.

18
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:32,766
If through some unforeseen
circumstances the mission
were to fail, and the Slate

19
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,235
were somehow stolen away...

20
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:37,571
I ordered him to use any
means available to

21
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:40,240
infiltrate JUNGLE'S
central command.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,210
Because he had been a
turncoat before, he was
perfect for the job.

23
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:45,579
What?!

24
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,415
But isn't that a dangerous
plan?

25
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:52,553
If Saruhiko's found out, the
Greens will just go ahead
and kill him,

26
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,521
no questions asked!

27
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:55,789
That is true.

28
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:57,290
[gasping]

29
00:01:57,357 --> 00:02:02,435
I sent Mr. Fushimi on a
mission with no guarantees
that he'd return alive.

30
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:05,438
Because frankly, he's the
only one who could pull it
off.

31
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,576
And of course, he accepted
the mission fully aware of
the risks.

32
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,548
Why...?! How could you even
consider giving your own
clansman a mission as

33
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:15,782
dangerous as that?!

34
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:16,750
Tell me!

35
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:18,552
<i>Why?</i>

36
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:23,289
Because no matter what the
cost, we can't let JUNGLE
have their way.

37
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,892
SCEPTER 4 stands for order.

38
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:29,796
We won't just sit back and
watch the world fall into
chaos.

39
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:34,901
As a member of SCEPTER 4,
Mr. Fushimi concurred.

40
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:39,405
However, there is one sure
way for him to live through
this.

41
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,910
And that is for him to
betray me and join JUNGLE
for real.

42
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:47,681
Do you believe that he would
actually do such a thing?

43
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:50,651
I ask since, as a former
friend, you probably know
|

44
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:53,453
him best, don't you,
Misaki Yata?

45
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:55,756
Uh‐‐

46
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:43,309
Beneath the ground where
that pillar of light is
emerging is a water intake

47
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:45,946
station that was built then
abandoned.

48
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:48,448
It seems that JUNGLE has
made it their hideout.

49
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:54,621
We believe that the Slate
was taken to that facility's
lowest level.

50
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:57,490
So that's where we're going
to go.

51
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:02,302
And the Red Clan will back
you up. We'll make sure that
the three of you get down to

52
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,637
the lowest level.

53
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,807
Right, everybody? Let's show
those guys what we're made
of!

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,174
Yeah!

55
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,643
Let's do this!

56
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,849
Here's yours, Misaki.

57
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,485
Hmm? Oh, right... You can
count on me!

58
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,457
I'm in charge of Basement
Level 9, isn't that right?

59
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,860
<i>Yata, it's okay.</i>

60
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,163
Okay...? What the hell's
that mean?!

61
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:35,168
Go and save Fushimi. You can
take your position after
that.

62
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,938
But if I'm not in time,
then...

63
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,339
You'll be fine.

64
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,006
Uh!

65
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,308
I believe in you, Misaki.

66
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,476
Uh‐

67
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,317
<i>This is it!</i>

68
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,953
Everyone, hold onto
something!

Aren't you gonna help him
out, Zenjo?

74
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:33,433
No, that isn't my
assignment.

75
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:37,871
Is your only job to cut down
Kings like Habari who've

76
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:39,405
lost control of
their powers?

77

[grunting]

00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,743
You can't afford to be
distracted!

00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:58,925
Just what are you clinging
so tenaciously to, Munakata?

82
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,870
Aren't you just being
stubborn? Face it, the die
has been cast. The world

83
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:07,240
you're so determined to
protect has already been
destroyed.

84
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:08,809
Yes...

85
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,946
I am being stubborn. I
despise the fact that I lost
our battle to you far more

86
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:15,281
than I ever imagined I
would.

87
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:18,384
<i>Do you really hate</i>
<i>me that much?</i>

88
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,788
Yes, I do. I hate the way
you live.

89
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:26,459
Well, if we're talking about
likes and dislikes, I don't
care for you either.

90
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:30,263
Watching you reminds me of
just how deluded I used to
be.

91
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:31,832
Hmph!

92
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:34,901
Didn't having your sword
broken teach you anything?!

93
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:39,405
Flaunt your childish ideals
all you like, but you still
won't be able to change a

94
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,507

Benzai! Look sharp!

00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,817
Right, you too!

107
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,353

[chuckling]

113
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:48,214
And just what do you all
think you're doing here?

114
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:53,386
We've decided that at the
present time, our most
crucial responsibility is

115
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,856
the swift suppression of the
JUNGLE stronghold.

116
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:58,224
So we've come to assist you,
Captain.

117
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:03,236
I have issued no such
orders. Besides, I'm no
longer your captain...

118
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:06,673
SCEPTER 4 isn't made of
aimless followers who just
sit around waiting for

119
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:08,374
orders, sir.

120
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:11,878
We just use the name "Tokyo
Legal Affairs Bureau Civil
Registry Department Division

121
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:14,781
4" as a cover for SCEPTER
4's actions.

122
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:17,784
He's right. It's just a
faÃ§ade. That's all.

123
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:22,923
It doesn't make a difference
where or when, your cause is
our cause, Captain.

124
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:26,927
We all are clansmen of Blue
King Reisi Munakata!

125
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:31,765
<i>Currently, every member of</i>

We of SCEPTER 4 fulfill our

00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,587
It sounds lovely.

Captain! Please, sir, you
have to undo your Sanctum
immediately!

168
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:05,872
I already did. But my will
alone is no longer enough to
make it disappear.

Go! All of you, get back,
now!

Yes, you too, Mr. Zenjo.

171
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:14,080
I am the Blue King's
lieutenant.

172
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:18,585
If necessary, then I will...

173
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,086
Hm.

174
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:25,158
This is Akagi. B2, standing
by!

This is Bando. B3, standing

This is Fujishima. B7,

Thanks to the Blue King

still have a chance.

What about Izumo and
Misaki...?

All done. Kusanagi, B8

189
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:08,942
All right, this is as far as
I go.

190
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:14,047
I can't accompany you
further, Mr. Shiro. But good
luck, okay?

191
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:14,981
Right.

192
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:16,917
Mr. Kusanagi, thank you.

193
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:21,221
We're grateful for the Red
Clan's help.

194
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:24,991
See you later, sunglasses
guy! Make me pancakes again,
okay?

195
00:13:25,058 --> 00:13:29,563
Sure thing, Neko. When this
is over, I'll make you a
tower of pancakes.

You're so lame! You're
s'posed to try to beat the
final dungeon after you earn

202
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:45,779
enough experience points.

203
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:49,482
It's too bad for you that
I'm not gonna let you return
to your last save point.

Shut up, you game obsessed
brat...

This is reality, and here
you don't have the luxury

00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,324
of a reset button to
save your life.

207
00:13:58,358 --> 00:13:59,826
There are times ...

208
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:04,104
...when you still have to
keep playing the damn
game... even if...

209
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:06,106
...you know that you can't

213
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,684
This whole reality pretty
much sucks...

214
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:22,222
Even considering the hazard
pay, this is nowhere near
worth it.

215
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:27,127
Why the hell did I ever
agree to take on this damn
job in the first place?

216
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:29,395

that guy actually came after
me...

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,041
Saruhiko!

00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,242
Fire!

222
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:46,412
Damn you, trying to make
yourself look good, doing
this alone! If you die

223
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:49,215
before giving me some
answers, I'll never forgive
you!

me!

00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,518
Get back here!

232
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,287
Saruhiko! You alive?! Hey!

233
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,191
You're late...

234
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,459
Uh‐‐

235
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,030
And you call yourself a
hotshot?

236
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,898
What a joke...

237
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:35,802
Hey! Shut up! And why didn't
you tell me, anyway?!

238
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:41,074
You know I can't talk about
top‐secret missions, idiot,
but couldn't you guess?

240
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,945
Come on, how was I supposed
to guess that?!

241
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,247
You've always been like
this, you know.

242
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,251
Yeah, fine! So, I'm stupid!

243
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,054
That's why I won't get
something unless you explain
it!

244
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,591
Would you have understood
even if I told you?

245
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,826
You could've figured
something out!

246
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,161
Explained till I got it.

247
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:05,271
If you never told me
anything about this, and you
died in here...

248
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,607
I would have
never known!

249
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,910
Then I would've thought
you were a traitor forever!

250
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,246
But I am a traitor,
remember?

251
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,280
No, you're not!

252
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:19,485
You took this huge risk,
putting your life on the
line, for the Blue King...

253
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,856
Just like I would've done
for Mr. Mikoto or Anna...

254
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,962
That means the Blue King
really was your true King
all along!

261
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,451
what'll you do now?

262
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:55,121
Hey, you little punk! Don't
you have any friends to play
games with?

263
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:59,225

<i>with weak idiots who just</i>
<i>slow me down.</i>

265
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:06,540
I'm strong enough on my own,
anyway. The only one who's
fun to play with is Nagare.

266
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,509
That's why anyone who gets
in his way...

267
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:10,310
...is gonna get crushed!

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,565
But...

271
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,534
It's time to go home, kid...

272
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,371
You're full of it! I'm still
way stronger than the two of
you put together!

273
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,206

<i>assigned floor, Yata!</i>

311
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:46,012
All right... Got it.

312
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,049
Just go.

313
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:52,085
Count me out of this one,
okay?

314
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,355
Or I'll be working overtime
without pay.

315
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:58,091
What? But you're...!

316
00:19:58,158 --> 00:20:00,200
Who matters to you the most
right now?

317
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,868
Uh!

318
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,138
Anna, of course.

319
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:09,475
Then hurry up and get going.
You have a job to do, so go
do it.

320
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,345
Don't worry, I can get out
of here by myself.

321
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,315
<i>Misaki...</i>

322
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,517
Mm‐

323
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,154
I'll think about how to say
things...

324
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,889
...so even a fool can get
it.

325
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,825
Uh‐‐

326
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,161
All right! Let's talk more
later!

327
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:40,974
[breathing heavily]

328
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,343
There he is! Move in!

329
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,078
[sighing]

330
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,048
I've used up all my
knives...

331
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:54,487
He's simple‐minded, stupid,
and ignorant. He barely
understands anything...

332
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:59,259
But despite that, he's
somehow able to come up with
the perfect explanation...

333
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:03,003
That means the Blue King
really was your true King
all along!

334
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:06,239
No wonder I'd go through all
this trouble just for him...

335
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,778
An escape route has been
secured.

336
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:14,515
I don't recall asking for
your service.

337
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:18,251
That's okay. I already
received payment from your
superior.

338
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:19,419
Hm!

339
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:32,098
Bright and shiny teeth that
can light up the abyss, bring
a healthy life.

340
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:42,275
You understand, don't you? I
won't let you get past me.

341
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:44,878
I'll fight you with
everything I've got.

342
00:21:45,411 --> 00:21:46,412
[hissing]

343
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:48,214
Yukari Mishakuji...

344
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:51,151
This battle will be...
one on one.

345
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,252
Kuroh?!

346
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:58,424
You two go on ahead. I must
face this man alone.

347
00:21:58,424 --> 00:22:02,102
Please, Shiro, let me do
things my way, just this
once.

348
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:03,136
Oh‐

349
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:10,110
This is the first time
you've ever insisted on
anything.

350
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:10,911
Hmm.

351
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:13,847
<i>I admire your spirit, but...</i>

352
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:15,115
Kuroh...

353
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:24,190
Remember, if you can't
defeat me, I'll waste no
time whatsoever in going

354
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:25,425
after your king.

355
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,326
Hm!

356
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:13,914
<i>The King who seeks change,</i>
<i>the King who prepares for</i>
<i>her final destruction...</i>

357
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:19,419
<i>Next time on K RETURN OF</i>
<i>KINGS, episode 13 "Kings."</i>

358
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:22,422
<i>The first King will put an</i>
<i>end to everything...</i>
