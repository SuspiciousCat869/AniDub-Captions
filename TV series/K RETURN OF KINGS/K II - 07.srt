1
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,776
Enemy infiltration is
at seventy percent.

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,345
We can't hold them
off for much longer.

3
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,482
Yukari Mishakuji
and Sukuna Gojo.

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,986
Their plan's simple:
overwhelm with brute force.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,955
And yet it shows just
how much confidence they

6
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,324
have in their own abilities.

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,827
They're messing with us.

8
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,297
Oh my, another trap
to try to stall us?

9
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,534
This is really getting
quite tiresome.

10
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,302
My orders are to destroy
all the traps I can in

11
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,105
order to clear a route
inside for our King.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,308
I understand that
that's part of my duty,

13
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,877
and I've accepted that.

14
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,979
Caw! Duty! Duty!

15
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:48,949
However...

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,820
I prefer my battles
to be more beautiful!

17
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,223
We'll be more than happy
to grant your wish!

18
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:02,503
Hm?

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,405
[growl]

20
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:18,051
We'll give you a beautiful
send‐off! How's that?

21
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:19,986
Phase Two of the
plan to neutralize

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,355
JUNGLE: concentrate
our military power in

23
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:24,490
the Cloud Hall on the
seventy‐fifth floor and

24
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:27,493
crush the Green
clansmen one by one.

25
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:30,163
It's all going as
planned so far, but...

26
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,667
Our sensors are detecting
massive Weismann

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,502
levels on the lower floors!

28
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:36,937
It's in motion!

29
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:40,040
Agh! He's here now,
The Green King!

30
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:44,511
This is Nagare.
I'm going in.

31
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:20,386
[laughter] It's so
good to see him up

32
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:21,988
and running again!

33
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,990
It's been nine years since
he fought the Gold King,

34
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:25,526
Daikaku Kokujoji.

35
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:29,062
And it's been over a decade
since the Kagutsu Incident.

36
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,131
We've been forced to
hide in the shadows

37
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:32,566
for practically ages.

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,468
I mean really, that
stubborn old fart

39
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:37,370
just wouldn't die!

40
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,406
[sigh]

41
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:43,744
But now Kokujoji's
finally gone.

42
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,680
And that means there's
no one left in this

43
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,015
entire world that
can stop you when

44
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,652
you're at full
power, Nagare.

45
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:55,756
That's it, Nagare!
Run wild all you want!

46
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,092
Mr. Iwa's here to get your
back, so go right on ahead

47
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,701
and have an absolute blast!

48
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,235
[laughter]

49
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:04,370
[gasp]

50
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,608
Holy crap! That
was way too close!

51
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,045
What's that noise?!
Is it more of them?!

52
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:15,616
Hey! C'mon, you Blues! Hurry
up and get into position!

53
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,785
Oh my, you're here
already, are you?

54
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:21,387
Here already?

55
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:23,223
You don't mean!

56
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:24,625
Yes, that's right.

57
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,560
He's coming...

58
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:27,794
[gasp]

59
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,065
How very unfortunate.
Truly unfortunate.

60
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:34,400
And just when things
were finally starting to

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,135
become interesting.

62
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,404
But now it's all
over. Oh, well.

63
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:40,073
Over! It's over!

64
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,408
What do you mean, over?

65
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:44,210
It's the Green King!

66
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:46,246
I didn't expect him so soon.

67
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,281
Hey, what's the matter?!

68
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:49,716
Don't act like cowards!

69
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,252
Whether it's a King or only
some low‐level clansmen,

70
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,754
who the hell cares?!

71
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:57,390
We'll crush anyone who comes
at us, so show some spirit!

72
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,559
Come on!

73
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:02,235
Oh? like this
boy's enthusiasm.

74
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,105
But I meant me when
I said unfortunate!

75
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,274
Hey! What the‐?!

76
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,411
Since my part in this
is all over, ta‐ta!

77
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:13,680
Shiro!

78
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,518
Yeah. It appears that
he has decided it's time

79
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,785
to make his move.

80
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,455
Although it's sooner
than I had expected...

81
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,190
What'll we do, Shiro?

82
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,127
Hey, who gave you guys
permission to talk, anyway?!

83
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:30,631
[gasp]

84
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,804
Ah! Damn it! Stop all
your fooling around!

85
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,673
Come on! Fight me for real!

86
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,176
Sukuna Gojo, this battle
of ours is not a single

87
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,846
combat that will determine
the outcome of war.

88
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,481
Huh?! But nothing is
more important than

89
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,184
winning whatever
game you're playing!

90
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,786
You gotta risk everything!

91
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,320
I'm betting my life!

92
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,724
So you're willing to throw
your life away, huh?

93
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,166
Then you leave
me no choice!

94
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,235
He'll use a big move here.

95
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:04,671
So counter the instant
that he first swings.

96
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,572
Understood.

97
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:08,709
I'm gonna take all of
you out, right now!

98
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:14,347
The sun is setting. Those
who chose to leave their

99
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,517
homes, and those who return.

100
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,484
Yukari Mishakuji!

101
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:21,855
Yukari! I'm right in the
middle of a game here!

102
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:23,690
Middle of a game!

103
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,592
[chuckle] Well, Kuroh...

104
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,361
I see being reunited
with the Silver King has

105
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:31,665
made you even more
handsome than ever.

106
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:33,867
Understandable, since
you only use your

107
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,569
sword to protect your King.

108
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,338
It's what defines
your selfless nature.

109
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:41,274
So have you come here
to assist your comrade

110
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:43,777
then, Yukari Mishakuji?

111
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:44,945
That's just dirty!

112
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:47,280
Hey, I don't need
your help, you know!

113
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:49,883
Assist? Or help?

114
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:54,220
I would never do anything as
tasteless as those things.

115
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:57,958
I just came by so that I
might pick up our boy, here.

116
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:00,393
Come on, Sukuna. Time to go.

117
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:03,036
Caw! Time to go! Time to go!

118
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:05,906
No way, man! I'm
staying to fight!

119
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,409
Stop being so
selfish, Sukuna.

120
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,812
A child throwing
infantile tantrums is

121
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,614
very unattractive.

122
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,582
And besides...

123
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,752
I've already decided
that Kuroh will be mine.

124
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:22,556
When the time comes, I get
to have him all to myself.

125
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:25,425
Whatever, and you have
the nerve to say that

126
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,893
I'm the selfish one here?!

127
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:36,069
Alas, Kuroh, it seems we
just weren't destined to

128
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:37,904
face each other tonight.

129
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:42,509
But I'm sure that we'll
meet again very soon.

130
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:45,345
And on that fateful
day we'll settle things

131
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,913
once and for all.

132
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:52,953
What's the deal with that
weirdo? After all the fuss

133
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:54,621
that he caused getting
up here, he just

134
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,523
decides to run off!

135
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,925
I mean, talk about
anticlimactic!

136
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,101
And who exactly am I
supposed to take out all

137
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:02,936
my frustration on now?!

138
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:08,008
Right, so, the kid that you
guys were just dealing with.

139
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,611
Yes, that's right.
I mean Sukuna Gojo.

140
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:13,113
Really? You're saying that
he just retreated along

141
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:14,781
with Yukari Mishakuji?

142
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:16,683
Okay, got it.

143
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:19,052
It's sooner than
anticipated, but we'll go

144
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:21,555
ahead and prepare to
move on to Phase 3.

145
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:22,823
Yes, Mr. Shiro.

146
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,491
We'll all be waiting
up at the top.

147
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:27,994
Please, sir, be very careful.

148
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:34,400
Fushimi, we're starting
Phase 3. Everything ready?

149
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:35,802
I was ready hours ago.

150
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:39,139
Mihashira Tower will now
go into total lockdown,

151
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,908
including all communication
and power systems.

152
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:43,744
That will isolate
the Green King.

153
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:47,347
And from this moment onward
our communication will be

154
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,916
limited to just the Red
King's psychic powers,

155
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:52,519
so please be cautious.

156
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:53,520
Understood.

157
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:56,422
Right! Launch emergency
Tower lockdown.

158
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,892
Yes, sir! Emergency
Tower lockdown!

159
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,707
You can't use the routes
that your henchmen opened

160
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:08,909
up, Green King.
I won't let you.

161
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:16,049
There are no lights
along the corridors.

162
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,452
And no one will be
able to hear your voice.

163
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:23,023
Furthermore, several
layers of thick walls

164
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:24,558
will block your way.

165
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:28,128
All of Mihashira Tower
has now become a prison,

166
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,130
custom‐made just for you.

167
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:33,734
Obviously, a trap like this
one could never completely

168
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:36,703
stop a powerful King
such as yourself.

169
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:40,574
However, each trap will
certainly eat away at your

170
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,576
limited time and strength.

171
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:46,079
You'll need to break
through a hundred walls

172
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,748
and get past two Kings.

173
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:51,151
All right then, let's see
if you'll make it this far.

174
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:55,055
Can you, Green
King, Nagare Hisui?

175
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:57,791
[chuckle]

176
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,509
Is this the damage Nagare
Hisui left behind?

177
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,578
His destructive power
is simply amazing.

178
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,048
Yeah, he's using up his
power at an alarming rate.

179
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,718
His speed is far greater
than I expected.

180
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,955
But, there's no way he
can maintain his stamina.

181
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,058
Shiro, isn't that exactly
the outcome you hoped your

182
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,727
strategy would produce?

183
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,863
Yes, but it's happening much
faster than I anticipated.

184
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:31,898
Its like he's not
even trying to save

185
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,133
his strength at all.

186
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,569
Just what could
he be up to?

187
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,571
Something doesn't
feel right.

188
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,139
Shiro!

189
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,641
Shiro!

190
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,908
Hurry up!

191
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,644
So are you saying?

192
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,045
I think Anna's in danger!

193
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,716
Shiro, hurry up!
Meow! Meow!

194
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:53,219
Remember, Anna will be the
key player in this mission.

195
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,089
There isn't very much we'll
be able to do during a fight

196
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,726
between Kings. We'll
only get in Anna's way.

197
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,669
Soon, Yashiro Isana,
the Silver King,

198
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:03,937
will join us here.

199
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,007
Mr. Shiro will defend and
Anna will attack. The rest

200
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:09,776
of us are all there for
diversion and support.

201
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,778
Right! Did you
guys get that?

202
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:12,779
Yeah!

203
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,016
But Yata, What about you?
Did you get it, as well?

204
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,451
I'm not supposed to
get carried away and

205
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:20,120
jump into battle, is that it?

206
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,856
[chuckle]

207
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:25,859
Even at a time such
as this one you

208
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:28,595
HOMRA are full of energy.

209
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,699
Please, I beg your
pardon, Red King.

210
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:36,102
We are all connected.

211
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,137
Huh?

212
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,972
I said we're all connected.

213
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,642
Deep down inside of
us we all share a bond.

214
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,176
That's why...

215
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,979
Our fire will never go out.

216
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,281
But what I don't get
about all of this

217
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:50,617
is the Blue King.

218
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:55,055
I mean, he's making Anna,
HOMRA's King, put her life

219
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,824
on the line while he
gets to kick back and

220
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,893
chill out up there!

221
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,668
Just who the hell
does that guy think he

222
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:03,737
is to do that, anyway?!

223
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,840
Yata, we went over all this
at the strategy meeting.

224
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:09,743
We can't afford to let the
Green King gain entrance to

225
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,244
the Chamber of the Slate.

226
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,880
If all of us are in here and
he somehow manages to break

227
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:16,149
through, it would be bad.

228
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:18,885
That's why Anna and Mr.
Shiro's job is to force the

229
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,854
enemy to use up his power,
so if he does get past us

230
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:24,558
the Blue King will be
waiting to stop him for

231
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:26,760
sure. That's the plan.

232
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,563
Hey, listen, don't get me
wrong, here. I have no

233
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,264
problem with the
strategy itself.

234
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:34,868
What I'm talking
about is his attitude

235
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,337
and his sense of honor.

236
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,206
I just don't understand
why anyone would

237
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,875
want to follow that guy.

238
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,045
Dishonest bastard...

239
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:49,750
Dumbass! Don't make
such a fuss over

240
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:51,217
other people's business!

241
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,555
Sorry, Seri. Forgive him.

242
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:58,258
Huh?! Oh, no, I, uh,
wasn't talking about you!

243
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:02,235
Hey!

244
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:11,645
Everyone, get back.

245
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:13,580
What is it?

246
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,882
He's coming now.

247
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,601
[chuckle]

248
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:48,915
[groans]

249
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:55,622
Agh! Shit! Didn't
see that coming!

250
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:58,258
So that is the Green King?!

251
00:13:58,659 --> 00:13:59,793
Anna!

252
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:05,205
Are you injured?!

253
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:07,307
I'm fine.

254
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:10,276
I'm going. I
have to stop him.

255
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:15,215
Anna!

256
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:22,656
Hello, Red King,
Anna Kushina.

257
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:26,693
I must ask you to forgive my
rude entrance back there.

258
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:27,828
I'm in a hurry.

259
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:29,029
Apologies.

260
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:31,965
Enough, Green
King, Nagare Hisui.

261
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,835
Just give it up. We
cannot and will not

262
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:35,869
let you have it.

263
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,172
The Slate is not merely
your toy to play with.

264
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:42,876
You're right. It's not my
toy. I'm in complete

265
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:44,410
agreement with you on that.

266
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,981
A world where players are
granted powers that far

267
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,383
exceed the limits of
humankind and compete

268
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,685
to reach the top.

269
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:54,054
The Dresden Slate
is a catalyst that

270
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,856
serves that purpose.

271
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:59,092
Which means it doesn't
belong to me alone.

272
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,867
It belongs to everyone.

273
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,503
You must stop.

274
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:05,038
No, I will not stop,
nor can I be stopped.

275
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,241
Watch, Anna Kushina,
I'm now going to

276
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,043
achieve my objective.

277
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,444
Stop! Now!

278
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,895
You've only been a King
for a very short time

279
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,131
and yet you seem to
have great control

280
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,398
over your power.

281
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:33,967
I'm impressed.

282
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,437
You do not understand the
true meaning of this power.

283
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:41,241
Power by itself has
no intrinsic meaning.

284
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:44,044
It is the people who
wield power that are the

285
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,879
ones who provide it meaning.

286
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,213
That's not true!

287
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,417
Fine, then. Since we've
confirmed that our opinions

288
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,086
are at odds with each other.

289
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:56,122
Now the games shall begin!

290
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:05,105
[chuckle]

291
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,015
A lightning beast?!

292
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,789
Anna and Nagare Hisui
are battling each other.

293
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,357
Look! There!

294
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,208
I've arrived at last!

295
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,010
My goal!

296
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:47,447
Sorry, no goal just yet.

297
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:04,905
It's time! He's
used up his power.

298
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:14,147
Anna! Mr. Munakata!

299
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:27,360
So? How was it, Nagare
Hisui? Did you enjoy your

300
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,229
pointless little rampage?

301
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:32,032
There's no sense or
order to your actions.

302
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:33,600
In your frenzy of
destruction, you were

303
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,369
essentially like an animal.

304
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:41,207
Oh, it was almost unbearably
fun, Reisi Munakata.

305
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:44,545
You do realize that humans
are animals, too, right?

306
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:47,447
We're all just individual
creatures that happen to be

307
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:49,583
different from each other.

308
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:53,053
Don't you agree with
that, Miyabi Ameno?

309
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,021
You mean me?!

310
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,892
But I'm Neko!

311
00:17:59,025 --> 00:17:59,926
Miyabi Ameno...

312
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,569
Even with SCEPTER 4's
resources, we couldn't

313
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,705
identify that girl.

314
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:07,240
So that is her real
name, then, is it?

315
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:09,643
Although, wouldn't you
say that she's a bit

316
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,979
too unique to use as an
example of what ordinary,

317
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:14,648
everyday humans are like?

318
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:17,918
You believe that
because you're a fool.

319
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,554
She and I are both the same...

320
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:23,256
We can define ourselves
without being limited

321
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:25,592
by whatever human
qualities just happen

322
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,060
to be forced upon us.

323
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,296
It's possession of that free
spirit that throws open the

324
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,432
doors of human possibility.

325
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:35,636
And now, I the one nearest
that free‐spirited ideal,

326
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:38,438
have come here to
receive the Slate.

327
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:40,574
Are you saying you're
the most suitable

328
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,609
to manage the Slate?

329
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:46,513
The amount of arrogance you
show is just astounding.

330
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,950
Don't misunderstand
me, Reisi Munakata.

331
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,586
Really, it's completely
impossible for anyone

332
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,288
to be "suitable" to
manage the Dresden Slate.

333
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:59,025
It's the wellspring of
possibilities, and to think

334
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:02,035
one can arbitrarily
control it shows a total

335
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:04,470
lack of understanding
of its true nature.

336
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,773
The whole idea's absurd.

337
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:09,643
Oh, I see. Don't try
to manage the power,

338
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,311
merely release it.

339
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:14,548
Creating unbridled chaos is
the meaning of the Slate's

340
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:16,382
existence, is that right?

341
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:18,519
Is that what you're saying?

342
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,622
No, there is no meaning.

343
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:25,125
Those who possess power
simply use it in any way

344
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:26,660
that they want, that's all.

345
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,196
But look, your power is
exhausted. This situation

346
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,065
you've found yourself in.

347
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,000
How do you explain that?

348
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:41,675
Nagare Hisui, you are
already a dead man.

349
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:43,744
According to the
Silver King's data, you

350
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,647
lost your heart during
the Kagutsu Incident.

351
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,683
Your power alone is
sustaining your existence,

352
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:51,718
and barely at that.

353
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:54,054
That explains how you're
able to manipulate your

354
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:56,557
physical capabilities
to such an extreme.

355
00:19:57,524 --> 00:20:00,661
However, once your power
has become all used up

356
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:03,637
you're like a toy with a
dead battery inside of it.

357
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,541
Or rather, your original
self which is to say,

358
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:09,009
nothing but a corpse.

359
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,212
I hardly think that you're
qualified to battle me in

360
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,981
order to determine
who has the right to

361
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,449
possess the Slate.

362
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,185
[chuckle] Perhaps
you're right.

363
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,454
But then, I'm not the
one you're going to

364
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,056
be doing battle against.

365
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,192
"He" will be arriving
here shortly using the

366
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,630
path I've cleared.
"He" is my trump card.

367
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:31,832
Come on!

368
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,735
Anna our King!
Is in danger!

369
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,337
Ya hear?! Show
some guts, bastards!

370
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,304
Right!

371
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,307
[chuckle] At times like
these, it sure is good to

372
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,475
have Yata around!

373
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,310
Huh?!

374
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:48,048
Hey, this fog,
Where'd it come from?

375
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,684
[gasps]

376
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,318
Everyone! Be careful!

377
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:56,557
Yata! Kamamoto! Seri!

378
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:17,050
Who are you?!

379
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,593
What the hell was that?

380
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:29,429
[gasp] Anna!

381
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,565
An unknown sanctum just
appeared inside the tower!

382
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,534
It's another King, sir!

383
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,401
[gasp] What?!

384
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:39,439
Vertical over. A Sword of
Damocles is manifesting!

385
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,110
Impossible! Another King?!

386
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:03,103
Mr. Munakata!

387
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,439
Yes, I see. Nagare Hisui's
reckless actions and

388
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:09,643
surprising confidence
can be explained by the

389
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:12,813
fact that you were the
one behind this all along.

390
00:22:15,582 --> 00:22:17,618
You, who were said
to have died during

391
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,653
the Kagutsu Incident.

392
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,422
The Sixth King!
The Gray King!

393
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:25,792
Whoa, hold on. Just
wait a second, Munakata.

394
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:29,362
The beginning is crucial in
human relationships.

395
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,632
So I just have one
thing to say first.

396
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:36,136
If you wanna talk
to me, call me Mr. Iwa!

397
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:11,044
The final sword
that remained

398
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:13,614
hidden till now, Gray.

399
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:18,451
Next time on K RETURN OF
KINGS, Episode 8 "Kaput."

400
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:22,923
You are a coward, but
also a very tragic figure.
