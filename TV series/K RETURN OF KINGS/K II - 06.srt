1
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:10,110
We will attack on the
24th, on Christmas Eve.

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,246
We will summon up
every ounce of power

3
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,349
that we possess and
we will seize the

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,252
Dresden Slate, the
ultimate sacrament.

5
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,923
With it, we'll fulfill
our goal as JUNGLE too.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,192
Are any of you even
listening to me at all?

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,963
Sure, Nagare, of
course we're listening.

8
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,965
Oh dear, I've got a
wrinkle right here.

9
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:36,202
Yes, I see, Yukari. Well
then, I shall continue.

10
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,373
Currently, the Slate is
kept inside Mihashira Tower.

11
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,277
Originally, my plan was
this. Now that the Gold

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,446
King is no longer around
to suppress its power

13
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,616
the Slate should be able
to serve its original

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,319
purpose of advancing
mankind's evolution.

15
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,990
After all, Daikaku
Kokujoji was an exception.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,960
I was sure there was no way
the young and inexperienced

17
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,703
Blue King could control
the Slate's power.

18
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:06,239
That's why I left it
there, untouched, and yet...

19
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:09,008
Are you sure that you
all are listening?

20
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,711
Yeah, of course, Nagare.

21
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:14,047
Yes! All right!
I leveled up!

22
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:16,517
Oh, did you?
Congratulations, Sukuna.

23
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:19,986
In any case, the Blue
King has proven me

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,355
wrong by lasting longer
than anticipated.

25
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:24,424
Impressive...

26
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:26,392
And to make matters
worse, the Silver King has

27
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,996
returned, and a new
Red King has been born.

28
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:33,333
Now, they've joined forces
to guard Mihashira Tower.

29
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,437
Which means that there is
only one other option left

30
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:40,406
to us, to bring the
Slate under our control.

31
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:44,177
Come on. Not one of you
is really listening to me.

32
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:45,278
I can tell.

33
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:47,447
Hey, come on,
now, you two!

34
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:49,516
Pay attention to him,
would you? I know that

35
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,185
he may not look it, but
he is still our King.

36
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,021
Stop joking! Show
him some respect.

37
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:59,259
It seems to me you're the
least respectful one, Mr. Iwa.

38
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:02,135
Please, don't
misunderstand, Mr. Iwa.

39
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:05,405
I am simply beautifying
myself in preparation.

40
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,440
I want to make sure
that I look gorgeous and

41
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:10,043
elegant as I walk
through the battlefield.

42
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,714
But my heart is filled with
excitement. I'm ready to

43
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:17,083
draw my beloved
Ayamachi at any time.

44
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:19,285
Yeah, and the
same goes for me.

45
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:21,221
This game's just
to stay busy.

46
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:22,556
It's keeping me
distracted from how

47
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:24,490
badly I want to
go out and fight.

48
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:27,493
Seriously, Nagare, don't
get all bent out of shape.

49
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:28,729
I totally understand
what you've been

50
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,496
saying this entire time!

51
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:33,233
Oh, I see. So both of
you are fully prepared

52
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,568
then, are you?

53
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:36,069
I'm quite impressed.

54
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:38,572
Well then, after we take
possession of the Slate,

55
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:41,107
we'll celebrate with a
lavish Christmas party.

56
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,810
Chicken, chicken!
Juicy and delicious!

57
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:48,414
Kotosaka, I expect you
to do your share, too.

58
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:51,351
No need to worry. Every
one of us here is totally

59
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:53,253
pumped up and ready to go!

60
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,422
Oh. Well, you guys all
know how I do things.

61
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:59,259
I'll just be relaxing around
here and drinking my beer.

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,835
Come to think of it, Nagare.

63
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:04,370
Isn't it a bit unusual for
you to hold an official

64
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,773
meeting like this
before assigning a job?

65
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:09,610
I wonder, could it be,
perhaps, that you're

66
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,312
starting to feel a little
nervous? After all,

67
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:14,180
you are taking
on three Kings.

68
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,383
[chuckle] Give me a break.
As if! Right, Nagare?

69
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:20,621
Well, I must admit, an
alliance of the Silver,

70
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:24,625
Red and Blue Kings is a
very formidable challenge

71
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,793
to have to overcome. But...

72
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,974
[humming]

73
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,578
Welcome. Thank you
so much for coming.

74
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,314
And how are all of
you doing today?

75
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,585
Well, it appears that
you're not too happy.

76
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:22,322
Perhaps in deference to my
position as the Silver King,

77
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,290
you don't want to come
right out and do or

78
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,927
say anything to
blatantly oppose me.

79
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,930
However, do I detect a
little resentment at my

80
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,767
calling you out so often
and at my taking charge?

81
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,302
Excuse me, Silver
King, may I have your

82
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,304
permission to speak freely?

83
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,774
By all means, Mr. Kusanagi.

84
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,776
Right now, we're
going on the premise

85
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,845
that the Green
Clan is going to

86
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,881
attack Mihashira Tower
to steal the Slate.

87
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,617
Are you positive that's
really their plan?

88
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,019
Yes I am, and if they do
get their hands on the

89
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,789
Slate, the world order
that the Lieutenant...

90
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,325
I mean, the Gold King
and the Blue King

91
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,969
here worked so hard to
preserve, would collapse.

92
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,673
At the very least, the
world that all of us know

93
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:08,408
would cease to exist.

94
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,814
The reason is that the Green
Clan's intent is to pass on

95
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:17,317
the power of the Slate to
the entirety of mankind.

96
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:23,757
I can speak for the Red Clan
and I'm pretty sure that I

97
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,893
can do the same for the Blue
Clan over there as well.

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,329
When I say I can assure
you that none of us would

99
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:32,666
even dream of questioning
your status as King.

100
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,868
But still, that status and
whether or not you're

101
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,037
capable of leading
this operation are

102
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,705
two completely
different matters.

103
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:39,773
Mm‐hm.

104
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,676
I apologize, but I have
to be frank about this...

105
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:44,678
I'm not sure if you
have what it takes.

106
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:47,914
[growl] I'll have you
know Shiro is amazing!

107
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:49,449
Settle down, Neko.

108
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:53,787
Kusanagi...

109
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,524
I realize that I may sound
biased, but this man's more

110
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,359
than qualified for the task.

111
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,736
He has the intelligence,
the leadership,

112
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,605
the good judgment.

113
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,039
Kuroh...

114
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:07,073
Thanks for that.

115
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,576
You too, Mr. Kusanagi.

116
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,977
You chose to play the
devil's advocate for

117
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,613
everyone, right?

118
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:13,580
[chuckle]

119
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:17,117
Now, there's a simple
reason why I should be

120
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,553
the one who's directing
this counterattack.

121
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,455
It's because I know
everything that there is to

122
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:25,792
know about the Green
King, Nagare Hisui.

123
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:27,728
Hey, wait a minute!

124
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:30,731
How's it possible
for you to know that?

125
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:32,899
I thought that the Green
King went out of his way to

126
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,068
avoid being seen in public!

127
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,070
Unless you're
telling us that you're

128
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,905
connected to the Greens!

129
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:41,441
I'll put this very simply...

130
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:44,511
The Green King, Nagare
Hisui, once challenged the

131
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:47,480
Gold King, Daikaku
Kokujoji to battle.

132
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:49,916
All by himself.

133
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,654
Video and images of
that incident remain

134
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:55,421
intact in their entirety.

135
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,958
The Lieutenant passed
that data on to me,

136
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:00,767
and I also heard the
details from him directly.

137
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:06,507
Is it all right if I say
something too, Silver King?

138
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,842
Yes of course,
Ms. Awashima.

139
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:12,713
And please, just call me
Shiro, if you'd prefer.

140
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,447
Understood.

141
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,950
Mr. Shiro, if I may
be frank, I'm having

142
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,786
some real troubles
believing all of this.

143
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:22,022
Why would the Green King
ever have issue to challenge

144
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:24,858
that's as reckless as
that would have been?

145
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,694
Because maybe it isn't as
reckless as you think.

146
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:31,464
I say that because although
he did lose in the end, at

147
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:33,967
one point the Green King
was managing to hold his

148
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,036
own against the most
powerful King and the

149
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:37,804
battle was nearly even.

150
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,174
And another thing, he
actually explained his

151
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,510
reason for wanting to
overthrow the Gold King

152
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:46,479
in the first place and it
was absolutely ridiculous.

153
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,081
Before the Green
King escaped he left a

154
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,016
parting message, quote,

155
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,053
"I just wanted to fight
the game's final boss."

156
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:54,154
That's mature.

157
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:56,089
That guy sure is messed up.

158
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:58,058
Then after he barely
managed to get away from

159
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,860
the Gold King, the
Green King dropped

160
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:01,602
completely out of sight.

161
00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:04,104
His clan didn't make a
move till now because the

162
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,172
Lieutenant was still around.

163
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:09,543
But I'm afraid
that the Lieutenant

164
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:12,112
isn't here any longer.

165
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,581
And so that is why I
would like to be the

166
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,217
one who's in command
of this counterattack.

167
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:21,221
I'm certain that I know how
we can defeat Nagare Hisui.

168
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:23,557
The Green King is
unbelievably strong, but

169
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,192
still, he can be defeated.

170
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,094
It's just that it isn't
going to be possible

171
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:30,864
without help
from all of you.

172
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,700
I get what you're saying,
and yet at the same time.

173
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,536
Okay.

174
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:36,737
Anna?!

175
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:39,640
I've made up my mind.

176
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:41,942
Okay, then!

177
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:44,645
Well, I guess I'll have to
take back what I said.

178
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,582
Silver King! I mean, Mr.
Shiro! The Red Clan has

179
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:51,117
decided that we're
going to help you out.

180
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:55,989
Great. Thank you. What
about the Blue Clan?

181
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:58,625
It will depend on the
details of your strategy.

182
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,835
Naturally, of course.
Then let me move on to

183
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,737
discuss that
point right now.

184
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,938
Kuroh?

185
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,106
I'm on it, sir.

186
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,243
The fight against the
Green Clan won't center

187
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,514
on Nagare Hisui, but
rather on these two.

188
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,551
Yukari Mishakuji
and Sukuna Gojo.

189
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,185
Remember these
faces well.

190
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,223
Our first priority will be
to keep these two at bay.

191
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,926
Okay? Now in
order to do that,

192
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,861
what we must do is...

193
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,234
Mr. Shiro? I
think your strategy

194
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,802
makes a lot of sense.

195
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,138
We'll just have
to do our best.

196
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,774
Thank you, Mr. Kusanagi.

197
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,709
I'm counting on you, Anna.

198
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,710
Sure!

199
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,614
By the way, what is your
opinion regarding him?

200
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,952
He never seems to let on
what he's really thinking...

201
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,055
Can we count on him or not?

202
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,125
I don't know. However, we
can't win if we don't have

203
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,603
his help. That's how
strong our opponent is.

204
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,109
Reisi...

205
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:12,012
Besides, since the
Lieutenant passed

206
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,147
away, he's the one
who's been keeping the

207
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,783
Dresden Slate suppressed,
and he's been doing so

208
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,752
all by himself.

209
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:20,654
That's an exhausting
burden to bear.

210
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,958
I don't blame him for
being extra cautious.

211
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,761
That thing needs a king's
strength to control it,

212
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:30,130
otherwise mankind will
evolve without limits.

213
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:33,767
Mr. Munakata has taken
over and continued the

214
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,602
Lieutenant's work.

215
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:40,006
All of us and especially
me, should be very

216
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,208
grateful to him for that.

217
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:50,784
Two Green Clansmen sighted
at the main entrance!

218
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,954
It's Yukari Mishakuji
and Sukuna Gojo!

219
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,889
They're coming in!

220
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:05,138
Surveillance cameras in all
areas have been destroyed!

221
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,341
They're here! Men,
draw your swords!

222
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,987
[chuckle]

223
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:26,259
[humming]

224
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:29,095
Merry Christmas, everyone!

225
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:32,198
We've come to take the
Slate as our special gift!

226
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,200
The only one worth
any points here.

227
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:36,870
Is Seri Awashima,
their number two!

228
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:42,175
Well, It sounds like
things are getting

229
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,677
started out there.

230
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,912
Shiro, believe me, I
have the utmost faith

231
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,948
in your strategy, but
are you absolutely

232
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:49,850
sure about this decision?

233
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,218
Leaving the first floor
to just the Blue Clan?

234
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,955
As I said during the
strategy meeting,

235
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:57,123
the first task in our
counterattack focuses on

236
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,259
the Green King's
two heralds.

237
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,467
We have to hinder their
progress, slow them down as

238
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:04,370
much as possible, if this
plan is going to succeed.

239
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:07,207
Their goal right now
is to weaken us, to

240
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:09,075
reduce our fighting power.

241
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,878
So we're going to do the
opposite and weaken theirs.

242
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:14,981
I've told Ms. Awashima
to withdraw her men when

243
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:16,717
it feels right. Don't worry.

244
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,452
And is what you said during
that meeting true, that the

245
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,388
Green King can only stay
active for a short time?

246
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:25,458
Yes. The Green King
is almost invincible.

247
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:28,494
If he gets serious, I
honestly don't know

248
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:30,463
if even the Blue King,
the Red King, and I

249
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:32,733
together can defeat him.

250
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,401
In fact, he's probably
capable of taking down

251
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:38,438
every person in this
building single‐handedly.

252
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:41,274
However, the good news
is that he can't sustain

253
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,844
that level of power
for very long.

254
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,978
That's good to know...

255
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,246
Meow!

256
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:49,082
Hey, Shiro, isn't this
all just so exciting?

257
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:51,818
What on earth are you
talking about now, Neko?!

258
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:54,454
What do you think, silly?!
I mean, Shiro's here and

259
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:56,456
you're here, too, Kuroh!

260
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:59,159
We're all together again!

261
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:01,367
Working as one
to do our best!

262
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:05,105
And that just makes me
feel so happy inside!

263
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,040
[laughter]

264
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,442
Good grief, Neko! You're
always so unbelievably

265
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,377
optimistic about everything.

266
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,313
[chuckle] Yes, she sure is!

267
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:16,883
We're all in on this, so
I'm sure that it'll be okay.

268
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,819
And Once this is
over, we'll have

269
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:21,121
a grand Christmas
celebration together.

270
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:26,292
Bring it!

271
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:29,295
Finally. You going
to stop running now?

272
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,463
Sukuna!

273
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:31,865
Don't go after her.

274
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,199
Yeah, but...

275
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,068
You know what the plan is.

276
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:38,471
By now the both of us ought
to be heading upstairs.

277
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:40,841
Upstairs! Upstairs!

278
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:44,010
Nagare can only fight for
a limited amount of time,

279
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:48,348
remember? Our job is to
open up a path for him.

280
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:49,382
[disappointed sigh]

281
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:51,885
Yeah, okay, you're right.

282
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:53,587
This isn't the place to
use up our resources.

283
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:55,421
Caw!

284
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,157
Seems you Blues
concocted quite a

285
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:59,025
scheme, but it's useless.

286
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,401
Because I'm the beautiful
flower that blooms in the

287
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,904
rich green known as JUNGLE.

288
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,239
And you are nothing more
than nutrients to provide

289
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,874
sustenance to me.

290
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,876
You only make
me look better.

291
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,445
Yeah, whatever.

292
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:15,582
The new Red King's power
to let us communicate

293
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,918
telepathically is so useful.

294
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,020
With this, we don't have to
worry about the Greens

295
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,955
intercepting our messages.

296
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,424
Yukari Mishakuji and
Sukuna Gojo have

297
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,426
infiltrated the building.

298
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,195
Okay everyone,
let's do this.

299
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,466
I suppose that at this
point, we'll just have to

300
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:34,935
hope that everything
goes according

301
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:38,138
to the plan that Yashiro
Isana has put together.

302
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,040
We're not done yet!

303
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,142
Join the team upstairs
and stop those two

304
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,410
by using a pincer attack!

305
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,880
<i>Cameras have picked</i>
<i>up Mishakuji and Gojo</i>

306
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:47,948
<i>on the tenth floor!</i>

307
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,551
<i>Roger that. As planned,</i>
<i>I'll manually activate</i>

308
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,119
<i>the Mihashira Tower</i>
<i>security measures.</i>

309
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,458
<i>Entrapment 10E. Plus 3,</i>
<i>plus 4, F minus 4.</i>

310
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,293
<i>Deployment confirmed.</i>

311
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,990
And heaven and nature sing!

312
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:04,104
All traps ready.

313
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:07,140
Needle ceilings,
pitfalls, tasers.

314
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:09,242
Just try to
dance past these.

315
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:12,646
[gasp] They cleared
all the traps!

316
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,251
Entrapment 11D minus 3,
minus 4, minus 5. S

317
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:22,122
plus 4, plus 5, Z the
whole nine yards.

318
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:24,925
Entrapment normal
deployment confirmed.

319
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,427
Yukari Mishakuji and
Sukuna Gojo have

320
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,095
finally been separated!

321
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,997
However, it appears
they've only suffered very

322
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,133
minimal damage at best!

323
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,168
Why those damn monsters!

324
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:38,705
Those two are extremely
powerful, so we'll lure them

325
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:43,009
in and separate them. We
Reds'll take on Sukuna Gojo.

326
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,046
And the Silver Clan will
surround Yukari Mishakuji

327
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:47,280
and bring him down.

328
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:50,617
This strategy would be
impossible without Fushimi's

329
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:53,453
complete grasp of this
building's security system

330
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:56,623
and without his flawless
operational set‐up.

331
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:58,625
Isn't that right, Yata?

332
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,627
[scoff] Mr. Kusanagi...

333
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:03,303
Even I have to admit just
how good the guy is when it

334
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,471
comes to stuff like this.

335
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:08,308
Where's that brat
we're in charge of?

336
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,343
Isn't it about
time he showed up?

337
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:13,580
Damn right! That's one
thing I gotta thank Shiro for.

338
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:16,149
That Green bastard's
gonna pay for what he did!

339
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:17,483
[gasps]

340
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,560
What's this?

341
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,162
What in the hell?!
What is that asshole

342
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:30,664
doing here, Monkey?!

343
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:33,166
Those two are
ridiculously strong.

344
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,169
Look, I lured them in
and separated them.

345
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:39,039
If they got switched around,
that's a minor issue!

346
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:42,075
You wanna complain?
Then do this yourself!

347
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,346
So the three clans will put
every resource available

348
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:49,249
toward pinning down
Mishakuji and Gojo and

349
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:52,185
then the Silver,
Red, and Blue Kings

350
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,120
will attack the
Green King together.

351
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,256
I suppose this is the
only strategic option

352
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,691
we have left to us.

353
00:17:58,258 --> 00:17:59,059
Although...

354
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:01,401
Kuroh? What's the matter?

355
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,736
I'm simply disappointed.

356
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:05,606
If only I had been stronger.

357
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:12,445
If only I could at least handle
Yukari Mishakuji on my own.

358
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:14,280
It would make this
battle easier for you.

359
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:16,382
For everyone.

360
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:19,219
Kuroh...

361
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,987
Look, I've heard stories
about your battles,

362
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:22,589
and I know how
they've turned out.

363
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,257
But I don't believe
for a second that you

364
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,660
are inferior to
Yukari Mishakuji.

365
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:29,495
Why do you say that?

366
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,465
I'm only saying that
previously you weren't able

367
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:36,503
to fully access your power
as a Silver Clansman.

368
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,606
Kuroh, the way that
I see it, you display

369
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,808
your true strength when‐‐

370
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:46,312
Hm? Meow!

371
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:48,749
Shiro! Something's
coming closer!

372
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:50,851
Is it Yukari Mishakuji?

373
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:53,419
Neko, if the parrot is
with him, can you take

374
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,855
care of it, please?

375
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:57,791
Yeah! I'll turn him into
roast chicken and then I'll

376
00:18:57,824 --> 00:19:00,366
eat him up for a yummy
Christmas dinner!

377
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:04,705
[gasps]

378
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:09,510
Whoa, it's the Silver King!

379
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:12,546
Of all the places to
meet the final boss!

380
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:15,281
You know, I was getting
really irritated with all

381
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:18,351
those traps, but now
I say, lucky me!

382
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:20,486
Shiro, let's get him!

383
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:22,455
Guess I'll save
Nagare the trouble of

384
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:23,790
having to deal with you!

385
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,127
Plus I'll earn
massive points!

386
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:28,695
Thanks, Silver King!

387
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:30,664
Don't get cocky!

388
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:35,168
I wonder how the
Red Clan is doing...

389
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,303
Hey, Yata, this is bad!

390
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:40,340
Like, very, very,
very, very, very bad!

391
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:41,474
Just shut up and run!

392
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:55,756
Bang!

393
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,604
Really? Is there
no end to all this?

394
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,340
It's obvious that they're
merely trying to stall us.

395
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,675
How ungraceful...

396
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,448
Time to go for
the middle boss!

397
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,495
I feel so light...

398
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,198
Is it because Shiro is near?

399
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,300
Hey! Don't ignore me!

400
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,401
Neko!

401
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,203
I'm on it!

402
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,544
W‐ What is this?!

403
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,884
Damn it!

404
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,319
No fair!

405
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,822
[harrumphing chuckle]
Complain all you want to.

406
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,225
Hey, Shiro's got that
evil look of his!

407
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,867
Now...

408
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:03,737
This is as far as you go.

409
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,672
This'll be the end for
you as a power that's

410
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:07,908
able to fight against us.

411
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:10,711
[growl] The end, my ass!

412
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,681
Well now, those guys are
really putting up a heck of

413
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:15,916
a fight, aren't they?

414
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:18,351
I'd say that we've
cleared maybe seventy

415
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:19,620
percent at best.

416
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:24,357
You think we got here a
little too early, Nagare?

417
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,260
I don't. Not
even a little bit.

418
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:29,630
I'm going to enter the fray.

419
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:30,731
Huh?!

420
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:33,634
Listen, you know there
are three Kings waiting

421
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,401
for you up there, right?

422
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,971
I think you should
wait here 'til Yukari

423
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:40,473
and Sukuna clear
a path for you?

424
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,875
I will not wait.

425
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:44,878
Seriously? So you're not
even going to listen to the

426
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:47,581
person who's been
like a father to you?

427
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:51,718
Yes, that's right. I will do
whatsoever I please to do.

428
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,887
[chuckle] So, you're
turning rebellious

429
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,756
on me, is that it?

430
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,892
All right, fine!
Go if you must.

431
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:00,567
Mr. Iwa, thank you.

432
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,302
I appreciate it.

433
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:06,406
I have to admit that the
alliance of the Silver, Blue

434
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:09,743
and Red kings is
indeed very powerful...

435
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:13,313
However for me, it's easy!

436
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:36,603
Well go and have a
blast then, Green King.

437
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:13,614
Not even the steel prison
can contain the green beast.

438
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:16,550
As the Green King
climbs to the top,

439
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,885
the other kings stand
ready to face him.

440
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:22,989
His wish: A game
with no rules.

441
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,626
Where only the
strongest will reign.

442
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:32,599
Next time on K RETURN OF
KINGS, Episode 7 "Kickdown."

443
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:38,605
However, our feelings
are no game!
