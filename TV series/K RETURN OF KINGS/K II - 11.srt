1
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,764
The Dresden Slate... the
treasure that has given
birth to Kings.

2
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,165
We are now witnessing...

3
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,100
...its true brilliance.

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,103
It's simply... magnificent!

5
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,806
The light that will
revolutionize the world...

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,876
It really is
incredibly beautiful.

7
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:47,180
Hey, Nagare... So does this
mean that this world is
finally gonna start changing

8
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,649
into the new one?

9
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:53,219
No, it's not going to start
changing. The change has
already happened.

10
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,988
What? Already?

11
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,026
<i>The Dresden Slate... is an</i>
<i>apparatus meant to evolve</i>
<i>all of mankind to the level</i>

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,862
<i>of Kings like us.</i>

13
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,640
<i>The Silver King was the one</i>
<i>who initially awakened it...</i>
<i>But then that stubborn Gold</i>

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,977
King went and put a lid on
its capabilities.

15
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:15,148
Which means this whole time
that thing's only been
running on what you'd call

16
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:16,683
"safe mode."

17
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:21,688
But now... there really
isn't anyone left who's able
to suppress the Slate.

18
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:26,927
It's returned to its full
power... And with its
reawakening... comes the

19
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:30,864
<i>opportunity for all of</i>
<i>mankind to evolve into</i>
<i>Kings!</i>

20
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:33,667
An opportunity for all
mankind...

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,769
You mean, outside is...

22
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:37,571
Hmph...

23
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:39,873
Outside's probably total
chaos.

24
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:42,843
Yes. When the masses who
were powerless before at

25
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:45,011
last come into
their powers...

26
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:49,883
...the existing order will
be destroyed and a new world
will be born.

27
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:55,522
<i>A world where one controls</i>
<i>one's own destiny and forges</i>
<i>one's own path.</i>

28
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:59,893
Where one stands a chance
against meeting a senseless
death...

29
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,535
That's correct.

30
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:02,636
Huh?

31
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:05,038
Are you saying... that from
now on, I'm gonna be able to

32
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:08,141
just up and fight Kings
like you, Nagare?

33
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:12,646
That sounds awesome! I can't
wait! The stronger the
opponent, the better it

34
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:15,148
feels when you beat them!

35
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:17,751
The birth of a new world...

36
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,554
...where Kings battle
against Kings.

37
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:23,890
It'll truly be a paradise of
natural selection.

38
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,829
And we're going to be the
flowers that bloom... in
that brave new world!

39
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:31,732
These guys are nuts...

40
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,677
Do you know where we're
going on Saturday yet?

41
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:12,946
Oh, well, I dunno, where
do you wanna go?

42
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:14,948
What's that? Uhh...

43
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,885
<i>It almost looks like that</i>
<i>red light we saw before...</i>

44
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,754
[gasping]

45
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:24,024
This is so weird...Whoa...

46
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:30,396
Oomph...

47
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:32,866
<i>Mish, what's happening?</i>

48
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:38,538
Uh? Mishina? Are you okay?

49
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,044
[panicking]

50
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:45,812
<i>Not good, not good!</i>

51
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:59,826
<i>This is... just like that</i>
<i>time a year ago.</i>

52
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,672
[gasping]

53
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,574
<i>What's going on?</i>

54
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,509
Ahhh!

55
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,145
Kukuri!

56
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,447
Huh?

57
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,650
Thank goodness...

58
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,018
That was too close!

59
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:18,985
<i>Shiro!</i>

60
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,656
Kukuri... We have to ask you
a big favor.

61
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,457
Me? Help you?

62
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,692
That's right.

63
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,094
It's something only
you can do.

64
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,597
Uh‐mm!

65
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,536
This just in. We have the
latest developments
surrounding the most recent

66
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,770
outbreak of people...

67
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,772
...manifesting strange
powers.

68
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,975
Since the start of this
year, there have been
numerous reports of people

69
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,012
suddenly displaying
unnatural powers. But around
noon today, the number of

70
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,515
reports abruptly
skyrocketed.

71
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,485
<i>The government has issued a</i>
<i>state of emergency and is</i>
<i>asking all citizens to</i>

72
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,555
<i>remain indoors.</i>

73
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,724
<i>Similar phenomena are being</i>
<i>reported throughout the</i>
<i>world.</i>

74
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,503
Have we gotten any word
from JUNGLE yet?

75
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:03,904
Nothing yet, sir.

76
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,006
Outrageous! I mean...

77
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,844
...I wasn't told that any of
this would happen! It's
utter chaos out there!

78
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:14,548
At this rate, we'll have a
diplomatic crisis on our
hands!

79
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:17,083
Well yelling at me isn't
going to help!

80
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,752
[gasping]

81
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,186
What was that?

82
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,656
What's going on?

83
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:29,162
<i>What the...?!</i>

84
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,765
I'm able to see right
through the wall!

85
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:32,766
What?

86
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,669
Rioters in the minister's
mansion! [gasping]

87
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:47,213
Uh, you! Call a bodyguard
for me! And get me Captain
Munakata!

88
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:51,885
But Mr. Prime Minister, sir!
You already dismissed him as
captain.

89
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,623
Oh no, that's right!

90
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,124
[panicking]

91
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:02,703
Munakata! I'm so, so sorry!
Please save me!

92
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:10,944
Hey, look... the Prime
Minster has sent an urgent
request for help.

93
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:13,446
So? What should
I do with it?

94
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,918
In the present situation,
the importance of the
existing government's power,

95
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:20,721
honestly, could
not be any smaller.

96
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:24,891
<i>I see no need to help them.</i>
<i>Please... just ignore it.</i>

97
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,627
Gotcha.

98
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:35,769
We've come a long way,
haven't we?

99
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,971
Undoubtedly.

100
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:41,174
In order to evade the Gold
King's endless pursuit...

101
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:46,747
...we had to go into hiding,
away from anyone's prying
eyes, for a long time indeed.

102
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:51,752
Oh, yeah. I gotta say, you
definitely scared the hell
out of me with that one.

103
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:55,188
I mean, trying to pick a
fight with the invincible
Gold King?

104
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,592
And the fact that you got
your ass kicked didn't help!

105
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:03,604
An innocent boy got into a
little mischief, and he
became so upset about it.

106
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:07,207
Daikaku Kokujoji was quite
immature for an old man...

107
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:12,045
<i>I thought I was going to</i>
<i>die. I regretted what I'd</i>
<i>done.</i>

108
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:16,650
Oh, well... it's over. All
that is long in the past.

109
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:22,022
The Gold King is dead now.
And the Slate belongs to us
free and clear.

110
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,857
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

111
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,891
Hm?

112
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:30,463
<i>This time, it's the opposite</i>
<i>of a month ago. It's our</i>
<i>turn to protect,</i>

113
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:32,733
<i>and their turn</i>
<i>to attack.</i>

114
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,169
It looks like blue boy
hasn't learned his lesson.

115
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:41,041
<i>Is that why you ordered all</i>
<i>passageways except the</i>
<i>Yomito Gate to be closed?</i>

116
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:42,408
<i>Yes.</i>

117
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:46,012
<i>We've also cleared all</i>
<i>civilians from the Yomito</i>
<i>Gate area, and we've</i>

118
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:48,815
<i>assembled U‐Rank players at</i>
<i>this secret base.</i>

119
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,484
Does that mean...

120
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:54,588
...you're seriously
entertaining the notion that
they're going to be able to

121
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:57,558
infiltrate even here, our
secret base?

122
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:59,159
The possibility...

123
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:04,871
...of them making it here,
to where the Slate and I
reside, is not zero, after all.

124
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,206
However...

125
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,712
As long as I'm connected to
the Slate, I have no time
limit holding me back.

126
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:14,014
My powers are
inexhaustible.

127
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:18,852
And the chance that they can
defeat me when I'm like this
simply does not exist.

128
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:19,886
It's zero.

129
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:25,526
<i>Therefore, there's no need</i>
<i>for two Kings to stand guard</i>
<i>over this place.</i>

130
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,630
<i>So, Mr. Iwa, I'm going</i>
<i>to ask you to welcome</i>
<i>the Blue King.</i>

131
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:30,931
Hm?

132
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:36,036
You're really expecting that
to happen, as well?

133
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:39,706
Everything possible has a
chance of happening.

134
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,044
Since you can tap directly
into the Slate's power, you
can manifest your

135
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:47,648
manipulation ability to its
highest degree now, right?

136
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:50,951
Then I wonder...
could it be...?

137
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:52,485
Hmm.

138
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:56,222
...that you're also able to
manipulate things that
happened in the past?

139
00:09:56,222 --> 00:10:00,534
<i>For example, could you make</i>
<i>my losing ticket at the</i>
<i>horse races turn into a</i>

140
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,702
<i>winning ticket...</i>

141
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,605
Or, you know...

142
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,609
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Iwa.

143
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,011
Just what are you sorry
for...?

144
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:15,015
I'm afraid I can't do
that... Even with my
powers...

145
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,518
<i>Changing the past is</i>
<i>impossible.</i>

146
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,052
[sighing]

147
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,856
Yeah, I figured that it
might be...

148
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,693
I imagine that it would be
too good to be true...

149
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:31,064
I suppose it just means that
honesty and hard work are
still the quickest and most

150
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:35,869
reliable ways to achieve
happiness.

151
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,871
Well, I'm going.

152
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,206
Yes, please be careful.

153
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,943
It does make
sense, I guess...

154
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,880
Changing the past and
redoing it just isn't
your style.

155
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:51,718
<i>Your power is to correct the</i>
<i>present and to change the</i>
<i>future.</i>

156
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:58,725
<i>So use that power, Nagare...</i>
<i>Use it to reshape this giant</i>
<i>toy box called the world...</i>

157
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,667
The way you see fit...

158
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:07,073
<i>Please, please try to stay</i>
<i>calm and act rationally.</i>

159
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:11,077
<i>I know how scary it must</i>
<i>feel to suddenly have these</i>
<i>strange powers...</i>

160
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:14,848
But, still... it's possible
to suppress them!

161
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:19,452
All of you, just try to
remember what happened a
year ago. That time when

162
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,021
this school came under
attack.

163
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:25,759
What we have to do is become
like the man who saved us
back then.

164
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:30,697
These strange powers don't
have to be used only for
destruction!

165
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:35,769
<i>They can also be something</i>
<i>that we can use to protect</i>
<i>ourselves! So please...</i>

166
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:37,971
A year ago...?

167
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:43,677
Yeah, that's right! You
remember? There was that guy
who helped us all out!

168
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:45,779
We can do this!

169
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:46,980
Mm.

170
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:54,955
<i>I'll do my best over here,</i>
<i>Shiro, Kuroh, Neko...</i>

171
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,192
[gasping]

172
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:01,001
[grunting]

173
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:05,859
Everyone...!

174
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,510
Hey! Look.

175
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:13,146
Huh? Yeah, just
as we were told.

176
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:17,651
<i>I still can't believe the</i>
<i>Blue King would show up like</i>
<i>this.</i>

177
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:22,488
I suppose this removes any
doubt that JUNGLE's
headquarters is up ahead.

178
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:25,892
Well, that pillar of light
was glowing for over fifteen

179
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:27,994
minutes and thirty
seconds, after all.

180
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:30,697
It's hard not to draw
attention.

181
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:34,167
There are quite a few of
them. Shall I lead off, sir?

182
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,506
No, that won't be necessary.
Your task today isn't to
clear the path.

183
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:42,075
You're going in yourself,
Captain?

184
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:46,547
Mr. Zenjo, I am no longer
the Captain.

185
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,050
I'm just an ordinary King.

186
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,554
<i>They went through the</i>
<i>blockade tape! Activate</i>
<i>Protocol A!</i>

187
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:56,189
<i>Fire! Just attacking earns</i>
<i>you points!</i>

188
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:59,192
<i>But watch your aim! There's</i>
<i>only two of 'em!</i>

189
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:03,537
<i>Hold your positions,</i>
<i>everyone! All teams ready?</i>
<i>All right! Fire at will!</i>

190
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:06,940
[chuckling]

191
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:14,147
Incidents of superpowers
have skyrocketed!

192
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:18,051
It's like everyone in the
country has turned into a
Strain now!

193
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:21,755
Seems that some situations
are escalating into
violence...

194
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:25,125
It's unconfirmed, but
reports say the Prime
Minister's official

195
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,727
residence was attacked.

196
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,666
Lieutenant, with all this
going on, are we still
supposed to just stand by?

197
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:35,569
As long as we still have
standing orders, there's

198
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:37,971
nothing we can do,
but obey them.

199
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,906
If that's true...

200
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,576
Well, then... what's the
point of us being here?

201
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:43,577
Fuse!

202
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,680
All we can do right now to
help is gather intel.

203
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:50,951
And the Captain? Has there
been any progress in getting
in touch with him?

204
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,152
No...

205
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:53,754
Hm.

206
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,589
<i>Lieutenant, take</i>
<i>a look at this.</i>

207
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:56,923
What is it?

208
00:13:56,957 --> 00:14:00,594
We've been keeping that
pillar of light that
appeared in Yomito under

209
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:02,603
constant video
surveillance...

210
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:04,871
And this is what showed up
on the feed!

211
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:08,609
It's the Captain! And
Mr. Zenjo, too!

212
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:11,011
Against... the
whole Green Clan?

213
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:15,048
They're going into enemy
lines with just the two of
them? That's suicide!

214
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:18,785
The Green Clan... Could one
of them be Mr. Fushimi?

215
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:20,453
Don't be stupid!

216
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:23,890
Why'd he... take just Mr.
Zenjo with him?

217
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:27,794
<i>Captain...</i>

218
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:31,131
I've decided...

219
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,800
As of now, I resign from
SCEPTER 4!

220
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,368
[gasping]

221
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:39,540
<i>As long as I remain with</i>
<i>SCEPTER 4, I'm not allowed</i>
<i>to leave the premises.</i>

222
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:43,877
I also can't involve the
rest of you or force you to
disobey your orders!

223
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,649
I realize this may sound
selfish, but I have now
reached my limit...

224
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:49,716
However...

225
00:14:55,756 --> 00:15:01,067
I still want to remain the
Blue King Reisi Munakata's
right‐hand man.

226
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,904
Even if he's no longer a
public servant...

227
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,840
...I want to continue to
serve him...

228
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,075
...and do what must be done.

229
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,678
That is my duty!

230
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,848
Lieutenant...

231
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:20,687
Sorry, Akiyama. As of this
moment, you're the one who's
in charge of SCEPTER 4.

232
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,589
I'm leaving now.

233
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,559
I understand.

234
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:30,697
As you just heard, I am now
in command of SCEPTER 4.

235
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:33,534
So here are my orders as the
acting captain!

236
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,038
We will now proceed to the
headquarters of the Green
Clan JUNGLE, who

237
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,973
masterminded this entire
scheme...

238
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,442
...and we'll neutralize the
situation!

239
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:42,917
What?

240
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,338
Hm.

241
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,080
<i>During this operation, the</i>
<i>safety of the citizens is</i>
<i>our top priority.</i>

242
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,049
[smiling]

243
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,052
<i>Do everything in your</i>
<i>power to protect them.</i>

244
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,721
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

245
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:58,725
Stop this! Don't be foolish!
Weren't you listening?

246
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,734
You're disobeying‐

247
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,736
It's no use, Lieutenant...

248
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:04,771
No... Miss Awashima.

249
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:07,774
You're merely an ordinary
citizen now, remember?

250
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:10,611
You're someone that we're
supposed to protect.

251
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:12,412
Here, take it.

252
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:13,914
This is an emergency.

253
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:18,118
By the authority of SCEPTER
4, it's loaned to you for
self‐defense.

254
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,820
Okay, Akiyama?

255
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,987
[gasping]

256
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,157
Yes. As acting captain of
SCEPTER 4, I authorize it.

257
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,160
All of you...

258
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:30,931
[chuckling]

259
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,102
All right. Let's go.

260
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:38,539
SCEPTER 4! Move out, now!

261
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:39,606
Yes, sir!

262
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:41,775
[yelling]

263
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:57,724
Oh, crap! Move out!

264
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:03,069
<i>Your moves are starting to</i>
<i>get old. This plasma bullet</i>
<i>packs the same amount of</i>

265
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,205
power as the Lightning Bolt
Jutsu.

266
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:08,509
This ought to take down even
the Blue King!

267
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,881
[grunting]

268
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,818
[grunting]

269
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:20,654
My apologies for intruding
like that, sir.

270
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:24,424
If you'd done nothing, it
might have saved you some
trouble down the road.

271
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,728
Hmph.

272
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,929
Surely, you jest.

273
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,496
Shit, it didn't work!

274
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:34,434
The gate can still only be
opened from the inside,
though! Even the Blue King

275
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,169
can't get through it alone!

276
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,843
Now, we wait...

277
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:56,189
<i>Hello, Saruhiko. You sure</i>
<i>work fast.</i>

278
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,024
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

279
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:07,874
I already know what you're
up to. You intend to invite
the Blue King inside.

280
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:11,712
Then I guess you'd better
hurry up and kill me before
then.

281
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:16,049
There's no need for that.
And there's no reason to
either.

282
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:21,054
As long as you don't open
the gate... then you won't
be considered a traitor.

283
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:25,726
A J‐Rank has the right to
freely walk around this
secret base of ours.

284
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:29,630
<i>And a duel between clansmen</i>
<i>is also not prohibited.</i>

285
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:35,168
So once I open this gate,
I'll be considered a traitor
and disposed of, is that it?

286
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:39,673
<i>You understand things</i>
<i>quickly, and that saves so</i>
<i>much time. You must know the</i>

287
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,175
Blue King cannot reach this
place.

288
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:45,445
You'll just die
meaninglessly, a dog's
death.

289
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:46,913
Is that a threat?

290
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:49,583
<i>No, an invitation, Saruhiko.</i>

291
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,587
I'm offering you the chance
to truly become one of us.

292
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:57,924
<i>Your personality isn't a</i>
<i>good fit for HOMRA or</i>
<i>SCEPTER 4.</i>

293
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:00,126
<i>We both know you're best</i>
<i>suited to be a member of</i>

294
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,171
<i>JUNGLE. Which celebrates</i>
<i>free will.</i>

295
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:07,774
[sighing]

296
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,442
It's true...

297
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:13,880
If I stay here, I won't have
to deal with idiots, or be
forced to obey a superior's

298
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:16,016
reckless orders anymore.

299
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,018
That's right.

300
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:21,522
Then the choice is an
obvious one.

301
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:23,156
Go to hell.

302
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:24,958
[squawking]
Unfortunate.

303
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:28,161
You're dead! Dead!

304
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:30,296
Hm‐

305
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:34,167
If you're no longer on our
side...

306
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,636
[chuckling]

307
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:38,004
Then I can kill you now,
right?!

308
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:51,518
No way! The gate's opening!
But how can that be?!

309
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,987
Who is in control of
that thing?

310
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:56,590
We gotta get outta here,
man. I don't trust this.

311
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,192
Hey, wait! That's...!

312
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:05,371
Holy cow...! They actually
managed to open the gate!

313
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,709
Nagare's foresight always
amazes me.

314
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,611
[grunting]

315
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:14,047
I don't need assistance. For
now, just stay focused on

316
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:16,717
the task that you've
been assigned.

317
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,718
Right.

318
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,820
Ah! Munakata!

319
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:24,157
And that face the one behind
you, there, certainly brings
back memories!

320
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,461
<i>Goki Zenjo, the right‐hand</i>
<i>man of Jin Habari.</i>

321
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:33,133
So, Gray King Seigo
Ootori... It's been
fourteen years.

322
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:36,136
Wow, you sure have
aged and not well.

323
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,740
And you, King...
have dried up.

324
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,642
That's for sure!

325
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,676
Hm.

326
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:55,421
<i>Bring as many as you want,</i>
<i>none of you will get past</i>
<i>me.</i>

327
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,059
<i>No more holding back, no</i>
<i>more showing mercy...</i>

328
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,867
<i>...and no more stalling.</i>

329
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:02,836
Let's go...

330
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:13,220
What?!

331
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,869
Well, look at that...

332
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:39,706
I guess I'm not able to stop
a vessel of such
magnitude...

333
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,543
...when my attention and fog
are directed toward you.

334
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:45,045
<i>That's so unlike</i>
<i>you, Munakata.</i>

335
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:48,715
<i>I mean, volunteering</i>
<i>to act as decoy.</i>

336
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:53,887
<i>There seems to be some kind</i>
<i>of misunderstanding. That</i>
<i>had nothing to do with me.</i>

337
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,056
I am still your main
opponent.

338
00:21:56,623 --> 00:21:59,092
Well, not that it matters, I
guess...

339
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:03,637
My role right now is simply
to welcome you!

340
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:34,134
Munakata...

341
00:22:34,935 --> 00:22:36,770
...ready!

342
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:13,947
<i>We clash because we cannot</i>
<i>yield. And We must fight to</i>
<i>protect.</i>

343
00:24:13,947 --> 00:24:19,620
<i>Next time on K RETURN OF</i>
<i>KINGS, episode 12, "Knuckle</i>
<i>bump."</i>

344
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,323
<i>Two former kids must face</i>
<i>the most powerful kid...</i>
