Nagare Hisui, the Slate
isn't something essential to
humanity.

That's more than enough.

That is what I believe.

99
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:20,587
That's my answer as the
Silver King.

discouraged! Nagare!

102
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:32,599
All right... Well then, let
me ask you this question...

103
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,368
Why did you come here,
Silver King?

104
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,503
Caw!

105
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:40,741
I came to destroy the Slate.

106
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:45,078
How will you do that? You
already know the Slate's
indestructible.

107
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:47,781
Besides, I won't let you lay
a finger on it.

108
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:54,420
Right now, I'm directly
connected to the Slate and
can extract inexhaustible

109
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:56,456
power from it.

110
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:58,759
If I choose to...

111
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:02,636
I could even overwrite the
eternal power that you
possess...

112
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:08,374
Or to put it more simply,
Silver King... what that
actually means...

113
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,812
..is that I can kill you.

114

Kill me.

So you can hurry along to
your king...

Hmm?

In fields and mountains,

we're Ichigen's seeds.

It seems... that that boy
has finally come into his
own.

Now, then...the least I can
do...is go pick up a fellow

180
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,516
Have you gone mad?! You know
a Damocles Down will...

181
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,555
I'll concentrate the
Damocles Down's enormous
energy into a single point.

182
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:57,591
<i>The Secondary Methodology of</i>

<i>Hammer Effect.</i>

184

<i>the Damocles Down.</i>

186
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:10,911
In other words, what that
means is that under the
right conditions...

187
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:14,147
...the Slate and the Sword
of Damocles will only

ten seconds for the sword to

fall this far.
