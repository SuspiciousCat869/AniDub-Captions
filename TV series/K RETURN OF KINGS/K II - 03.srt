1
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,131
And after that, Homra
had little choice but

2
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,100
to respond just the way
that I wanted them to!

3
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,203
Not to mention I got the
Blues to come out, too!

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,206
Seriously, the more clans
that get involved, the more

5
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,308
fun the game becomes.

6
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,844
Pretty...

7
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,980
Getting Homra to cause
trouble will indeed force

8
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,215
Scepter 4 to dispatch
more of their personnel

9
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,217
to quell the situation.

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,655
I guess getting the Reds
involved wasn't such

11
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,723
a bad idea after all.

12
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,959
But your choice to
exploit the deceased

13
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,994
was quite unattractive.

14
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,837
I don't really care about
your aesthetics, Yukari.

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,573
Besides, I got a closer
look at the Red and Blue's

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,141
Swords of Damocles.

17
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:11,645
The Blue Sword's crack is
even worse than before.

18
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:13,647
It keeps getting
bigger and bigger.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,382
That's good to know.
And by the way, how

20
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,351
was my dear Kuroh?

21
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:21,087
Huh? Kuroh Yatogami?

22
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:24,190
He didn't look as strong as
you said. Listen, Yukari, is

23
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,226
he seriously your
kid brother?

24
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,762
He's not actually
my real brother.

25
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:31,197
I just call him that since
we spent so much time

26
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:34,400
together as pupils of our
master, Ichigen Miwa.

27
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,837
Yukari! Senior pupil!

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,239
All right, that's
enough small talk.

29
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:42,275
Did you buy the detergent
that I asked you to get?

30
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:45,345
Stop asking me to run
your stupid errands.

31
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:48,615
It's ridiculous! I'm
busy too, you know.

32
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:51,184
And yeah, I did get it!

33
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:54,921
Hey! What the hell?!
I asked you for the

34
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,790
one with softener!

35
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,626
What the hell? What
the hell? What the hell?

36
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,735
Oh, just shut up,
you damned bird!

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,871
What does it matter?!

38
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:07,040
Anyway, when do we get to
try something different for

39
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:08,809
a change around here?

40
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,144
I'm getting really tired of
just giving out missions to

41
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,979
low‐ranking members.

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,316
Yes, we truly are
missing a certain spark.

43
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:20,320
It's very frustrating that
the Silver King continues

44
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:22,288
to remain absent.

45
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,990
Are we even sure
the Silver King is

46
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:26,059
actually still alive?

47
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:28,328
Then again, we're talking
about a guy who hid up in

48
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:30,764
the sky for seventy years.

49
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:33,133
So, I guess hiding
is his specialty.

50
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,102
He could also suddenly
reemerge like his

51
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:38,104
descent a year ago.

52
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:39,806
His second coming.

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,841
Huh?

54
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:46,312
I wish to meet the Silver
King. The first King to

55
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:49,015
uncover the mystery
of the Dresden Slate.

56
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,919
You mean the Eternal King?

57
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:55,789
As the ever‐changing King,
you'd have almost zero

58
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,423
chemistry with him.

59
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:59,492
He could just end
up being our biggest

60
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:01,301
obstacle, Nagare.

61
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:04,270
[scoff] I'd save my breath
if I were you. 'Cause after

62
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:07,340
he makes up his
mind, he never listens.

63
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:11,712
Well, you can go ahead and do
whatever you want, Nagare.

64
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:13,847
I am only interested in
seeing what type of new

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,882
world you're going
to create and whether

66
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:18,451
that world will be
beautiful or not.

67
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:20,320
Well, I'm up for anything!

68
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:22,989
Whatever game
Nagare comes up with!

69
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:23,990
[chuckle]

70
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:26,326
After all, that's what
we're here for, right?

71
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,729
We're your
players, Nagare.

72
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,797
Jungle, the Green Clan!

73
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,241
Why are you so obsessed with
the Silver King's clansmen?

74
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,243
Do they worry you?

75
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,079
Yes, I am concerned
about them.

76
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,317
The Silver Clansmen have
been associating with Blue

77
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,855
King, Reisi Munakata and
with Red King, Anna Kushina.

78
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,526
That is undoubtedly
something to be

79
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,927
concerned about.

80
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,030
So you think the Silver
King is pulling the strings

81
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,265
from behind the scenes,
and that's why those two

82
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,968
are in contact with the
Reds and the Blues?

83
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,137
A flower bud is pretty.

84
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:42,375
But a bud that falls before
it is able to bloom is even

85
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,210
more beautiful than that.

86
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:50,951
Caw! Nip the bud!
Nip the bud! Caw! Caw!

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,223
That's the plan, isn't
it, Mr. Iwa, Nagare?

88
00:05:57,558 --> 00:06:00,400
[chuckle] What are you
babbling about now?

89
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:02,536
You're correct, Yukari.

90
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:06,406
Whatever the possibilities
may be, once the bud is

91
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:09,510
nipped, it ends as just
that, a possibility.

92
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:12,145
Yukari, I have a mission.

93
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,648
Please eliminate the
two Silver Clansmen

94
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:15,716
from our game.

95
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:22,322
[chuckle] I didn't think I'd
be able to pick up from

96
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:24,558
where we left off so soon.

97
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,359
Perhaps this is fate too.

98
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,196
Caw! Fate! Caw caw!

99
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:33,166
If we're gonna get
rid of Kuroh Yatogami,

100
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,367
then I'm coming too.

101
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:37,270
Yukari and I have a
difference of opinion

102
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,673
about whether Kuroh's
strong or not.

103
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:42,375
And this way we'll
know in black and white!

104
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,678
[chuckle] "Black and white?"
Is that a pun on the Black

105
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:46,346
Dog's nickname?

106
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,348
You know what? You're
actually pretty funny

107
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,450
for a kid, Sukuna.

108
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,418
And you know what? I
really hate it when you

109
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:54,621
say stuff like that.

110
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,123
[laughter] Black and white...

111
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,967
Well, shall we go and nip
the bud now, Sukuna?

112
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,202
Sure!

113
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,470
I forgot one thing, Yukari.

114
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,275
It is acceptable if you
kill Kuroh Yatogami.

115
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,978
But make sure that
you bring Miyabi Ameno

116
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,214
back here alive.

117
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:17,450
Very well, but
may I ask why?

118
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:21,722
Because she and I both
share something similar.

119
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:28,494
Similar? I see...
Understood, milord.

120
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:38,338
It seems unlike you,
Nagare, to rush into things

121
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,607
as quickly as you're
doing right now?

122
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:44,277
You're right, Mr. Iwa. I
am in a rush. I am also

123
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,513
running out of patience.

124
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:50,784
If the Silver King, the
First King, Adolf K.

125
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:54,120
Weismann, has any
intention of continuing

126
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,523
the game, then he
will not allow his own

127
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,525
subjects to die.

128
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:03,369
Will he run away again?
Or will he stay this time?

129
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:07,040
At long last, we will
finally know the answer.

130
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,710
[chuckle] I can not wait!

131
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:11,712
Move onward!

132
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:12,513
Time for battle!

133
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:13,379
Just a moment...

134
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:16,482
Shiro, we're both
doing fine, don't worry.

135
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:20,654
Hey, stop that!
It's disrespectful!

136
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:23,289
Yeah, but Kuroh,
I want Shiro to be

137
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,225
able to eat, as well!

138
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,161
All right, fine, if you
must but listen, please

139
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:30,564
just eat your own
meal first, all right?

140
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:31,798
Sheesh...

141
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,702
Thank you for the food!

142
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:39,239
Not bad.

143
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:41,808
Mm, not bad.

144
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:45,411
By the way Neko, this room
is becoming pretty crowded

145
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:47,347
with all of our stuff.

146
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,752
Yeah, every time we go out
looking for Shiro we somehow

147
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:55,488
end up bringing stuff back
that reminds us of him.

148
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:57,858
Well, we are using this
place as our base of

149
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:00,326
operations while
we look for him.

150
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,269
I wonder where could
Shiro possibly be that we

151
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,672
have not been able
to locate him yet?

152
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:07,173
I don't have a clue.

153
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:09,776
But maybe he's not
actually as far away

154
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,444
as we think he is.

155
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:14,915
What makes you think that?

156
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:17,250
I just do! [giggle]

157
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,352
So there's no
logical reason...

158
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:24,390
I suppose that's what it
means to have faith in

159
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:27,127
something and believe
in it with all your heart.

160
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,531
Hey, man. What's up?

161
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:35,235
[sigh] Well, it's done. I
kicked every damned one of

162
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:36,737
the Greens outta Shizume.

163
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,640
Those dicks! Man,
they're just like a

164
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,474
bunch of green cockroaches!

165
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,476
No one can rid of them
all. It's impossible

166
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,746
even for you, Yata.

167
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,615
The fact that we can't tell
them apart from other people

168
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,751
is what makes the
Greens so tricky.

169
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:53,453
Yeah! I know that!

170
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:56,557
I was talking about the
troublemakers who snuck in.

171
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,325
Anyway, what's
going on with you?

172
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:00,601
[chuckle]

173
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,104
Mr. Kusanagi, that's!

174
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,607
They say, "If you know your
enemy and yourself, you

175
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,510
need not fear the outcome
of a hundred battles."

176
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,446
Anyway, I was curious about
how exactly Jungle operates.

177
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,217
So I did some spying
with a disposable PDA.

178
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,286
Here, take a look. You see
what popped up when I did?

179
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,590
What the hell? That's me!

180
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,459
Sure is. This means
that the Greens put a

181
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,261
bounty on your head.

182
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,631
If one of them is able
to get you, then they

183
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,298
earn bonus points.

184
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,201
And by increasing their
point total, they move up in

185
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,438
the Clan's ranks.
That's how it all works.

186
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,906
I see...

187
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,309
So they'd get
rewarded for me, huh?

188
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,613
Huh, I guess that just goes
to show you exactly how

189
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,482
scared they all are of
Mr. Yatagarasu, here.

190
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,252
What? Are you kidding?!

191
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,821
How come Monkey is
worth more than I am?!

192
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,456
[growling]

193
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,592
Well, you're about even
in fighting ability, but

194
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,502
Fushimi's also good with
information and technology.

195
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,638
Maybe the Greens
consider that to be more

196
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:05,772
of a threat to them?

197
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:10,977
Hey, Anna.
Where're you going?

198
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,680
Neko left something when
she came by yesterday.

199
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,617
She forgot something here?

200
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,653
That figures, the girl
is such a scatterbrain.

201
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:21,755
Well I have to go give this
back to her. I'm guessing

202
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:23,790
that she probably needs it.

203
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:25,526
Give it here.

204
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:30,330
I can take it to her for you.

205
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:31,598
But, um...

206
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,867
You're a King, and a King
shouldn't be out running

207
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,669
errands all by themselves.

208
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:37,270
Misaki...

209
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,873
I mean, you may be
the Red King now, but

210
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,708
you aren't Mr. Mikoto.

211
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:43,810
Don't you remember?

212
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,512
I said I wanted to
be someone that

213
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:46,847
you can rely on.

214
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:48,782
That's right, you did.

215
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:53,720
All right, can you go to
school island and return

216
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,556
this to her for me?

217
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:57,357
[gasp]

218
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,634
I dunno, Yata, you sure you
wanna be walking around with

219
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,669
that? You might arrested.

220
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,738
That crazy ass chick!

221
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:07,240
How the hell does someone
even forget something like

222
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:08,742
this in the first place?!

223
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:12,546
Seriously? When did
she even take them off?

224
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,519
Oh, sorry about that!

225
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:22,422
[chatter]

226
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,227
Huh? Come on, why not?!

227
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,062
I want to fight him, too!

228
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,732
I told you, Kuroh
was my junior when

229
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,567
we were both pupils.

230
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,069
And that means that
killing him is my duty

231
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,672
alone and my destiny.

232
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:41,608
If anyone interferes with
that, I'll show them no

233
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:44,110
mercy, not even you, Sukuna.

234
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,847
If you want the points,
I'm willing to give them

235
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,782
to you after I'm done.

236
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:52,786
Just don't get in my way.

237
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:55,556
Where's the fun in
getting free points without

238
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:57,724
having to do anything?

239
00:12:57,724 --> 00:12:59,560
That isn't how games
work, you know.

240
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:07,240
All right, Yukari! I'll let
you have that one!

241
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:11,244
Hm? Where are you going?

242
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:14,280
Sorry, something urgent
just came up. So go ahead

243
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:16,817
and take care of Kuroh
Yatogami, will you?

244
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:18,318
See you later!

245
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:22,388
I really must say kids
have such short attention

246
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:23,790
spans these days.

247
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:25,425
Here you go, Mr. J‐Rank.

248
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,259
Cool!

249
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,661
You've earned 5
Jungle points.

250
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:28,662
Good work!

251
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:29,596
Thanks.

252
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:37,804
Damn it!

253
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:41,274
Where the hell could that
Neko girl be now, anyway?

254
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:44,110
If I'm caught red‐handed
with this thing, I'll kill

255
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:45,579
myself out of shame!

256
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:50,483
[sigh]

257
00:13:58,491 --> 00:13:59,459
Monkey...

258
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:03,804
Misaki...

259
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:08,642
And what exactly is Homra
doing in a place like this?

260
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:11,311
Are you trying to
occupy the island again?

261
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:13,313
What's that?! Never
mind, it's none of your

262
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,281
damned business!

263
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:19,319
Look, I never
really got around to

264
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,787
thanking you, did I?

265
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:22,155
Huh?

266
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,792
I'm talking about the time
the Green Clan kidnapped

267
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:28,228
Anna, before she had
completely awakened

268
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:29,830
as the new Red King.

269
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:33,567
If you hadn't tipped us off
to where she was, there's no

270
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:36,670
way I would've ever been
able to rescue her in time.

271
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,539
Shit, I don't even know
if I would've been able

272
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:40,406
to find her on my own.

273
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:41,808
Okay, and?

274
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:43,343
Huh?

275
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:46,547
All right, listen. I don't
like you, Monkey, and it's

276
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,483
not like I've forgiven you
or anything, but still.

277
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:53,486
I'm grateful to you.

278
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:55,488
So thank‐‐ huh?!

279
00:14:57,691 --> 00:14:59,560
Hey! What the hell, man?!

280
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,369
[chuckle] Darn, there goes
my chance to back‐attack.

281
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,838
Huh?

282
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,206
[gasp]

283
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,241
Who the hell are you?!

284
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:10,844
[chuckle]

285
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,780
If you're just going to keep
rambling on like that, at

286
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,517
least pay some attention
to your surroundings.

287
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:17,884
[growl]

288
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,386
You're Jungle's
top‐ranked player Sukuna

289
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,722
Gojo, aren't you?

290
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,559
Oh! So you know
who I am, do you?

291
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,394
[laughter] Well, I guess
it's no wonder that you're

292
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,863
worth more points
than beanie

293
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,464
cap boy over there.

294
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,266
Say that again,
you asshole!

295
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,902
Bringing you two down is
worth seven thousand points.

296
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,738
Now that's a
sweet mission!

297
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,941
So listen up, do me a
favor and turn into my

298
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,276
points now, all right?

299
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,650
[giggle] Kuroh, I've
been looking for you!

300
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,419
Yes, Kukuri? What
is it you need?

301
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,257
Well, actually I'm not the
one who needs something.

302
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,925
But I've brought someone
with me who would really

303
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,667
like to talk to you.

304
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:03,904
Hey! Come on out!

305
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:07,641
What are you doing? Hurry
up! Come over here, already!

306
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,342
[giggle]

307
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,611
Come on!

308
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:13,446
Now, don't be shy!
Just tell him!

309
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:18,919
Um, Mr. Kuroh Yatogami?
Please accept this!

310
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:21,822
It's for me?

311
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:22,989
[affirmative grunt]

312
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:24,758
[giggle]

313
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:27,994
E‐Excuse me!

314
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,997
Mission complete.
10 Jungle points.

315
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,633
Yes! I got points!

316
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:35,636
I can't stand it! I wonder
what it says inside?

317
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:37,504
Let's open it and find out!

318
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,039
Uh, okay...

319
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,477
Oh, look at that! I
didn't know that girl's

320
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:45,979
name was Yukari!

321
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,481
What neat handwriting!
I wonder if she comes

322
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:50,617
from a rich family?

323
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:54,988
So you've finally made your
move, Yukari Mishakuji.

324
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,803
Well, she's super cute.
I say you go for it.

325
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:04,404
Thank you.

326
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:05,906
Wish me luck, Kukuri.

327
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:07,007
You got this!

328
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:23,089
Caw! Caw! Caw!

329
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:28,762
It's been a while, huh?

330
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:32,065
I'm so glad to see you
again, my dear Kuroh.

331
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,036
Yukari Mishakuji. What
is it you want from me?!

332
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,739
I thought I already
told you that you should

333
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:41,374
call me your dear brother.

334
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,611
Furthermore, it's quite
unattractive to ask

335
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:47,380
questions you already
know the answer to.

336
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:55,722
So you're here to settle
things, is that it?

337
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:59,059
Wasting my time to give
you an obvious answer

338
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:02,035
is also unattractive!

339
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:09,409
[fighting grunts]

340
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:15,649
As I suspected, you're still
sorely lacking in skill.

341
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:17,784
Although, I do have to
commend you for not

342
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,586
simply running away.

343
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:23,824
Right here, this entire
school island is the place

344
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,727
my king, Shiro, calls home!

345
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,596
And that is why I
cannot allow your kind to

346
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,732
ever set foot here!

347
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:33,166
That's too bad.

348
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,670
Because my comrade went
inside there just now.

349
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:41,474
Don't you dare bully
Kuroh! [power yell]

350
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,112
[chuckle]

351
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:52,452
[screaming]

352
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:54,621
Neko!

353
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:56,022
Don't worry.

354
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,959
My King asked that you be
brought back to his presence

355
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:02,669
unharmed, Neko. Or
should I perhaps...

356
00:19:02,703 --> 00:19:04,971
Say, "Miyabi Ameno."

357
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:06,640
What? "Ameno"?

358
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,174
Who's that?

359
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:11,978
You don't remember? Oh,
well. It doesn't matter.

360
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,280
Yukari Mishakuji!

361
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:16,783
Don't you dare lay
a hand on my friend!

362
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,185
[chuckling]

363
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:24,991
[fighting grunts]

364
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,628
You're as righteous
as ever, Kuroh.

365
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:29,696
It's beautiful, in a way.

366
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:32,132
But even righteousness
has its limits.

367
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,968
Enough! Just stop
talking nonsense!

368
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,147
For example, the ones who
let Sukuna inside the school

369
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,716
grounds were the
students themselves.

370
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,053
They know nothing about
your thoughts, or anger,

371
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:55,055
or sense of purpose.

372
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:58,091
Yet knowing nothing, they
welcomed the Greens.

373
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,935
This place that you're so
intent on protecting from us

374
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,637
already belongs to us!

375
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:07,473
[fighting grunts]

376
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,112
[chuckle]

377
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,882
Jungle can set down roots
and collect nourishment

378
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,117
from anywhere.

379
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,821
The giant tree of the
Greens will spread its

380
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:24,691
branches across the stars
and eventually engulf the

381
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,828
golden sun and
the silvery moon.

382
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:32,165
Then this world will be
enveloped in beautiful green

383
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:33,834
and will be born anew.

384
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,003
And that is something
I want to see.

385
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,509
But you will not be able
to see that come to be.

386
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,811
You will remain
an unblossomed

387
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,680
bud and die here.

388
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,884
Do your worst, but I'll
never yield to you people!

389
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,754
Shiro, what should I do?

390
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:56,657
At this rate, Kuroh
is going to be killed!

391
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,040
[chuckle] So You're
prepared to die, are you?

392
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:10,677
That look on your face
right now is beautiful.

393
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:12,212
Kuroh Yatogami...

394
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:14,748
Your life is now mine!

395
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:16,082
Shiro!

396
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:18,084
Please, Shiro!
Come and save us!

397
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,854
Shiro!

398
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:32,065
[gasp]

399
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:47,981
You! You're the‐‐!

400
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:51,985
[chuckle]

401
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:53,086
Shiro!

402
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:54,721
Shiro...

403
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:57,591
You come here,
invading a person's home.

404
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,166
And even worse, you
also try to hurt his family.

405
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:03,136
That's the height
of arrogance.

406
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:06,673
Green King, Nagare Hisui!

407
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:13,013
Finally, at long
last, you're here.

408
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,148
You've finally returned!

409
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:18,118
The First King,
the Silver King.

410
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:20,821
Adolf K. Weismann.

411
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:23,089
At last you've returned.

412
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:25,692
You've decided to
rejoin this world

413
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,028
and to be a player
in our game again.

414
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:31,932
[chuckling]

415
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:36,369
Welcome back...

416

<i>The man who</i>
