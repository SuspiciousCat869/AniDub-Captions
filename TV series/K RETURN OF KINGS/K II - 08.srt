1
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,925
My god! What have
you done, Kagutsu?

2
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,877
Is there anyone out there
who's still alive?! Anyone?!

3
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,246
Is someone there?!

4
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:16,216
Is there anyone at all?

5
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,728
Please someone
answer me!

6
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:32,733
[gasp]

7
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,252
HWake up! You okay?!

8
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:58,458
I'm too late. He
was just a kid!

9
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:02,468
All of this, is this
really the end result of

10
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:04,104
pursuing my ideals?

11
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:10,276
What use is a king's power
if I can't save one child?!

12
00:03:38,371 --> 00:03:40,173
What do you make of
this, Mr. Fushimi?

13
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:43,143
How can there be another
Sword of Damocles?

14
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:47,180
I thought there were only
four Kings right now.

15
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:51,552
This is big trouble.

16
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:56,857
What color is
that Sword anyway?

17
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:00,501
Well, it isn't gold
and it isn't colorless.

18
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:04,505
There's only one other
color left. Although I didn't

19
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:07,574
think that it was possible.

20
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,176
[gasp] The Green
King's sword is fading!

21
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,046
The Fifth King's Weismann
level is dropping rapidly!

22
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:23,857
[growl]

23
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:27,528
[gasp]

24
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,597
Fourteen years ago, a
King's death triggered

25
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,366
the worst destruction
in human history,

26
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,868
the Kagutsu Incident.

27
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,905
And it was believed that
amongst those victims was

28
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:42,543
the Sixth King, the
Gray King Seigo Ootori.

29
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:46,379
But as it turns out,
he did survive and was

30
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,315
also secretly the
Green Clan's mastermind.

31
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,387
I must admit this situation
truly is very surprising.

32
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:56,389
You're wrong, Munakata.

33
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:59,392
The man that you call
Seigo Ootori did

34
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:01,234
indeed die that day.

35
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,404
And the guy you're looking
at now is Tenkei Iwafune,

36
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,407
the surrogate father of the
Green King, Nagare Hisui,

37
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,677
and someone who's basically
freeloading off JUNGLE.

38
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,179
I'm a chicken
that can't fly.

39
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,982
So stop making such
a big deal over me.

40
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,584
I'm a simple old man.

41
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,587
[harrumphing chuckle] The
Fog Sanctum is a power that

42
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,923
provides absolute protection.

43
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,659
After demonstrating that
you possess such power,

44
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,360
you still have the
audacity to call

45
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,096
yourself a
simple old man?

46
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,133
[gasp]

47
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,637
I win, Reisi Munakata.

48
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,339
[gasp]

49
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,378
Meow?!

50
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,614
Everything is starting
to get all hazy.

51
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,215
What's this?!

52
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,617
No!

53
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,152
Stop him!

54
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,971
Anna! Look out!

55
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:11,578
[grunting]

56
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,518
[gasp]

57
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:21,421
Shiro! Shiro!

58
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:22,422
Shiro!

59
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:26,593
Kuroh! Take care of Neko!
Get away from here now!

60
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:32,999
Shiro?! Shiro!

61
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:36,603
Mr. Munakata...

62
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,171
[determined yell]

63
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,293
C'mon, now, get it together.

64
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,035
What were you
even aiming at?

65
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:08,374
Taking cheap shots to win?
I suppose it's fitting

66
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:11,578
for a cowardly man like
you, who changed his name

67
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:14,080
and went into hiding
after losing his clan!

68
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:15,716
Call me whatever you like.

69
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,151
It doesn't bother me
one bit. I stopped caring

70
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:20,086
about my pride years ago.

71
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:23,557
The Gray Clan, also
called Cathedral.

72
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:27,127
It was a powerful clan whose
influence, in its heyday,

73
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,063
was second only to the
Gold Clan, Tokijukuin.

74
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:33,266
And the person who
led Cathedral was the

75
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,269
Gray King, Seigo Ootori.

76
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:38,739
He was said to be a
man of great virtue and

77
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:42,442
strength, widely respected
not just by his clansmen

78
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:44,578
but also by the
general public.

79
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:47,748
[chuckle] You're giving the
guy way too much credit.

80
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:57,257
Fourteen years ago, he led
his clansmen to try to

81
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,366
prevent Red King Genji
Kagutsu's Damocles Down.

82
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:04,270
But he failed to stop
Kagutsu. And as a result,

83
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,439
he lost all his clansmen.

84
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:11,377
That tragedy claimed
over seven hundred

85
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:14,615
thousand lives, including
innocent civilians.

86
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:17,518
So he decided to leave
behind his old self,

87
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:19,853
abandoning his past and
the memories of the people

88
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:22,689
that he'd failed to
save, isn't that right?!

89
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,461
Eh, who really knows?
It's all ancient

90
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,863
history now anyway.

91
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:34,400
Then tell me why, after all
this time, you've decided to

92
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:37,871
conspire with Nagare Hisui
and come out in the open!

93
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:40,707
If the world that
Nagare Hisui proposes

94
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:43,744
becomes a reality, society
will fall into chaos

95
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,380
and it's certain millions
of lives will be lost.

96
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:50,316
I can't believe that
endorsing such barbarism

97
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,485
is in line with your past
efforts to save all of

98
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,922
those people and
create the ideal paradise.

99
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,158
Did the Kagutsu
Incident truly force

100
00:08:58,191 --> 00:08:59,660
you to fall this far?

101
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:05,839
Ideal paradise, you say?

102
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:07,908
A King doesn't
have the power to

103
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,543
create such a thing.

104
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,346
All of us are being played
by this goddamn Slate, and I

105
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,782
mean all of us, including
both you and me.

106
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,684
But it's different for him.

107
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:21,221
He intends to play
the Slate instead.

108
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:39,272
[gasp] Anna? You all right?

109
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:40,541
You're shivering!

110
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:44,545
This fog is so cold. I can
feel the weight of all his

111
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,312
despair pressing down.

112
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:48,782
The Gray King, Seigo Ootori.

113
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,386
The Lieutenant described
him as a pacifist who

114
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:55,989
detested conflict, but
when he was forced to

115
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:59,492
fight, he displayed strength
that rivaled even then Blue

116
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,169
King, Jin Habari and Red
King, Genji Kagutsu.

117
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,438
This is bad...
[gasp]

118
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,678
Oh, no! The Slate!

119
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,348
Hundreds of thousands
of people lost their

120
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,383
lives that day all
because they were

121
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,686
helpless, and didn't
know what to do.

122
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,290
If everyone has their
own power, at least

123
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,627
they won't have to
confront death helplessly.

124
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,530
They'll have the choice to
fight back on their own.

125
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,533
And that is the kind of
world that Nagare is trying

126
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,568
to create with this plan.

127
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,869
Nonsense!

128
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,872
Suddenly giving people
undeserved power will only

129
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,307
make them flaunt it. They'll
end up killing each other

130
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,545
and turning this into
a depraved world!

131
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:48,982
Society needs order as well
as leaders to oversee it all.

132
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,385
A world where there is order
and reason is the ideal

133
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,887
world, a beautiful world!

134
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,724
[chuckle] Oh, you and
your lofty ideals.

135
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,927
I guess that's the reason
why you're the Blue King.

136
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,937
You believe in this bullshit
about creating the ideal

137
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,807
world with your
own power, Munakata.

138
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,442
Because you're like a
little kid who's never

139
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,578
experienced true failure.

140
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:13,580
[chuckling]

141
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,283
Or is the Blue King
better than that?!

142
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,621
[screaming]

143
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,324
Whoops...

144
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:25,926
Sorry, time out.

145
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:30,496
Listen kid, you need to
stop being so aggressive.

146
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,699
Here's some advice from an
old man who's been around

147
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,500
the block a few times.

148
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,269
The higher your
ideals, the greater

149
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:38,471
your disappointment
is once you fail.

150
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:40,774
Moderation is everything.

151
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,443
You need to learn how
relax a little bit more.

152
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:46,479
I don't care to engage
in idle talk with you!

153
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,484
Back to playing
hide‐and‐seek, are we?!

154
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:57,323
Well, don't think I'll
make it easy for you.

155
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,527
Don't push yourself. You
look pretty worn out, there.

156
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:04,370
Listen, I really don't enjoy
kicking people when they're

157
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:07,841
down, but I need to
wrap things up here now.

158
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:27,427
[gasp]

159
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,571
Sorry about
that, Munakata!

160
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:06,807
That little game of sword
fighting that I was playing

161
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:09,109
with you was merely a
diversion to buy us the

162
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:11,111
time that we needed
to haul the Dresden

163
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:12,713
Slate out of here.

164
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:17,784
Hey, stop, you lousy thief!
Give that back to us!

165
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,487
They played us
all for fools.

166
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:40,106
Get that monitor
back online! Now!

167
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,009
I need to determine
if the Captain's okay!

168
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:44,678
Yes, sir!

169
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:48,481
I'll dispatch men to the
Chamber of the Slate now!

170
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:54,087
I guess it pays to
have insurance.

171
00:13:57,524 --> 00:14:00,093
Evacuating the injured is
our top priority! Are there

172
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:01,802
any more inside the tower?

173
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,672
It's possible the
interior could collapse.

174
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:08,609
Rescue teams, exercise
extreme caution.

175
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:10,777
Where's that helicopter?

176
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:14,447
I'm afraid that the fog not
only acts as a smokescreen,

177
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,650
but it's also jamming our
radar, making it impossible

178
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,451
to track them right now.

179
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:21,187
I see. Well keep searching
with everything we've got.

180
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:22,956
Yes, ma'am!

181
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,128
Intel team! Analyze
the video footage now!

182
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:29,796
Then report to Fushimi!

183
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:40,807
Shiro, are you okay?

184
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,510
Shiro, what
should we do now?

185
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:47,814
[chuckle]

186
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:50,884
That's a very good question.

187
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,720
Honestly, I'm at a loss
for what to do myself.

188
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,856
I didn't think even for a
moment they'd have

189
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,659
a wild card like that
up their sleeves.

190
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:01,835
I failed everyone.

191
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,705
Stop blaming
yourself, Shiro.

192
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,008
We don't have time for
self‐pity. Because we're

193
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,677
going to take the Slate
back from them, right?

194
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,879
Take it back?

195
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,251
The Lieutenant put his life
on the line for over half a

196
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,254
century to keep the Slate
under control, and after his

197
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,924
death, Mr. Munakata
took up the task.

198
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,593
But now it's just a
matter of time before the

199
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,195
Slate's power is
released to the world.

200
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,798
What'll happen if the
power's released?

201
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,701
Will everyone become
naked or something?

202
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,203
You numbskull! We're
having a serious discussion!

203
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,640
What the heck, Kuroh!

204
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,108
I was just trying
to cheer up Shiro!

205
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,778
Mr. Shiro, we were planning
on heading out now.

206
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,247
Some of our guys need
their injuries treated.

207
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,584
Oh. Yes, of course.
Thanks for your help.

208
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,787
It's not over yet.

209
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:56,923
[sigh]

210
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,159
There has to be
something that we can do.

211
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,902
There's always hope
if we don't give up.

212
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:04,738
Yes, you're right,
Anna. Thank you.

213
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:06,907
There is still hope.

214
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:13,580
Man...

215
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:16,917
We let ourselves get bossed
around by the Silver King,

216
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:19,252
and still wind up
losing after all that?

217
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:22,923
C'mon, San, don't be so hard
on the guy. He did his best.

218
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:26,259
He's right. This is on us,
too. After all we weren't

219
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:28,995
able to stop the Green King.

220
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,264
So what do you think's
gonna happen now?

221
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:34,601
Well, since the Greens
got ahold of the Slate...

222
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,637
Actually, I don't have a
clue. What's supposed to

223
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,605
happen, Yata, do you know?

224
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:46,880
Oh hey, what do you want?

225
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,184
So our Clans form this
overblown alliance and we

226
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:53,353
put on this big show
of working together,

227
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:56,657
only to lose. I mean,
talk about ridiculous.

228
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,325
Shut up, Monkey! Quit
talking shit, will ya?! We

229
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:02,035
all did our best, and
you can't deny that!

230
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,971
So the best you
can do is to lose?

231
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:07,140
You're one to talk! You
just sat in the car and

232
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,875
typed on your keyboard!

233
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,411
Besides, none of this
would've ever happened if

234
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,914
your King had just
beaten the Gray King!

235
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,021
You're absolutely right.

236
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:27,093
He's a complete loser.

237
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,931
Hold up! You're talking
about your King!

238
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:33,399
Aren't you even going to
stand up for the guy?!

239
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,004
Hey...

240
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:41,842
Things are about to
get very interesting.

241
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,712
Try to keep up, if
you can. [chuckle]

242
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,081
Saruhiko?

243
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:57,724
To think the Gray King
was alive all along.

244
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,967
And the fact that he was
working with Hisui was

245
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,769
completely unexpected.

246
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:05,939
Completely unexpected? I
couldn't disagree more.

247
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:07,874
It was a
preventable mistake.

248
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:12,212
You and Yashiro Isana failed
to consider the Gray King.

249
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:13,279
That's the truth.

250
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:16,883
It seems obvious to me who
was really at fault here.

251
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:19,820
You Kings were fixated on
the struggle for the Slate

252
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:22,422
and didn't even notice the
presence of another King

253
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:24,725
right under your noses.

254
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:26,159
[sigh]

255
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:29,295
If you're only here to
berate me about what just

256
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,732
happened, then you
really ought leave.

257
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:33,900
I'm too tired for this now.

258
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,270
Too tired even to lead
us like you should?

259
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:41,307
I'm sure Yashiro Isana will
think of something to do.

260
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:43,276
You should follow
his orders.

261
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:48,982
After all, I was defeated.
I'll stay out of the way.

262
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:53,119
So you're just going to sulk
because you got your ass

263
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:55,488
kicked in a one‐on‐one
fight, is that it?

264
00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:59,459
I bet what you
were thinking

265
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:01,768
is that with the Gold
King finally gone, there

266
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:03,870
wouldn't be anyone
left to stand in

267
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:05,872
your way, so at last
you'd be able to control

268
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:07,774
the world as you saw fit.

269
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:10,143
But unfortunately
another annoying old

270
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:12,278
man was still alive.

271
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:14,180
I'd be pissed,
too, if I were you.

272
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:16,049
[irritated sigh]

273
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:18,785
I can only assume that you
must be pleased with how

274
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,186
all this turned out.

275
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:23,123
After all, you were
against this alliance

276
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,825
from the start.

277
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:27,060
Just tell me the truth!
Are you secretly glad

278
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,829
that our plan failed?

279
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,332
Yeah, just like I'm
glad that you choked

280
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,034
and lost this fight!

281
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,302
Mr. Fushimi, that's too far!

282
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:37,303
[angry snarl]

283
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,074
[considering sigh]

284
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:44,044
If you're just going to give
up and bail on all of us,

285
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:45,812
then I'm going to resign.

286
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,013
Fine.

287
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:49,315
Go on, resign. If you're
harboring any complaints

288
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:51,151
against me, then leave.

289
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:56,356
You should be used to being
a traitor by now, anyway.

290
00:19:57,658 --> 00:19:59,259
[gasp]

291
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:02,435
If you don't like something,
you just quit. Isn't that

292
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,938
the kind of person
you've always been?

293
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,941
That's why you could never
commit yourself to one king.

294
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,377
But you also refused to
remove yourself from the

295
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,947
Slate's influence, so you
just wander around

296
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,449
aimlessly in your
little world.

297
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,451
Pathetic...

298
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:20,987
[growl]

299
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:23,890
[gasps]

300
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,200
Mr. Fushimi!

301
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,369
Captain, should we stop him?

302
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,039
[chuckle]

303
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,874
No, let him go.

304
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,550
Hey there, Seri,
what can I do for you?

305
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,818
You calling to
discuss our next move?

306
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,387
Hm? Fushimi?

307
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:59,259
No, he's not here. I don't
understand. What's going on?

308
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,169
Hey, Yata! Have
you been in contact

309
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:05,371
with Fushimi recently?

310
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:07,574
Saruhiko? Are
you kidding me?

311
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,544
Why, what has he done now?

312
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:14,548
Well, it seems he
walked out of SCEPTER

313
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:17,017
FOUR after getting into an
argument, and hasn't

314
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,585
been heard from since.

315
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:21,522
What?

316
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,928
He and the Captain exchanged
some harsh words... [sigh]

317
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,464
To be honest, our
work is stacking

318
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,033
up here without him.

319
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,902
It seems we relied on
Fushimi's skills more than

320
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,370
we realized we did.

321
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,375
Where can that boy be now?

322
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:46,412
Does he even have
a place to sleep?

323
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:47,447
You should be used to being
a traitor by now, anyway.

324
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:55,689
Fine, then that's
just what I'll become!

325
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:12,078
The giant Green tree
blooms in full, while a

326
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:14,648
shard of Blue breaks away.

327
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:19,586
Next time on K RETURN OF
KINGS, Episode 9 "Kid's room."

328
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,423
Twisted hearts are lost
and wander aimlessly.
