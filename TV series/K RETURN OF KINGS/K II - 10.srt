1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,525
See this?

2
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:12,612
It's the Slate that we stole from your
previous King after he was defeated.

3
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,517
Yeah? So? I don't really
care.

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,951
[gasping]

5
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,020
Yeah, well, you'd better
care!

6
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:23,590
<i>Now that you've reached</i>
<i>J‐Rank, you aren't just</i>
<i>another player... you're</i>

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,359
<i>also an administrator of the</i>
<i>game.</i>

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,094
<i>But don't let it go to your</i>
<i>head.</i>

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,596
Hm?

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,133
Just because you beat my
record for reaching J‐Rank
in the shortest time doesn't

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:33,667
mean that you‐

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,368
Oh, I get it.

13
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,970
Huh?!

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,642
You're sulking 'cause I beat
your score. This is why I
hate dealing with kids.

15
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,110
What?!

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,480
You only made it to J‐Rank
as quickly as you did
because you had help from

17
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:53,286
Hirasaka! Man, I can't stand
guys like you who have to
depend on other players to win!

18
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:57,558
I don't depend on anyone.
But I don't mind using them.

19
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,293
After all, that's my
specialty.

20
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,467
[grunting]

21
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:06,072
Say, you wanna go a round
against me?

22
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:09,909
We'll each put up ten
thousand of our points,
winner take all. I'll go

23
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:14,314
easy on you, just to
make things fair.

24
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:16,082
What a pain...

25
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,485
Relax, I won't kill you.
We're "comrades," right?

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,021
[chuckling]

27
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,392
All right, I'd say that's
enough...!

28
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:27,661
...both of you!

29
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:28,662
[grunting]

30
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:33,366
<i>Stop being so hostile to</i>
<i>each other.</i>

31
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,502
It's truly unattractive.

32
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:36,570
Caw!

33
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:40,073
Fine, but... why did you
have to hit me?!

34
00:01:40,106 --> 00:01:43,510
Damn it! Was that really
necessary?!

35
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:49,082
Listen, it's fine to fight
amongst yourselves... but
this is a very critical time.

36
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:51,685
We need you to act more
responsibly.

37
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:55,221
Very soon, the Slate is
going to bloom.

38
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:57,691
At this point, it's just a
matter of time.

39
00:01:57,724 --> 00:02:02,402
And then Nagare's new world
begins, right?

40
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:03,604
I can't wait!

41
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,942
You're right. Sukuna can be
petulant at times.

42
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,577
But he's really very
strong.(

43
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:14,915
It's true that he's far from
polished, but when it comes
to raw power, he's my

44
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:17,450
equal ‐and perhaps even my
superior.

45
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:21,555
If he challenges you again,
I would turn him down.

46
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:26,226
A clan consisting of two
Kings, two clansmen, and one
bird...

47
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:30,664
Yet you all interact with
each other as equals, even
the Kings.

48
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:32,398
What a strange place...

49
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:34,000
<i>Think so?</i>

50
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,003
Well, you know, in the new
forthcoming era...

51
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,274
...every person will have
their own power,
unsupervised by anyone else,

52
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:44,444
and will have to take
responsibility for their own
life with it.

53
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:48,248
I think that it will suit
you very well.

54
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,449
Hmph.

55
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:59,926
I guess this really is the
only option...

56
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:38,772
<i>I demand an explanation!</i>

57
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:41,441
Why's the Captain being
dismissed?!

58
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:42,576
It's quite simple.

59
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:44,110
[gasping]

60
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:47,781
I had Munakata step down as
captain, effective
yesterday, in order to take

61
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:51,484
responsibility for the
incident that occurred at
Mihashira Tower over

62
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:52,385
Christmas.

63
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:54,655
He was fired.

64
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:58,792
But by what authority could
you do that, Mr. Prime
Minister?

65
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,667
<i>The authority is mine.</i>

66
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,168
Mm.

67
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,471
The executive and
administrative rights for
SCEPTER 4 rest with the

68
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,142
Legal Affairs Bureau Civil
Registry Department Division
4.

69
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:14,347
Ultimately, you are all just
public servants and must
abide by orders issued by

70
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,015
the government.

71
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,617
Yes, but‐

72
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,087
You were able to behave so
arrogantly until now due to
the influence of His

73
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,124
Excellency, Daikaku
Kokujoji.

74
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,494
It seems Munakata had the
gall to try to take His
Excellency's place... and

75
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,132
now, just look at the
results of his hubris.

76
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,769
<i>His Excellency protected our</i>
<i>national treasure for</i>
<i>nearly seventy years, and</i>

77
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>then, within two months of</i>
<i>being placed under</i>
<i>Munakata's supervision,</i>

78
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,473
<i>it was stolen!</i>

79
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,476
You cannot deny that he was
unqualified.

80
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,781
Besides, Munakata has
already agreed to accept his
dismissal as captain.

81
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,683
He did what...?!

82
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,486
The rest of your members are
to wait for further
instructions.

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,321
Here, this is the order.

84
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,157
With just a sheet of
paper...

85
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,560
An important sheet of paper.

86
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,803
I do value protocol above
all else.

87
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:04,204
Damn it!

88
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:06,673
What are you saying?! He's
been fired?!

89
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:09,209
He's the Blue King! Why
isn't he doing something?!

90
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,077
Calm down, Domyoji!

91
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:15,348
The government never
interfered with us like this
before.

92
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,185
Do you think it's connected
with the rumors that the
executive branch is tied to

93
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:20,721
the Greens?

94
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:24,591
First Mr. Fushimi defects to
them, and now this. It's
like one unthinkable thing

95
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,392
happening after
another...

96
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:33,066
I wish I knew what they were
thinking, both the Captain
and Fushimi!

97
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,070
[chatting]

98
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,338
[sighing]

00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:41,341

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,582
<i>Hey! Anna!</i>

102
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:51,351
Thank goodness... you're
back.

103
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:53,520
Where've you been, anyway,
Anna?!

104
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,290
I went out to meet
with Yashiro.

105
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:00,594
Look, if you told me, I
would've taken you!

106
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:04,070
It's pretty dangerous
out there right now.

107
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:04,771
Sorry.

108
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:09,976
By the way, Anna, it sounds
like Mr. Munakata got into a
lot of trouble.

109
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,077
Mm‐hmm.

110
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,481
<i>I can't believe a King could</i>
<i>be fired as easily as that.</i>
<i>And from what I've heard,</i>

111
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:20,220
<i>the guys over at SCEPTER 4</i>
<i>aren't taking the news too</i>
<i>well, either.</i>

112
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:23,757
The members are all on
stand‐by, and they aren't
even allowed to leave their

113
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,725
home base.

114
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,993
I hope Seri is okay...

115
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:31,665
<i>You know... there were a lot</i>
<i>of politicians and other</i>
<i>government types among the</i>

116
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:35,268
<i>guests at the JUNGLE party</i>
<i>that Seri and I infiltrated.</i>

117
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,507
I guess all this means that
the government chose the
Greens over the Blues...

118
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:44,310
If this keeps up, then the
entire world is gonna turn
green.

119
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,245
<i>Is that why?</i>

120
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:47,147
Huh? What's that?

121
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:51,151
Is that why Saruhiko left
like a rat deserting a
sinking ship...

122
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:54,788
...and betrayed just about
everyone by switching his
loyalty from the Blues to

123
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,523
the Greens?

124
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,258
Misaki...

125
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,034
Huh?

126
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:03,770
Well, I'm gonna go patrol
the area again.

127
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,309
[sighing]

128
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:15,716
Anna, how'd everything go
with the Silver King?

129
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:17,951
Anna...?

130
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:20,521
Yashiro has completed his
research.

131
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,723
You mean...

132
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:26,492
Mm‐hmm. He's gonna
destroy the Slate.

133
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:32,465
I see... So you're saying
Mr. Shiro has finally
||

134
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,234
figured out a way
to do that, huh?

135
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,540
Yes... Yashiro's made up his
mind to destroy the Slate,
the symbol...

136
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:41,575
...of his dreams.

137
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:48,048
Are you okay with this?

138
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:51,685
The Slate's been responsible
for taking so many things
away from me...

139
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:57,059
And yet at the same time, I
love this red. This red
saved me.

140
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,325
Anna...

141
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:04,170
Still, I wouldn't mind
losing it.

142
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:09,075
<i>All my life, the only thing</i>
<i>I could do was watch fate</i>
<i>unfold from the sidelines.</i>

143
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:11,077
<i>But it's different now.</i>

144
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:16,082
<i>If my fate as the Red King</i>
<i>is to destroy, then I'll</i>
<i>destroy the fate that tries</i>

145
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:18,351
<i>to hurt the ones that I care</i>
<i>about.</i>

146
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:21,254
Yeah, I understand...

147
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:25,458
Ever since I found those
documents back in Germany, I
knew that this day was bound

148
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:26,259
to come.

149
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:29,563
All that's left...

150
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:30,463
Hm?

151
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:35,769

<i>What, may I ask, was the</i>

<i>abruptly, Red King?</i>

154
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:50,316
I needed to speak with you.

155
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:53,887
We are going to make an
attempt to destroy the
Slate.

156
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,589
I see.

157
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:02,836
I do have to admit that
would certainly be one
option to try to break the

158
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,571
current deadlock.

159
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,841
I didn't know that you
smoked.

160
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,010
Only on rare occasions.

161
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:17,684
I assume that to you,
destroying the Slate would
mean getting revenge for

162
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,185
Mikoto Suoh's death.

163
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:23,356
That's true,... but I'm
afraid it's not quite that
simple.

164
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:28,595
The Slate gave him life but
also killed him... It gave
us many things,

165
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,196
but took many
away, too.

166
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,867
<i>I'm not saying destroying</i>
<i>the Slate will give me a</i>
<i>sense of satisfaction.</i>

167
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,639
It's just....I've come to
believe that it's something
that must be destroyed.

168
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:43,243
Well, I do agree with you
that the Slate is something
that's extremely dangerous.

169
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,711
[blowing smoke]

170
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,917
However, it's largely thanks
to the late Gold King
Daikaku Kokujoji that our

171
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,053
nation has become what it is
today.

172
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,889
Or to put it another way,
the Slate system is a very

173
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,158
deeply rooted part
of the nation.

174
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,394
I don't believe that we can
afford to lose it.

175
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:06,239
What we can't afford is to
think like that anymore.
Hisui plans to release the

176
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:10,611
power of the Slate in order
to give every person in the
world superpowers.

177
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,913
And if that were to come to
pass...

178
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,114
[exhaling]

179
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:20,253
You're right... That
eventuality must be
prevented at all costs.

180
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:23,790
But if the way this is
unfolding is that the Green
King is hoping for a

181
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:28,328
revolution and the Red King
has decided on destruction,
then I, the Blue King, will

182
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:29,930
aim for order.

183
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:34,835
It is my firm belief that
the Slate must be regulated
and used appropriately.

184
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:38,138
With the condition you're in
right now, I doubt you can
pull that off.

185
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:39,673
Oh?

186
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:46,146
And... Anna is quite worried
about you as well...

187
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,347
Is she...?

188
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,983
Your sword is at its limit.
Right now...

189
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:53,219
... if you overexert
yourself, it will fall.

190
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:54,888
[chuckling]

191
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:56,623
<i>What's so funny?</i>

192
00:11:56,623 --> 00:12:02,368
Sorry, I just thought it was
ironic that the situation
has exactly reversed itself

193
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:03,704
from a year ago.

194
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:05,338
What...?

195
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:08,374
I tried reasoning with the
Red King like this once,
too.

196
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,311
[inhaling and blowing smoke]

197
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,181
But it was all in vain.

198
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:16,917
You're wrong.

199
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,318
In what way?

200
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:21,154
You are not the same as
Mikoto.

201
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,155
[gasping]

202
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,173
I must ask you to leave here
immediately, Red King. This
matter comes under the

203
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,175
jurisdiction of SCEPTER 4.

204
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,844
Not my problem.

205
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:48,915
This is about those Strains
you arrested a moment ago...
They came into our territory

206
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,517
and pulled some stunts.

207
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:54,788
We have a few questions that
we wanna ask them, so could
you hand them over to us?

208
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,724
Uh, Captain...?

209
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:01,367
Look... you know we're not
able to comply with such a
request.

210
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:04,070
As always, you people are
nothing but trouble...

211
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,951
Burn them all.

212
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:21,922
No blood! No bone! No ash!

213
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:25,759
We will advance with our
swords in our hands.

214
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,595
We will triumph because
our cause is just.

215
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,163
Men! Draw your swords!

216
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,897
[chuckling]

217
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:31,832
Akiyama, ready!

218
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:32,799
Benzai, ready!

219
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,634
Kamo, ready!

220
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,668
Domyoji, ready!

221
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:35,470
Enomoto, ready!

222
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,102
Fuse, ready!

223
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,103
Goto, ready!

224
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:38,905
Hidaka, ready!

225
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,941
Fushimi, ready!

226
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:45,278
And, Awashima, ready!

227
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,615
Munakata...

228
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:49,816
...ready!

229
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,253
Totsuka...

230
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:54,955
You got it.

231
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:56,790
C'mon, let's go, Anna.

232
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,991
Mikoto...

233
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:02,936
[chuckling]

234
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:10,611
You continue to use your
power recklessly.

235
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:11,945
You're incorrigible.

236
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,314
I don't need a lecture.

237
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:17,183
Then I'll stop you with
force!

238
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:18,952
[grunting]

239
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:23,557
Let's see you handle this,
Mikoto Suoh!

240
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:27,828
[grunting]

241
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:30,030
Stand down, now...

242
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:32,165
...Izumo Kusanagi!

243
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,333
[grunting]

244
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:34,167
Sorry.

245
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,069
No can do.

246
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,573
Is that all you've got?

247
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,709
That's quite impressive.

248
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,745
However...

249
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:49,916
Mikoto...

250
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,986
<i>It's okay.</i>

251
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:56,890
What you just saw is merely
the way that Kings say hello
to each other.

252
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,224
<i>Tatara, be serious.</i>

253
00:14:58,258 --> 00:14:59,860
[chuckling]

254
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,735
Sorry.

255
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,370
But I really don't think
it's something to worry
about.

256
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,374
Yes, the King and Mr.
Munakata are fighting, but I
bet that they're actually

257
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,176
communicating through their
swords.

258
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,211
Oh‐

259
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,016
I must say, you're a
thoroughly unpleasant man.
I've lost count of how many

260
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,119
times you've interfered
since I've become the Blue
King.

261
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,354
That should be my line.

262
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:25,592
The power that both of us
possess as Kings shouldn't
be wasted in such a

263
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,227
frivolous manner as this.

264
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,195
Yeah? And who decided that?

265
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,765
Surely, it's not a matter of
who decides?

266
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:37,370
To put it very simply,
whoever wields power must be
responsible in its use.

267
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,742
That coming from you? You
seem to be enjoying
yourself.

268
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:42,976
Surely, you jest.

269
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,216
Using power without order,
rushing forward without
a goal,

270
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,885
destroying without
creating.

271
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:56,222
<i>The title "King of Fire"</i>
<i>suits you very well indeed.</i>

272
00:15:56,256 --> 00:16:00,734
<i>You simply burn up into</i>
<i>ashes without purpose.</i>
<i>Honestly, you‐</i>

273
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:02,903
Make me sick?

274
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:05,305
Yes. exactly.

275
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:07,841
Good, we see eye to eye.

276
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:08,909
[grunting]

277
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,312
The name "King of Order"
suits you just fine, too.

278
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:16,850
Always meddling in other
people's lives with your
long, boring lectures.

279
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,184
Seriously, you‐

280
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,319
Make me sick?

281
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,253
Exactly...

282
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:22,756
[grunting]

283
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,793
Don't you ever get tired of
always being such a straight
arrow?

284
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:29,930
No, of course not, I'm not
like you.

285
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,132
Guess not.

286
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,673
You're not like him.

287
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:47,313
I never dreamed the day
would come where I'd be the
one who's being admonished.

288
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:51,818
I was so certain that Suoh's
path was a foolish one...

289
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:53,119
Reisi...

290
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:57,223
In any case, the alliance of
three Kings is no longer
valid.

291
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,060
What does that mean...?

292
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:04,237
Simply that yesterday, I
received a notice from the
government relieving me of

293
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,739
my duties as captain.

294
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:09,643
And as a result of that
dismissal, I'm no longer
able to assist you as the

295
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:11,244
leader of my clan.

296
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:15,181
Maybe, but even if you're no
longer the captain, you're
still the Blue King.

297
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:19,185
What's going to happen to
the rest of the Blues, your
clansmen, who will now be at

298
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:20,987
a loss without you?

299
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,155
[chuckling]

300
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,894
Reisi!

301
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:40,240
We'll use this method to
destroy the Slate.

302
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:43,343
Is such a thing actually
possible, Shiro?

303
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:47,380
Before now, it was believed
that the Slate was
indestructible.

304
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:52,218
So even the Green King
wouldn't expect this. It's
the one way to fix this

305
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:53,453
hopeless situation.

306
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,390
But the method you're
proposing... isn't it too
dangerous?

307
00:17:57,423 --> 00:18:01,768
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to ask you to trust
me as a researcher.

308
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,739
I do! I do, I do!

309
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:08,308
I believe in you, Shiro!

310
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:11,211
Thank you, Neko.

311
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:12,579
You're a good girl, you know
that?

312
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:15,749
[groaning]

313
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,150
I believe in you, too!

314
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,218
Uh?

315
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,956
[clearing throat]

316
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:27,894
I believe in you. We will do
what we have to do,
together, and afterward, we

317
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:29,830
will come home together as
well.

318
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,064
[gasping]

319
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:33,734
[chuckling]

320
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:35,335
Huh?

321
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:39,072
Don't you worry.

322
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:43,343
I made sure that this plan
of mine includes me coming
out of it alive.

323
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:44,645
Mm‐hmm.

324
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:45,912
Huh??

325
00:18:45,912 --> 00:18:48,181
<i>Oh, I almost forgot.</i>

326
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:51,084
There's something that I
want to give to both of you.

327
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:52,252
Here, look.

328
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:53,620
Huh?

329
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,691
But what are those things?

330
00:18:57,758 --> 00:19:00,260
Well, I'll explain: the
thing is, we don't actually

331
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,335
have a clan name or
a clan symbol.

332
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:05,806
To be honest, I was a bit
jealous of the other clans
that do!

333
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,174
Oh, I see...

334
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:12,045
So this... is to be our clan
symbol?

335
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:13,446
[excited squealing]

336
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:17,784
And while we're at it, I
thought we should give the
clan a name, too...

337
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:19,653
Kuroh, will you do the
honors?

338
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:21,054
What? Me?

339
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,890
Try to think of something
really cool!

340
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,660
All right...

341
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:28,795
Hm, let me see...

342
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:33,033
What's a name that best
describes us?

343
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,201
Huh‐

344
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:39,906
White rice...

345
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,975
[eager humming]

346
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:43,644
[clearing throat]

347
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,178
I have decided.

348
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:47,047
Mm!

349
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,982
Our clan name will be...

350
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:50,383
Will be...?

351
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,652
Will be...?

352
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:55,188
[grunting]

353
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:57,057
HAKUMAITOU!

354
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,992
<i>What?!</i>

355
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:01,094
Yes...

356
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:05,939
Rice is a staple of our
diet. It's the foundation of
a healthy body.

357
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,843
Most of all, you love white
rice, isn't that right?

358
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,645
Uh, yeah...

359
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,181
HAKUMAITOU!

360
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:21,054
<i>Inside of white rice Is where</i>
<i>you will discover Your true</i>
<i>happiness</i>

361
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:26,627
Well, I guess that since
we're always eating at the
table, that name really does

362
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,629
fit us perfectly.

363
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:33,333
Fine. We're HAKUMAITOU.
We'll always stick together
and do our best!

364
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,570
Yes! We'll do it!

365
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,307
Neko, Nagare Hisui called
you Miyabi Ameno, which
means that he must have

366
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:45,712
looked into your past and
knows about who you were
before you became Neko.

367
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,047
<i>If we question him...</i>

368
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:48,849
Shiro!

369
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:52,853
I'm Neko! I'm your cat!
That's who I will always be!

370
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:56,156
Uh. you're right, I'm sorry.
Never mind, Neko.

371
00:20:56,189 --> 00:21:00,667
Listen to me carefully,
Shiro: both Neko and I are
here as your friends.

372
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:02,736
That's all that matters.

373
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:06,673
I'm going to follow you
until the end...

374
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:08,842
And this time, Shiro, I
won't fail you.

375
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:12,846
Yeah, me too!

376
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:14,848
Yes! We'll do it together.

377
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:18,885
And the first thing to do...
is for us to find JUNGLE's
secret headquarters.

378
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:20,787
[struggling]

379
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,288
Shiro!

380
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:23,189
[grunting]

381
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:24,257
What's wrong, Shiro?!

382
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,293
Oh no, Shiro! You okay?

383
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:29,295
[gasping]

384
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:32,733
Anna?! What is it?!

385
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:34,935
It's... the Slate...

386
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:36,937
[struggling]

387
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,139
<i>So...</i>

388
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,141
It's finally happening.

389
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:46,747
Yes, at last... The Slate is
about to be liberated, to be
set free.

390
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,215
And then...

391
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:50,817
...revolution!

392
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,836
It seems it has begun...

393
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:07,608
Then again, it saves me the
trouble of having to find
them.

394
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:11,745
Although I don't know how
long I can last...

395
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:16,182
I suppose that I'm just
going to have to find out...

396
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:18,184
That's not like you,
Munakata.

397
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:19,152
[gasping]

398
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,593
I know, right?
