1
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:25,859
Douhan Hirasaka, former
U‐Rank member of JUNGLE.

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,863
Saruhiko Fushimi.
What do you want?

3
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,366
I just came by to laugh at
the foolish covert agent

4
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,968
who's trapped in a cage.

5
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,304
What happened to your power
to walk through walls, huh?

6
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,542
Only the top handful of
J‐Rank members in the Green

7
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:45,211
Clan JUNGLE actually
possess genuine powers.

8
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,614
But anyone below
that rank is merely

9
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,550
borrowing a portion
of the Green King's

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,518
power through his
online network.

11
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,355
So what you're saying is
that the Green King Nagare

12
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,191
Hisui is the one with real
power, and he gets to

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,893
decide who can share it.

14
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,669
To him, you're all
just like PDAs.

15
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:05,539
You're just convenient tools
used to transmit his powers

16
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:08,474
and then tossed aside when
you're no longer useful.

17
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,578
It's just a part of doing
business. It's my policy

18
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:14,581
not to concern myself
with a client's interests.

19
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:18,251
Then what exactly are you
in this little game for?

20
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,321
What, is it to earn some
JUNGLE points so that you

21
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:24,257
can become a J‐Rank
member of the Green Clan?

22
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:26,192
[harrumphing chuckle]
Such bullshit...

23
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:30,363
It's to earn a living. All
that concerns me is money.

24
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:33,266
[chuckle] That's
good enough for me.

25
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:38,038
I'm being released?!

26
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:40,440
Not quite.

27
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:42,175
You're breaking out.

28
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:49,282
[chuckle]

29
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,077
Hey, isn't that the guy?

30
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:46,379
He's worth ten
thousand points!

31
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,148
Should we take him out?

32
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:50,483
Yeah, right. We don't
stand a chance.

33
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:53,253
At least get a picture
of him! Even intel

34
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,855
is worth some points.

35
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,258
Hey, he's getting away!

36
00:03:58,424 --> 00:03:59,425
Shit!

37
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:00,734
I got a shot of him!

38
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,770
Mission complete. You've
earned 5 JUNGLE points.

39
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,374
[gasps]

40
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,578
That wasn't me! Was it?

41
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:18,284
[screams] ‐What's going on?!
‐Did you see that?

42
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:21,354
<i>Next up, the latest news on</i>

51
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:40,240
Well, would you take a look
at that! It appears that the

52
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:43,610
field test for the Slate is
going very well indeed!

53
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:46,713
And it seems that old fart
Kokujoji's media blackout is

54
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:48,481
no longer functioning.

55
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:50,316
Going well! Going well!

56
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,587
Yes. The number of people
that have now been empowered

57
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,790
by the Dresden Slate is
increasing every single day.

58
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:58,625
It's satisfying.

59
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:01,835
[chuckle] And with these
changes will come a new age

60
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,905
where everyone can express
their own individuality.

61
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,641
I say we call it the
age of JUNGLE, where

62
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,409
chaos breeds life.

63
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,346
A true paradise for the
survival of the fittest.

64
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,649
It'll be a paradise, huh?

65
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,851
Well, if you ask me, it
sounds more like the kind of

66
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,521
place that people
usually call "hell."

67
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,589
What's wrong, old
man, you getting cold

68
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,857
feet or something?

69
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,693
Caw! Old man! Cold feet!

70
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,263
Hey, come on! I never said
that I have any gripes!

71
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,700
After all, a hell that one
can foresee is at least a

72
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,769
little better than one
that you can't see coming.

73
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,204
That's the kind
of choice I made.

74
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,808
In order to make this
forthcoming new age

75
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,377
arrive sooner and
more definitively.

76
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,713
I have issued several
special missions for our

77
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,815
JUNGLE players to carry out.

78
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,453
You mean like tracking
down any newly born

79
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,988
Strains for recruitment.

80
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,458
Keeping watch over the
other clans' activities.

81
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,994
And, of course, laying the
groundwork with other

82
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,737
influential parties for the
next phase of our plan?

83
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:07,641
All that sounds like
a huge pain in the ass.

84
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:10,511
A sumptuous meal requires
lots of preparation before

85
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,579
serving, my dear Sukuna.

86
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:14,380
But you were just
talking about

87
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:15,982
"survival of the fittest."

88
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:18,852
This is winner take all,
right? Eat or be eaten?

89
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:23,389
Wait, isn't she
that ninja girl?

90
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:26,426
Yes, Douhan Hirasaka.

91
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:29,763
During our first attack on
Mihashira Tower in October,

92
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:32,566
she was captured by
SCEPTER 4 and as a

93
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,268
result, she ended up
losing a lot of points.

94
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:37,904
But in the past month, she's
recouped her losses and

95
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,773
returned to being U‐Rank.

96
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,107
Really?

97
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:44,077
In any event, it's wonderful
to see skilled players make

98
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,713
it back onto the battlefield
the way that she has.

99
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,682
I welcome her return.

100
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:50,617
Who's that guy?

101
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,786
The new face that
everyone's talking about.

102
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,788
Caw! New face!

103
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,759
Whoa! He has over
ninety thousand points!

104
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,935
It's possible he's been
exploiting some kind of

105
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:04,470
loophole. I find it
quite amusing.

106
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,708
You mean he's cheating?!

107
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,777
You know, if he's able to
complete another big

108
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:13,313
mission, then he could
move up to J‐Rank.

109
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,081
That's a real possibility.

110
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:16,650
I'm looking forward to it.

111
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,818
Very much.

112
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:20,486
Well I guess this
place is gonna liven up

113
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:21,988
in just a little bit.

114
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,958
[annoyed scoff] Those
guys are no big deal.

115
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,428
Huh? where are you
off to, Sukuna?

116
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,063
I'm gonna hunt down
some easy missions.

117
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:34,635
What's the matter? You
worried that the new guy

118
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:36,002
might catch up to you?

119
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,571
Of course not!

120
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:43,610
Hey Yukari, stop making
fun of the kid so much,

121
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:45,078
would you? It's not nice.

122
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:49,516
But being mean is
a part of love too.

123
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:54,420
I'm home.

124
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:55,856
Welcome back!

125
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:57,858
I'm making myself at home!

126
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:03,136
Huh? Is it raining outside? Hold
on, let me get you a towel!

127
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,439
No, it wasn't rain. I just
ran into someone with

128
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,874
unnatural powers again.

129
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,476
Oh. Right...

130
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:13,714
I've heard that stuff's been
happening all over the place.

131
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,950
Oh! I've gotta get to my
student council meeting.

132
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:20,721
Kuroh, I brought some cookies,
so please help yourself!

133
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:24,390
I'm already eating
them! Mm! They're delicious!

134
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,193
I'll see you later on,
Shiro! Good luck with

135
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:28,662
all of your studies.

136
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,130
Thanks, Kukuri!

137
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:34,901
Public safety seems to
be declining every day.

138
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:37,070
And it's all because of
the Slate falling into the

139
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,072
hands of the Green King.

140
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:42,008
It's even bestowing
powers to civilians who

141
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:43,544
aren't in a clan.

142
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:47,480
Sorry, I'll hurry up
and find a solution.

143
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:50,416
Oh! I'm not blaming
you or anything.

144
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:53,554
You seem like
you're very focused.

145
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,690
[chuckle] Well, I am the
one who messed everything

146
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:58,091
up back at Christmas time.

147
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,835
But still, I can't
just give up now.

148
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:05,005
'Cause the Dresden
Slate and the Green King

149
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:07,674
simply have to be stopped.

150
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,545
My sister often scolded
me when I was little.

151
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:14,447
She'd say, "Learn to
clean up your own mess."

152
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,116
You've been pushing
yourself quite hard

153
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,851
for the past month.

154
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,954
I'm ashamed that I
couldn't be of more help.

155
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,957
Yeah! You're
doing great, Shiro!

156
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:25,458
And Kuroh is useless!

157
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,895
Although, Kuroh does
prepare our meals every day.

158
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,797
Don't try to be funny.

159
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,633
I'm serious.

160
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:33,800
So am I!

161
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:37,538
If you didn't cook, then I'd
probably die of starvation.

162
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,073
If I don't do something
about the Slate,

163
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:41,207
mankind is screwed.

164
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,811
That's why I have to come up
with a countermeasure for

165
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:47,213
the Slate soon. And why
you have to cook our

166
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:48,982
meals for us, Kuroh.

167
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:50,817
Yeah, what Shiro said!

168
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:54,087
I'm thinking maybe I could
use the Resonant Hammer

169
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,756
Effect on the Slate.

170
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,125
By unfolding the Sanctum
under special conditions,

171
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,768
we'll cause an irreversible
change to the Dresden

172
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,670
Slate's own Weismann phase.

173
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,741
The idea is based on

174
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,577
my sister, Professor
Klaudia Weismann's theory

175
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,946
called the Secondary
Methodology of Schwert

176
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,517
Regulation. This
illustrates the basic idea.

177
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,886
Mm‐hm! That's a
good plan, Shiro.

178
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,121
Okay...

179
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,123
Well, we're having
curry for dinner.

180
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,959
[excited gasp] Yay! Yay!

181
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:43,877
[chatter]

182
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,918
Oh, I see. So Fushimi
is still missing, is he?

183
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,655
Did your Captain
say anything?

184
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,590
No, nothing much
at all, really.

185
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,066
I don't know what's going on
with him or with Fushimi.

186
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,937
Come on, now, try to put
away the long face.

187
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,507
I mean, we're at a
party, so let's try to

188
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:08,975
have fun. Okay, Seri?

189
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,277
[sigh] Be serious.

190
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,954
Please log in for
admittance to the hall.

191
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:26,793
Ah, Mr. and Mrs.
Izuru Kusakabe.

192
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,194
Thank you so
much for coming.

193
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,697
The entrance is
just over that way.

194
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,199
Right. Thank you.

195
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,202
So I'm your wife now?

196
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,938
That's right, my darling.

197
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,212
[laughter]

198
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,284
Man, I've heard about
celebrity parties, but this

199
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,019
is beyond what I pictured.

200
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:57,223
Politicians from around the
world, leaders of industry,

201
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,001
world‐famous authors,
actors, and over there,

202
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,970
even the Japanese
Prime Minister.

203
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:05,906
Ladies and gentleman.

204
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,575
Thank you all so much for
attending the JUNGLE

205
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:10,043
Boot Up Reception.

206
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:13,213
Representing the JUNGLE
Corporation, the sponsor of

207
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:17,017
this gala, is CEO Yukari
Mishakuji, who'd like

208
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,586
to offer a few
words of welcome.

209
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:29,763
Welcome. You're all
about to enter a new era.

210
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:32,265
It's Yukari
Mishakuji of JUNGLE.

211
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:35,602
He's not hiding his name
or face. Pretty bold.

212
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,739
It's obvious that
they no longer feel

213
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:39,940
any need to hide.

214
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,276
Our JUNGLE information
network is no longer just a

215
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:46,947
communication tool. It's
become a way of life.

216
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:50,350
It will redefine what it
means to be human.

217
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:55,789
The future spreading out
before us is limitless.

218
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:58,759
Those people getting
powers must've helped

219
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,260
push this deal through.

220
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:03,036
I hear the JUNGLE system
is to be installed in

221
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:04,237
government agencies.

222
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:07,440
This is truly a day to
celebrate for many

223
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:08,975
different reasons!

224
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:11,745
Now after so long...

225
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,316
I'm finally going to be able
to dismiss that intolerable

226
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:17,951
young know‐it‐all brat!

227
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,821
I guess that we should
call this the dawn

228
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,422
of the age of JUNGLE!

229
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:25,158
[laughter]

230
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:27,994
[groaning]

231
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:33,967
Oh, I beg your
pardon, ma'am.

232
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:38,071
I'm sorry. I'm
feeling faint.

233
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:40,674
Yeah, but, uh, ma'am!

234
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:48,014
That was a pretty bold move,
Seri. It's not like you.

235
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:50,350
I'll do whatever it
takes to get the job done.

236
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:58,024
I found it. The invitation
list for this party.

237
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,794
If we can get this out
of here we'll know the

238
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:02,836
identities of the
people who are under

239
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:04,037
JUNGLE's thumb.

240
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,271
Found them!

241
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,944
This way!

242
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:42,843
It looks like we've
given them the slip.

243
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,351
Oh, no! The PDA!

244
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:52,986
Damn it!

245
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:54,921
Emergency mission complete.

246
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:58,892
You've earned three
thousand JUNGLE points.

247
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,202
Is that?

248
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,370
You've ranked up!
You've been promoted to

249
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,072
the J‐Rank of JUNGLE!

250
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,274
Congratulations,
Saruhiko Fushimi!

251
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,114
[gasp]

252
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:14,948
Fushimi?!

253
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,420
Fushimi, I'll hear your
excuses once I put

254
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,888
you in the hospital!

255
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,895
A Green Clansman!

256
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,397
Fushimi...

257
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,233
Why, Fushimi?!

258
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,300
Seri...

259
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,273
This way! Shoot
'em if you have to!

260
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,476
Seri, we have to
call it a night.

261
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,221
I never knew there were
underground passages

262
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,390
like this in the
heart of the city.

263
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,401
They have tight security.
And it runs deep...

264
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,272
This is a secret passage
that leads to our hideout.

265
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:08,174
It also connects to
over a hundred exits

266
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:10,343
inside this city alone.

267
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,513
Such as main subway
lines, the basement floors

268
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,848
of skyscrapers,
and so forth.

269
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,918
Is it really wise of you to
leak all this intel to me

270
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:20,286
without any hesitation
whatsoever?

271
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,023
Of course. Because
you are now a J‐Rank

272
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:24,658
member of JUNGLE.

273
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:28,595
You're a comrade with whom
we share all our secrets.

274
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:32,465
That was quite a feat today,
Saruhiko. You managed to

275
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:36,202
take on HOMRA's and
SCEPTER 4's number twos.

276
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:39,673
And even did so
all by yourself.

277
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:40,541
[chuckle]

278
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,509
You should've called for
help, though. There's no

279
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,444
need to try so hard.

280
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:47,047
I don't work well with
others. I'm just not a fan

281
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:48,882
of that kind of thing.

282
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,016
Liar.

283
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,120
I know you hired
U‐Rank member Douhan

284
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:56,056
Hirasaka to work for you.

285
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,392
By doing so, you were able
to obtain twice the JUNGLE

286
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:02,368
points, allowing you to
move up in rank more quickly.

287
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,508
That was very clever.
You're quite the cheater.

288
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:10,410
Your system doesn't
have any rules against it.

289
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:12,245
Is there some kind of problem?

290
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:15,549
Of course not. I thought it
was cunning and brilliant.

291
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:18,384
Besides, our Nagare
isn't bothered by foul

292
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:19,686
play such as that.

293
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:24,324
The Green King,
Nagare Hisui.

294
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:26,426
In fact, I believe he
prefers people to think

295
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:28,028
outside the box.

296
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:30,363
That's just who
our King is.

297
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:32,566
Well we're here.

298
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:40,574
Welcome, Saruhiko Fushimi.

299
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:44,344
JUNGLE's secret base extends
its hospitality to you.

300
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,567
Can anyone explain what the
hell that idiot's thinking?!

301
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:04,137
Look, just calm down, Yata.

302
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:07,473
First, that asshole
betrays us.

303
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,475
Now he betrays the Blues?

304
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:11,712
And for what?! Huh?!

305
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,548
What the hell is the
point of all this?!

306
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:17,083
I mean, why would
he go this far?!

307
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,487
I see... Then this is
conclusive evidence of

308
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:24,457
Saruhiko Fushimi's
defection from us.

309
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:28,629
I guess this is what is
known as, biting the hand

310
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:30,130
that feeds you.

311
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:32,332
I hope you can
forgive me, sir.

312
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:34,167
My poor management
caused this.

313
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:37,738
Well in any event, we'll
have to work quickly to fill

314
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,606
the void he created.

315
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:43,243
To reinforce the front lines
for now, I'll have several

316
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:46,680
members transferred to
the Special Police Force.

317
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,249
We'll need two people from
the general riot squad,

318
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:51,251
three from the
intel division,

319
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,520
and one from general
affairs and records.

320
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,256
Excuse me.

321
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,359
Hold on, you're‐‐

322
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:07,140
[gasp]

323
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:12,546
Pardon me, sir.

324
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:15,215
Impressive.

325
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:18,218
The man responsible
for killing the prior

326
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,786
Blue King, Jin Habari.

327
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:23,223
Goki Zenjo, also called
Zenjo the Ogre.

328
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:26,560
From this moment
forward, your assignment

329
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:29,062
will be to watch my back.

330
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:40,406
Well, well! It's nice to
meet you, Fushimi!

331
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,078
As they say at times
like these, "Welcome!"

332
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:48,348
Thank you for coming here
to meet us, Saruhiko.

333
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:49,750
I am truly delighted.

334
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:51,552
Delighted! Delighted!

335
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:53,554
Thank you.

336
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:57,257
Hey, let's not stand around
gabbing! Sit down, sit down!

337
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:01,467
Mr. Iwa, the homebody,
actually went outside to

338
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,704
bring this feast
back here for you.

339
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,339
Real sushi! Not that
cheap, pre‐packaged crap.

340
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,542
So? What would you like?

341
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,145
Fatty tuna? Sea urchin?
Salmon roe? Or Shrimp?

342
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,647
I'll have the egg...

343
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:15,649
[harrumph]

344
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,650
That's for kids.

345
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,219
Hey, come on, now! You
just speak for yourself,

346
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,486
all right, Sukuna?

347
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,123
We have more than sushi,
like fried chicken!

348
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,390
You like chicken?

349
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,192
Chicken! Chicken!

350
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,562
You know you're a bird,
too, you stupid chatterbox!

351
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,797
What's bothering
you, Sukuna?

352
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,233
Why are you in
such a bad mood?

353
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:34,735
[annoyed harrumph]

354
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,469
You feeling shy? Hmm?

355
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,706
Now, Saruhiko, I'm sure
you're aware that you moved

356
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,576
up five ranks in just
barely just a month.

357
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,311
And in doing so, you beat
the previous best time held

358
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,148
by Sukuna. Now you've
set a new record.

359
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,816
Very impressive.

360
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,851
[annoyed harrumph]

361
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,418
Nagare...

362
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,887
We can talk about
that another time,

363
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,188
don't you think?

364
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,559
But why do you say that,
Mr. Iwa? I'm quite puzzled.

365
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,694
Just because.

366
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:04,270
Look, Sukuna, stop being in
such a bad mood, all right?

367
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,740
A first impression is what
counts in building a healthy

368
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:08,709
relationship. So smile!

369
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:11,111
Right? Don't you agree?

370
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:14,715
No, sorry not
really. I don't care.

371
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,517
Oh? Really?

372
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,620
Okay, then! That's fine!

373
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:22,455
Act all cool if you want!

374
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:24,791
Well, I didn't come here to
make friends, you know.

375
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,795
Oh, yeah? Then tell me,
why exactly have you come?

376
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:33,734
No reason. This is
all a game, right?

377
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:36,469
I was simply curious to
discover what was going to

378
00:21:36,537 --> 00:21:40,273
happen if I were able to
push the score to its limit.

379
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:43,476
To learn if it would change
the way I see things.

380
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:44,745
And that's all.

381
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:46,479
Don't tell me that I did all
of that just to get a party

382
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,549
with a sushi platter.

383
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,786
No, of course not. The
remainder of our plan

384
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,488
starts from here on out.

385
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:57,824
Ready, set, go!

386
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,267
From now on, I'll also be
counting on you. As one of

387
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:03,236
JUNGLE's top clansmen.

388
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:04,771
J‐Rank...

389
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:07,173
Saruhiko Fushimi.

390
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,677
Just tell me what to
do and I'll do it.

391
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,847
I will complete any mission
that you assign to me.

392
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:17,751
I'd rather spend my time on
missions than on shit like

393
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:19,753
interpersonal relationships.

394
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:14,114
As the Blue Clan
deteriorates, Yashiro makes

395
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:18,051
up his mind. Will Reisi take
the path toward destruction?

396
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:22,322
Next time on K RETURN OF
KINGS, Episode 10 "Keystone."

397
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:26,059
Mikoto, your red will
always be my favorite.
