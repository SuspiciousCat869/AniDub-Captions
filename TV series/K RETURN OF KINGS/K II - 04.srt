1
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:48,214
You're too kind.

2
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:50,016
You hillbilly samurai!

3
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,051
Move onward!

4
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:52,218
Just a moment...

5
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:53,086
Time for battle!

6
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,420
Know your place!

7
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:56,056
Die!

8
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:56,957
You're too kind.

9
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:02,869
[fighting grunts]

10
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:03,737
Damned brat!

11
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,808
Your attacks are so weak!

12
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:09,876
[chuckle]

13
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:12,078
Don't get cocky!

14
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:21,154
[chuckle] You are nothing
but a sneaky little bastard

15
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,089
who's full of shit!

16
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,826
I thought you were
the Blue's and Red's

17
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:26,960
number threes?

18
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,762
Is that really
all you've got?

19
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,232
Frankly, I hate
earning points when

20
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:33,767
it's as easy as this.

21
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:37,971
You son of a‐‐!

22
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:40,306
[chuckle]

23
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,809
I'll shut that damn
mouth of yours!

24
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:46,012
Look, don't lump me
in with that idiot!

25
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,816
I'll get the four
thousand points first!

26
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:54,454
[chuckle]

27
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:56,857
Is that‐‐?!

28
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:59,192
No way!

29
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:09,510
I recognize that sword!

30
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:12,879
It's the one that
appeared last year!

31
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,481
That means it's
the Silver King...

32
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:26,827
[chuckle]

33
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:29,029
Shiro!

34
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:29,996
Shiro...

35
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:33,399
You come here, invading
a person's home.

36
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,402
And even worse, you also
try to hurt his family.

37
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,339
That's the height
of arrogance.

38
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,509
Green King, Nagare Hisui!

39
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,880
[chuckling]

40
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:51,852
<i>Is this a dream?!</i>
<i>Am I seeing things?!</i>

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,256
It's an honor to finally
meet you, First King Adolf

42
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:59,092
K. Weismann, also known
as the Silver King.

43
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:02,435
I am Yukari Mishakuji,
a J‐rank of the

44
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,505
Green Clan Jungle.

45
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:06,006
And...

46
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,173
Caw!

47
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,011
I must apologize for our
King's absence, but he will

48
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:13,614
be speaking to you
through our clansman.

49
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:21,688
Greetings, Silver King. I
am the Fifth King, Nagare

50
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:24,390
Hisui, the Green King.

51
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:29,429
I have waited a long
time for this moment.

52
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:33,233
You managed to
lure me out.

53
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,134
I guess that this is
what you were after.

54
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:37,904
Is that right,
Green King?

55
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:41,374
That's correct. You
coming here verifies

56
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,409
that you are no
longer the detached

57
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,379
bystander that you
once chose to be.

58
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:49,215
I'd say it's quite a
strategic success.

59
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:52,085
[chuckle]

60
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,622
Are you telling me that you
used my dear Kuroh as bait?

61
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:58,258
[chuckle] You Kings
can be so cruel!

62
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,160
Yes, you are correct.

63
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:03,269
In the same vein, I'm
issuing new orders. Please

64
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,438
withdraw immediately.

65
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,607
Huh?!

66
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,310
Don't you want me to take
care of our big catch?

67
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,614
No. Withdraw immediately.

68
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,158
Too bad. I can't say
I'm pleased, but if

69
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,961
my King orders it
so, very well then.

70
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,131
We shall take our
leave now, Silver King.

71
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,704
Did you hear
that, Sukuna?

72
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,542
This mission has just been
cancelled. No ifs or buts

73
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,309
about it. Let's go.

74
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:47,447
Aw! I can't believe I have
to quit such an easy game.

75
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,386
Kuroh, in deference to
the Silver King who so

76
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,056
selflessly rushed
to your rescue, I'll

77
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,491
let you live for today.

78
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,135
Next time, though, try to
make it a little more fun.

79
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:06,507
Or else I'll cut you
down like a dead branch.

80
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,143
Caw! Caw! Caw!

81
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,225
Can you get up, Kuroh?

82
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:32,432
[chuckle]

83
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:48,048
I welcome you
back my King.

84
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:49,115
[gasp]

85
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:50,684
Shiro!

86
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:53,086
[gasp]

87
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,355
[giggle] Shiro!

88
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:58,391
Shiro! Shiro! Shiro! Shiro!

89
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,393
I missed you so much!

90
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:01,568
What have you been doing?

91
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:02,736
Why didn't you come back?

92
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,304
Oh, I have so
many questions!

93
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,905
Neko!

94
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:06,573
How dare you do that?!

95
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:08,141
I was just about to ask
the same thing before

96
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,442
you stepped on me!

97
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,377
We looked everywhere
that we could possibly

98
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,413
think to look for you, Shiro!

99
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,215
We searched and searched
and then searched

100
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,551
those places over and over!

101
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:20,086
Then those staticky Greens
came after us! And glitter

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,488
guy went "swoosh!" and
then beat up Kuroh.

103
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:25,325
And Anna went
all "boom!" on fire.

104
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:28,595
[crying]

105
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:32,799
After that, well, we both
still kept on looking for you.

106
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:34,501
And then...

107
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,436
And then...

108
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,272
[sobbing]

109
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:40,674
[chuckle]

110
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:43,510
I'm home now.

111
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:46,647
Welcome back...

112
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:50,416
Well, you heard her!

113
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:51,952
Come on, just admit it.

114
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:55,522
This is s'posed to be our
tearjerker moment. Where you

115
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:58,324
come running up to
me like Neko here,

116
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:01,267
and say, "I missed
you too, Shiro!"

117
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,639
That isn't really my style.

118
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:08,642
Huh?

119
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:11,545
Sorry.

120
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:14,648
No, I'm just glad
you're alive.

121
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,150
Same goes for you.

122
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,820
Do you know what's
happened since you left?

123
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:21,822
I have a pretty good idea.

124
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,790
'Cause otherwise, how
could I have made such a

125
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:25,659
perfectly timed entrance?

126
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,694
You mean everything
that happened was

127
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,329
done intentionally?!

128
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:31,665
Could be... Who knows?

129
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,835
[chuckle] You haven't
changed at all, you clown.

130
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:37,671
I was working
behind the scenes...

131
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:39,172
Hoping...

132
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,907
I could handle it and
keep you all out of it.

133
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:43,744
But the Green Clan
moved more quickly

134
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,512
than I expected them to.

135
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:48,381
They outmaneuvered me and
drew me out into the open.

136
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:50,751
So it appears that all I
actually did was cause

137
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,686
everyone even more trouble.

138
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,523
Yes, you're damned
right you did, you fool.

139
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:58,825
[chuckle]

140
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:00,927
If you came back sooner and
shared what you knew with

141
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:05,238
us, things wouldn't have
gotten so complicated!

142
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:07,373
First King Adolf
K. Weismann.

143
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:09,510
No, wait.

144
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,613
Yashiro Isana, don't
forget we're your clansmen.

145
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:17,551
That's right. You're our
King, remember, Shiro?!

146
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:20,721
[giggling]

147
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:23,223
Neko...

148
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:24,558
Kuroh...

149
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,459
You're too kind.

150
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,861
Try to do your best.

151
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:28,729
Just a moment.

152
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,263
Easy there.

153
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,397
Alas!

154
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:38,539
[chatter]

155
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:40,240
So? What now?

156
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:44,244
I'm aware of how
cunning you are.

157
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:47,548
You didn't just let them
lure you out, did you?

158
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:49,783
I'd like to believe
you've got a counter

159
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,652
plan or two prepared.

160
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:54,921
Well I might have
something up my sleeve.

161
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:57,624
Until recently the
Green Clan was

162
00:09:57,658 --> 00:09:59,259
only a potential threat.

163
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:02,202
But now that they've
officially made their move,

164
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,604
it'll take more than
just the three of

165
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,338
us to deal with them.

166
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:06,773
That's why...

167
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,241
Huh?!

168
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,381
May I ask you two to deliver
a message to your Kings?

169
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:16,717
Huh?

170
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,884
[giggling]

171
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,723
Well done! Well
done! Well done!

172
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:27,227
Third King Anna
Kushina, the Red King.

173
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,632
Fourth King Reisi
Munakata, the Blue King.

174
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:36,903
And me, Adolf K. Weismann,
the First King, the Silver

175
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,906
King, also known
as Yashiro Isana.

176
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,577
Three rather prominent
figures all gathered around

177
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,411
a table for a discussion.

178
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,583
We'll call it a round
table conference!

179
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,752
Are you talking
about the coffee table?!

180
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,921
It's not even round!
It's a rectangle!

181
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,424
Shoot!

182
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:11,444
We're already packed like
sardines in here. So stop

183
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,847
your whining or
you'll suffocate us all.

184
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,516
Screw you, Monkey!

185
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:17,518
You're one to talk! You
and your horde of Blues

186
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,352
breathing up all
the air in here!

187
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:27,427
[grumbling]

188
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,634
The last thing we need
is for you punks to cause

189
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,936
more trouble like
you did a year ago.

190
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:39,005
So we're here to
keep things in order.

191
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,207
What?! Huh?!

192
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:44,344
That's enough. We're
having a VIP meeting.

193
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:46,613
Let's tone it down
a bit, all right?

194
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,516
Yes, you too, Fushimi.
Stop provoking him.

195
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,818
Of course, ma'am. I'm sorry.

196
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:03,570
Um...

197
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,338
Excuse me.

198
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,908
Please, have some tea.

199
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,345
Thank you so much
for this, Kukuri.

200
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:15,649
Oh, uh, sure thing!
You're welcome!

201
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:17,350
[chuckle]

202
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,252
Sorry for making
you do all the work.

203
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:21,254
Oh, I don't mind.

204
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:23,657
You're Shiro, right?
It's obvious that Kuroh

205
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,759
and Neko don't wanna
leave your side

206
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,394
now that they've
finally found you.

207
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:29,495
[clearing throat]

208
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:31,497
Well, it's not exactly like
that. This is actually a

209
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:33,934
formal meeting of the
three Clans that‐

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,935
Kukuri's right!

211
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:35,936
Huh?!

212
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:39,372
I am never, ever gonna
leave his side again!

213
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:40,440
[clearing throat]

214
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:41,441
Huh?

215
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:46,346
Shall we begin our round
table or should I instead

216
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,348
say, our coffee
table conference,

217
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:51,785
Silver King Adolf
K. Weismann?

218
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:53,086
Right...

219
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,555
Pardon me.

220
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:58,559
[nervous laugh]

221
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:04,638
And please, you can just
call me Yashiro Isana, Blue

222
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,740
King Reisi Munakata.

223
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,610
You as well, Red
King Anna Kushina.

224
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:13,614
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

225
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:17,818
It's not a problem. I've
been wanting to repay

226
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,553
your clansmen for
all the help that

227
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,321
they've given me recently.

228
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:24,658
[laugh] Thank you, Anna!

229
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,060
If we're going
by that logic...

230
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:29,963
Then I'd say that you both
owe us for always having to

231
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:32,799
clean up after your
messes time and time again.

232
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:35,836
[sigh]

233
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:39,973
[clearing throat]

234
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,009
Well, putting that thought
aside for right now.

235
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:46,012
What is the purpose
of this meeting?

236
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,084
I'm sure someone in your
position has a good idea of

237
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:52,819
why we're all here today.

238
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,490
To talk about the Green Clan
and what to do about them.

239
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:00,861
Yes, you're correct.

240
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:03,103
We've had our differences
in the past, but now, a

241
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:05,639
situation has arisen that
requires us to all put

242
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:08,108
that aside and discuss
this matter together.

243
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:18,552
The Second King, Daikaku
Kokujoji the Gold

244
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:21,054
King has passed away.

245
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:37,037
I see...

246
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,572
Well, then...

247
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,707
The Dresden Slate wields a
latent power that can affect

248
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:43,744
not only Japan but the
entire world, and you're

249
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,079
saying that the strongest
King, the one best at

250
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,549
keeping it under
control, is now gone?

251
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,917
Is that the reason why the
Green Clan has become so

252
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:52,586
active recently?

253
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,757
Right now, with the
Lieutenant, I mean

254
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:58,992
the Gold King gone,
the Green King has

255
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:00,934
nothing to fear anymore.

256
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,837
There's no reason for
him to suppress his

257
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,606
ambitions or powers.

258
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,241
But we'd gotten word that
the Green Clan had been

259
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,110
looking for you, as well.

260
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,112
I mean, don't they
have good reason to be

261
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,614
concerned about you?

262
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,683
I don't pose a direct
threat to them the same

263
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,184
way that the
Gold King did.

264
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,053
But I possess
knowledge about the

265
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,555
Slate that they want.

266
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,090
And because my power is
eternal, it is the opposite

267
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:27,027
of theirs, which makes it
hard to manipulate me.

268
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,263
Are you saying they couldn't
anticipate your move because

269
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,633
you're a kind of wild card?

270
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:34,467
Yes.

271
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,470
The Gold King knew this,
which is why he kept me

272
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,973
hidden as long as
he could, but...

273
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,108
Man, I'm totally lost.

274
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,651
What a waste to
now close my eyes.

275
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:55,989
Yes...

276
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:10,310
Lieutenant, just as you
did, I will move forward

277
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:12,278
until my very last breath.

278
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:15,516
No running this time.

279
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:18,519
I'll face it head on.

280
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,858
And now, they've
managed to pull me

281
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,593
back into this world.

282
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:29,996
The Green Clan won't
hold back anymore.

283
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,599
And they'll be calculating
how the wild card will be

284
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:35,201
used as they continue
to challenge us.

285
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:39,606
That means the remaining
three Kings must work

286
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,208
together to fight
against the Green Clan.

287
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:45,178
Is that what you brought
us here today to propose?

288
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:48,549
Especially now that the
Gold King, the most powerful

289
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:50,884
King, is no longer with us.

290
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,218
Correct?

291
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:53,620
Yes, and so?

292
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,557
I've no objection.

293
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:59,225
After all, Scepter 4's
mission as the Blue Clan is,

294
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:02,235
first and foremost,
to maintain order.

295
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:05,806
But, Captain! Are you
really sure about this?

296
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:09,075
Ms. Awashima, we are wearing
ourselves out trying to

297
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:11,912
counter everything that
the Green Clan is doing.

298
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:15,649
Having powerful allies will
be worth it, even if we have

299
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:17,818
to put up with a little
friction among us.

300
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:21,254
Reisi...

301
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:25,091
As I once told you one time
before, it's very hard for

302
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:27,994
me to bring myself to
say, "thank you."

303
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:39,773
But I also said it
was what Mikoto had

304
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,943
wished for, and that I
can't hate you for it.

305
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,213
So the Red Clan will be
proud to fight alongside

306
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:49,249
the Silver Clan
and the Blue Clan.

307
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:53,286
I pledge this to
you as the Red King.

308
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,957
Mikoto, watch over us.

309
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:00,634
I accept, as well.

310
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,037
Wow, an alliance
between three clans, huh?

311
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:06,807
Well, under the
circumstances, there's no

312
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,142
reason to oppose the idea.

313
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,911
Hell, yeah!

314
00:18:11,978 --> 00:18:13,379
So the plan is, we team up
and beat the shit out of

315
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,048
those Greens, right?

316
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:16,817
Then I say we do it!

317
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:26,326
It's payback time! We're
gonna squash those

318
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:27,761
Greens like bugs! [yell]

319
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:28,762
Yeah!

320
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:31,832
No blood! No bone! No ash!

321
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,802
Special Police Force, return
to base now. Update our

322
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:37,437
alert procedures.

323
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,440
Make sure that everything
is set up and ready before

324
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:42,909
the Red Clan's
representative arrives.

325
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:44,310
Yes, sir!

326
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:47,848
Representative? I guess
that'll be me, huh?

327
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:50,283
Right? Seri, Dear.

328
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:53,319
Try not to
disappoint me, okay?

329
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,756
By the way, what should
we do with those documents

330
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:56,990
you recovered?

331
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:57,991
Oh...

332
00:18:58,358 --> 00:18:59,192
That...

333
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:06,873
So now we're going to
pretend to be buddies, huh?

334
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:13,714
Mr. Munakata!

335
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:17,217
Is there something
else that I can help you

336
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:19,319
with, Yashiro Isana?

337
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:34,868
One last thing, since the
Gold King's gone, you're in

338
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:36,503
charge of the Slate, right?

339
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:38,905
Yes. That a problem?

340
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:42,909
I thought I was the obvious
choice as no one else

341
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:44,244
appeared suitable.

342
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:49,349
So tell me, how much do
you know about the Slate?

343
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:52,085
Not nearly as much as
you do, First King, but I

344
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:53,920
understand what it is.

345
00:19:57,257 --> 00:20:02,368
Do you intend to become the
second Daikaku Kokujoji?

346
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,874
If you don't mind,
please let me help you

347
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,109
watch over the Slate‐

348
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,376
You want me to rely
on someone who

349
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,012
already ran away once?

350
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,179
[gasp]

351
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,291
It's over...

352
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,228
Are you running away?

353
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,065
Why would you give all
of this up? Weismann!

354
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,975
However, when it comes to
dealing with the Green Clan,

355
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,745
your assistance is more
than welcome, Silver King.

356
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,348
Now please, excuse me.

357
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:06,039
[sigh]

358
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,876
Well, I suppose that
I did have that coming.

359
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,778
Right, Kuroh?

360
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,116
You knew we were here?

361
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,785
Shiro!

362
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:23,356
The boss with the
glasses was mean!

363
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:28,128
[chuckle]

364
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:32,132
I'm okay, thanks. That
was nothing, really.

365
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:36,570
Are you sure? I mean, are
you really okay? For real?

366
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:40,240
I made a promise that I
wouldn't run away this time,

367
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:42,809
and that I would face things
head on but, well...

368
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:50,483
One step at a time, skip
toward the path you chose,

369
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,085
that is all it takes.

370
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:55,956
That's creepy!

371
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:56,923
What?!

372
00:21:58,491 --> 00:21:59,826
[sigh]

373
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:02,603
Get back inside. We're
having grilled mackerel

374
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:04,638
and miso soup for
dinner tonight.

375
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:08,241
Yes! Yes! Yes!

376
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:11,612
Fishy! Fishy!
Gotta eat fishy!

377
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:15,415
By the way, I understand
the Gold Clan handled

378
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:17,350
all the repairs to my
room and arranged

379
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,319
to have the lease
transferred to you.

380
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:23,023
I have to say those guys
really are very efficient.

381
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:27,127
The Gold King created a
place for you to return to.

382
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:29,195
You should be grateful.

383
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,865
You're right. Thank
you, Lieutenant!

384
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:35,335
Thank you Lieutenant! Thank
you, thank you, thank you!

385
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,503

386
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,612
