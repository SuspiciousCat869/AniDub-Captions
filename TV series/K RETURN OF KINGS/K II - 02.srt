1
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,753
<i>Lieutenant, just as you</i>
<i>did, I will move forward</i>

2
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,755
<i>until my very last breath.</i>

3
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,424
<i>No running this time.</i>

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,927
<i>I'll face it head on.</i>

5
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,837
<i>This is the second time I'm</i>
<i>descending from the sky, but</i>

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,373
<i>it's different from last</i>
<i>time when I was hurled down.</i>

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,400
<i>This time, I'm descending</i>
<i>of my own free will.</i>

8
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:41,441
<i>Shiro, as your loyal Silver</i>
<i>Clansman, Kuroh Yatogami,</i>

9
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,445
<i>I'll do everything in my</i>
<i>power to complete my part</i>

10
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:46,980
<i>till the day you return.</i>

11
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:53,987
Captain Munakata is waiting
for you in his office.

12
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:58,925
Hey, where's that
partner of yours?

13
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,334
Neko didn't want
to come here.

14
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,970
She's a disobedient
stray cat just as

15
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,506
her name implies.

16
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:07,173
'Kay...

17
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:21,354
[sigh]

18
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:23,990
First of all, I wanted to
thank you for contributing

19
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:26,059
to the arrest
of our suspect.

20
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,862
I'm glad to see that you're
safe. My men had informed me

21
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:30,496
that you two had gone
missing following the

22
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,332
bombing incident
orchestrated by the

23
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,200
Green Clan Jungle.

24
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:37,671
Yes, we just barely
escaped the blast.

25
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:40,040
But since it seemed that
we were the ones they

26
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,576
were actually after,
we decided that we

27
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,545
should go into hiding.

28
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:48,148
I'd say that's a very
prudent decision.

29
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:51,251
It's also the reason why I
came here to speak with you.

30
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:53,520
Were we both targeted
because we're the Silver

31
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:55,421
King's Clansmen?

32
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,257
It is a fact that the
Green Clan is searching

33
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:59,159
for the Silver King.

34
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:01,234
And who could provide a
better lead than Silver

35
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:04,404
King Adolf K. Weisman's
own clansmen?

36
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:07,040
The first he's made
since emerging from

37
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,175
over half a century
of solitude.

38
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:14,280
That would be you,
Kuroh Yatogami.

39
00:04:14,347 --> 00:04:18,084
You and that young Strain
girl you travel with.

40
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:20,521
It's only natural
you were targeted.

41
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:24,257
I don't understand. What
exactly is the Green Clan?

42
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,593
They're quite out
of the ordinary.

43
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:29,462
While they do have some
clansmen, it seems that very

44
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,599
few of them have ever
actually met the Green King.

45
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:35,401
I have heard they use
the internet for their

46
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:38,071
organization in unique ways.

47
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:40,741
Still, it's quite odd
that they've never even

48
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:42,943
met their own King.

49
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:44,945
I agree completely.

50
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:47,748
Perhaps "clansmen" isn't
even the correct terminology

51
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:49,282
to describe them.

52
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:57,457
Nagare Hisui, the Green
King, maintains control of

53
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:00,126
his Clan through a
social network service

54
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:01,602
known as Jungle.

55
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,437
And this is what
their site looks like?

56
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,506
Yes.

57
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,974
People unaware of the
existence of clans or their

58
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,077
power log into Jungle
thinking its just another

59
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,179
social networking site.

60
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,982
These normal users are
called "E‐Rank," based on

61
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,751
the last letter of Jungle.

62
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,420
As the lowest ranked Clan
members, they complete

63
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:24,024
"missions" and when they
do, they earn points,

64
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,127
allowing them to
move up in rank.

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,596
You mean that the crimes
committed around the

66
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,798
city by Jungle
are actually...

67
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,301
Yes. They're missions
undertaken in order

68
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,170
to gain Jungle points.

69
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,506
It's like they've
taken an online game

70
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,007
and made it real.

71
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,310
As they earn points,
people move up to L‐Rank,

72
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,312
G‐Rank, and so forth.

73
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,348
And they acquire
special though generally

74
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,116
temporary powers.

75
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,820
If they fail at a mission,
they lose their points.

76
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,356
And depending on the
circumstances, they

77
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,192
could lose their temporary
powers altogether.

78
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,503
Once these culprits are
cut off by Jungle and left

79
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:05,171
powerless there's really
nothing that we can do

80
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:08,174
except turn them
into the police.

81
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,310
But there must be some
clansmen out there who've

82
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:13,046
managed to acquire real
power, too, correct?

83
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:16,216
We know of a few
who've made it to the

84
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:18,084
Clan's highest level.

85
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:20,053
And they have true powers.

86
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:23,223
The J‐Rank. Their powers
were bestowed upon them in

87
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:26,159
person by the Green
King, Nagare Hisui.

88
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:29,262
And yes, one of them is
the man you're probably

89
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,431
thinking of right now.

90
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,366
Yukari Mishakuji.

91
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:41,174
Has Yukari Mishakuji made
contact with you since

92
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:42,609
your last encounter?

93
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:44,077
No...

94
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:46,412
What about the
Silver King, has he?

95
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,082
I wouldn't be here, then!

96
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:51,417
Can you remember the Silver
King ever saying anything at

97
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,520
all about the Dresden Slate?

98
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,521
No...

99
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,423
After his memories of being
the Silver King finally

100
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:02,102
returned, the time we spent
together was too short.

101
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,739
We had no chance to talk
about anything like that.

102
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,473
That's unfortunate...

103
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:10,210
Has something
happened to the Slate?

104
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:11,612
No, nothing.

105
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:14,881
However, with the Gold
King still missing, the

106
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:18,284
safekeeping of the Dresden
Slate rests with me.

107
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:21,121
The Silver King knows more
about it than anyone. If he

108
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:23,557
had left any information
regarding the Slate,

109
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,893
I'd merely like to
know. That's all.

110
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:32,265
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I
can't be of much help.

111
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,467
If that is all,
please excuse me.

112
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,172
Kuroh Yatogami...

113
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:43,176
As I recall, the Silver
Clan has no territory

114
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,145
of its own, correct?

115
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,613
Yes, that's right. Why?

116
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:50,817
Given the situation, not
having a base of operations

117
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:52,653
must be rather inconvenient.

118
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:56,489
So if you'd like
I can offer you

119
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,358
Scepter 4's protection.

120
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,803
We'd allow you to take up
residence in our home base.

121
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:04,705
And I'll promise you
protection should any

122
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:06,840
emergency arise.

123
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,841
[gasp]

124
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:12,345
I do appreciate the offer,
but I can't accept it.

125
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,616
My, my how disappointing.

126
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:17,951
I thought that you and I had
a pretty good chemistry with

127
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,686
each other, don't you agree?

128
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:22,889
Uh... It isn't
about chemistry!

129
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,728
You don't want to find
yourself beholden to

130
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:30,330
another clan, is that it?

131
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:32,633
It's not that either.

132
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,701
It's simply that I...

133
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,345
Mr. Fushimi, do
you have a moment?

134
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:47,313
Have you already completed
your questioning of

135
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,315
Kuroh Yatogami, sir?

136
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,585
Yes. I would imagine that
he's probably signing

137
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:53,987
out of the building
at this very moment.

138
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,723
Mr. Fushimi,
please tail him.

139
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:57,824
Why?!

140
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,493
There's a very good chance
that the Green Clan will

141
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:02,903
attempt to target him again.

142
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,871
So keep an eye on him.

143
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,940
Very well, sir.

144
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:10,744
Make sure Ms. Awashima
is kept up to date

145
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,445
with your findings.

146
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:13,680
That is all.

147
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:16,783
Where're you
off to, Captain?

148
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:18,785
Mihashira Tower.

149
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:20,854
What, again?

150
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:23,557
Lately, you spend more
time there in the Chamber

151
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,527
of the Slate than you
do here at home base.

152
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,601
A cat?

153
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:36,970
[chuckle]

154
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,573
Kuro!

155
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,407
Yes? What is it?

156
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:42,809
Oh...

157
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:45,612
I was actually just
talking to the cat.

158
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:49,616
Ah yes, I understand.
"Kuro" as in black cat.

159
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,284
Sorry.

160
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:54,555
[meow]

161
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:01,234
Mr. Zenjo...

162
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,406
Could I perhaps have a
moment of your time?

163
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,553
Now then, what can I do to
help you out, Lieutenant?

164
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,523
Today I'd like to talk not
as the lieutenant, but just

165
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,726
as someone who wants to
speak with Goki Zenjo.

166
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,428
Known as Zenjo the Ogre,
the name you used as the

167
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:32,633
right‐hand man of the
previous Blue King, Jin Habari.

168
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,971
To be honest, I doubt that
I'd have anything useful to

169
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,773
tell you, Lieutenant.

170
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,743
You're the only one Captain
Munakata personally

171
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,278
recruited from the clan
of the Blue King prior

172
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,414
to him, or so
I've been told.

173
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:52,586
But I am merely a clerk in
the Clan's Documents Office.

174
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,421
In the Kagutsu Incident
fourteen years ago, the

175
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,658
ex‐Red King's Sword
of Damocles crashed

176
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,925
to the ground.

177
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,902
You lost your left arm
during that disaster.

178
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:06,773
I've heard that without
you, the change in Japan's

179
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:09,676
topography would have
been far more cataclysmic.

180
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:13,780
Had you not been there the
entire Japanese archipelago

181
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,582
could have been torn apart.

182
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:19,419
The Weismann level of
the then‐Red King Genji

183
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:22,656
Kagutsu had become
terribly unstable.

184
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:24,858
The influence of that
threatened your king, Jin

185
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:28,428
Habari the Blue King, with
a Damocles Down too.

186
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:31,932
However, the
worst was averted.

187
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,336
Because before
that could happen...

188
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,774
Mr. Zenjo, you slew
the king yourself.

189
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:41,675
Yes.

190
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:42,876
[gasp]

191
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,646
I realize that this is
an impudent question

192
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,947
to ask you, but...

193
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:50,016
Please tell me, did you
notice anything different

194
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,553
about the previous Blue
King's behavior before

195
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:55,388
his Sword of Damocles
reached its limit?

196
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:58,559
You're worried about Captain
Munakata, aren't you?

197
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,893
[gasp]

198
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,468
I know that the Captain's
Sword of Damocles is

199
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:05,038
damaged. And it seems
clear that there are others

200
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:08,074
who have noticed
this fact, as well.

201
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:10,744
How is the Captain?

202
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:15,048
He seems to be
his usual self.

203
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:18,051
But ever since he's been
put in charge of Mihashira

204
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:20,721
Tower, he spends more
and more time in the

205
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:22,523
Chamber of the Slate.

206
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:26,827
And every time he goes there
I sense a change in him.

207
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:29,095
I understand.

208
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:34,668
Frankly, I'm afraid that the
reason the Captain asked

209
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:38,438
you to join Scepter 4 is
so you'll be able to carry

210
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:41,775
out the very same task
you once did years ago.

211
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:45,011
Are you sure that's my job?

212
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,115
I'm not Munakata's
right‐hand man. You are,

213
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,217
Lieutenant Awashima.

214
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,452
[gasp]

215
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,088
Thank you for the
refreshments. It's been

216
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:58,124
quite a while since I
had something sweet.

217
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,092
It was delicious.

218
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:05,606
Dresden Slate, possessor
of mysterious power.

219
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:08,709
I command you to obey me.

220
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,046
[growling]

221
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,917
It's no good! It's not
working! I can't see Shiro!

222
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,152
Are you one hundred percent
sure it actually showed

223
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:20,987
you the Silver King?

224
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:24,124
I know I saw him! I looked
into the marble and saw

225
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:27,493
Shiro inside! I'm
not lying, you know!

226
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:30,130
It's working just fine. I
infused energy into that

227
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:31,932
marble to let you
see the person

228
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:33,466
you want to see the most.

229
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,136
All right, well, if you
say so, Anna, then I

230
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:38,238
guess that it must be true.

231
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:41,975
Yeah, but I only got to
see Shiro that one time.

232
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:46,580
Come on, Anna! Let
me see Shiro again!

233
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:50,183
Sorry you can't see
him all the time,

234
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,186
but there's no doubt
you're connected to him.

235
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:55,989
The one who is precious to
you just might be looking

236
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:57,624
at you, as well!

237
00:13:57,658 --> 00:13:59,092
What, really?!

238
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,168
Shiro! Shiro! You there?!

239
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:03,837
Hey, listen!

240
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:06,940
What's the big idea, acting
like you own this place?!

241
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,175
You're from a whole
other clan, you know!

242
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:12,045
Yeah, but the boss with
glasses was trying to take

243
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:15,281
us away for questioning
or whatever he was doing!

244
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:17,851
Oh, I get it. So you
escaped and took

245
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,886
refuge here, is that it?

246
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:23,189
I gotta say that was
a pretty smart move.

247
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:24,891
The Blues can't
come after you while

248
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,860
you're here in
our territory.

249
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,731
What the hell?! Homra isn't
your personal litterbox!

250
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:33,033
But I hate the
boss with glasses!

251
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:35,636
And the jerk with glasses!

252
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,838
I don't wanna go to
the Blue Clan's place!

253
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:41,207
So what's the Black
Dog doing over there?

254
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:42,676
I dunno.

255
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,210
You dunno?!

256
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,979
I'm not worried
about Kuroh.

257
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:50,817
I can always see him
even if we're apart.

258
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,587
[chuckle]

259
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,922
You said for
questioning...

260
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:58,592
I guess even the
Blues are stumped.

261
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:01,568
No one really knows what the
Green Clan is up to now...

262
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,571
Well, I know those
guys are a creepy bunch.

263
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,707
The city's crawling with
people who're part of the

264
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,075
Greens, but most of them
are just normal dudes!

265
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,778
We can't even figure out
if they're actually real

266
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,246
clansmen or not!

267
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,081
And then there's the people
who look like they're going

268
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,718
about their business with
their PDAs who do turn out

269
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,252
to be linked to the Greens.

270
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,087
What a pain in the ass.

271
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,389
You guys don't think those
assholes are gonna come

272
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,759
after Anna again, do you?

273
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,394
Well, Anna is now
the new Red King.

274
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,030
They won't be able
to move against her

275
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,032
that easily anymore.

276
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,601
Even if they try,
I'll be fine.

277
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:39,239
I have inherited the red
from Mikoto and I can use

278
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,643
it to fight against
them. I won't lose.

279
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,713
Are you sure
about that, Anna?

280
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,815
Because I thought that Kuroh
had said something about

281
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:52,285
the Red power being
destined for destruction.

282
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:54,287
The King's power
isn't gonna make you

283
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,124
go kaboom, right? Or
something like that?

284
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,801
[chuckle]

285
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:03,937
Hm?

286
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:20,320
I may not be as strong
as Mikoto right now.

287
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,658
But I have this feeling
that I'll be just fine.

288
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,864
Hey, take it easy.

289
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:35,468
What do you want? I didn't
call for you, Totsuka.

290
00:16:35,502 --> 00:16:38,772
Yeah, but just look
around, it's all over.

291
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,142
Any further destruction
would be meaningless.

292
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:45,812
Destruction is destruction.
There's no meaning to it.

293
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:47,380
Well, yeah. That's true.

294
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:59,492
Bet you wanna say that
this is a power that should

295
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:02,235
be used to protect,
is that right?

296
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:06,039
It is unchecked power
itself that's destructive.

297
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,473
It's like a monster.

298
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:13,246
But it's really all
just a matter of how one

299
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,415
uses their power.

300
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:18,218
If you have something
that's precious close to you,

301
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:20,220
then it can become
a power to protect.

302
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:22,756
And the monster will
become your friend.

303
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:24,190
Right?

304
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:26,359
Mikoto, your red
is very pretty.

305
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,930
[sigh] You think so?

306
00:17:56,957 --> 00:18:00,767
I inherited this power
to protect everyone.

307
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,971
My power comes from
Izumo, Misaki, Rikio,

308
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:06,573
and everyone at Homra.

309
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:08,542
Tatara and Mikoto, too.

310
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,377
That's why I'm sure I'm
going to be fine. Because

311
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:14,447
this pretty red
is my friend.

312
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:15,281
Mm‐hm!

313
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:19,385
And I, I'm gonna
protect you too, Anna!

314
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,488
I mean, I know that you're
on a whole other level of

315
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:25,091
strength compared to
the rest of us now.

316
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,459
But still...

317
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:30,130
All the time I kept saying
how great Mr. Mikoto was,

318
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,099
but I never really
tried to understand him.

319
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:36,570
I guess there's still a lot
that I don't know about.

320
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:40,841
But I want to be someone
you can rely on, Anna.

321
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,476
I am willing to do whatever
it takes to be someone

322
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:45,145
you can lean on.

323
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:48,414
Wow, Yata! That
was so touching.

324
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:51,251
Yeah, you'll be fine,
Anna! I'm so happy!

325
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:52,152
Yes!

326
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,355
And I'll bring Shiro to see
you when he comes back!

327
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:58,458
He's been a King for a
seriously long time, and

328
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:01,935
that means, that he can
teach you lots of stuff!

329
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:03,003
Yes.

330
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:05,005
I'd love to talk to him.

331
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:07,974
Hey, hold on! That isn't the
way things are done! Kings

332
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:09,843
aren't supposed to be
all buddy‐buddy with

333
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:11,344
each other, you know.

334
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:12,478
But why not?

335
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,180
Huh? Well, hell
if I know what the

336
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,449
goddamned reason is.

337
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:19,185
Look, that's just the
way it is, all right?

338
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:21,487
It's better to get along!

339
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,890
Yes, Neko is right.

340
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:24,958
[sigh]

341
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,193
Now, now, let's stop
all of this bickering

342
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:28,662
guys and eat up.

343
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:31,665
Yay! Snack
time! Awesome!

344
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:33,567
Mr. Kusanagi, I
want some too!

345
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:34,568
Me, too!

346
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:36,503
Wow, it looks
so yummy! Yay!

347
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:37,571
Come and get it, then!

348
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:39,205
Yeah!

349
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,041
Hey!

350
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,009
Hey! That's my
pancake, Rikio!

351
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:51,184
You know what? Kuroh made
this dish for me just the

352
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,386
other day, too. [chuckle]

353
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:56,489
And he said things like,
"Master Ichigen used to put

354
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,324
dark molasses on these."

355
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,493
"He liked pancakes, too."

356
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:03,036
Kuroh sure can get pretty
annoying with his long,

357
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:06,472
boring talks, but I
do love his cooking!

358
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,976
Oh! I like yours too,
sunglasses guy!

359
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,344
Thank you very much.

360
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,015
Black molasses. That's
not a bad idea at all.

361
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,184
So, Neko. You like
Kuroh, too, not just

362
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,220
his cooking, right?

363
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,288
Hmm...

364
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:27,460
Well I like Shiro most of
all, and Kuroh is more like...

365
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:31,231
I guess that he'd rank
right after fish, maybe?

366
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,066
Neko...

367
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,300
Meow?

368
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,970
Why don't you and Kuroh come
and live with us right here?

369
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,238
Meow, meow, meow?!

370
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,040
You'd both be
welcome to stay here

371
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,475
until Yashiro returns.

372
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,244
It's safer here.

373
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,413
Don't you guys have a
territory of your own?

374
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:51,184
Oh wait, I guess not, since
your King went missing

375
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,653
right after you
became his clansmen.

376
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:53,887
Hm...

377
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,890
Uh, I'm sorry.

378
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,258
It's okay.

379
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,193
Seriously, though...

380
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,603
I mean it! You guys are
welcomed to stay here,

381
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:04,337
just like Anna said.

382
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,672
Don't worry!

383
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,007
Neko?

384
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,576
Because even
without a territory...

385
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,415
Hey, Kuroh! [giggling]

386
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,284
So, where have you been
all this time, anyway?

387
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:21,454
[giggle] I didn't want to
see the boss with glasses,

388
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:23,724
so I was hiding out
over at Anna's place.

389
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:25,358
Seriously?

390
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:26,459
[giggle]

391
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:28,028
What is it?

392
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:30,931
You remember this marble?

393
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,099
Well, apparently it won't
always be able to show

394
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,635
Shiro to us.

395
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,437
But Anna is sure that
it's connected to him!

396
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:39,606
And she even told me
that Shiro just might be

397
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,441
watching us, as well!

398
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,043
Is that so?

399
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:46,613
Everything's gonna be
okay! So let's go home!

400
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:51,117
I can offer you Scepter
4's protection.

401
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:55,956
I do appreciate the offer,
but I can't accept it.

402
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:59,459
I don't have a territory
but nonetheless, I do

403
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:03,136
have a place I call home.

404
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:04,571
You'd both be
welcome to stay here

405
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,973
until Yashiro returns.

406
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:08,241
It's okay.

407
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:11,111
Because even
without a territory,

408
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:13,514
I still have a
home where I belong!

409
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:16,517
Yes, you're right.

410
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,452
Let's go home to the
place that we belong!

411
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:26,192
[chatter]

412
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:31,097
You're too kind. You're
too kind. You're too kind.

413
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,613
<i>The place where Kuroh</i>
<i>and Neko belong, the home</i>

414
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:14,615
<i>they've sworn to protect.</i>

415
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:17,884

416

<i>to take his life.</i>

418
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:27,460

420
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:35,301
