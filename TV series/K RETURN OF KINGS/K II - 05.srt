00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,179
[attacking yell]

2
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:15,916
[self chuckle]

00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,754
[groaning]
[attacking grunts]

4
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,756
Get all of them!

5
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,258
Zap yourself with this!

6
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,960
[groaning]

7
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,096
Like they say,
don't resist arrest!

8
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,266
[humming]

9
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,105
Domyoji, you shouldn't
go charging in like that.

10
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,474
What, why not? I mean,
come on! The Reds have

11
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,376
got our backs, don't they?

12
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,345
And those guys act fast!

13
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,514
So all that we really
have to do is scatter

14
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,783
the Greens, and after
that, the Reds will

15
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,285
just go ahead and
handle the rest of it!

16
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,288
Well, speaking tactically,
you aren't wrong about that,

17
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,825
but we shouldn't rely on
other clans too much.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,133
[chuckle]

19
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:06,339
Akiyama, bring the police
transport vehicle around.

20
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:08,908
Yep, we got 'em
all rounded up.

21
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:14,548
Look, the Reds' have their
own network to track crimes.

22
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,383
And they also employ
resources that our clan

23
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:19,385
tends to overlook.

24
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:21,321
It's thanks to them
we subdued these

25
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,323
suspects so fast.

26
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:25,992
It wouldn't hurt to
show them gratitude.

27
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,829
I will admit that they have
helped drastically improve

28
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:31,598
the ease and effectiveness
of our patrols.

29
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,266
In the end, this
whole partnership has

30
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,868
worked out just fine.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,108
We'll handle the prisoners.

32
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:43,176
Alright.

33
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,517
Oh! Thanks for this!

34
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:54,054
So should we just put 'em
in that car now, or what?

35
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,622
Yes, please do so.

36
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,357
Make sure they're
tightly restrained.

37
00:01:57,357 --> 00:02:00,433
All of this buddy‐buddy
stuff is making me sick...

38
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:47,413
But why can't I go in?!

39
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,649
You just can't.

40
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,717
Meow‐Meow? Hmph!

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,588
Meow!

42
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:00,734
It's the first time I've been
in your room, Lieutenant.

43
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:06,707
So this is where you
lived all those years.

44
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:09,710
All alone.

45
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:16,550
Guess what, Lieutenant.

46
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:22,088
My sister left behind
something amazing for us.

47
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:32,132
They dug it out from the
remains of the shelter next

48
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:34,433
to my old research lab
several years after

49
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,402
we went our separate ways.

50
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:41,274
It was simply stored in a
random box and ultimately

51
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,210
donated to the library,
where it stayed until

52
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,312
Mr. Kusanagi
rediscovered it.

53
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,716
You know, he's the
Reds' second in command.

54
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:55,221
I think Sis knew that
this was going to happen.

55
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:58,559
About how you'd stop
at nothing to make sure

56
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:01,301
that the dreams we
shared were fulfilled.

57
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,170
And how I would stumble
once that dream all

58
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,272
of it became too big.

59
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,515
[chuckle]

60
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,091
"Irren ist menschlich."

61
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,495
Huh?!

62
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,765
Shiro!

63
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,203
Are you all finished?

64
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,841
Yeah. There really
wasn't much to go through.

65
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,644
Hardly any personal
effects at all.

66
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,156
Meow?!

67
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,459
[chuckle]

68
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,335
I know the Lieutenant's
original order was for you

69
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:05,238
to assist me until I
returned to the surface.

70
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:09,242
I'm sorry to make you
extend that term for so long.

71
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,348
Thank you for those thoughtful words
from the friend of our King.

72
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,422
As per our King's dying
orders, the Gold Clan's

73
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:25,491
Tokijikuin will
engage solely in

74
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,261
the maintenance of
the existing system.

75
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:30,597
And we ask for your
approval to cease

76
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:33,433
active participation
in this matter.

77
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:40,507
Permission granted.
[chuckle]

78
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:44,511
For your service to
Daikaku Kokujoji, I

79
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:46,513
offer my heartfelt thanks.

80
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,704
It's somewhat unfortunate
that we can't rely

81
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,206
on the Gold Clan for
military support.

82
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:09,409
That group is not
only a fighting unit.

83
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,312
They hold an important
post, managing the Slate

84
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:14,581
and secretly maintaining
the whole country.

85
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,751
So we can't try to
recruit them carelessly

86
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,319
and risk losing them.

87
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:22,222
The Lieutenant knew
that fact all too well.

88
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:24,591
That's why his orders to
assist me extended only

89
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,827
till I came back
and no further.

90
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:30,396
So, with the Gold King
gone is the one who's

91
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,266
going to manage the
Slate now the Blue King?

92
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:35,736
Hold on. Don't tell me that
you still hold a grudge

93
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,672
against him because
he defeated you?

94
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:43,443
The boss with glasses goes
flash! Dodge! Step! Swoosh!

95
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:46,412
Wham! Bam! "I'm
over here." "What?!"

96
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:49,783
Achoo! Bitch slap!
Jab! Jab! Jab! Kaboom!

97
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,919
"Ha, ha, ha, ha..."

98
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,624
And then...

99
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,826
[chuckle]

100
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,836
Yup, he totally kicked
your butt, all right!

101
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:07,373
It's nothing personal like
that! I mean, it's just...

102
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,974
[chuckling]

103
00:08:11,044 --> 00:08:15,448
So, as I already explained,
oversight of Mihashira

104
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:18,451
Tower and the Dresden
Slate has been officially

105
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:21,021
turned over to
us, SCEPTER FOUR.

106
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:24,625
You should also receive a
letter from the Gold Clan.

107
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:28,562
So you get to act like
a king now that His

108
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,864
Excellency is gone, huh?

109
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,633
I'm certainly not "acting."

110
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,002
I was chosen by
the Slate for this.

111
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,972
One other thing: the
authority, now possessed

112
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:42,408
only by the Gold Clan,
to issue orders to every

113
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:43,977
government agency
will need to be

114
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,046
transferred over to us.

115
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,981
[gasp] Now?! Just when‐‐

116
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:49,750
"Just when the weight
that was hanging over

117
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:53,053
my head is finally
gone?" Is that it?

118
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:57,691
Let me reassure you,
Mr. Prime Minister.

119
00:08:57,724 --> 00:08:59,593
We have no intention
of controlling this

120
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,669
country's future to pursue
our own self‐interest.

121
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:04,838
Currently, we are going
up against the Green

122
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:07,073
Clan, an organization
that threatens the

123
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:09,510
peace of our
entire nation.

124
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:11,912
And I simply want to
request cooperation from

125
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:15,015
various quarters. That's
the entirety of it.

126
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,551
You demand the sole
authority to give orders

127
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,586
and call it a "request"?

128
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,588
One must have a solid
foundation if one

129
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,089
wishes to maintain order.

130
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:28,529
So, Mr. Prime Minister, I
"request" your cooperation.

131
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:32,633
In other words, I have
to obey you, is that it?

132
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:35,536
If you wish to put
it that way, yes.

133
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:49,716
It seems the partnership
with the Blue Clan is going

134
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,052
far better than we ever
could have expected.

135
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:55,488
Uh‐huh.

136
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,074
Aw man, they're so lucky.

137
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,912
Hey, Mr. Kusanagi. Why
do I have to be here

138
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,914
on standby, anyway?

139
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,517
We're supposed to be
crushing the Green Clan.

140
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,051
HOMRA is gonna look
pretty damn bad without

141
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,954
Yatagarasu joining
the party, you know.

142
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,557
Listen, Yata, you're
like the reserves.

143
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,059
We need you here at the
ready just in case something

144
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,930
happens to go sideways out
there with all of the others.

145
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,566
So what you're telling me is
that I'm a benchwarmer?!

146
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,869
[chuckle] Don't get
all bent out of shape.

147
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,605
Besides, aren't you the
one who said you're

148
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,141
going to make sure that
Anna stays protected?

149
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,710
Well yeah, but...

150
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,115
Yata, you have to learn that
you don't always have to be

151
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,618
at the center of everything.

152
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,720
This is a good chance
for you to practice!

153
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,656
Fine!

154
00:10:58,925 --> 00:10:59,993
[sigh]

155
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:02,569
[chuckle]

156
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:04,738
The Green King himself
has actually been pretty

157
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,573
quiet for a while now.

158
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:09,009
Ever since that incident
over on school island.

159
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,445
As usual, the ones
acting up are only the

160
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:14,414
low‐ranking clansmen.

161
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,684
Blues in public and
Reds behind the scenes.

162
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,853
As long as he's being
watched by both sides like

163
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,424
this, he can't do anything
drastic. But still...

164
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:34,467
He's not really being
pressured now. He's just

165
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,603
saving up his strength.

166
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:40,173
So he's merely sharpening
his fangs before he makes

167
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:42,643
his next big move, huh?

168
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:53,453
That sure makes me uneasy.

169
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:56,456
What is there to be
afraid of? I mean, we've

170
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:58,959
got Anna and two other
Kings on our side!

171
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,502
Even if those green worms
bring out their boss, we can

172
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,203
still crush them, no problem!
[fumbling grunts]

173
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,812
Even with three kings
it won't be easy...

174
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,086
Mr. Kusanagi, please tell
the Red King to keep an eye

175
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,988
on the Blue King's condition.

176
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,225
His condition? How so?

177
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,663
Honestly, I can't
exactly say for sure,

178
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:31,865
but he's unstable.

179
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,067
Like when...

180
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:50,684
[gasp]

181
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:53,053
The burden of
killing a king?!

182
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,559
It's starting to show.
Don't tell me you haven't

183
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:00,060
noticed it as well?

184
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:03,269
If you mean his Sword
of Damocles, I have...

185
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:08,809
It's not like something's
going to happen immediately.

186
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:10,911
But we can't ignore it.

187
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:14,214
So we'd better be
on high alert.

188
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,226
There's no guarantee how
much help we can count on.

189
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,795
I just really wish that we
didn't have to worry about more

190
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:31,932
casualties coming out of
this whole damn mess.

191
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,236
I guess it's not going
to be that simple.

192
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:39,740
It's all because of the
Slate that I was able to

193
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,243
meet Mikoto and all of the
other people in HOMRA.

194
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:49,650
But still, if the Slate is
going to continue to cause

195
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:52,619
people to meet the same
fate as Mikoto did.

196
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,187
Well, then I‐‐

197
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:56,857
Anna, what're you saying?!

198
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:05,305
Is it really that bad?

199
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,309
I mean with the Blue King?

200
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:23,824
Shiro? Shiro?!

201
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,961
Shiro?

202
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:30,897
Hey!

203
00:14:30,964 --> 00:14:31,998
Shiro!

204
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:34,968
Where is he?
Where is he?!

205
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:40,140
Hey, where's Shiro?

206
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,043
He stepped out a moment ago.

207
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:47,147
What?! Where'd he go?!
I want to go, too!

208
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:50,216
Please, Neko, just leave
him be for right now.

209
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:53,987
He probably wants some
time to think things over.

210
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:58,191
Aw! But I just got
to see him again.

211
00:14:58,224 --> 00:15:00,767
[grumbling] Fine!

212
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,235
Meow!

213
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,017
This country will come
to an end unless we

214
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,953
do something... fast.

215
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,027
Seems the Blue King decided
to ignore your warnings.

216
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,362
And after all the
trouble you went through.

217
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,197
I feel sorry for you.

218
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:35,368
I really don't appreciate
being spied on, not one bit.

219
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,704
Green King, Nagare Hisui.

220
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,106
My eyes are everywhere.

221
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,776
It's my only true freedom.

222
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,486
So you come crawling
out the moment that

223
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:55,221
the Lieutenant dies.

224
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,958
I have to say, you
really are quite

225
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,459
the cunning person.

226
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,302
This coming from the man
who decides to act only

227
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:05,071
after his best friend dies?

228
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:08,108
It's quite ironic...

229
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:11,277
That one stung. Well, I
can't really deny it. You

230
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:13,346
certainly got me there.

231
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:14,915
So what now?

232
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:18,952
Well, now that we've
exchanged pleasantries let's

233
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,854
move on to the main topic.

234
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,992
I've been waiting for
your return for a while

235
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,763
now so that I can give
you this proposal.

236
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:38,004
First King, Silver King,
Adolf K. Weismann.

237
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,274
Would you like to
join forces with me?

238
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:43,877
[chuckle]

239
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,346
I thought you came here
to join our Coffee Table

240
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:49,449
Alliance, so that the
four of us could work to

241
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:51,518
bring peace to the world.

242
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,788
But now it doesn't
sound like it.

243
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:58,458
Coffee Table Alliance?
I do respect the name.

244
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,134
But no, that's not
the reason that I'm

245
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,803
contacting you now.

246
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:04,370
Instead, I want to talk
about forming a new

247
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:06,472
alliance, just you and me.

248
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:09,475
Together we'll advance
mankind's evolution.

249
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,980
That used to be your
life's goal, didn't it?

250
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,817
Back in Dresden,
seventy years ago.

251
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:23,924
The Dresden Slate. It makes
us kings and gives power to

252
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,193
our clansmen. It's an
evolution accelerator.

253
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:30,096
But for decades, the
all‐powerful Gold King

254
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,865
kept it under control.

255
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:35,001
As a result, only a minimal
number of Strains were born.

256
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,571
He even managed to
contain the birth of kings

257
00:17:37,604 --> 00:17:42,342
within the Kanto region of
Japan. But this great power...

258
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:45,078
We will release it.

259
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:50,951
I see. So that's your goal,
is it? For what purpose?

260
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:52,385
Like I just said...

261
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:56,056
Simply to advance the
evolution of mankind.

262
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:57,357
That is all of it.

263
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,434
If that's true, that means
you're even more dangerous

264
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,069
than I thought you were.

265
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,239
I think that I'll choose to
take that as a compliment,

266
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,108
but in any event...

267
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,376
That is my dream.

268
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:13,880
Your dream?

269
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,119
That dream...

270
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:20,453
Has been shattered?

271
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:25,892
Then rebuild that dream
again, this time with me.

272
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:29,930
The situation is entirely
different than seventy years

273
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:35,301
ago. This time there
is nothing to stop us.

274
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:40,974
We simply have
to take action.

275
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:49,482
[gasp]

276
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,287
Respectfully, I refuse!

277
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,356
But why?

278
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,592
Because everything is
different from the way that

279
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:00,366
it was seventy years ago!

280
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:03,970
And here I thought
that you would find my

281
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:05,672
proposal to your liking.

282
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:08,642
But it appears I
was wrong about that.

283
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,044
Well, no matter.

284
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:12,946
I'm just going to
have to take the

285
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,548
Slate by force, then.

286
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:15,682
[gasp]

287
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:18,318
The Blue King foolishly
thinks he can suppress

288
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:21,187
the Slate's power, just
as the Gold King did.

289
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,457
So I was just going to
wait until that rookie

290
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,294
exhausted himself. That
was my original plan.

291
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:30,964
But this calls for a change.

292
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:34,200
Now that I've come
back you won't be able

293
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,569
to do as you please.

294
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:37,470
I see...

295
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,341
I wanted to partner with you
and move the world forward.

296
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:46,713
However, if instead you wish
to choose confrontation...

297
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:49,415
I'm happy to oblige.

298
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:57,490
There's one other thing I
want to confirm with you.

299
00:19:58,091 --> 00:19:59,392
The incident last year...

300
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,035
Is it safe for me to
assume that you were the

301
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:06,272
one who dragged me
into this little game?

302
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,345
Oh, so you figured
it out, huh?

303
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,349
This body I'm in, not even
the Blue Clan's Yuishiki

304
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,019
System could identify it.

305
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:24,124
Only you could've pulled
off a stunt like that.

306
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,493
So that means that the
person who made all of

307
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,563
the arrangements for
the actions taken by

308
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,632
the Colorless King
and who sent him to

309
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,134
attack me, was
in fact you!

310
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:46,513
Yes, I see. Removing every
trace of his existence,

311
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:50,050
making the death appear
accidental, and of course

312
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,185
providing critical data.

313
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,188
All of the things that I
took such pains with turned

314
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,357
out to be my downfall.

315
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,661
I do have a habit of
being too elaborate.

316
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:04,037
But why do all of this
just to get to me?

317
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,073
Because your role is
not to be a spectator.

318
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,441
It's to be a player.

319
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:11,211
After all, everything
started with you.

320
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:13,747
Do you intend to
control the Slate?

321
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,286
Or rather,
unleash its power?

322
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,188
You could say that.

323
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:27,528
So just relax, sit back, and
entrust your dream to us.

324
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:32,432
And what happens
if I say no?

325
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,649
If that's your choice,
then it means war.

326
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,419
I never wanted
any of this...

327
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,089
But still, I will
not run away.

328
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:24,591
Not this time.

329
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,613
The three Kings
assemble at the tower.

330
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:16,583
To stop the Green King from
reducing the world to chaos.

331
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:19,419
But we have not yet
witnessed the terrifying

332
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:21,722
power that will
shake everything up.

333
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:24,991
There are those who
must fight and those

334
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:26,760
who must defend.

335
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:32,465
Next time on K RETURN OF
KINGS, Episode 6 "Keeper."

336
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:38,238
Mikoto, do you think I can
fulfill my role as King?
