1
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,369
We'll be in the airspace
over the site shortly.

2
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,104
What's the situation there?

3
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,773
<i>Enemy clan confirmed.</i>

4
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,008
<i>Special Police Forces</i>
<i>are also on the scene.</i>

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,046
Roger. Now entering site
airspace. Alert the Special

6
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,981
Police Force to be on guard.

7
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:48,949
<i>Copy that.</i>

8
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,853
Target confirmed.

9
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,320
Shall we descend?

10
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,023
No, that won't be necessary.

11
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:09,075
[harrumphing chuckle]

12
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:15,148
That group is
nothing but trouble.

13
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,085
Captain, please!

14
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,221
Let us at least
touch down first!

15
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,856
[gasps]

16
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:25,425
I'm sorry, but it would
be very rude of me to

17
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:27,160
keep the Red King waiting.

18
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:30,363
Both of you, please
return to the base now.

19
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,911
[gasp]

20
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:50,083
He just dropped out of
the sky! Did you see that!

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,923
Wow, now that's what I call
making a grand entrance...

22
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,902
Third King Mikoto Suoh...

23
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:05,438
Your actions are as
unruly and chaotic

24
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,240
as they always are.

25
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:10,243
Fourth King Reisi Munakata...

26
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:15,415
Your face looks as awful and
annoying as it always does.

27
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:21,487
Why don't we have
some fun, Misaki?

28
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,058
Nice kick!

29
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,093
And nice catch
too! [laughter]

30
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,096
[chuckle]

31
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,246
Burn them all.

32
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:50,116
No blood! No bone! No ash!

33
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:54,120
We will advance with our
swords in our hands.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,590
We will triumph because
our cause is just.

35
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:58,258
Men! Draw your swords!

36
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,425
[chuckle]

37
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,326
Akiyama, ready!

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,201
Benzai, ready!

39
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:02,202
Kamo, ready!

40
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:03,103
Domyoji, ready!

41
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:04,004
Enomoto, ready!

42
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:04,971
Fuse, ready!

43
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:05,872
Goto, ready!

44
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:06,507
Hidaka, ready!

45
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,942
Fushimi, ready!

46
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:13,179
And Awashima, ready!

47
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:17,818
Munakata ready!

48
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:21,387
[harrumphing chuckle]

49
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:23,156
Totsuka...

50
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:24,324
You got it.

51
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:26,492
C'mon, let's go, Anna.

52
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:28,228
Mikoto...

53
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:41,407
You continue to use
your power recklessly.

54
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:43,209
You're incorrigible.

55
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:45,345
I don't need a lecture.

56
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:48,181
Then I'll have to
stop you with force!

57
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:51,518
Fine by me, Munakata!

58
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:55,556
Let's see you handle
this, Mikoto Suoh!

59
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:00,233
[chuckle]

60
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,038
Is that all you've got?

61
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,578
That flame...

62
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:13,379
It's quite impressive.

63
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,015
However...

64
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:21,555
Mr. Mikoto!

65
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,027
Saruhiko!

66
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,229
Come here an
play, Misaki!

67
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:32,232
I'll play, but don't cry
when I plaster you!

68
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,369
Over here, you
damn Monkey!

69
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:39,305
You're going down today...

70
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,908
...ya good for
nothing traitor!

71
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:44,277
[chuckle]

72
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:49,415
Sounds interesting!
Let's see you try!

73
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,251
[chuckling]

74
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,319
Like that'd stop me!

75
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:57,323
What's wrong? You
look pretty rusty!

76
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,126
Look, Saruhiko, why don't
you just shut up, already?

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,502
You stupid monkey!

78
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,340
It's time to end this.
I'm done with you.

79
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,276
Why don't you go take
a nap or something?!

80
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,413
This is nothing!

81
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,683
You'd better watch out,
or you're seriously

82
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,184
gonna get it!

83
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,355
Since you're not
paying attention! See!

84
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,427
[chuckle] Misaki!

85
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,502
So sorry about this, but
I'm in a hurry. Excuse me!

86
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,003
Hey, watch it!
That's dangerous.

87
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,371
Sorry for scaring you!

88
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,306
Daddy, look! Look!

89
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,510
Well, that was
a fancy move.

90
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,311
Huh? Uh‐oh, heads up!

91
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,318
Oops... Oh, boy.
I guess I overdid

92
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,020
it a little bit, there.

93
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,792
Whoa! [chuckle] Sorry...

94
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,167
I didn't mean for
that to happen, Seri.

95
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,137
[nervous chuckle]

96
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,141
And just what's so funny?

97
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:15,516
Don't underestimate
Scepter 4, Homra!

98
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,184
[gasp]

99
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:26,560
Come!

100
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:27,661
Right...

101
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:29,495
Well, let's get
on with it, then.

102
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,598
This one's mine!

103
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,736
Woo! This pumps me up!

104
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,171
Submit to your arrest!

105
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:42,208
If you stand in my way,
then I'll blast you away!

106
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,545
Take this, damn Blue!

107
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,614
You're pretty fast
for a guy your size!

108
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:49,215
Time to cut loose!

109
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,718
Sounds like your attitude
fits our team better!

110
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:54,254
Trying to recruit
me? No thanks!

111
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:57,691
Sorry, but you're not strong
enough to bring me down.

112
00:06:57,724 --> 00:07:00,226
[chuckle] See if you
say that after I show

113
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:01,602
you my cool moves!

114
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:04,470
[gasps]

115
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:05,539
Stay back.

116
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,472
I've got this.

117
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,410
Don't worry, Anna. It looks
like everyone is just having

118
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,078
a great time tonight.

119
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:15,782
But they're fighting.

120
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:17,718
Yes, that is true.

121
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,886
But doesn't it also
look to you like they

122
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,122
might be dancing?

123
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:25,458
Just like this butterfly.

124
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:33,834
So pretty!

125
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:38,271
The Dresden Slate, a
mysterious relic that

126
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:41,107
selects seven Kings and
bestows upon them each

127
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:44,678
a Sword of Damocles along
with its great power.

128
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:45,646
[defiant chuckle]

129
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,848
Taken into the country
by Daikaku Kokujoji

130
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,650
after World War
II, it brought

131
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:52,185
unprecedented
prosperity to Japan.

132
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:55,421
Every so often, a
new king is selected.

133
00:07:57,257 --> 00:08:00,767
Some live to wield its
power. While others died to

134
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:02,636
protect their friends.

135
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:07,541
While still others choose
to watch over the world.

136
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:11,712
And now, as an era
comes to a close...

137
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,650
A peculiar bond will
merge all the Kings'

138
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,152
paths into one.

139
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:34,500
[humming]

140
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:53,419
[chuckling]

141
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,856
High Score Kill.
Found ya!

142
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:01,001
By the authority given
to me by my J‐Rank,

143
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:03,937
launch Mission 2086.

144
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:05,071
[chuckling]

145
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:10,744
Voiceprint verified. Mission
2086 authorized by J‐Rank.

146
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,245
Activate!

147
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:16,917
Thanks!

148
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,452
[chuckle]

149
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:22,556
Hey, Kuroh! When
are we gonna eat?

150
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:25,458
[giggle] Wow! A bird?

151
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:28,228
[giggle]

152
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:30,564
Well, you can't eat
it, whatever it is.

153
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:31,632
Hey!

154
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,301
Target acquired. You've
earned 100 JUNGLE points.

155
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:46,046
How's that incident report
from the other day coming?

156
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,381
I'm putting it together
now, but I don't know.

157
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:50,483
Something's off.

158
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:52,418
Damn, I'm exhausted.

159
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:54,755
I know, right? You
can say that again.

160
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:56,489
It's been like
this every day!

161
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:58,592
Hard day, huh,
Mr. Domyoji?

162
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,702
Yeah I'm completely
wiped out, Hidaka.

163
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,237
Domyoji, Kamo, let me get
this straight, you've been

164
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,339
sent out two days in a row?

165
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,742
[harrumph] That is rough.

166
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,445
Yeah, it's the same for you
and Benzai, right, Akiyama?

167
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,217
Three days for me, and today
is Akiyama's fourth day.

168
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,720
We just got back here and
barely had enough time to

169
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,688
take a shower and change.

170
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,356
The reports just
keep coming.

171
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,958
There's no time
to rest at all.

172
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:26,793
Enomoto, Fuse.

173
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,395
Are there any leads on
Kuroh Yatogami? Have you

174
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,364
discovered anything
about where he went

175
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,599
after the explosion?

176
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,568
No, not a thing.

177
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,537
Fuse pressured that
informant they brought in

178
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,706
really hard, but we ended
up with nothing useful.

179
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,408
This is only a hunch,
but I have a suspicion

180
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,277
that he must've gone
into hiding with

181
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,446
that female partner of his.

182
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,914
I wouldn't be surprised.

183
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,051
After all, the Green Clan
did go out of their way to

184
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,486
target him in particular.

185
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,421
The truth is, we're
already spread so thin

186
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,624
with all the trouble
happening everywhere.

187
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,793
I don't know how
we'll keep up.

188
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,069
Goto, what do you think
the Green Clan is thinking

189
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:04,838
about right now?

190
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:06,940
Well honestly,
I have no idea.

191
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,743
Are you guys
stupid or what?

192
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:12,913
Aside from their leaders,
the Green Clan foot soldiers

193
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,915
aren't thinking anything.

194
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:17,651
Huh? What do you
mean, Mr. Fushimi?

195
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,452
[sigh]

196
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:22,523
Oh. Thanks so much.

197
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:26,593
Let's see, here. This reads,
"I've finally made it to

198
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,595
N‐Rank status."

199
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,463
"I'm gonna keep on
earning points, and the

200
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:32,999
more that I have,
the more power I get."

201
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,335
Mr. Fushimi, what is this?

202
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:38,839
"Your mission: to keep on
bullying the Black Dog. And

203
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:42,709
keep on toying with
the Blues, as well."

204
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,111
It's the underground
website for users from

205
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,480
Jungle, the Green Clan.

206
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,817
To their sick minds,
all of this is nothing

207
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:52,318
but a game.

208
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:57,658
It seems the Green Clan is
giving us quite a hard time.

209
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,893
Yes, much to our dismay...

210
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,503
They're using an advanced
tool to remain anonymous on

211
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:05,371
the Net and orchestrate
incidents across the city,

212
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,841
as if it's all just for fun.

213
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:10,577
Last night, in the midst
of our investigations in

214
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:13,680
Shizume, we had an encounter
with the Red Clan that

215
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:15,982
ended in a stare‐down.

216
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,519
Something wrong, Captain?

217
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:22,388
So, they still had
that option, did they?

218
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:23,489
Huh?

219
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,826
It's merely the method
that they're employing

220
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,528
to harass us.

221
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:30,564
Ms. Awashima,
contact the Red Clan.

222
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:33,366
And please do so as
quickly as possible.

223
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,935
Yes, sir.

224
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:42,509
Hey, Yata. It looks
like Anna fell asleep.

225
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:45,411
You guys...

226
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,848
Don't just stand
around doing nothing.

227
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:51,084
Put a blanket on the little
lady or something, would ya?

228
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,892
Yeah, it is getting
pretty chilly these days.

229
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:00,527
Chitose.

230
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:02,903
Is it true what I
heard? You and the Blues

231
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:05,972
got into some kinda
tussle again last night?

232
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,207
[confident chuckle]

233
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,443
Well that was only a run‐in
with the pretty lieutenant.

234
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:12,212
I'm guessing that they
wanted to save face or

235
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:14,114
something like that.

236
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,983
But they had come on
to our turf so we

237
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,484
couldn't back down.

238
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,221
In the end, Mr. Kusanagi
stepped in and got

239
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,089
things under control.

240
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:24,758
Oh, I see.

241
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,827
You know Eric and I
almost got into it with

242
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,629
the Blues, as well.

243
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:31,565
But the whole thing just
fizzled out, no big deal.

244
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:34,601
Those guys have really been
on constant alert lately.

245
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,137
They're even starting to
step into our territories.

246
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,072
They're stirring
up a lotta shit.

247
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:41,007
[chuckle] Hey there, San.

248
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:43,476
Just what're you
up to over here?

249
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,946
Hm... Someone just posted
something online that

250
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:48,481
seems to be grabbing
a lot of attention.

251
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,150
Hold on, what is this?!

252
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:51,818
Hm?! [gasp]

253
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:54,955
What's the matter, Shohei?

254
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:57,524
Just look!

255
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:58,659
Why do you guys
look so freaked out?

256
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,702
[gasps]

257
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:08,975
Hi, there! Hey, listen, I'm
sorry about yesterday, Seri.

258
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,811
But I'll make it up to you.

259
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:32,666
Yeah, I know. We're
supposed to be pushing

260
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,067
the guy who has the
Slate, the Blue

261
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,302
King, to the point
of exhaustion.

262
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:38,672
And we also want to bully
the Silver Clan so we can

263
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:41,307
get their King to come
out of hiding, right?

264
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,810
So I got to thinking. Why
not make things even more

265
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:48,682
exciting by having the Red
Clan join the event, as well?

266
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,017
Yup, I already
gave the orders,

267
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:52,719
Nagare.

268
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:56,990
Damn it!

269
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:59,359
That's the one thing you
bastards should've known

270
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,234
better than to disrespect!

271
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,236
You won't get
away with this!

272
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,850
Those times were
something really precious!

273
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:32,132
I was here that last time.

274
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,901
[gasp]

275
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,377
Oh, it's you...

276
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,446
What are you doing
here, Saruhiko?!

277
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:50,216
You figured out the source
of the feed too, huh?

278
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,385
Convenient how the
address of this building

279
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,622
was encrypted into the
message posted online.

280
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:59,225
You idiot. This is
obviously a trap!

281
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,401
I bet Mr. Kusanagi
was the one who

282
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,303
actually figured it out.

283
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,305
And you must have heard the
location and rushed here

284
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:08,108
right away, all by yourself.

285
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:10,911
Right, Misaki?

286
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:16,349
Look, just shut up. I'm here
on Mr. Kusanagi's orders.

287
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:20,253
The rest of Homra is
gonna be here soon.

288
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:23,256
Sure, we know that
we're being lured here,

289
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,325
but a lead is still a lead.

290
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,461
I mean, that is why
you're here too isn't it?

291
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,670
Hey, Saruhiko...

292
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,473
What you did for us before,
it was thanks to you that‐‐

293
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:44,545
All this fuss over
some stupid video.

294
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:48,281
Monkey, what did
you just say to me?!

295
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,349
Oh?

296
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:52,485
Honestly now, can you
really say that I'm wrong?

297
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,321
I'm happy to say it
again it's stupid.

298
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:56,289
Take it back.

299
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,960
[chuckle] Stop being
such a fool, Misaki.

300
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,067
Take it back!

301
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:05,371
Mikoto Suoh is dead. Just
face the truth, he's gone!

302
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:06,372
Monkey!

303
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:08,074
Take it back, or else!

304
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,477
[fighting grunts]

305
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:16,650
[chuckling]

306
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,687
Yata! That's enough now!

307
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,322
Fushimi!

308
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:23,423
Stand down!

309
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,191
Always interfering.

310
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,260
Monkey, you had
a narrow escape!

311
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:37,203
Well, well, well. All of you
seem to be quite upset.

312
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,705
Aren't you, Homra?

313
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,674
You're damn right we are!

314
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,677
Mr. Mikoto and Mr. Totsuka
were both slandered!

315
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:47,013
And we're going to make
whoever the hell did it pay!

316
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:50,551
Izumo Kusanagi, we would
like you to back down.

317
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:53,286
We will deal with the
Green Clan by ourselves.

318
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:57,357
Lieutenant Awashima,
I'm sorry...

319
00:17:57,357 --> 00:18:00,393
But Yata's right. The
idiots responsible have

320
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:03,203
to learn the hard way,
that messing with any of

321
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:05,539
us means they'll get burned.

322
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:07,440
And I mean that literally.

323
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:12,779
That's the only way
Homra will be satisfied.

324
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:15,315
Well, if you must
insist on putting it that

325
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:18,652
way, then we have been
taken for fools as well.

326
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:21,788
After all, choosing this
location is no coincidence,

327
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:23,489
wouldn't you agree?

328
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:26,426
[gasp] They're here!

329
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:30,564
Don't watch from behind the
scenes. Show yourselves.

330
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:35,268
The bait was so obvious
and still you took it!

331
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:39,840
Reisi Munakata, the Blue
King, a hundred thousand

332
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,575
Jungle points.

333
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:44,811
Anna Kushina, also a
hundred thousand points?!

334
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:47,748
Oh, man! If we get
them, we'll jump up at

335
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,616
least three ranks!

336
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,453
Hey, the one with the big
hooters is Awashima, right?

337
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:55,589
She's worth six
thousand points.

338
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:57,490
And that guy with the
shades, Kusanagi, is

339
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,760
worth six thousand, too?

340
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:03,169
Four thousand for Fushimi
and three thousand for Yata.

341
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:07,207
So anyway, listen. We've got
nothing against you guys,

342
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:09,142
but we have no choice!

343
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:11,277
We gotta get those points!

344
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,446
So die for us, will ya?

345
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,348
[cocky laughter]

346
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:19,720
[laughing]

347
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:28,128
[gasps]

348
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:35,569
What's going on?!

349
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:36,737
Why aren't they dead?!

350
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:39,239
Vile and disgusting.
We won't tolerate

351
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,541
these anarchists.

352
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:45,746
Our lock‐up is not what you
call comfortable. I hope

353
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:47,814
you're prepared for that.

354
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:50,483
You said that HOMRA
is dead, didn't you?

355
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,185
I guess you
didn't know.

356
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:55,488
We've just recently
gotten a brand new King.

357
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:58,725
A strong king who
rivals even Mikoto Suoh.

358
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:02,268
You laughed at the
lives that Mikoto

359
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,804
and Tatara lived.

360
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,847
I won't forgive you.

361
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:18,351
Very well, then. Shall we
begin now? We will triumph

362
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,153
because our cause is just.

363
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,155
Men! Draw your swords!

364
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:22,723
Right!

365
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,825
Akiyama, ready!
Benzai, ready!

366
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,359
Kamo, ready!
Domyoji, ready!

367
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,694
Enomoto, ready!
Fuse, ready!

368
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:28,862
Goto, ready!
Hidaka, ready!

369
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,499
Munakata, ready!

370
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,844
[chuckle] It's
time for us, too.

371
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,146
Those Blues can't
take all the glory!

372
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:47,681
No Blood!

373
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:48,715
No Bone!

374
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,416
No Ash!

375
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,386
Do not let the Red
Clan outshine us!

376
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,821
Just leave this to me!

377
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:56,723
[chuckle]

378
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:01,535
[attacking yell]

379
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:07,407
What is that?!

380
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,675
What's going on?!

381
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:16,517
What the hell was that?!
What are they, monsters?!

382
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:19,252
[gasp] You two?!

383
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,855
Yeah, and we'd really like
to have a word with you.

384
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:25,692
[chuckling] And don't
think you can get past us!

385
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:29,596
Hey, don't underestimate me!
I'm an N‐Rank in Jungle!

386
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,232
And I don't just
work with explosives!

387
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:33,567
I have powers too!

388
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,868
[screaming]

389
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:42,809
All right, I'll ask
and you'll answer.

390
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:47,213
Was your King the one who gave
the order to carry out this assault?

391
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,983
Or was it one of
your top Clansmen,

392
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,618
like Yukari Mishakuji?

393
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:54,555
What are your
King's intentions?

394
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:58,458
And lastly, do you know
anything at all about

395
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,500
Yashiro Isana?

396
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,903
Damn it! Eat this!

397
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:10,677
Mission failed. Mission
failed. You have now lost

398
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:12,478
all of your Jungle points.

399
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,750
You will be stripped
of all powers.

400
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,788
What?! No way! After I
worked so hard to earn those

401
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:25,659
points?! Damn it, come on!

402
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:28,762
I'm an N‐Rank! An N‐Rank
that was just about

403
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:30,964
to get to meet with
the King himself!

404
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:35,602
How could this happen?!
How?! It's not fair!

405
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:37,604
You're done with
him? Already?

406
00:22:37,604 --> 00:22:41,775
That guy is merely
another expendable pawn.

407
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:43,443
I highly doubt he
knows anything.

408
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:47,013
Does that mean
no one does?

409
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:49,683
Can't we find anyone who
knows where Shiro is now?

410
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,654
Are you worried?

411
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:57,891
Mm‐mm! He's our
Shiro, after all!

412
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,701
I know that we'll
see him again!

413
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:02,969
We just have to
keep searching

414
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:04,805
harder, that's all!

415
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,375
Looks like things are
getting pretty interesting

416
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:12,312
thanks to those losers
that we threw in, Nagare.

417
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:14,848
Of course, it sucks that
we weren't able to lure

418
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:16,817
out the Silver King.

419
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:22,523
But guess what? The
Blue King's running

420
00:23:22,556 --> 00:23:24,424
out of time, quickly.

421
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:39,372
Lieutenant, just as you
did, I will move forward

422
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:41,407
until my very last breath.

423
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:44,511
No running this time.

424
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,013
I'll face it head on.

425
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:51,552
<i>This is the second time</i>
<i>I'm descending from</i>

426
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:54,688
<i>the sky but it's</i>
<i>different from last</i>

427
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:56,723
<i>time when I was</i>
<i>hurled down.</i>

428
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,474
This time, I'm descending
of my own free will.

429
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,045
<i>The Green rustles with</i>
<i>malice as it takes root</i>

430
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:16,082
<i>deeply and extends its</i>
<i>branches far and wide.</i>

431
00:24:16,116 --> 00:24:19,485
<i>Meanwhile, Scepter 4</i>
<i>summons Kuroh, and Neko</i>

432
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:21,421
<i>makes a visit to Homra.</i>

433
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:23,990
<i>As they become targets</i>
<i>of Jungle, those two</i>

434
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:26,727
<i>think of their missing</i>
<i>King and patiently</i>

435
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,494
<i>wait for his return.</i>

436
00:24:28,962 --> 00:24:33,900
<i>Next time on K ‐ RETURN OF</i>
<i>KINGS: Episode 2, "Kindness."</i>

437
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:36,737
<i>May those two be</i>
<i>reunited with the person</i>

438
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,672
<i>they wish to see.</i>
