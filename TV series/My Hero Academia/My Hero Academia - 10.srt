00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,791
[KUROGIRI] All Might was
supposed to be here today,

160
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,875
and yet I see no sign of him.

161
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,125
There must have been some
sort of change in plans.

162
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,208
They knew our whole schedule
and who would be here.

163
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,833
They must've gotten
into school files

164
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,708
while we were all stuck
in the cafeteria.

165
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,458
The teachers were busy
trying to get the media

166
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,750
off school grounds.

167
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,291
That means they've been waiting
for the perfect time to attack.

168
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,458
Just like Todoroki
said they were.

169
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,958
[MINETA]
Hey, hold on a second.

170
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,791
It's not like these guys
can really kill All Might.

171
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,250
Once he shows up,

172
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,583
he'll pound these villains
until there's nothing left!

173
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,083
Think about it though.

174
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,666
If the villains spent so much
time planning this attack,

175
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,125
then they probably figured
out a way to kill him.

176
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,583
[gasps]

177
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,166
[TSUYU] And didn't you hear
what that smoke guy said?

178
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,875
Maybe we should worry more about
not getting tortured to death.

179
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,958
Otherwise, we might not
survive long enough

180
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,625
to see All Might again.

181
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,000
And even if he does show up,

182
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,541
who knows if he'll make
it out in one piece.

183
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,583
[whimpering]

184
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,791
No, the pros are
gonna save us, right?

185
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,708
Tell Frog-Boobs to shut up!

186
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,750
Ribbit!

187
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,291
[HALF-FISH VILLAIN]
You bastards!

188
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,208
I'll enjoy eating you.

189

[screams]

190
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,708
[MINETA]
Bad guys!

191
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,541
[IZUKU]
Asui might be right.

192
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,583
If they're here for All Might,

193
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,958
they may have a way
to defeat him.

194
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,208
They wouldn't have planned
this attack if they didn't.

195
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,041
But why him out
of all the heroes?

196
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:06,000
Because his very existence
discourages villains and evil?

197
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,583
Because he's the one and only
Symbol of Peace and Justice?

198
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,666
[IZUKU]
Actually...

199
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,833
It doesn't matter.

200
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,666
Young man. You, too,
can become a hero.

201
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,125
C'mon, fanboy. Show me
that fightin' spirit!

202
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,041
[IZUKU] I don't care
what their reasons are.

203
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,041
Welcome, Young Midoriya.

204
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,458
Congrats on getting in.

205
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,708
[IZUKU]
I have to focus.

206
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,208
Fear not, citizens.
Hope has arrived.

207
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,041
Because I am here.

208
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,708
[IZUKU]
I have to face this evil!

209
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,875
Head on!

210
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,875
[IZUKU]
If they can beat him,

211
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,000
then we have to stop whatever it
is these bad guys are planning.

212
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,833
We have to work together
and keep All Might safe.

213
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,250
No one at UA knows
what's happening.

214
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,583
This is up to us.
Let's be heroes.

215
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,916
[TODOROKI] Aren't you
embarrassed to lose to a child?

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,041
For God's sake, you're adults.
Put up a real fight.

[ALL MIGHT sighs]

[ALL MIGHT] Can't get through
to Thirteen or Aizawa.

224
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,458
Then again, they are teaching.

225
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,458
Unlike me.

226
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,958
I'm neglecting my duties

227
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,541
because I spent the entire
morning commute being heroic.

228
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,250
An amateur move.
What was I thinking?

229
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,416
Maybe I should just show up

230
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,333
and say something
inspiring at the end.

231
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,250
Yeah, get a good ten minutes
out of my hero form.

232
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,083
Time to join my students--

[ALL MIGHT]
Hello, Nezu, sir!

237
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,458
That's me! The one who
could be a mouse,

238
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,166
or a dog, or a bear, though
the only important thing is...

239
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,333
...I'm the principal!

240
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,583
Your fur looks especially well
groomed and glossy today, sir.

241
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,208
The secret is keratin.

242
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,458
I'm not sure that humans can get
this kind of lustrous shine.

243
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,541
But we can talk
about grooming later.

244
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,041
Look at the news!

245
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,541
Shall I read it to you?

246
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,791
It says you resolved three
incidents in just one hour!

[ALL MIGHT grunts]

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,708
[NEZU sighs]

249
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,666
[NEZU] The fault mainly
belongs to the ruffians

250
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,625
who still cause trouble in this
city despite you being here.

251
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,541
But you also have
to learn not to react

252
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,541
every time you hear
of an incident.

253
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,583
You haven't changed
in all these years.

254
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,250
You've always been proactive.

255
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,416
Only now, your heroism must be
limited due to your injury.

256
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,041
Plus, you've also
got the added work

257
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,541
of training One For
All's successor.

258
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,958
You insist on remaining
the Symbol of Peace,

259
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,666
and the only way you can justify
staying out of the spotlight

260
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,833
is by teaching.

261
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,333
That's why I gave you this job.

262
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,083
Oh, dear, you're smoking,
that can't be good.

00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,958
[ALL MIGHT groans]

264
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,458
[NEZU] It looks like you need
to stay here in the lounge

265
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,291
and relax a little while longer.

266
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,166
The other teachers
will understand.

267
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,625
They're more than capable.

268
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,916
But now that you are a
teacher here, All Might,

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,333
I really do wish you'd
prioritize your students

270
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,000
over your hero work.
They deserve it.

271
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,333
After all, there are plenty
of other hero agencies

272
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,625
working throughout the city.

273
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,500
[ALL MIGHT]
Yeah, you're right, principal.

274
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,416
So, I was gonna head over to the
USJ to make an appearance now,

275
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,708
actually, if you don't mind.

276
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,833
[NEZU]
Even if you went now,

277
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,625
you'd have to return
almost right away.

278
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,000
So, you might as
well stick around

279
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,125
and listen to some of
my teaching philosophies.

280
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:09,833
They could prove...

281
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,708
[ALL MIGHT]
Great.

282
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,916
This is turning into a lecture.

[ALL MIGHT groans]

Here, drink up.

He's always so long-winded

286
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,791
whenever there's tea involved.

287
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,166
And I'm still a little concerned

288
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,166
that I couldn't get in touch
with Thirteen or Aizawa.

289
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,708
[NEZU] Let's start by
discussing combat pedagogy

290
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,291
as viewed through the
lens of ethical Quirk use.

291
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,625
[ALL MIGHT] You know,
you haven't changed much

292
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,833
all these years, either, sir.

Where is everyone?

00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,958
[SHOJI] They've been scattered
across the facility.

297
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,625
But our classmates
are still here.

[SERO]
What do we do?

00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,458
The guy's not affected
by physical attacks

301
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,875

[THIRTEEN]
I have a job for you.

305
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,833
Run to the school and tell the
faculty what's going on here.

306
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,500
The alarms aren't sounding,

307
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,125
and our phones and radios
are useless right now.

308
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,666
One of these villains
must be to blame.

309
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,916
Even though Eraser Head

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,958
is canceling people's
Quirks left and right,

311
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,041
we're still completely sealed
off from the outside world.

312
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,041
Likely, whoever is
causing this interference

313
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,500
hid as soon as they
warped into the USJ.

314
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,916
They could be anywhere.
Impossible to hunt down.

315

Did you hit your head
when we got warped here?!

The best plan is for us to just
wait for a real pro from UA

Those villains down there

347
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,208
clearly have an
advantage in the water,

348
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,625
and assume that's
where we'll fight.

[MINETA]
Are you even listening?!

350
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,250
[TSUYU] If that's the case,
they must've known

351
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,916
what was inside the USJ
before they warped in.

352
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,125
[IZUKU]
Yeah.

353
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,125
But for a group with
such careful planning,

354
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,958
there's one thing that
really sticks out to me,

355
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,416
something that just
doesn't add up.

356
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,541
They sent you here, Asui--

357

--Uh.
--[TSUYU] Ribbit.

358
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,750
Um-- Whoops, I meant Tsu!

359
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,583
Yeah, they warped you
to the shipwreck zone.

360
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,666
That kinda fell apart
on you, didn't it?

361
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,916
[IZUKU]
A little bit.

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,541
But why does it matter
that she's here?!

363
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,875
Yeah, okay, right.

364
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,833
It means the villains
probably have no idea

365
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,333
what our Quirks are!

366
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,291
[TSUYU]
Uh, ribbit.

367
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,875
You've got a point.

368
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,833
If they knew I was a frog,
they would've sent me

369
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,375
into that fire zone over there

370
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,916
instead of somewhere
full of water.

371
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,333
They probably separated us

372
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,875
because they didn't know
what we could do,

373
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,708
and planned to overpower us
once we were in smaller groups.

374
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,125
Easier to pick us
off one by one.

375
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,250
We can use that
to our advantage.

376
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,000
They don't know
what our Quirks are.

377
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:37,000
So, for all they know, the three
of us could be super powerful.

378
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,458
Look, none of them are trying
to climb into the boat.

379
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,250
That proves they're
a little unsure.

380
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,333
But that means they're not going
to underestimate us, either.

381
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,083
They're being smart
and playing it safe.

382
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,375
For now.

383
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,541
[TSUYU]
So, let's talk Quirks.

384
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,458
I'll go first if you want.

385
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,625
Obviously, I can jump high and
cling to pretty much any wall.

386
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,125
And of course there's my tongue.

387
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,458
I can stick it out
about 20 meters.

388
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,416
Oh yeah, and I can spit out
my stomach so I can clean it.

389
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,041
That's not really useful.

390
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:11,041
Finally, I also secrete a toxic
mucus. It just stings a bit.

393
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,375
We can probably only
use my jumping

--and my tongue here.

00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,166
I figured you were powerful,
but that's crazy.

397
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,000
I have my super strength,
but it comes at a price.

398
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,916
Once I use it, I'm pretty
much out of commission.

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,583
It's a double-edged sword
until I can control it.

I've got these sticky balls.

401
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,541
Their strength varies.

402
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,875
Depending on how I'm feeling,

403
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,041
they might stick to
something a whole day.

404
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,291
They grow back as fast
as I pull 'em off.

405
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,791
But I'll bleed if
I use too many.

406
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,291
Oh, and they don't stick to me.

407
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,916

Ready, Mineta?

472
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,958
[MINETA] Even though
he's as scared as I am...

473
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,666
...even though he's shaking...

474
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,000
...he's still going
through with this.

475
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,666
Take this!

476
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,458

[groans]

479
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,041
Tsu! Mineta, now!

480
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,166
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

481
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,500
[MINETA]
What the heck, Midoriya?

482
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,416
How do you do it?

483
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,416
You're acting so cool,
and I'm not helping at all.

484
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,250
[yelling]

485
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,958
Take this, you villains!

486
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,333
You can eat my sticky balls!

[SEA VILLAIN A]
What's goin' on?

488
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,291
[HALF-FISH VILLAIN]
I'm getting dragged in!

489
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,416
[SEA VILLAIN E]
Did these come from that kid?

490
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,333
I can't get 'em offa me!

491
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,208
[IZUKU] If a strong force is
applied to water's surface,

492
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,125
the water will be pushed away,

493
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,250
and then come rushing
right back to the middle!

494
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,708
--[HALF-FISH VILLAIN] Move!

[HALF-FISH VILLAIN]
You're gonna drown me!

497
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,166
[TSUYU]
We rounded 'em all up.

498
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,958
Not too shabby.

499
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,000
You guys are amazing.

500
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,541
Both of you.

501
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,708
[TSUYU] I guess we passed
the shipwreck zone.

[OCHACO]
Everyone,

503
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,666
let's hold our own until
Iida gets back with help!

504
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,833

some unexpected developments

507
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,291
from Yaoyorozu's body.

508
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,583
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

509
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,916
