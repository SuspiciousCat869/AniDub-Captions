1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,541
[IZUKU]
The world's most popular hero.

2
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:18,041
All Might! Age unknown.
Quirk unidentified.

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,416
He broke onto the hero scene

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,250
and was an immediate hit,
thanks to his abilities.

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,333
Ever since he appeared,

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,541
crime rates have
drastically decreased.

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:30,458
His very existence, a deterrent
for many would-be villains.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,666
The world's a safer place.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,166
They don't just call him
the Symbol of Peace.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,916
It's what he is.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,708
And this pillar of
justice said to me:

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,250
[ALL MIGHT] Young man.
You, too, can become a hero.

13
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,875
[STUDENT 1C]
Midoriya? You're kidding...

14
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,458
[KATSUKI]
...Quirkless wannabe.

15
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,166
You really think they'd
let someone like you in

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,958
when they could have me?

17
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,333
[DOCTOR 1A] Sorry, kid,
it's not gonna happen.

18
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,750
[IZUKU'S MOM]
I'm sorry, Izuku.

19
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,291
[IZUKU] I needed someone
to tell me that.

20
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,500
And then...

21
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,833
The person I admire most
in this world did.

22
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,208
Honestly.

23
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,125
Part of me never thought
I'd hear those words.

24
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,833
Much less from him.

25
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:14,083
I deem you worthy of my power.
My Quirk is yours to inherit.

26
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,666
[IZUKU gasps]

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,458
Uh?

28
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,750
Wait. What do you mean inherit?

29
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,958
Inherit what?

30
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,208
[laughs] You should
see your face right now.

31
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
force this thing on you.

32
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,958
[ALL MIGHT]
Listen well, young man.

33
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,625
This is your choice.

34
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,750
Do you wanna accept
my awesome power or not?

35
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,583
[IZUKU]
Wh-What is he talking about?

36
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,041
What is this?

37
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,625
There are a couple
things you should know

38
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,708
about my abilities.

39
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,958
[IZUKU gasps]

40
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,583
[ALL MIGHT] Journalists
always guess my Quirk

41
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,000
is super strength or some
kind of invulnerability.

42
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,416
When people ask in interviews,

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,625
I always make a joke
and dodge the question.

44
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,458
That's because the
world needs to believe

45
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,041
that their Symbol of Peace
is just a natural born hero,

46
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,500
like any of them.

47
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,666
But I'm not.

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,416
There's nothing natural
about my ability.

49
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,208
I wasn't born with this power.

50
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,416
It's a sacred torch
that was passed on to me

51
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,125
from someone else.

52
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,375
Someone gave you
this Quirk? No way.

53
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,625
[ALL MIGHT]
Yes way. And you're next.

54
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,041
I can give you my abilities.

55
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,666
[IZUKU] Wait. Hold on,
this is a lot to process.

56
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,166
It's true that there's
a lot of debate

57
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,625
as to what your
Quirk actually is.

58
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,875
Nobody's ever figured it out--

59
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,583
It's one of the world's
greatest mysteries.

60
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,125
People are constantly
talking about it online.

61
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,916
But, well, the idea
of passing on a Quirk

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,916
or inheriting it just doesn't
make any sense to me.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,458
I've never heard anything
like that before.

64
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,583
Powers are supposed to be
unique to each individual.

65
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,500
I mean, since the first
superpowers, no one's ever

66
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,875
been able to just
give someone else

67
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,541
their power like
a present. That's crazy.

68
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,250
If this is true, it would
cause us to rethink

69
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,000
everything we know about
Quirks to begin with.

70
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,666
--All bets are off the table.
--[ALL MIGHT] Uh, sounds like

71
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,666
[ALL MIGHT] you're overthinking
this whole "inheriting" thing.

72
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,750
Stop nerdin' out!

73
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,250
[gasps]

74
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,541
You'll have to
adjust your reality

75
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,416
and accept this new truth!

76
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,875
I can transfer my Quirk
to someone else.

77
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,041
And that's just one facet
of my secret abilities.

78
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:43,666
The true name of my power
is One For All.

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,208
One... For... All.

80
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,375
Yes.

81
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,333
[ALL MIGHT]
One person improves the power,

82
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,708
then hands it off
to another person.

83
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,958
It continues to grow
as it's passed along.

84
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,000
It is this cultivated power

85
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,166
that allows me to save those
who are in need of a hero.

86
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,208
The truth behind my strength.

87
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,750
But why would you
choose to give me

88
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,333
a gift like that? What if
I can't live up to it?

89
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,500
[ALL MIGHT] I was on a long
hunt for a worthy successor.

90
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,041
And then, I watched
you jump into action

91
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,166
as the rest of us stood idly by.

92
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,750
You may just be
a Quirkless fanboy.

93
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,000
But you tried to save that kid.

94
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,958
You acted like a hero.

95
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:32,083
[whimpers]

96
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,083
Seriously!

97
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,791
You gotta stop cryin' so much
if you want my Quirk.

98
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,375
Come on, kid.

99
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,541
[IZUKU whimpers]

100
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,833
[IZUKU] He's said so much
to encourage me.

101
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,875
He even told me the secret
behind his powers.

102
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,458
Is this...

103
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,166
Is this what I've been
waiting for all these years?

104
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,083
How can I turn him down?

105
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,875
Okay, I'll do it. Yes!

106
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,083
No reluctance.

107
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,125
That's exactly how I
figured you'd respond.

108
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,083
[IZUKU]
But it wasn't that simple.

109
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,708
Receiving All Might's
power turned out

110
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,250
to be no easy task.
As I'd soon find out.

111
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:19,541
[IZUKU grunting]

112
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,000
Hey, hey, hey.

113
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,750
It's pretty comfy up
on this fridge,

114
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,541
how are you doing down there?

115
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,875
[IZUKU grunts]

116
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,833
People move these
every day, y'know.

117
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,708
And most of them don't even
have any super strength.

118
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,500
[IZUKU]
Well, yeah, but...

119
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,500
There's an extra 600 pounds
with you sitting on top of it

120
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,083
Nah, I've lost weight,
so I'm down to 560 these days.

121
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,875
In this form, at least.

122
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,833
[IZUKU]
Great, much better.

123
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,083
Why do you have me
dragging trash

124
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,125
across the beach, anyway?

125
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,041
[laughs] Take a
look at yourself.

126
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,583
You're not ready for my power.

127
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,458
[gasps] But I thought you
said that I was worthy!

128
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,708
[IZUKU screams]

129
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,291
[ALL MIGHT] I'm talking
about your weak body.

130
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,208
My Quirk, One For All,
is a whole lot to handle.

131
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,208
The combined physical
abilities of everyone

132
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,791
who's ever used it creates
a hurricane of pure force.

133
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,750
An unprepared body
can't fully inherit it.

134
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,500
Your arms and legs would
shoot off if you tried to.

135
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,583
Seriously?

136
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,916
Okay.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,833
So this whole trash thing
is really some kind of

138
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,083
hardcore gym workout.
And... you're my trainer.

139
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,458
You got it. But there's
another reason, too.

140
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,583
I did a little online
research yesterday.

141
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,708
Turns out this part of the
beach used to be beautiful,

142
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,833
but it's been a total mess
for the last few years.

143
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,333
That's right.

144
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,916
Because of the ocean currents,

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,375
anything that's dropped in
the water ends up here.

146
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,458
People take advantage of that
when they're illegally

147
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,916
dumping their trash.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,250
Now, all the locals
avoid this place.

149
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,416
Heroes these days are
all about showing off

150
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,375
and capturing flashy villains.

151
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,333
Things were different
before Quirks.

152
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,375
Service was what mattered.

153
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,000
Back then, heroes were those
who helped the community.

154
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,250
Even if it was kinda boring.

155
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,708
You will restore the coastline

156
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,125
for this entire
section of the beach.

157
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,500
That is the first step
on your path, young man.

158
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,375
Towards being a hero.

159
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,958
Um... All this?

160
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:19,833
But... There's so much.
That's impossible!

161
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,333
Young Midoriya, you
wanna go to UA, right?

162
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,041
Well, yeah. Of course!
You went there.

163
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,666
So it must be the best
school around, right?

164
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,583
It's a long shot. But still.
I'm gonna shoot for the moon.

165
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,833
UA.

166
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,416
[ALL MIGHT] You've got
a lot of spirit, fanboy!

167
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,750
But, as I've mentioned before,

168
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,083
hero-ing isn't easy
to do without a Quirk.

169
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,000
It's not fair, but
that's the reality.

170
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,875
And UA is the hardest
hero course to get into.

171
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,875
So that means...

172
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,416
...that I have to
prepare my body

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,083
for your Quirk really fast.

174
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,291
UA's exam is in ten months!

175
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,875
Not to worry, kid.
I've got you covered.

176
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,583
With the help of my handy "Aim
to Pass: American Dream Plan!"

177
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,166
Follow this to the
letter and the beach

178
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,041
will be cleaned up just in time.

179
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,208
I also detailed every other
aspect of your life

180
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,416
while I was at it.

181
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,125
Even my sleep is scheduled.

182
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,875
[ALL MIGHT] If I'm being honest,
this is going to be super hard.

183
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,375
Think you're up to it?

184
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,166
Yeah, sure I am.

185
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,166
I have to work way harder
than anyone else to get in.

186
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,708
So what choice do I have, right?

187
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,958
[IZUKU]
Just like that,

188
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,416
I began ten months
of absolute hell.

189
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,333
[grunting]

190
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,541
[ALL MIGHT] Come on, put your
back into it, Midoriya!

191
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,000
It's not gonna move itself!

192
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,291
[panting]

193
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,791
[IZUKU] I'm using
different muscle groups

194
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,000
depending on the size and shape
of the trash I'm hauling.

195
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Let's go, let's go!

196
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,958
The clock is ticking
and ten months

197
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,625
will be over before you know it!

198
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,208
Don't you give up!
It's time to go beyond!

199
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,708
[TEACHER 3A]
So you see,

200
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,333
with the appearance of Quirks,
the Building Standards Act

201
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,375
in place had to be...

202
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,958
[IZUKU]
So tired. But I gotta focus.

203
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,541
It'd be better if I
could finish cleanup

204
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,666
a week before the exam.

205
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,500
That means I've only
got 294 days left.

206
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,000
If I take recovery
periods into account,

207
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,541
assuming I'll be
resting two days

208
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,416
between each hard
workout, then...

209
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,083
That gives me about 98
days of actual training,

210
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,500
even at my most efficient.

211
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,583
I can get in around five hours
every morning and night,

212
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,333
so that's 490 hours.

213
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,916
Also, I'll need to
make sure I'm hitting

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,833
every muscle group, which means
I need to pay attention

215
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,416
to the type of work I'm doing
on the beach every day.

216
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,958
I could start sneaking
in extra workouts

217
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,041
and lifting weights
on my own, I suppose.

218
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,125
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,166
That would help me
focus my workouts

220
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,833
and isolate specific muscles.

221
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,500
But it'll cost me time.
Lots of it.

222
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,958
I'll have to cut back
on the hours of sleep

223
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,750
All Might scheduled for me,
but independent training

224
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,208
could help me catch up
a little bit more.

225
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,083
Excellent.

226
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,041
[TEACHER 3A]
Hey! Midoriya!

227
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,125
[IZUKU yelps]

228
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,875
I know you had a
run-in with a villain.

229
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,666
But pull yourself together, kid!

230
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,166
If you really wanna
get into UA,

231
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,458
you might actually
have to know something.

232
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,916
[IZUKU] Oh, right,
I've gotta study, too.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,666
You hear him? Nuts!

234
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,166

Hey, hey, kid, look alive now!

249
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,875
You've only got
three months left!

250
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,208
What, are you gonna give up
after all this work?

251
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,750
Wanna flush it all
down the toilet

252
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,458
and take it easy?

253
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,458
[ALL MIGHT]
You're overworked.

254
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,583
The "Aim to Pass:
American Dream Plan"

255
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,791
was created with
your body in mind.

256
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,666
It was fine-tuned to
ensure your progress

257
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,750
was swift but manageable.

258
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,333
Which means...

259
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,500
You haven't been sticking to it.

260
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
You're overdoing things;

261
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,333
that's gonna have the opposite
effect of what we want!

262
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,416
[IZUKU]
I have to work harder.

263
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,458
Or I won't stand a chance
against the other applicants.

264
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:06,708
I don't just want into
UA, I want to excel.

265
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,916
I want... to be like you.

266
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,000
[IZUKU]
I want...

267
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,041
...to be the greatest
hero in the world!

268
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,750
So I'll keep on trying.

269
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,250
Until I've got what
it takes to do that.

270
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,458
I want people to see my
fearless smile and feel safe.

271
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,458
And be just like you!

272
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,166
[ALL MIGHT]
Gotta hand it to the kid.

273
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,625
He's given a lot of
thought to the future.

That fighting spirit's

what I like about you, fanboy!
It serves you well.

276
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,291
I do get your concerns.

277
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,916
That said. Now's not the time
to go and rush progress.

278
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,625
Fear not! I can get
you back on track.

279
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,375
Leave it to this old man
to adjust your plan!

280

[IZUKU weakly] You're not
an old man, All Might.

283
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,916
[IZUKU]
And suddenly...

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,291
It was the morning of the exam.

285
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:09,625

[IZUKU screaming]

287

Hey, hey, holy crap, kid.

288
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,000
You even cleaned up outside
the area I told you to.

289
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,583
Seriously...

290
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,625
There's not one speck of
trash left on this beach.

291
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,458
Only a few minutes to spare.

292
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,416
But you exceeded
my expectations!

293
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,416
Holy... Stinkin'... Supercrap!

294
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,708
Excellent work.

295
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,625
I finished everything.

296
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:58,083
All Might. I did it. Do you
think I'm ready now?

297
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,875
[ALL MIGHT]
Yeah, you did good, kid.

298
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,916
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I knew you had it in you,
but this is beyond.

300
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,583
[ALL MIGHT]
Look at this.

301
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,166
[IZUKU]
Um...

302
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,375
[ALL MIGHT]
It's you crying ten months ago.

303
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,916
[ALL MIGHT]
Look how far you've come.

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,333
Such improvement!

305
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,000
There's still a long
road ahead of you

306
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,041
before you can inherit
my full power set.

307
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,041
But it's starting to
look like you can do it.

308
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,750
All Might... Do I deserve
this? Are you sure?

309
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,416
Hm?

310
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,083
[IZUKU] You put so much time
and energy into helping me.

311
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,166
How did I end up so lucky?

312
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,166
[laughs]

313
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,458
[ALL MIGHT] Are you really
worried about that

314
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,458
after all these months?

315
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,583
It was your hard work
that did this, not mine.

316
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:55,333
Now. For your reward,
Izuku Midoriya.

Yes, sir!

00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,041
Someone told me this once.

319
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,875
There's a difference between
being lucky and deserving.

320
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,208
One's an accident,
the other a reward.

321
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,916
Never get the two confused.

322
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,416
[gasps]

323
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,250
Take that to heart, young man.

324
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,625
This gift. You earned it
with your own valiant efforts.

325
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,541
[IZUKU]
And so...

326
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,625
I held out my weak,
Quirkless hands,

327
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,583
and grabbed the future.

328
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,041
Eat this.

329
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,458
Huh?

330
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,291
To inherit my power,
you've got to swallow

331
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,500
some of my DNA,
that's how it works.

332
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,916
[IZUKU] This isn't exactly
how I imagined it.

333
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,541
[ALL MIGHT]
C'mon, there's no time.

334
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,291
You'll be late for the exam.

335
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,750
--Eat. Eat. Eat!
--[IZUKU yelping]

336
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,458
[pants]

337
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,625
Made it just in time.

338
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,416
[IZUKU] I was so worried
about missing the exam

339
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,208
that I didn't have a chance
to test out my new power.

340
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,916
Eat this.

341
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
[IZUKU]
I may have swallowed the hair,

342
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,916
but I don't feel like anything
great has happened to me yet.

343
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,083
[KATSUKI]
Stupid Deku.

344
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,375
[gasps] Kacchan!

345
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,916
Get out of my way, now,
before I set you on fire.

346
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,250
[yelps] Oh hey, g'mornin'.

347
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,333
Um, let's just both do
our best out there, okay?

348
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,541
Good luck!

349
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,083
I think that's the
kid who withstood

350
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,416
the sludge villain.
His name's Bakugo, right?

351
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,583
Yeah, he's the real deal.

352
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,208
[IZUKU]
Ever since that day,

353
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,250
Kacchan's been taking
it easier on me.

354
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,625
[sighs]

355
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,166
[IZUKU] I guess I was just
scared out of habit.

356
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,333
[IZUKU]
But I'm not defenseless anymore.

357
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,583
Yeah.

358
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,291
I have to remember all
the work I've put in.

359
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,583
Thanks to All Might,

360
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,125
I'm actually going to be a hero.

361
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,500
[IZUKU]
Or I'll just die.

362
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,333
[gasps]

363
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,000
[OCHACO]
Heh. Are you okay?

364
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,666
[yelps]

365
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,666
I stopped you with my Quirk.

366
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,416
I'm sorry I didn't
ask first. But...

367
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,875
I figured you wouldn't
mind me catching you.

368
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,916
Isn't this all, like,
way nerve-racking?

369
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,416
Uh, I, uh...

370
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,250
Well, guess I'll see you inside.

371
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,541
Bye!

372
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,041
[IZUKU] Holy whoa,
I just talked to a girl!

373
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,416
[IZUKU laughs]

374
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,250
[PRESENT MIC]
What's up, UA candidates?

375
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,458
Thanks for tunin' in
to me, your school DJ.

376
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,958
C'mon. And lemme hear ya!

377
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,208
Keeping it mellow, huh?

378
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,541
That's fine, I'll skip
straight to the main show.

379
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,375
Let's talk about how
this practical exam

380
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,708
is gonna go down, okay?

381
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,666
Are you ready? Yeah!

382
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,625
Oh my goodness, it's the
Voice Hero, Present Mic.

383
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,125
So cool!

384
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,833
I listen to his radio show
every day of the week.

385
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,666
It's so crazy nuts that
all the UA teachers

386
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,000
--are pro heroes.
--Will you shut up?

387
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,750
Like your application said,

388
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,833
today you rockin' boys and
girls will be out there

389
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,333
conducting ten-minute
mock battles

390
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,000
in super-hip urban settings.

391
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,583
Gird your loins, my friends.

392
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,583
After I drop the mic here,
you'll head to your

393
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,875
specified battle center,
sound good?

394
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,000
[PRESENT MIC]
Okay?

395
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,583
I see. They're splitting us up

396
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,000
so we can't work with
any of our friends.

397
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,500
[IZUKU]
Yeah. You're right.

398
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,750
Our examinee numbers
are one after the other,

399
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,208
but we're assigned to
different battle centers.

400
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,458
Get your eyes off my card.

401
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,083
Damn. I was really looking
forward to crushing you.

402
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,583
Okay, okay, let's
check out your targets.

403
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,583
There are three types of faux
villains in every battle center.

404
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,916
You'll earn points based on
their level of difficulty,

405
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,541
so better choose wisely.

406
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,541
Your goal in this trial
is to use your Quirk

407
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,958
to raise your score by
shredding these faux villains

408
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,291
like a mid-song guitar solo.

409
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,416
But, check it!

410
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,125
Make sure you're
keep'n things heroic.

411
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,125
Attacking other examinees
is a UA no-no, ya dig?

412
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,708
[TENYA] Excuse me, sir,
but I have a question.

413
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,083
[PRESENT MIC]
Hit me!

414
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,333
[TENYA]
On the printout,

415
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,166
you've listed four types
of villains. Not three.

416
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,416
With all respect,

417
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,791
if this is an error on
official UA materials,

418
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,125
it is shameful.

419
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,666
We are exemplary students.

420
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,416
We expect the best from
Japan's most notable school.

421
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,250
A mistake such as this won't do.

422
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,458
Additionally, you with
the unkempt hair.

423
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,708
Huh?

424
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,000
You've been muttering
this entire time.

425
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,375
Stop that.

426
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,625
If you can't bother to take
this seriously, leave.

427
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,541
You're distracting
the rest of us.

428
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,666
[IZUKU]
Sorry.

429
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,041
[STUDENTS laugh]

430
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,541
[PRESENT MIC]
All right, all right.

431
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,750
Examinee number 7-1-1-1.

432
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,833
Thanks for calling in
with your request.

433
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,458
The fourth villain type
is worth zero points.

434
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,333
That guy's just an obstacle
we'll be throwing in your way.

435
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,291
There's one in
every battle center.

436
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,500
Think of it as a hurdle
you should try to avoid.

437
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,500
It's not that it can't
be beaten, but there's...

438
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,750
...kinda no point.

439
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,291
I recommend my listeners

440
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,208
try to ignore it and focus on
the ones toppin' the charts.

441
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,000
[TENYA] Thank you very much.
Please, continue.

442
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,583
Oh, I get it.

443
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,583
So they're kinda like traps
you have to get by in games.

444
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,083
The whole thing's like
a video game, huh?

445
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,166
[PRESENT MIC] That's all
I got for you today.

446
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,166
I'll sign off with
a little present.

447
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,041
A sample of our school motto!

448
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,208
As General Napoleon
Bonaparte once laid down.

449
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:56,333
"A true hero is one who
overcomes life's misfortunes."

450
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,791
Mm-hm. Now that's
a tasty soundbite.

451
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,958
You ready to go beyond?

452
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,041
Let's hear a Plus Ultra!

453
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,833
[PRESENT MIC]
Good luck!

454
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,666
Hope you practiced hitting
more than just books.

455
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,291
[IZUKU]
Well. This is it.

456
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,208
Time to put ten months of
training with All Might

457
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,875
to the test. Time to
give it my all.

458
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,000
I will become a hero.

459
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:34,375
Just like I always dreamed.
I won't let myself down!

460
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,208
Uh!

461
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,583
[IZUKU]
UA High's entrance exam is here,

462
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:17,250
and every one of us wants a spot
at this prestigious school.

463
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,791
The question is,

464
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,541
will I be able to get through
the practical with the power

465
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,250
I only just received
from All Might?

466
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,250
[OCHACO] Let's do our best
on the exam today!

467
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,791
[IZUKU]
Huh? Who're you? Holy crap.

468
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,000
It's that girl I talked to!

469
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,916
[IZUKU, OCHACO]
Next time: "Start Line"!

470
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,500
[OCHACO]
I, Ochaco, will try hard not

471
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,875
to puke during the test.

472
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,333
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

473
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,458
[IZUKU, OCHACO]
Plus Ultra!
