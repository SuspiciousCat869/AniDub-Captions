00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,375
[IZUKU]
Even if I have a lot to learn...

2
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,291
I'll focus on what
I can do right now.

3
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,458
Smash!

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,041
[STUDENTS gasp]

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,458
[IZUKU] It hurts,
but not as bad as before.

6
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,416
[AIZAWA] A throw like that
requires a lot of force.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,583
Did he focus all that
power into one finger?

8
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,041
[IZUKU]
Mr. Aizawa.

9
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,416
You see? I'm still standing.

10
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,500
This kid.

11
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,041
[KAMINARI]
He threw it over 700 meters!

12
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,000
Nice, he's finally showing
us his true power!

13
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,125
But his finger appears
to be broken now.

14
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:32,125
Just like in the exam.
This Quirk is very odd.

15
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,833
It wasn't a very pretty throw.

16
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:34,875
[gasping]

17
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,916
[KATSUKI]
What the hell was that?

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,375
If he had a Quirk,
he would've gotten it

19
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,541
when we were kids!
This is impossible!

20
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,708
He's up to something.

21
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,541
[IZUKU]
Someone I look up to...

22
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,583
...told me I have what
it takes to be a hero.

23
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,833
That's why I'm going to UA!

24
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,708
[KATSUKI growls] I'm getting
to the bottom of this.

25
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,708
Hey!

26
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,625
[gasps]

27
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,791
[KATSUKI]
Deku, you bastard!

28
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,916
Tell me how you did that,
or you're dead!

[gasps]

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,875
What?

33
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,916
Why the hell is your
damn scarf so strong?

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,416
[AIZAWA]
Because it's a capture weapon

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,833
made out of carbon fiber
and a special metal alloy.

36
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,083
Stand down.

37
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,166
[gulps]

38
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,791
[AIZAWA]
It'd be wise to avoid making me

39
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,500
use my Quirk so much.

40
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,625
It gives me serious dry eye.

41
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,375
[STUDENTS]
Too bad. That power is amazing!

42
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,208
[PRESENT MIC] Class 1-A's
homeroom teacher: Shota Aizawa.

43
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,541
He can erase the Quirk
of anyone he looks at,

44
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,750
but the effect ends
when he blinks.

45
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,875
You're wasting my time now.

46
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,000
Whoever's next can step up.

47
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,583
[OCHACO]
Ouch, is your finger okay?

48
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,250
[IZUKU]
Sure. Fine!

49
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,625
[growls]

50
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,000
[KATSUKI]
Until the exam, he was nothing.

51
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,000
A little bug I could
crush if I wanted to.

52
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,458
Wow, you're so lucky!

53
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,666
Your Quirk is amazing, Kacchan.

54
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,125
When I get mine, I hope
it's just as cool!

55
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,125
[KATSUKI] Whatever, Deku,
no matter what power

56
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,458
you end up with, you'll
never be able to beat me.

57
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,833
[KATSUKI]
Just an annoying bug

58
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,916
that I can smash
into the ground.

59
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,375
[IZUKU] After that, I had
to fight through the pain

60
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,041
as we finished up the rest
of our physical fitness tests.

61
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:30,166
[pants]

62
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,958
[groans]

63
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,916
[AIZAWA] All right, time
to give you your results.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,708
I've ranked you all
from best to worst.

65
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,833
You should probably have a good
idea of your standing already.

66
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,458
I'll just pull up
the whole list.

67
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,458
It's not worth going over
each individual's score.

68
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,208
[IZUKU] The person ranked
last is gonna be expelled.

69
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,666
And the only test I was any good
at was the softball throw!

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,208
Can I squeak by on
that score alone?

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,541
I bombed the rest
of the challenges!

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,375
[IZUKU whimpers]

73
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:13,041
[IZUKU]
I'm in last place. I failed.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,625
And I was lying,
no one's going home.

75
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,458
That was just a rational
deception to make sure

76
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,000
you gave it your
all in the tests.

77
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,416
[GROUP yelps]

78
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm surprised the rest of you

79
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,291
didn't figure
that out. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,916
I guess I probably should
have said something.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,625
[JIRO, MINETA, KAMINARI]
Yeah, you should have.

82
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,375
That was pretty
nerve-wracking, huh?

83
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,291
Nah, I'm always down
for a challenge.

84
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,708
Huh.

85
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,916
[AIZAWA] That's it.
We're done for the day.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,708
Pick up a syllabus
in the classroom.

87
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,125
Read it over before
tomorrow morning.

88

[AIZAWA]
Midoriya--

90
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,916
Take this and go have
the old lady fix you up.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,333
Things are gonna
be tougher tomorrow

92
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,458
when your actual
training begins.

93
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,083
Make sure you're prepared.

94
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,791
[IZUKU] I managed to make
it through the first day.

95
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,291
But there was so much,
I completely failed at.

96
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,500
I'm starting out at the bottom.

97
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,458
[IZUKU] I've still got
a whole lot to learn...

98
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,708
...if I'm gonna
achieve my dream!

99
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,666
Aizawa, that was a rotten move.

100
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,958
[AIZAWA]
All Might. So you were watching.

101
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,208
No talk shows today?

102
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,000
"A rational deception."

103
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,791
That's cute, but you're
not exactly known

104
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,958
for being lighthearted.

105
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,500
I read your file.

106
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,166
Last year you expelled an entire
class of freshmen students.

107
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,458
You have no problem
kicking students out.

108
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,208
Anyone you deem unworthy.

109
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,250
You were planning to
send last place home.

110
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,333
So that can only mean...

111
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,166
...you see the same
kind of potential

112
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,625
in Young Midoriya that I do.

113
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,291
What is this about?

114
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,583
It almost sounds
like you've been

115
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,958
in his corner the whole time.

116
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Uh--

117
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,333
[AIZAWA] Isn't it a little early
for you to be playing favorites?

118
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,208
He doesn't have zero
potential, I admit.

119
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,625
If that were the case.

120
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,833
I would have sent
him straight home

121
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,041
after class without hesitation.

122
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,125
It's cruel to let a kid
keep dreaming of something

123
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,041
that will never come true.

124
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:18,208
[ALL MIGHT] In your own strange
way, you're a kind man, Aizawa.

125
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,666
I know that.

126
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,583
But clearly, we are
gonna have us a problem.

127
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,583
[groans] I'm so tired.

128
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,916
[gasps] Hey there, Iida!

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,333
How's the broken finger doing?

130
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:38,125
O-Oh. It's doin' fine,
thanks to Recovery Girl.

131
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,208
[IZUKU screaming]

132
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,041
Whoa, thanks, that
feels so much better!

133
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,333
But, uh, I suddenly
feel really tired.

134
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,750
I need a nap.

135
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,083
My Quirk stimulates
your ability to heal,

136
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,041
but healing takes energy.

137
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,833
It's not my fault, that's
just how the body works.

138
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,791
Get too many big
injuries, your stamina

139
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,000
will be shot and you'll
die instead of healing,

140
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,083
so be careful.

141
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,291
[IZUKU]
You mean this could kill me?!

142
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,833
[IZUKU] I can't keep relying
on help from others.

143
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,958
I have to hurry up and
learn to control my power.

144
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,000
I was a bit concerned

145
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,250
by Mr. Aizawa's
approach to class.

146
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,958
But I trust the
school's judgment.

147
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,791
UA is the top program.

148
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,333
Even so, lying is
downright immoral.

149
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,541
[IZUKU] I thought he was
scary, but that's not it.

150
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,750
He's just really
serious about school.

151
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,958
[OCHACO]
Hey! Wait up, you two!

152
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,416
Are you going to the station?

153
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,958
I'll join you guys!

154

[IZUKU]
It's her again!

Oh, you're the infinity girl.

I'm Ochaco Uraraka.

Let's see. You are Tenya Iida.

158
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,291
And your name is...
Deku, right? Midoriya?

159

[IZUKU]
"Deku"?

160
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,958
Uh, yeah, isn't that
what Bakugo called you?

161
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,875
During the fitness
test, he said...

162
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,583
Deku, you bastard!

163
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,625
[OCHACO]
Right?

164
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,083
Uh, well. My name's
actually Izuku.

165
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,166
Deku's what Kacchan calls
me to make fun of me.

166
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,416
That's unsportsmanlike.

167
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,291
[OCHACO] Oh, I didn't
realize that! I'm sorry.

168
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,291
But, you know what?
I like "Deku."

169
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,000
It could make a great hero name!

170
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,708
Plus, I think it
sounds kinda cute.

171
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,625
Deku it is!

172
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,166
[TENYA]
Just like that?

173
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,625
Weren't you saying
that it was an insult?

174
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,500
[IZUKU] Paradigm shift!
My whole world is upside down!

175

Wait, what?

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,208
[IZUKU]
I survived my first day at UA.

177
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,041
Even if I kinda failed.

178
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,708
But, you know what, All Might?

179
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,708
At least I'm making
some new friends.

180
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,708
That's gotta be a
good thing, right?

[ALL MIGHT] You don't have
time to relax, Midoriya.

[IZUKU]
UA's Hero Course curriculum.

184
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,250
There are normal core
classes, like English.

185
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,291
They meet in the mornings.

186
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,666
Now.

187
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,333
Which of these four sentences
contains a mistake?

00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,708
[ASHIDO, KAMINARI, JIRO]
So boring.

[KATSUKI]
This really sucks.

190
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,666
Hey, everybody, look
alive! Grammar rules!

191
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,458
[IZUKU] The relative pronoun's
wrong in the last one!

[PRESENT MIC]
Yaoyorozu, lay it on us!

193
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,000
[IZUKU] We eat lunch
in the main cafeteria,

194
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,958
where we can buy pretty
tasty stuff on the cheap.

I can't believe it's
really All Might!

205
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,916
So he is a teacher!

Is he wearing his
Silver Age costume?

I'm getting goose-bumps.
It's so retro!

210
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,250
Welcome to the most
important class at UA High.

211
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,458
Think of it as "Hero-ing 101."

212
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,958
Here, you will learn the
basics of being a pro.

213
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,750
And what it means to fight
in the name of good!

Let's get into it.

Today's lesson will
pull no punches!

Fight training.

217
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,333
Real combat?

218
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,208
But one of the keys
of being a hero is...

219
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,791
...looking good!

220
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,208
These were designed for you

221
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,208
based on your Quirk registration
forms and the requests

222

[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

make the pros,

[IZUKU]
The clothing allowance.

236
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,083
Before we enrolled at
UA High, we submitted

237
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,333
our Quirk registration
forms; which included

238
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,083
physical measurements and
any desired costume designs

239
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,166
to an exclusive clothing company
designated by the school.

240
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,708
With all that info, they created

241
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,125
state-of-the-art
costumes for us.

00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,083
Yeah, you can update
that, not a problem.

248
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,250
It's that easy?

249
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,125
[ALL MIGHT laughs]
Y'know how everyone's

250
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,250
examined and registered

251
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,625
when they enter
elementary school?

252
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,208
Well, there are plenty
of cases where people

253
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,041
discover that their
Quirks aren't exactly

254
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,791
what they thought
they were at first.

255
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,208
You're allowed to
revise your forms

256
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,916
once or twice when you
understand your powers better.

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,916
Normally, they won't let
you change it too much,

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,416
but if you had "none" before,

259
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,833
I'm sure they'll want you to
update things. Look, just--

Is that a costume?

I guess I might have
jumped the gun a little bit.

268
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,958
I brought you food earlier
but you'd dozed off,

269
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,208
and I maybe happened to
peek at your notebook.

[IZUKU]
Seriously?

To be honest with you,

I've been feeling
really terrible lately.

About something I said to you.

00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,541
I think you might have felt

275
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,833
that I gave up on
you a while back.

276

But now look at you.

You persevered, and kept
chasing your dream

like a real champion.

279

I'll support you with everything
I've got from now on!

so of course it's
what I'm gonna wear!

00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,958
It's not state-of-the-art
or flashy, but it means

00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,291
something to me.

specific about what I wanted.

Not really my style.

[TENYA] This is the fake city
from our entrance exam.

302
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,250
Does that mean that we'll be
conducting urban battles again?

Not quite.

I'm going to move
you two steps ahead.

305

Most of the villain fights
you see on the news

take place outside.

307

[IZUKU grunts]

Think about it. Backroom deals,

home invasions, secret
underground lairs.

Truly intelligent criminals
stay hidden in the shadows.

For this training exercise,

314

you'll be split into teams

and fight two-on-two
indoor battles.

316
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,958
Isn't this a little advanced?

317
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,041
The best training is what
you get on the battlefield!

318
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,875
But remember, you can't just
punch a robot this time.

319
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,041
You're dealing with
actual people now.

320
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,916
Sir, will you be the
one deciding who wins?

321
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,291
How much can we
hurt the other team?

322
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,791
Do we need to worry
about the losers

323
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,250
getting expelled like earlier?

324
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,708
[TENYA] Will you be
splitting us up based on

325
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,000
chance or comparative skill?

326
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,583
Isn't this cape très chic?

327
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,458
[ALL MIGHT growls]
I wasn't finished talking!

328
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Listen up.

329
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,625
[IZUKU]
A script?

330
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,125
[ALL MIGHT]
The situation is this.

331
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,875
The villains have
hidden a nuclear missile

332
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,250
somewhere in their hideout.

333
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,666
The heroes must try
to foil their plans.

334
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,541
To do that, the good
guys either have to

335
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,041
catch the evildoers
or recover the weapon.

336
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,208
Likewise, the bad guys
succeed if they protect

337
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,458
their payload or
capture the heroes.

338
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,083
[IZUKU] Sounds like a
classic action movie setup.

339
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,916
Time's limited, and
we'll choose teams

340
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,916
by drawing lots!

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,500
[TENYA]
Isn't there a better way?

342
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,000
Think about it!

343
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,708
Pros often have to team up with
heroes from other agencies

344
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,750
on the spot, so maybe that's the
reason we're seeing that here.

345
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,166
[TENYA]
Yes, I see.

346
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,416
Life is a random
series of events.

347
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,708
Excuse my rudeness.

348
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,166
No sweat. Let's draw!

349
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,958
Wow, what are the
chances? We're a team!

350
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,125
[IZUKU]
Oh my gosh!

351
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,000
I have to make a good
impression on her.

352
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,458
I declare that the first
teams to fight will be...

353
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,500
...these guys!

354
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,208
Team A will be the heroes,

355
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,125
Team D will be the villains.

356
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,916
Everyone else can head to
the monitoring room to watch!

357
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,083
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

358
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,083
[gasps]

359
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,458
[gasps]

360
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,708
[growls]

361
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,125
[ALL MIGHT] Bad guys, you can
go on in and get set up.

362
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,041
In five minutes, the good
guys will be let loose

363
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,458
and the battle will start!

364
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,208
[TENYA, OCHAC, IZUKU]
Yes, sir!

365
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,833
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Iida. Young Bakugo.

366
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,250
The key to being successful
in this challenge

367
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,833
is to embody villainy.

368
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,083
Think from the perspective
of an evildoer.

369
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,333
[TENYA]
Got it!

370
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,000
[ALL MIGHT] If things go
too far, I'll step in.

371
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:29,708
[TENYA]
Understood!

372
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,541
[growls]

373
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,958
[TENYA]
Even though this is training,

374
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,625
it pains me to be aligned
with criminal behavior.

375
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,708
[TENYA] So this is the
weapon we must protect.

376
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,083
Fake, of course.

377
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:43,833
[KATSUKI]
Hey!

378
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,375
[TENYA]
Hm?

379
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,833
[KATSUKI] Do you really
think Deku has a Quirk?

380
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,125
You saw how he
threw that ball.

381
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,250
Though I think his
power hurts his body.

382
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,708
[KATSUKI]
Tch.

383
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,291
[TENYA] Why is it that you
seem to be especially angry

384
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,916
when it comes to Midoriya?

385
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,833
[KATSUKI] Was he seriously just
tricking me all these years?

386
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,166
I'm gonna roast that
damn nerd today!

387
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,916
[OCHACO] Ya think they
expect us to memorize

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,416
this building's floor plan?
It's so big! You know.

389
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,458
All Might's just as cool in
person as he is on television!

390
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,750
I'm glad he's not threatening us

391
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,791
with some kind of
punishment like Mr. Aizawa.

392
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,000
We can relax--

393
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,750
Ah! You're sweating
through your costume!

394
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,958
Uh. Well.

395
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,916
It's just because we're
up against Kacchan.

396
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,458
Plus there's Iida, too.

397
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,000
We should be on our guard,
who knows what they'll pull.

398
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,208
Oh, right. Bakugo.

399
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,916
He's the one who's always
making fun of you.

400
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,875
[IZUKU sighs]
And he's amazing.

401
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,333
I'll end up more popular
than All Might himself,

402
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,916
and be the richest
hero of all time!

403
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,625
[IZUKU]
He can be a real pain, sure.

404
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,416
But his strength
and confidence...

405
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,916
...and his ambition...

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,833
Not to mention his Quirk.

407
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,250
They're all so much
greater than mine.

408
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,041
Uh...

409
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,833
[IZUKU] But that just means
I have to do better.

410
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,125
I refuse to lose today.

411
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,708
So it's a fated
battle between rivals?

412
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,583
[IZUKU] Oh, not that I'm
trying to get you wrapped up

413
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,625
in my fight or anything!

414
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,583
Are you kidding?
We're a team, right?

415
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,125
Let's win this!

416
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,250
[ALL MIGHT]
All right!

417
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,958
Let's begin the indoor
combat training!

418
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:27,916
Team A and Team D,
your time starts now!

419
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,416
Pay attention, kids.

420
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,833
Think about what you would do.

421
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,333
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya!

422
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,000
In this class, you're
just another student.

423
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,333
I'll grade you as I
would anyone else.

424
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,375
Without playing favorites.

425
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,750
And just like that, we're in.

426
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,583
[IZUKU] Careful, there are
a lot of blind spots.

427
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,000
[IZUKU] I still have basically
no control over One For All.

428
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,583
I can't risk using it.

429
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,125
If I did, I'd probably
end up killing someone.

430
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,041
We'll just have to win with
Uraraka's Zero Gravity,

431
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,000
and whatever I can
do without a Quirk.

432
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,041
I've gotta use my head.

433
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,708
I took a lot of notes
on indoor battles

434
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,750
and fighting in tight spaces.

435
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,750
[IZUKU]
I can do this!

436
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,416
[IZUKU gasps]

437
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,541
[grunting]

438
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,833
Uraraka, you okay?

439
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,250
[OCHACO]
I'm fine. Thanks!

440
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,583
Oh! Deku!

441
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,750
It's just my mask.

442
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,583
[BOTH gasp]

443
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,458
What's the matter, Deku?

444
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,458
Afraid to stand up and fight me?

445
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,458
I knew you'd
come at me first.

446
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,791
And figured you'd try
to catch me by surprise.

447
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,250
[MINETA]
He almost got the jump on them.

448
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,750
Sneak attack, Bakugo?

449
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,041
What kinda man pulls
cheap crap like that?

450
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,541
It's a viable strategy.

451
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,583
He's playing the part.

452
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,208
Acting like a
true villain would.

453
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,416
It didn't work.
Midoriya dodged him!

454
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,833
Look, there he goes!

455
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,041
I won't hurt you so bad

456
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,500
they'll have to stop
the fight. Just close!

457
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,291
[yells]

458
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,083
[gasps]

459
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,708
Wow! Look at those moves!

460
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,875
[KATSUKI]
Impossible. How'd he know?

461
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,666
He's not that good!

462
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,916
[grunting]

463
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,291
[yells]

464
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,625
[groans]

465
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,583
[ALL MIGHT]
Huh?

466
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,000
[IZUKU pants]

467
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,250
[IZUKU]
Kacchan.

468
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,333
You always use a big
right hook to start a fight.

469
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,083
I know because I've
watched you for years.

470
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,375
[KATSUKI]
Huh?

471
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:44,000
[IZUKU] I analyzed every
amazing hero, even you.

472
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,250
I wanted to learn everything
I could about them.

473
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,041
It was all in the
notebook you burned

474
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,375
and threw away.

475
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,958
[growls]

476
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,833
You can call me Deku, but
I'm not the same helpless,

477
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,041
defenseless kid anymore!

478
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,458
You hear me? I've changed.

479
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,333
From now on, Deku is
the name of a hero!

480
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,541
[gasps]

481
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,083
[OCHACO] But you know
what? I like "Deku."

482
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,666
It could make a
great hero name!

483
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,125
Plus, I think it
sounds kinda cute.

484
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,166
[KATSUKI]
Deku.

485
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:23,958
If you keep on hurting him,
then I'll stop you myself!

486
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,375
[IZUKU grunting]

487
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,291
[KATSUKI] You're shaking in
your boots, you're so scared.

488
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,833
[growls]

489
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,583
[KATSUKI]
But you wanna fight me anyway.

490
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,666
That's why I hate you!

491
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,625
[TENYA] Midoriya. Even though
this is just training,

492
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,291
I'm going to give my all, 100%.

493
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,000
That's the Iida way,
and I won't tarnish

494
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,541
my family's heroic name!

495
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,875
[IZUKU]
Iida.

496
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,375
Are you sure you can play
a convincing villain?

497
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,125
[TENYA laughs]
Of course.

498
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,958
Didn't you know,
I'm extremely evil?

499
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,416
[IZUKU yelps]
He's so in character.

500
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,875
Next time: "Deku vs. Kacchan"!

501
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,375
[TENYA]
Hold on, I didn't know Uraraka

502
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,791
was a baseball player!

503
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:35,958
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

504
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,958
[IZUKU, TENYA]
Plus Ultra!
