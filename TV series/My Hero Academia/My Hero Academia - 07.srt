1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:10,750
[KATSUKI]
Hey!

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,625
Do you really think
Deku has a Quirk?

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,333
You saw how he threw that ball.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:20,041
[KATSUKI] Was he seriously just
tricking me all these years?

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:24,166
I'm gonna roast that
damn nerd today!

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,458
[IZUKU]
He can be a real pain, sure.

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:30,791
But his strength, and
confidence, and his ambition...

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,541
Not to mention his Quirk.

9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,083
They're all so much
greater than mine.

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:41,250
But that just means
that I have to do better.

11
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,875
I refuse to lose today.

12
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:44,958
[ALL MIGHT]
All right.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,250
Let's begin the
indoor combat training!

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:52,583
Team A and Team D.
Your time starts now!

15
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,833
[grunting]

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,875
What's the matter, Deku?

17
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,916
Afraid to stand up and fight me?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,125
I won't hurt you so bad

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,916
they'll have to stop
the fight. Just close!

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,083
[IZUKU grunts]

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,041
[gasps]

22
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,958
Wow! Look at those moves!

23
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:14,000
[KATSUKI] Impossible. How'd
he know? He's not that good!

24
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,083
[grunting]

25
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,208
[yelling]

26
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,250
[groans]

27
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,916
You can call me Deku,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,708
but I'm not the same helpless,
defenseless kid anymore!

29
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,583
You hear me? I've changed!

30
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,500
From now on, Deku is
the name of a hero!

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,416
[IZUKU] Kacchan and I grew up
in the same neighborhood,

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,791
so we've known each other
since we were little kids.

33
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,583
Uh...

34
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,125
Come on! Let's fight bad guys!

35
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,875
[BOYS]
Yeah!

36
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,875
Oh! Yeah!

37
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,166
[IZUKU]
All the other neighborhood kids

38
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,500
followed him around.

39
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,500
It seemed like he
could do anything.

40
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,541
And no matter what
he decided to do,

41
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,958
he was always so confident.

42
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,875
I thought he was the
coolest person I'd ever met.

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,666
[IZUKU]
However...

44
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,500
After his Quirk manifested,
he started to change.

45
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,666
[KATSUKI] You're shaking in
your boots, you're so scared.

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,291
But you wanna fight me anyway.

47
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,416
That's why I hate you!

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,333
[IZUKU]
Here's the sad truth.

49
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,875
All men are not created equal.

50
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,250
When I was four years old,

51
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,083
I learned that some kids
have more power than others.

52
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,583
[TENYA]
Bakugo! Come in!

53
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,333
Give me a status report.
Where are you?

54
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,708
Just shut up and
defend the weapon.

55
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,416
I've got more important
things to worry about.

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,041
[TENYA] Are you forgetting
what our mission is?

57
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,041
Hello? He hung up on me!

58
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,291
This isn't the time
for radio silence.

59
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,166
We're supposed to
be partners. Argh!

60
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,708
[KIRISHIMA]
Hey, who's Bakugo talking to?

61
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,916
I'm not hearing anything.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,875
Can we get any sound
with this video?

63
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,500
He's got a radio in
his ear so he can

64
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,791
talk to his partner.

65
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,708
I gave it to him before
the match started.

66
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,458
Along with a map
of the building.

67
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,750
Also, this. A roll
of capture tape!

68
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,083
Wrapping this around
your opponent

69
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,291
means you've apprehended them,

70
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,750
and they're out for
the rest of the game.

71
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,708
[ASHIDO] So, there's a
15-minute time limit,

72
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,458
and the good guys have
no idea what floor

73
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,166
the nuclear weapon
is hidden on, right?

74
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Correct!

75
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,583
Then the heroes are clearly
at a disadvantage here.

76
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,583
A big one!

77
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,125
Real Pros have
to outwit villains

78
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,791
on a daily basis.

79
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,125
That's life.

80
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,250
Even when the odds aren't
in our favor, we fight!

81
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,458
--[JIRO gasps]
--[KIRISHIMA laughs]

82
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,208
All together!

83
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,250
[ALL MIGHT, STUDENTS]
Let's hear a Plus Ultra!

84
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,583
Monsieur. He's on the move.

85
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,833
[ALL MIGHT]
Hm?

86
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,916
[KATSUKI grunts]

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,083
Ah! Uraraka! Go!

88
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,166
[OCHACO grunts]

89
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,250
[IZUKU grunts]

90
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:31,000
Ballsy move. Think you
can take me alone?

91
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,916
[KATSUKI]
He's using the capture tape!

92
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,541
[IZUKU] Hero notebook
number ten, page 18!

93
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,250
Luckily, I got to see
Eraser Head's moves in action!

94
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,791
What'll Kacchan do now?

95
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,416
Knowing him, he'll be impatient
and try another big punch!

96
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,416
[gasps]

97
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,541
[IZUKU]
I was right!

98
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,125
The little guy's really good!

99
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,791
[SERO] He's holding his own
and he hasn't even

100
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,791
used his Quirk yet!

101
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,291
[ALL MIGHT]
Not surprising.

102
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,208
He's always been pretty
good at taking action

103
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,125
in crisis situations.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,666
[ALL MIGHT] Plus, he spent
years taking notes

105
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,291
on different heroes.

106
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,000
He internalized
everything he learned.

107
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,333
Those lessons are
in his blood now.

108
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,250
That fanboy knowledge
is paying off!

109
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,333
And driving him forward!

110
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,250
[IZUKU]
He kicked first this time.

111
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,125
He's switching things up so
I can't predict his moves.

112
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,916
Does that mean he's worried?

113
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,125
[KATSUKI grunts]
Get back here, Deku!

114
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,958
[KATSUKI growls]

115
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,041
[IZUKU] I'm not gonna be able
to fight him at close range now.

116
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,041
I need some kinda plan!

117
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,208
Dammit!

118
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,541
You were tricking me
for years by acting weak.

119
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,875
Bet you've been laughing
behind my back, huh?

120
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,375
[gasps]

121
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,541
[KATSUKI growls] So where's that
flashy power a' yours now?

122
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,833
[growls]

123
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,958
Let's see how it
compares to mine.

124
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,916
Quirk or no, you'll
never beat me, Deku!

125
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,875
[KAMINARI] That guy has
some real anger issues.

126
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,750
Kinda scary...

127
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,791
[ALL MIGHT] Midoriya told
me that Young Bakugo

128
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,041
thinks very highly of himself.

129
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,791
But this level of pride
is something else.

130
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,333
It may end up being his demise.

131
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:26,750
[IZUKU panting]

132
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,833
[IZUKU] Good, he's completely
forgotten about my partner.

133
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,291
Just like I thought.

134
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,625
If they wanted to
send someone out

135
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,625
to stop us here,
it should've been Iida.

136
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,375
He's way faster, after all.

137
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,458
[IZUKU] That probably means
Kacchan's gone rogue.

138
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,583
The two of them aren't
working together as a team.

139
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,458
If we had to take those
two on head-to-head,

140
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,666
our chances of winning
would be pretty low.

141
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,458
They've got such strong Quirks.

142
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,958
I can't go after the
weapon right now

143
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,125
or Kacchan will follow me.

144
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,500
And if we both tried
to take him down,

145
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,458
we'd probably run out of time.

146
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,250
[IZUKU]
So we stay split up for now.

147
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,916
I have to trust Uraraka.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,333
She'll find the weapon and Iida,

149
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,583
and then I'll join her
for a two-on-one fight.

150
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,833
That's how we'll win.

151
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,166
I'll just have to capture
Kacchan down here.

152
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,708
On my own.

153
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,583
I can do it.

154
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,541
As long as I don't get
too close to his hands.

155
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,541
[KATSUKI]
Stop hiding!

156
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,708
[gasps]

157
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,166
Come out and
face me, you coward!

158
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,500
[IZUKU]
By the way.

159
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,833
I've been meaning
to tell you, Kacchan.

160

[TENYA gasps]

318
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,875
[OCHACO]
I just have to touch the weapon.

319
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,708
In one move,
this'll all be over.

320
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,541
[TENYA] Since when can
she make herself float?

321
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,458
Release!

322
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,291
[OCHACO] This special move
is hard, but it's worth it!

323
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,250
[yells]

324
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,083
[OCHACO yelps]

325
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,416
[groans]

326
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,958
[TENYA] Admirable attempt,
but your Quirk's no threat

327
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,541
if you can't touch anything.

328
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,500
I can easily keep this
weapon out of your reach

329
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,333
until time runs out.
[evil laughter]

330
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,791
[OCHACO grunts] It's not over,
I won't let Deku down.

331
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,666
[KATSUKI] What's the matter?
You look scared.

332
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,625
You dodged the attack, so you
can still fight, can't you?

333
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,625
Come and get me.

334
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,375
[IZUKU] The gauntlets make
it so he can use his powers

335
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:07,125
at long range. I'm not safe,
even if I stay away from him.

336
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,500
So what do I do?

337
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,083
Come in, what's the situation?

338
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,375
[OCHACO]
It's not good!

339
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,416
Are you ignoring me again?

340
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,458
I'll get your attention.

341
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,666
[KIRISHIMA] Sir, isn't
this getting outta hand?

342
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,208
That Bakugo is
acting real crazy.

343
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,750
He's gonna kill 'im!

344
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,916
Not so.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,125
I won't hurt you so bad

346
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,416
they'll have to stop
the fight, just close!

347
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,833
Oh, he'll be fine
as long as he dodges!

348
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,125
[ALL MIGHT]
Despite his fierce posturing,

349
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:39,458
he's not actually trying to
kill Midoriya. But still...

350
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,958
[ALL MIGHT]
Bakugo.

351
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,166
Use that stored-up power again
and I'll stop this fight.

352
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,375
Your team will lose.

353
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,708
Huh?

354
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,791
[ALL MIGHT] To employ such
a strong attack indoors

355
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,875
is inviting the destruction
of the stronghold

356
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,541
you should be protecting.

357
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,916
That's a poor strategy, whether
you're a hero or a villain.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The penalty would be
a massive loss of points.

359
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,416
[ALL MIGHT]
I know that as a teacher,

360
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,500
I should stop this
fight now. But...

361
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,708
[growling]

362
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,916
The pillar by the window.
Get there now! [gasps]

363
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,291
[KATSUKI]
We'll fight hand-to-hand!

364
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,208
[IZUKU] It's no good.
I can't dodge this!

365
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,833
I'll have to
counterattack! Like this!

366
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,250
[KATSUKI grunts]

367
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,833
[yells]

368
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:26,833
[STUDENTS gasp]

369
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,166
What was that move?

370
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,958
He doesn't come off as
a guy with a strategy.

371
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,833
But he's actually
quite intelligent.

372
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,666
[ASHIDO]
Huh?

373
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,083
What're you talkin' about?

374
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,083
[TODOROKI] He changed his
trajectory while in midair

375
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,708
using a blast that doubled
as a smokescreen.

376
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,000
Very clever.

377
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,375
A feint attack
like that requires

378
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,041
an extreme amount of precision.
He had to calculate

379
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,000
the physics and demonstrate
control over his Quirk.

380
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,958
Ugh, Bakugo is uber
talented. I hate it.

381
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,000
[IZUKU grunts]

382
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,208
[KATSUKI]
Here it comes, nerd!

383
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,541
The famous right hook
you were whining about!

384
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,541
[IZUKU screams]

385
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,791
[KATSUKI]
Deku!

386
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,416
Don't you ever
forget what you are!

387
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,833
You're a weakling!

388
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,208
[groans]

389
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,541
[IZUKU] He's not giving me
any time to form a strategy.

390
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,833
I can't beat him without
a Quirk after all.

391
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,458
He's too good.

392
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,958
[IZUKU] I have no choice.
I have to use it.

393
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,458
[ASHIDO]
This is hard to watch!

394
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,541
All he has to do is wrap tape
around him, not kill him.

395
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,791
Bakugo's certainly
acting like a villain.

396
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,500
I thought Midoriya
was pretty amazing

397
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,416
at the start of the fight,
but he's completely

398
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,708
outmatched in terms
of combat power.

399
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,625
Not to mention, Bakugo
seems like a natural

400
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,083
at all this stuff.

401
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:47,208
[ALL MIGHT]
I should end this. But--

402
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,458
[pants]

403
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,875
[ALL MIGHT] For his sake,
I'll let it go on.

404
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,666
[ASHIDO]
He's running away!

405
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,333
Not very manly, but he
doesn't have a choice.

406
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:02,291
He's outgunned. Unless he's
got some kinda plan.

407
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,500
It's possible...

408
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,791
[IZUKU panting]

409
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,125
Why won't you use your
damn Quirk against me?

410
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,500
Still think you can
stop me without it?

411
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,416
That's not it.

412
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,625
You've been hiding your
true power for years.

413
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,125
What's the deal, Deku?

414
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,916
Did you think you were better
than me this entire time?

415
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,416
That's what you think?

416
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,583
[IZUKU]
You idiot.

417
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,625
You've always been
stronger, Kacchan.

418
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,041
I know that you're
better than me.

419
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,708
[grunts]

420
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,625
[IZUKU]
Can't you see?

421
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,416
That's why I wanna beat you.
Because you're amazing!

422
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
[KATSUKI] You're even more
of an idiot than I realized.

423
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,041
Come at me!

424
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,125
[ALL MIGHT] The only other time
I hear that much passion

425
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,583
in his voice is when he
talks about being a hero.

426
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,833
In order to achieve his dream,
he has to do this.

427
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,666
Not for me, but for himself!

428
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,333
[IZUKU]
Detroit...

429
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,958
[yelling]

430
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,833
They're gonna kill
each other! Sir!

431
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:26,750
[yelling]

432
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,750
Both of you, stop--!

433
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,041
Uraraka, now!

434
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:29,750
[ALL MIGHT]
Hm?

435
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,291
Right!

436
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,333
[TENYA gasps]

437
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,583
[IZUKU]
I can't beat you.

438
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,291
Not in a one-on-one
fight like this.

439
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,583
But I can win!

440
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:44,666
Smash!

441

[TENYA gasps]
What's happening?

443
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,000
This is it! Sorry, Iida!

444
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:10,708
Improvised special move:
the Comet Home Run!

445
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,500
[TENYA] In the name of villainy,
I demand that you stop this!

446
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,500
Release!

[TENYA gasps]

00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,166

[TENYA gasps]

450
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,541
[TENYA]
No! The weapon!

451
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,458
This was your big plan...

452
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,958
...from the very
beginning, wasn't it?

453
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,333
You were playing me this
entire time, you bastard.

454
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,875
[IZUKU]
I wasn't... going to use it.

455
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,083
[grunts]

456
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,791
[IZUKU whimpers]
Because I can't control it.

457
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:58,458
My body just can't handle...
the backlash of my power yet.

458
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,625
Mr. Aizawa said I'd be useless.

459
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,791
But this was all...
that I... could think of.

460
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,833
[KATSUKI gasps]

461
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:12,458
This is the only way...
I had any chance at winning.

[KATSUKI grunts]

463
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,083
You did it.

...wins!

have a lot to learn,

467
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,125
but I'll help you hero up!

468

"Bakugo's Start Line"!

Young Bakugo's going to get

00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,333
all teary-eyed on us!
