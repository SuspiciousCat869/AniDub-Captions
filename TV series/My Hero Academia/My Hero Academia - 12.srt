I'm positive I erased his Quirk.

It's All Might!

20
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,708
[ALL MIGHT] I couldn't
shake the feeling that

21
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,166
something had gone
wrong here when

22
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,958
Aizawa and Thirteen
didn't answer my calls.

23
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,208
So I hurried over,

24
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,666
running into Young Iida
along the way.

25
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,625
He told me of the
villainy at work here.

26
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,208
[ALL MIGHT] I can't believe
all of this went down

27
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,916
while I was resting.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,291
I hate to think of
how frightened

29
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,041
these children must be.

30
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,833
And how hard my
colleagues had to fight

31

in order to protect them.

32
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,875
The only thing I can do
now is reassure them

33
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,500
that things will be okay.

34
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,375
That's my duty as

I didn't expect
him to be so huge.

time to talk, you idiots.

Of course a government hero

I couldn't even see
him when he moved.

But he's not as fast as
I thought he would be.

has shock absorption, All Might.

The only way you're
going to hurt him

is to slowly gouge
out his flesh.

this? That suplex

All Might's on a
whole 'nother level!

109
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,125
And yet he still has
to look at his notes

110
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,208
when he's teaching us.

111
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,666
[IZUKU] It's possible they
have a way to kill him.

112
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,083
But even if they do,
there's not really anything

113
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,875
we can do to help him now.

114
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,750
If we tried to, we'd risk
getting taken hostage,

115
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,541
which is so much worse than
just getting in his way.

116
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,583
I have to put my
faith in All Might,

117
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,500
and stop worrying about
the villains' plans.

Punch him right in the balls!

120
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,750
Maybe we were worried about
these bad guys for nothing.

121
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,750
All Might's unstoppable.

122
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,166
[IZUKU]
Seems that way. But...

123
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,916
I know the truth.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,333
I read the hero news this
morning on my way to school,

125
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,708
and saw the headlines
about All Might.

126
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,041
Then, when they
were talking about

127
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,833
why he wasn't at training,

128
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,625
Thirteen held up three fingers,

129
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,041
probably to indicate
that All Might

130
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,583
was already at his limit today.

131
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,708
He must've been absent because
he'd used too much of his power!

132
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,333
He shouldn't be using
One For All now!

133
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,791
I'm the only one in
my class who knows.

134
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,208
Pretty gross, right?

135
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,291
I got this in a big fight
five years back.

136
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,083
My respiratory system
was basically destroyed,

137
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,875
and I lost my whole stomach.

138
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,333
All the surgeries have
pretty much worn me out.

139
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,083
And it can't be fixed.

140
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,500
Right now, I can
only do hero work

141
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,958
for about three hours a day.

142
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,833
The rest of the time,
this is what I look like.

143
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,416
I'm supposed to be the guy
who's always smiling, right?

I'm the Symbol of Peace.

145
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,541
People everywhere have to
think that I'm never afraid.

146
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,583
But honestly, kid, I smile
to hide the fear inside.

147
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,833
It's just a brave face I put on
when the pressure is high.

This job isn't easy.

but at what cost?

Nice work, Kurogiri.

[ALL MIGHT] Damn. Gotta stop
him, despite his power.

If this is your best,

[ALL MIGHT grunts, growls]

[KUROGIRI] Since you're too fast
to see with the human eye,

176
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,291
Nomu had to restrain you.

00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,375
And once he's pulled your
body halfway through.

178
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,833
I'll squeeze the gate shut.

[IZUKU] Will you carry
Mr. Aizawa for me?

I want you to teach me!

[ALL MIGHT] He's frozen! That
means Todoroki must be here!

One of your poorly
trained thugs told me

you're here because you think
you can kill All Might.

[ALL MIGHT]
He controlled his Quirk

00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,708
so that the ice stopped just
before it reached my body.

You used that mist to
hide your actual body,

00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,208
as a kind of distraction.

actions sound noble.

318
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,583
But admit it; you're only
doing this because you like it.

319
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,250
Isn't that right?

320
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,541
[SHIGARAKI]
He's got me figured out.

321
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,958
We've got them outnumbered.

322
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,208
And Kacchan found the
mist guy's weakness.

323
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,958
These dudes may
act really tough,

324
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,250
but we can take 'em down
now with All Might's help.

325
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,166
Let's do this.

326
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't attack.

327
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,250
[STUDENTS gasp]

328
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,375
Get out of here.

329
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,750
You would've been
in trouble earlier

330
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,208
if it weren't for me,
remember? You need our help.

331
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,458
[ALL MIGHT] I thank you
for your assistance,

332
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,541
but this is different.

333
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,250
It's gonna be all right.

334
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,958
Just sit back and
watch a pro at work.

335
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,875
But you're too hurt.
You're bleeding.

336
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,791
And you're almost out of ti--

337
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,416
[IZUKU]
All Might...

338
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:59,041
[SHIGARAKI]
Nomu. Kurogiri. Kill him.

339
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,250
I'll deal with the children.

340
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,958
[ALL MIGHT] I'm afraid that
I barely have a minute left

341
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,666
in this form.
My power's declining

342
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,541
faster than I thought it would.

343
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,875
[SHIGARAKI] Let's clear
this level and go home.

344
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:20,916
[ALL MIGHT] Even so, I have
to stop these villains.

345
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,750
Heads up, we're
fightin' after all.

346
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,125
[ALL MIGHT]
Because I am...

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,458
[ALL MIGHT] ...the world's
Symbol of Peace and Justice!

[SHIGARAKI grunts]
Weren't you listening?

353
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,750
One of his powers
is shock absorption.

354
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,875
Yeah? What about it?

355
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,750
[ALL MIGHT grunting]

[IZUKU grunting]

357
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,833
He's gonna fight that
brain guy head on?

358
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,958
Whoa, they're... so fast!

359
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,250
[KUROGIRI]
No! I can't get near them!

360
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,791
[ALL MIGHT] He said your Quirk
was only shock absorption,

361
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,583
not nullification.
That means there's a limit

362
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,708
to what you can take, right?

363
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,250
[ALL MIGHT groans]

364
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,958
[ALL MIGHT] So, you were
made to fight me, big guy.

365
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,708
If you can really
withstand me firing

366
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,666
at 100% of my power...

367

[SHIGARAKI gasps]

368
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,500
...then I'll have to go beyond
that and force you to surrender.

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,666
[ALL MIGHT grunting]

370
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,625
[IZUKU] He's giving it his all
even though he's injured!

371
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,375
[IZUKU] Those aren't just
random punches, either.

372
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:53,208
They're targeted, and every
single one of them...

373
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,166
[IZUKU] ...is more than
100% of his power.

[ALL MIGHT]
A real hero...

00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,375
[ALL MIGHT] ...will always find
a way for justice to be served!

Ha!

[gasps]

381
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,916
[ALL MIGHT]
Now for a lesson.

382
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,125
You may have heard
these words before,

383
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,916
but I'll teach you
what they really mean.

Go beyond! Plus Ultra!

What's happening?

00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,083
Everything is shaking.

[VILLAIN I groans]

388
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,416
What was that?

389
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,583
Um, did a villain just fly by?

390
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,125
Or am I goin' crazy?

391
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,125
It was that brain dude.

392
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,458
[SHOJI]
Such power.

393
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,583
Ah... That's All Might for you.

394
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,125
That's why he's the most amazing
hero in the entire world!

395
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:28,916
Ribbit, ribbit.

396
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,333
[MINETA]
Yes!

397
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,833
[KIRISHIMA] That was like the
finishing move in a video game.

398
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,750
He beat the shock absorption
right out of him.

399
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,833
I've never seen that
kind of brute strength!

400
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,916
Imagine having power like that.

401
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,833
He must've been punching
that monster so fast,

402
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,666
he couldn't regenerate.

He really is the best.

That's how you get to be a pro.

He did it...

I really have gotten weaker.

Back in my heyday, five
hits woulda been enough

408
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,875
to knock that guy out.

409
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,541
But today, it took more
than 300 mighty blows.

You've been bested, villains.

this over with quickly.

He cheated.

419

[ALL MIGHT]
I know the members of Class 1-A

420
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,541
will become valiant heroes!

[IZUKU] Next time:
"In Each of Our Hearts!"

422
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,791
[ALL MIGHT] Now, yell it,
from the depths of your soul!

00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,041
