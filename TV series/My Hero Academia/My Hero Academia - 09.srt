[REPORTER A] Hey, you!
Can you tell us what it's like

3
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,041
to work so closely
with All Might?

4
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,333
[IZUKU] U-Um, sorry, I
have to go to the, uh,

5
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,416
the nurse's office!
Yeah, right away!

00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,833
Are you one of
All Might's students?

7
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,833
Tell us-- what's the Symbol
of Peace like in person?

8
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,833
Um... What's he like?

9
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,708
Well... Uh--

10
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,958
He's super muscle-y. Yeah!

11
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,250
How is he faring as a teacher;
what are you learning?

12
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,958
His leadership and
wisdom remind me

13
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,708
on a daily basis that
I attend the world's

14

most prestigious
educational institution.

15
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,250
Of course, he's the
personification of honor

16
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,000
and integrity that one
would expect, but he's also

17
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,791
not afraid to show his
students a more humorous side.

18
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,916
It's truly a unique
opportunity to be under

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,375
the direct tutelage of
the pro we all admire.

Excuse me, kid!

Are you in All Might's

Walk away.

Please, sir. Can you
get All Might for us?

25
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,916
Also, you look like a
mess, what's your deal?

All Might's not on campus today.

to life as a teacher!

[REPORTER B] I feel like I've
seen that guy somewhere before.

But where?

33
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,750
[REPORTER A] I don't know, but
he's a bit scruffy for a hero...

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,291
[AIZAWA] How does All Might
ever get anything done

35
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,166
with this media circus
stepping on his cape?

36
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,333
All right.

Hey! What's happening?

Don't you know about
the school's defenses?

This gate is the UA Barrier.

Defenses? It
practically killed me!

44
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,583
[REPORTER B] Yeah, well,
it's designed to stop anyone

who doesn't have a
student ID or special pass

46
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,875
from entering the campus.
Guess it works.

This school thinks
it's untouchable!

is grant me one interview.

I know, right?

as a faculty member at UA

took the entire
nation by surprise.

Naturally, the media
swarmed the school

Everyone wanted to get
their hands on All Might.

feeds and went over

each of your team's
results. Bakugo.

You're talented.

about your loss, okay?

Yeah, whatever.

70
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,416
[AIZAWA]
And Midoriya.

71
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,041
I see the only way
you won the match

72
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,708
was by messing up
your arm again.

73
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,875
Work harder.

74
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,208
And don't give me
the excuse that

75
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,208
you don't have control
over your Quirk.

76
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,875
That line's already getting old.

77
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,208
You can't keep
breaking your body

78
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,208
while training here.

79
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,750
But your Quirk will
be really useful

80
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,416
if you can get a handle on it.

[gasps]

82
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,000

00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,000
Right.

84
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,833
Let's get down to business.

85
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,166
Our first task will
decide your future.

[STUDENTS]
Is it another Quirk test?

87
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,125
You all need to pick
a class representative.

88
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,416
[STUDENTS] Oh, good.
Just normal school stuff!

89
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,541
Pick me, guys!
I wanna be class rep!

90
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,375
I'll take it!

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,708
Yeah, you're gonna need me.

92
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,916
Someone with style
would be best.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,541
I'm, like, totally
the right pick!

94
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,833
[IZUKU] In a normal classroom,
a representative's duties

95
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,041
would just be a
bunch of extra work.

96
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,333
But here in the hero course,
there's more to it.

97
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,208
It's a way to get noticed
by agencies and prove

98
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,291
you can lead a team
like a real pro.

99
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,541
Silence, everyone, please!

100
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,583
[TENYA]
The class representative's duty

101
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,083
is to lead others.

102
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,541
That's not something
just anyone can do.

103
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,125
You must first have the trust of
every student in the classroom.

104
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,666
Therefore, the most logical way

105
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,083
to fill this position
is democratically.

106
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,125
We will hold an election
to choose our leader!

107
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,625
[STUDENTS] It's pretty obvious
you want us to vote for you.

108
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,416
Is this really the best idea?

109
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,250
We've only known
each other a few days,

110
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,916
how do we know who we can trust?

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,291
Besides, everyone'll just
vote for themselves.

112
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,416
Most people will.

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
But that means
whoever does receive

114
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,375
multiple votes must truly be

115
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,333
the most suitable
person for the job.

116
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,083
It's the best way, right, sir?

117
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,458
Do what you want, just decide
before my nap's over.

118
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,166
[TENYA]
Thank you for your trust!

119
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,750
How did I get three votes?

00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,125
Okay, you idiots,
who voted for him?

121
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,625
What, did you
honestly think anyone

122
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,791
was gonna vote for you?

123
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,375
[KATSUKI]
What did you just say?!

124
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,958
[OCHACO] Maybe I'll just
keep my vote to myself.

125
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,291
Zero votes...

126
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,083
I feared this might happen,

127
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,750
but I can't argue with
the system I chose!

128
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,375
So you voted for
someone else, huh?

129
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,791
But you knew it was best
to vote for yourself, right?

130
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,125
What were you tryin'
to prove here, Iida?

131
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,416
[AIZAWA] All right,
the class rep is Midoriya,

132
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,416
and our deputy is Yaoyorozu.

133
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,416
Really? Uh. It's not a mistake?

134
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,041
[sighs] How'd this happen?

135
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,791
This might not be so bad.

136
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,541
Yeah, I can get behind
Midoriya I guess.

137
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,375
[KAMINARI] Yaoyorozu was
totally on top of it

138
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,750
when it came to our
training results!

139
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,375
[OCHACO sighs]
It's always so crowded in here!

140
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,416
[TENYA] That's because students
in the support, management,

141
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,250
and hero courses all share
the same cafeteria.

142
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,625
This rice is delicious!

143
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:59,208
[sighs] Guys, I'm kinda worried
about the class rep thing,

144
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,125
I don't think I'm qualified.

145
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,375
Sure you are.

146
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,000
You'll be great.

147
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,250
[IZUKU]
Hm?

148
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,833
Your courage and quick
thinking under stress

149
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,750
will help make you
a worthy leader.

150
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,083
Not to mention the strength
you've demonstrated.

151
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,250
Those are the reasons I
voted for you, at least.

152
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,750
[IZUKU]
You were one of the three?

153
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,541
Didn't you wanna be
rep really badly,

154
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,000
I mean you do look the part.

155
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,166
'Cause of the glasses!

156
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,583
[IZUKU] That's not
exactly how we should be

157
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,708
choosing our rep.

158
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,541
Wanting a job and

But was this purely a show of
power or a declaration of war?

Don't move.

One step closer, and I'll
kill this whole family.

320
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,166
You don't want the blood
of these damned yuppies

321
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,041
on your hands,
now, do ya, heroes?

I'm here to keep you safe

even on my morning commute!

[WOMAN A shrieks]
A hit-and-run!

328
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,458
I shouldn't be late for school,

329
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,708
but I can't ignore
someone in need!

[ALL MIGHT]
I've clearly gotten slower.

331
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,083
My powers have been
weakening even faster

332
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,458
since I gave One For All
to Young Midoriya.

333
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,333
I'm pushing my hero form
too far past the limits.

Fighting that Sludge
Villain even though

[ALL MIGHT grunts]

341
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,625
[IZUKU] I didn't even tell
my mom about any of this,

342
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,000
but for some reason, I felt like
I had to explain it to him.

343
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,333
Like it was only
fair that he knew.

344
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,041
[ALL MIGHT] Midoriya isn't
the type of person

345
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,291
who wants to show off.

346
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,625
That's not the reason
he shared our secret,

347
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,583
so I didn't lecture
him too much.

348
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,541
Don't look so sad.

349
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,041
He didn't take you seriously,

350
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,916
so I don't think
he'll say anything.

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,291
This time I'll let things slide.

352
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,541
Just make sure this
doesn't happen again.

353
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,833
You need to think
carefully about

354
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,875
the responsibility that
comes with this power.

355
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,333
If word got out
that One For All

356
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,666
could be passed on,
villains across the globe

357
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,791
would come for you,
trying to take it.

358
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,333
You must keep this
secret to ensure

00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,208
your own wellbeing, true.

360

I guide him well.

[AIZAWA] Today's training
will be a little different.

369
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,291
You'll have three instructors.

00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,375
Me, All Might, and
another faculty member

will be keeping tabs on you.

[IZUKU] Three pros? Is that
because of the break in?

training is this?

[AIZAWA]
Rescue.

376
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,166
You'll be dealing with
natural disasters,

377
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,958
shipwrecks, stuff like that.

Real hero stuff.

382
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,958
This is what separates
the men from the boys.

I'm shakin' with excitement.

how good I am in water. Ribbit.

What you wear in this
exercise is up to you.

388
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,916
I know you're excited
about costumes...

389
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,458

that you haven't gotten

used to them yet, and they
might limit your abilities.

This special training's
at an off-campus facility,

392
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,250
so we'll be taking
a bus to get there.

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,208
to being the kind of hero
he is. I'll do my best.

wearing your PE clothes?

Where's your costume at?

You saw it after
the combat training.

It was kinda trashed.

Gather around, Class 1-A!

Using your student numbers,
form two neat lines

405

so we can load the
bus efficiently.

[IZUKU] Iida's kicking it into
high gear as our class rep, huh?

407
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,500
[TENYA] The bus's open layout
ruined my boarding strategy.

408
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,375
Iida, you really need to chill.

409
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,958
If we're pointing
out the obvious,

410
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,916
then there's something I wanna
say... about you, actually.

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,541
About me? What is it, Asui?

412
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,166
I told you to call me "Tsu."

Oh. Yeah, right.

a lot like All Might's?

[IZUKU yelps]
What? Really? You think so, huh?

416
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,166
I never really
thought about that.

417
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:26,958
I guess it's kinda similar...

00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,333
Wait, hold on, Tsu.

419
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,375
You're forgetting All Might
doesn't hurt himself.

420
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,125
That makes a huge difference.

[sighs]

422
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,833
Still, I bet it's cool to have

423
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,833
a simple augmenting-type
a' Quirk.

424
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,750
You can do lots of
flashy stuff with it.

00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,958
My Hardening's super
strong and can destroy

426
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,708
bad guys in a fight,
but it doesn't look

427
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,000
all that impressive.

428
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,125
Oh, no way, I think it's
really awesome looking.

429
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,000
You're definitely pro material
with a Quirk like that.

430
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,291
You really think so?

431
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,166
Seems like it'd be easier
to be a popular hero

432
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,916
if I had somethin' flashier.

433
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
My Navel Laser's got
the perfect combination

434
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,375
of panache and strength.

435
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,750
But it's way lame
if it gives you

a stomachache, sweetie.

437
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,291
Well, if any of our
classmates have

438
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,333
pro Quirks, it's
Todoroki and Bakugo.

439
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,375
Sure, but Bakugo's always angry,
so he'll never be that popular.

440
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,958
[KATSUKI] Uh-- What'd you
say? I'll kick your ass!

Y'know, we basically
just met you.

443
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,416
So it's kinda telling that
we all know your personality

444
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,541
is flaming crap
mixed with garbage.

00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,916
I created this training
facility to prepare you

471
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,125
to deal with different
types of disasters.

472
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,625
I call it the Unforeseen
Simulation Joint.

473
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,541
But, you can call it, USJ!

474
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,333
[STUDENTS] Just like
Universal Studios Japan.

475
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,625
Hey, shouldn't All Might
be here already?

476
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,458
Lemme guess, he booked
an interview instead.

477
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,208
[THIRTEEN]
Actually, it's something else.

478
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,458
[AIZAWA]
Hm?

479
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,666
[THIRTEEN] Apparently he
did too much hero work

480
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,083
on the way to
school this morning

481
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,625
and used up all his power.

482
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,083
He's resting in the
teacher's lounge.

483
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,333
I'm sorry.

484
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,875
I should be able to
catch the tail end

485
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:55,083
of the rescue exercises.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

486
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,541
That man is the height
of irresponsibility.

487
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,583
[AIZAWA] Well, we should be
okay with just the two of us.

488
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,208
The clock's ticking.
We should get started.

489
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,416
[THIRTEEN]
Excellent.

490
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,416
Before we begin, let me
just say one thing.

491
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,666
Well, maybe two things.

492
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,708
Possibly three, four, or five.

493
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,208
[STUDENTS]
We get it!

494
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,958
[THIRTEEN]
Listen carefully.

495
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,625
I'm sure you're aware that
I have a powerful Quirk.

496
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,375
It's called Black Hole.

497
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,541
I can use it to suck up anything
and turn it into dust.

498
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,583
Yeah, you've used
Black Hole to save people

499
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,916
from all kinds of disasters
before, haven't you?

500
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,208
[THIRTEEN] That's true,
but my Quirk could also

501
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,791
very easily be used to kill.

502
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,291
[OCHACO, TENYA, IZUKU gasp]

503
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,833
[THIRTEEN]
Some of you also have powers

504
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,166
that can be dangerous.

505
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,541
[TENYA, IZUKU, OCHACO]
Oh...

506
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,208
[THIRTEEN]
In our superhuman society,

507
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,083
all Quirks are certified
and stringently regulated,

508
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,333
so we often overlook how
unsafe they can actually be.

509
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,500
Please don't forget
that if you lose focus

510
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,750
or make the wrong move,
your powers can be deadly.

511
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,625
Even if you're trying
to do something virtuous

512
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,333
like rescue someone.

513
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,291
Thanks to Aizawa's
fitness tests,

514
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,541
you have a solid idea of
your Quirk's potential.

515
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,875
And because of All Might's
combat training,

516
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,500
you likely experienced how
dangerous your powers can be

517
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,583
when used against other people.

518
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,250
Carry those lessons
over to this class.

519
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,541
Today, you're going to
learn how to use your Quirks

520
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,791
to save people's lives.

521
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,125
You won't be using your powers

522
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:17,041
to attack enemies or
each other, only to help.

523
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,500
After all, that's what
being a hero is all about.

524
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,833
Ensuring the safety of others.

525
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,000
[IZUKU]
Thirteen is so cool!

526
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,458
[THIRTEEN]
That's all I have to say.

527
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,916
Thank you so much for listening.

528
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,833
[STUDENTS cheer]

529
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,250
Right. Now that that's over...

530
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,750
[STUDENTS gasp]

531
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,583
[AIZAWA grunts]

532
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,750
[grunts]

533
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,333
Stay together and don't move!

534
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,458
[STUDENTS gasp]

535
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,250
[AIZAWA]
Thirteen. Protect the students!

536
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,583
Whoa, what is that thing?

537
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,625
[IZUKU gasps]

538
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,875
Wait, has the training
started already?

539
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,916
I thought we were
rescuing people.

540
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,083
[AIZAWA]
Stay back!

541
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,208
[gasps]

542
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,916
[AIZAWA] This is real.
Those are villains.

543
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,541
[STUDENTS gasp]

544
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,625
[IZUKU] We thought we were
going to be practicing

545
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:31,416
saving other people's lives that
day, but when they appeared,

546
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,166
we realized we were
the ones in danger.

547
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,000
[IZUKU] Asui. The villains
are attacking us!

548
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,416
[TSUYU]
I told you, call me "Tsu."

549
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,333
[IZUKU] Is this really the
time to be correcting me?

550
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,458
Next time: "Encounter
with the Unknown."

551
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,833
[TSUYU] Oh, so that's why
Mineta's hair is like that.

552
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,708
Now I get it.

553
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,041
[IZUKU]
Let's Go beyond!

554
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,041
[TSUYU, IZUKU]
Plus Ultra!
