Whether you win or lose,
you can always

take something away from

As long as you're
open to learning.

[ALL MIGHT]
Well, despite the results.

The MVP of this

66
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,833
[STUDENTS gasp]

67
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,125
Huh?!

68
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,083
Shouldn't it be one
of the heroes instead,

69
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,500
since they're the winners?

70
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,916
[ALL MIGHT]
Mm! Valid question.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,125
Why didn't I choose
one of those two?

72
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,041
Who has a guess?

73
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,458
Sir! I can tell you why!

74
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,333
Iida embraced this challenge.

75
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,541
He was the only one who truly
adapted to his assigned role.

76
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,916
I'll explain.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,291
Bakugo's judgment was
clouded by a personal grudge

78
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,250
against Midoriya.

79
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,791
As you pointed out earlier,

80
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,125
launching a large-scale attack
indoors was a foolish move.

81
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,333
It could have been disastrous.

82
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,541
Similarly, Midoriya's
plan was also

83
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,625
poorly thought out, considering
the amount of damage

84
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,791
that he received.

85
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,916
He rendered himself
helpless. Not smart.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,500
As for Uraraka...

87
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,166
She let her guard
down mid-battle,

88
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,083
and her final attack
was far too reckless

89
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,916
given the hypothetical stakes.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,375
If she'd treated the fake weapon
as though it were real,

91
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,875
she never would've risked
using such an imprecise move.

92
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,625
Iida was fully prepared
for his opponent's arrival.

93
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,791
He had a strategy, and never
lost sight of his mission

94
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,291
to protect the dummy weapon,

95
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,458
even if he was
foiled in the end.

96
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,416
Technically, the hero
team won, yes,

97
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,958
but they took advantage of the
fact that this was training.

98
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,333
They didn't respect
the spirit of the trial.

really has a good eye on her.

overlooked a few things.

101
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,125
Young Iida could have relaxed
a little bit in the exercise,

102
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,916
but... otherwise, you nailed it!

Shoto Todoroki.

and burns up the

That guy's kind
of intimidating.

170
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,041
He got in on a recommendation,

171
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,291
so he must be good.

Moving on!

Time to gather 'round for a

You really stepped
up to the plate.

And, we didn't have any major
injuries, except for Midoriya.

You should be proud.

Excellent first day

Mr. Aizawa was
kind of a buzzkill.

I'm happy to bring such
staggering positivity

to my alma mater!
That's all for now, folks.

I should go and check on
Young Midoriya's progress!

[ALL MIGHT] Young Bakugo really
is overflowing with pride.

His ego may be justified,
but a school like UA

202
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,666
is bound to shatter it.

As his teacher,

00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,750
it's my sworn duty
to counsel him well.

Why didn't you
stop him, All Might?

Well, it's no good
apologizing to me!

He's too exhausted from
his classes for my Quirk.

I can't treat all
his injuries at once.

I am trying not
to play favorites.

I wanted to consider
his feelings, though.

He needed to see that he was
capable of winning the exercise.

about my injury

if you were born with
your Quirk or not?

Do you have to be the "Symbol
of Peace?" Is it that important?

If they knew I wasn't,

00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,625
the temptation of this power
could corrupt our society.

00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,000
[gasps]

317
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,583
[IZUKU]
Um, Uraraka. Where's Kacchan?

318
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,958
[IZUKU panting]

319
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,916
[OCHACO] We tried to
stop him from leaving.

320
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But he wouldn't listen.

321
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,458
You just missed him.

322
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,708
[KATSUKI]
Dammit!

323
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,791
You were tricking me
for years by acting weak.

324
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,500
Bet you've been laughing
behind my back, huh?

325
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,500
[KATSUKI] So where's that
flashy power a' yours now?

326
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,583
Kacchan!

327
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,250
[IZUKU]
Wait up!

328
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,083
What?

329
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,416
[gasps]

330
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,625
[IZUKU] I haven't told
anyone this secret.

331
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,083
Not even my mom.

332
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,416
[IZUKU]
I have to tell you something.

333
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,583
Maybe then, you'll understand
what's been going on.

334
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,375
[IZUKU] I wasn't hiding
my Quirk from you.

335
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,333
It was given to me by
someone else. Recently.

336
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,875
[KATSUKI grunts]

337
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,000
[IZUKU] But I can't tell you
who I got it from, so don't ask!

338
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,375
Sounds crazy, I know.

339
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,375
It's like something
out of a comic book.

340
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,041
Only, it's real.

341
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,583
The thing is, I don't
really have any control

342
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,166
over this power yet.

343
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,291
I haven't figured out
how to make it my own,

344
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,208
but I'm trying.

345
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,583
That's why...

346
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,208
...I didn't wanna use it
against you in the exercise.

347
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,666
But in the end,
it was the only way

348
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,666
that I had a chance of winning.

349
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,916
I've still got a lot to learn.

350
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,208
I know that.
That's why I'm here.

351
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,041
[IZUKU]
You'll see.

352
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,958
I'll work until
I have full control

353
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,000
of this borrowed Quirk.

354
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,708
And I'll finally beat
you with my own power!

355
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,041
[IZUKU gasps]

356
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,416
[IZUKU]
Oh, crap, what am I saying?

357
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,000
I only meant to tell him
that I wasn't tricking him!

358
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,666
[KATSUKI]
How dumb do you think I am?

359
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,750
[gasps]

360
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,500
"Borrowed power"?

361
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,333
Don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

362
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,958
You already made a fool outta me

363
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:33,583
in that damn
training exercise. So?

364
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,916
Did you come here
to rub it in? I lost.

365
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,500
And to make matters
worse, it was to you.

366
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:43,750
I came in first in the exam,
but that's not enough.

367
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,750
[KATSUKI] When I was
watching that ice guy,

368
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,916
I realized I couldn't beat
him in a head-to-head fight.

369
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,666
Launching a large-scale
attack indoors

370
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,166
was a foolish move.

371
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,333
Crap! I even agreed with
what that girl said.

372
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,750
My attack was so
stupid! Damn it!

373
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,750
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

374
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,083
Enjoy that win, Deku.

375
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,583
You won't get another!

376
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,250
I'm just getting
started! Got that?!

377
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,916
I'm gonna end up
the number-one hero,

378
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,458
no matter what!

379
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,666
[IZUKU grunts]

380
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,750
[KATSUKI] You'll never beat
me again, you bastard.

381
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,208
Don't even try.

382
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,083
[sighs]

383
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,250
[ALL MIGHT]
There you are!

384
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,583
Bakugo! I found you!

385
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:43,041
[ALL MIGHT pants]
Just so you know,

386
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,750
pride is an important
attribute to have.

387
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,708
But while you certainly have the
abilities to become a pro hero,

388
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,375
there's still plenty
you have to learn!

389
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,833
[KATSUKI] Let go of me,
All Might. Right now.

390
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,500
[ALL MIGHT]
Hm?

391
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,958
Save your speeches.

392
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,083
I'll be more famous than you,

393
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,958
and I'll do it
without your help.

394
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,666
[ALL MIGHT]
Uh--

395
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,166
Uh... Right.

396
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,333
[ALL MIGHT]
I guess he's already over it.

397
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:16,291
[ALL MIGHT]
Man. Being a teacher is hard.

398
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,583
Huh, I wonder what
that was all about.

399
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,833
The fated battle between rivals.

400
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,375
Whatever Midoriya was saying,

401
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,458
it looked like Bakugo
really wanted to punch him.

402
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,916
Childhood friends
turned enemies!

403
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,791
[IZUKU]
Kacchan's fuse has been lit.

404
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,125
There's a fire under him.

405
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,250
But that doesn't change
what I have to do.

406
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,958
I'll keep chasing after him.

407
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Midoriya!

408
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,666
What were you saying to Bakugo
before I arrived so heroically?

409
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,583
Ah! Oh, nothing special.

410
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,125
[ALL MIGHT]
Hmm. I'm so curious.

411
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,083
Why don't you tell me
all the juicy details?

412
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,166
[IZUKU]
Um, actually, I kinda forgot?

413
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:34,041
[IZUKU] None of us were prepared
for what was to come.

414
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,875
All Might warned us
about cunning villains.

415
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,666
And a few days later,
we learned firsthand

416
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,166
how terrifying they
could actually be.

417
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,083
[SHIGARAKI]
Did you see this joke?

418
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,708
It says he's a teacher now.

419
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,208
[SHIGARAKI]
Hey.

420
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,875
What do you think'll happen

421
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:01,166
when the mighty
Symbol of Peace...

422
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,125
[SHIGARAKI] ...is finally
killed by the villains?

423
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,333
[ALL MIGHT]
All heroes have an origin!

424
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,708
[IZUKU] Next time: "Yeah,
Just Do Your Best, Iida!"

425
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,041
[ALL MIGHT]
A lot weird stuff happens

426
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,916
and Young Midoriya
goes crowd surfing!

427
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,333
He's not very good at it.

428
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,208
[IZUKU] Go beyo--
Hey, you're crushing me!

429
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,416
[IZUKU, ALL MIGHT]
Plus Ultra!
