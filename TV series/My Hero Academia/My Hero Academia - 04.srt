The hallowed grounds of UA...

Sure, there are similar

but they don't hold
a candle to UA's,

which is why it's almost
impossible to get in.

7

The school's alumni list
is a "who's who" of idols.

[IZUKU]
Graduating from U.A.

17
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,458

And so...

I held my head high and marched
towards the entrance exams.

Okay, okay. Let's check
out your targets.

There are three types of faux
villains in every battle center.

32

You'll earn points based on
their level of difficulty,

shredding these faux villains

00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,250
[ALL MIGHT]
Now things get interesting.

162
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,250
A person's true
character is revealed

163
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,166
when they're faced with danger.

164
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,791
[IZUKU gasping]

165
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,041
[IZUKU]
This is a disaster.

166
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,500
I've gotta run and find
some smaller villains.

167
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,625
Crap, crap, crap.

168
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm still at zero points!

169
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,000
[PRESENT MIC]
Less than two minutes remaining!

170
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,125
What?! Two minutes?!

171
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:57,041
[IZUKU] Everything All Might
did for me, all that training...

172
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,583
It'll be wasted!

173
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,791
[OCHACO]
Ow!

174
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:13,833
[OCHACO groaning]

175
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,750
[OCHACO]
I'm sorry, I didn't ask first.

176
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,666
I figured you wouldn't
mind me catching you.

177
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,791
[ALL MIGHT]
There are no combat points

178
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,125
rewarded for taking on
the humongous villain.

179
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,333
But there is...

180
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,083
Opportunity.

181
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,333
A chance to shine.

182
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,666
[gasps]

183
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,750
[ALL MIGHT] To show what
you're really made of.

184
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,166
[IZUKU growling]

185
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,041
[ALL MIGHT]
So clench your butt cheeks, kid.

186
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,250
[ALL MIGHT, IZUKU]
And yell this from

187
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,708
the depths of your heart.

188
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,958
[IZUKU]
Smash!

189
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,458
That's right.

190
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,125
Show who you are.

191
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,500
Embody what it
means to be a hero.

192
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,333
Nothing is nobler...

193
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,333
...than self-sacrifice.

194
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,833
[IZUKU]
This is...

195
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,416
...kind of like when I
tried to save Kacchan.

196
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,041
I moved without thinking.

197
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,208
[IZUKU]
But now I have a Quirk,

198
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,291
real power.

199
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,875
Just one minute left!

200
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,583
[gasps]

201
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,666
[screams]

202
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,500
[IZUKU]
Okay.

203
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,708
I jumped using One For All.

204
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,000
So, maybe I can use
it to get down, too.

205
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,208
Just like All Might.

206
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,375
Landing should be a
piece of cake, right?

207
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,708
Right.

208
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,708
Right, right, right,
right, right, right, right!

209
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,250
[yelps]

210
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,250
[IZUKU]
I'm broken!

211
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,791
[IZUKU screams]

212
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,333
[ALL MIGHT] You may have molded
your body into a proper vessel,

213
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,583
but you did it in a hurry,
so be cautious.

214
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,666
The physical backlash of
One For All can be intense.

215
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,916
[IZUKU]
He warned me.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,541
I should have listened.

217
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,833
I can barely contain
this borrowed power,

218
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,708
even after ten
months of training!

219
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,958
[IZUKU] And this is just
a hair of his Quirk!

220
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,041
I got way ahead of myself
attacking that giant villain.

221
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,208
[IZUKU]
I'm acting like a pro...

222
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,791
...when I don't even have
enough skill to be a sidekick.

223
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,083
[IZUKU groaning]

224
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:44,916
[IZUKU]
No!

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,125
This isn't over.

226
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,875
There's gotta be
something I can do.

227
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,958
A Detroit Smash!

228
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,041
It's the only chance
I've got to survive.

229
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,208
My legs and my right
arm are broken,

230
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,458
so just one option.

231
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,875
[IZUKU]
I can do this.

232
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,416
But if my timing's off,
then I'm toast.

233
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Even if I live,
I've got zero points!

234
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,958
[IZUKU]
And if I break my left arm too,

235
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,083
there's no way I'm
gonna pass the exam.

236
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:18,416
[IZUKU screaming]

237
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,708
[groaning] And release.

238
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,750
[IZUKU, OCHACO grunt]

239
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,625
[sighs]

240
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,791
[OCHACO wretches]

241
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,583
[IZUKU]
I'm alive.

242
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,791
That girl...

243
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,416
She stopped my fall again.

244
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,875
[IZUKU] Sure seemed to
take a lot out of her.

245
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,541
But at least she
doesn't look injured!

246
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,833
That's a relief.

247
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,833
[IZUKU]
And now...

248
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,625
Thanks to her...

249
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,083
I still have a chance

250
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,083
to get at least
one point before--

251
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,625
And that's it.

252
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,875
Time's up!

253
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,625
[alarm sounds]

254
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,583

00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,250
[OCHACO groans]

[sobbing]

258
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,125
[STUDENT K]
Did you see that dude's attack?

259
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,458
I didn't think he had
that kind of strength.

260
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,875
[STUDENT L]
Me either.

261
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:40,166
Looked like some kind of
reinforcement-type Quirk, but...

262
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,833
There was something else.

263
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,291
[STUDENT M]
If he has such an amazing Quirk,

264
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,166
how come he didn't snag
any points all day?

265
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,458
[STUDENT N] Maybe he was
trying to trick all of us.

266
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,041
[STUDENT O]
Joke's on him.

267
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,416
There's no way he's passing
with a zero score like that.

268
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,833
[STUDENT P]
True.

269
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,291
But you gotta admit, that
was a pretty amazing move.

270
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,916
[TENYA]
They're all missing the point.

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,625
Don't they see what he did?

272
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,875
[TENYA]
He sacrificed everything.

273
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,166
Just to save that girl.

274
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,500
He must have known
how little time was left,

275
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,833
how many points he
needed to pass,

276
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,083
that he was putting
his life on the line.

277
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,083
But despite those concerns,

278
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,625
he didn't hesitate to jump.

279
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,375
[TENYA]
If this hadn't been an exam...

280
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,625
[TENYA]
Then, of course,

281
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,416
I would have done
the same thing!

282
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,791
[TENYA]
Wait.

283
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,166
The exam...

284
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,791
The judges...

285
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,500
They saw that.

286
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,541
[RECOVERY GIRL]
Very nice, good work all around.

287
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,875
You're heroes in my eyes,
every one of you.

288
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,916
Here, reward yourselves.

289
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,958
Have some gummies.

290
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,125
Oh, uh, thanks.

291
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,708
Yes, yes. Don't eat
them all at once, okay?

292
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,708
[STUDENT R]
Thank... you...?

293
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,625
That mademoiselle,

294
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:02,125
she's the heart of UA.

295
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,875
Oh, my goodness.

296
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,250
You were hurt this badly
by your own Quirk, sonny?

297
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,500
[RECOVERY GIRL]
It's as though his body

298
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,250
isn't used to handling
his own power at all.

299
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,416
[RECOVERY GIRL]
Gimme some sugar!

300
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,125
Um, what's she doin'?

301
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,583
You're watching a
school nurse in action.

302
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,875
[RECOVERY GIRL grunts]

303
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,250
[AOYAMA]
The Youthful Heroine,

304
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,541
Recovery Girl!

305
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,708
[AOYAMA] Her Quirk is a très
awesome boost of healing power.

306
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,333
She's the only reason UA can
hold these reckless exams.

307
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,416
Look, she's saving him
months of recovery time.

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,875
[RECOVERY GIRL]
All right, he'll be fine now.

309
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,375
Anyone else injured?

310
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,958
[TENYA]
I wonder...

311
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,625
What if the exam
has other parameters

312
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,708
I didn't take into account?

313
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,708
[TENYA gasps]

314
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,666
[TENYA]
It's possible.

Izuku?

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,708
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Snap out of it.

317
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,250
Izuku!

318
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,666
Uh--!

319
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,500
Why are you smiling
at that fish?

320
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,083
Should I be worried
about you, honey?

321
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,083
[IZUKU]
Oh, sorry, no.

322
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,083
I just spaced out for a minute.

323
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,916
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Mm-hm...

324
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,291
[IZUKU]
Based on my own estimates,

325
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,708
I barely passed the
written part of the exam.

326
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,208
Not that it really matters,

327
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,541
since I ended up with a big,
fat zero in the mock battle.

328
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,458
Not a single point.

329
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,625
And ever since the exam,

330
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,041
I haven't been able to get
in touch with All Might.

331
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,750
[sighs]

332
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,791
I know.

333
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,625
Waiting for the
results is terrible.

334
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,166
I guess.

335
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,583
No matter what, I just want
you to know I'm proud of you,

336
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,166
and I think you're
really cool, sweetie.

337
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,958
Sure.

338
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,708
[IZUKU] I didn't tell my mom
about All Might or his secret.

339
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:10,291
I want him to continue being the
Symbol of Peace for everyone,

340
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,875
the number-one hero.

341
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:16,208
Besides, he trusted me.

342
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,375
So, I'll keep my mouth shut.

343
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,583
[IZUKU]
All Might,

344
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:29,250
somehow, some way,
you saw potential in me.

345
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,875
But I failed.

346
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,791
I let both of us down so much.

347
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,916
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,791
But I'll keep trying.

349
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,500
A letter, Izuku.
They came, Izuku. Look!

350
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,250
You got a letter!

351
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,125
They're here!

352
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,041
Your test results from UA!

353
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,041
Ah...

354
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,125
[grunts]

355
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,125
Booya! I am here as
a projection now!

356
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,208
[IZUKU yelps]

357
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,458
Wait, All Might?!

358
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,875
But this is from...
UA, isn't it?

359
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,375
I know it's been a while,

360
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,708
but with great power, comes
a great amount of paperwork.

361
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,833
[coughs]

362
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,166
[ALL MIGHT]
My apologies, young man.

363
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,166
The truth is, I didn't
come to this city

364
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,666
just to fight villains.

365
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,541
You're looking at the
newest UA faculty member.

366
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,458
You're seriously going
to be working at UA?

367
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,250
Huh? Yes, what's the matter?

368
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,833
Who's showboating?

369
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,041
Oh, sorry. I'll wrap it up,

370
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,500
but I have to show
him something first.

371
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,791
Wait. I have to do how
many of these things?

372
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,458
[sighs] Right! So, moving on.

373
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,000
[clears throat]

374
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,416
[gulps]

375
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,416
[ALL MIGHT] Even though
you passed the written test,

376
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,333
you got zero combat points
in the practical exam.

377
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,458
Sorry.

378
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,541
[IZUKU]
I know that.

379
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,666
Of course, I know.

380
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,375
It's all I've thought about.

381
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,125
[IZUKU]
I'm a failure.

382
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,833
[ALL MIGHT] Fortunately,
there were other factors.

383
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,750
But before we get to that,
I have another surprise.

384
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,958
Here! Look!

385
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,208
A short clip for your
viewing pleasure!

386
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,083
Um, do you have a sec?

387
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,625
Sorry to interrupt.

388
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,250
It's that nice girl.

389
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,875
[ALL MIGHT]
She showed up after the exam

390
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,875
to talk about you, young man.

391
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,000
Huh?

392
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,708
What did she have to say?

393
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,000
You'll have to stay
tuned to find out!

394
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,125
You know that boy with
the really messy hair

395
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,500
and all the freckles?

396
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,833
It's hard to describe his face.

397
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,583
He's kinda plain-looking.

398
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,791
Uh, doesn't really stand out
or anything, you know?

399
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,208
[IZUKU]
She means me!

400
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,416
[OCHACO]
I was wondering.

401
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,833
Would it be possible to give him

402
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,166
some of the points
I earned in the exam?

403
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,458
I heard him say something about

404
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,416
wanting to get
just one point in,

405
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,125
which just seems crazy.

406
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,500
How could someone who took down
that huge villain all by himself

407
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,125
not have any points in the end?

408
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,083
[KATSUKI] You'd never be able to
hang with the best of the best!

409
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,250
He would've had a better score

410
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,125
if he hadn't've
stopped to help me.

411
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,958
[DEATH ARMS] There was
absolutely no reason for you

412
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,916
to put yourself
in danger like that!

413
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He saved me.

414
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,833
I have to make it up to him.

415
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,041
[gasps]

416
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,708
[OCHACO]
Please, sir!

417
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,041
Can't you just...

418
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,125
...give him my points!

419
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,500
[ALL MIGHT]
You have a Quirk now, yes.

420
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,500
But it's your actions
that inspire others.

421
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,833
And that's why I am here.

422
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,291
You see, the practical exam
was not graded on combat alone.

423
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,125
[gasps]

424
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,666
[PRESENT MIC] Thanks for
showin' up to the station

425
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,916
with your request.

426
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,041
But there's no reason
to give him your points.

427
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,625
The kid's chartin'
well on his own.

428
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,375
[ALL MIGHT] How could a hero
course reject someone who

429
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,958
is committed to saving others,

430
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,791
no matter the
consequences to himself?

431
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,208
After all, that is
what makes a hero.

432
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,166
And that's what my
alma mater is all about.

433
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,208
Training those who
would risk their lives

434
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,250
for the greater good.

435
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,666
So, we have Rescue Points.

436
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,791
A panel of judges watches,

437
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,875
and they award points
for heroic acts

438
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,833
beyond just fighting villains.

439
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,541
Izuku Midoriya,

440
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,208
60 Rescue Points!

441
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,500
And Ochaco Uraraka,

442
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,166
45 Rescue Points!

443
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,125
You both passed the exam.

444
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,708
Uh...

445
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,208
This is some kinda joke?

446
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,875
Welcome,

447
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,541
Izuku.

448
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,291
You have made it.

449
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,958
You're now a part of
the hero academia.

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,750
Thanks!

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,125
[IZUKU]
It took a lot of help.

452
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,291
But my life has
changed completely.

453
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,375
[IZUKU]
And now,

454
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,750
I'm enrolling in the
high school of my dreams.

455
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,291
Ah...

456
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,500
[gasps]

457
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,250
Heh!

458
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,458
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Oh, my baby!

459
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,583
[ALL MIGHT]
Welcome, Young Midoriya!

460
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:16,000
This is UA High,
your hero academia!

461
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,250
[IZUKU]
I'll do my best

462
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,958
on the Quirk assessment
test today, All Might!

463
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,125
I promise!

464
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,500
[ALL MIGHT]
Your teacher shows no mercy

465
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,791
and expels students who
do poorly, but, no pressure!

466
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,458
[IZUKU]
What?!

467
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,166
Next time:
"What I Can Do for Now"!

468
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,708
[ALL MIGHT]
Oh, no.

469
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:34,125
What the heck are you doing with
your index finger? [screams]

470
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,458
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

471
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,791
[ALL MIGHT, IZUKU]
Plus Ultra!
