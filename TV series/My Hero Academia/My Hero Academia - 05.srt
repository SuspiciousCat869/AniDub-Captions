1
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,833
[TEACHER A] Check out the
results from the exam.

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,000
[TEACHER B] Wow, the first
place student didn't even

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,500
have Rescue points.

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,375
[TEACHER C] He took down those
faux villains like an ace.

5
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:20,833
When most of the other examinees

6
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,583
were running from
the big obstacle,

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,708
he stayed focused on letting
the smaller targets get in close

8
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,458
and then counterattacking.
That kid is tough.

9
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,750
[TEACHER B] On the opposite end,
the seventh place student

10
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,208
had zero villain points.

11
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,708
[TEACHER C]
He's not the first UA hopeful

12
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,875
to take out that giant robot.

13
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,666
Though, it's been a while
since I saw someone

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,458
blow it away with one attack.

15
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,666
[TEACHER D]
But at what cost?

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,958
Did you see how badly
he injured himself?

17
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:47,041
If you ask me, it's like his
body isn't used to his Quirk.

18
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,500
Hm...

19
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,833
[IZUKU]
The night after I opened my

20
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:28,625
UA acceptance letter, he finally
got in touch with me again.

21
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:29,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Huh?

22
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,500
[IZUKU panting]
Hi, All Might!

23
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,375
Too loud, kid!

24
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,375
[MAN 5A]
All Might's here?

25
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,583
[WOMAN 5A]
No way! Where?

26
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,041
[ALL MIGHT]
Way to blow my cover.

27
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,750
Say it was a mistake.

28
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,458
I was just kidding!
Nothing to see here!

29
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,458
[MAN 5A]
Lame.

30
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,250
[WOMAN 5A]
I wanted an autograph.

31
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,416
[ALL MIGHT, IZUKU sigh]

32
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,333
[ALL MIGHT]
Congrats on getting in.

33
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,500
I couldn't have done it
without your help!

34
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,000
[ALL MIGHT]
Oh, speaking of which.

35
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,041
I didn't tell anyone
at UA that I've been

36
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,000
training you or anything.

37
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,416
[IZUKU]
Hm?

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,125
Really. I wasn't
one of the judges,

39
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,291
and I didn't pull
any strings for ya.

40
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,958
You earned your spot
all on your own.

41
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,333
[IZUKU]
Wow, thanks for telling me.

42
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,625
I'm glad to hear that!

43
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,375
[gasps] Oh, yeah!
I was really surprised

44
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,791
to hear you're gonna be
a teacher at UA this year!

45
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,875
I was wondering what brought
you here all of a sudden.

46
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,541
After all, your agency
is in Minato, Tokyo,

47
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,833
--and everyone knows--
--[ALL MIGHT] Gettin' creepy.

48
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,916
[ALL MIGHT] The school didn't
want me telling anyone

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,041
about the job until they made
an official announcement.

50
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,250
It seemed like
fortuitous timing.

51
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,166
An easy way to find someone
new to inherit One For All.

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,625
I was on a long hunt
for a successor.

53
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,208
[IZUKU]
So that's it.

54
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,916
He was originally planning
to give it to a UA student.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,250
Someone who was strong.

56
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,583
Who already had a Quirk.

57
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,166
[IZUKU] Your power
completely wrecked my body.

58
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,875
And all I did was jump
and throw one punch.

59
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,916
I can't control it.
What do I do?

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,875
You'll learn to manage in time.

61
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,375
Hoping to master it right
away is like asking a baby

62
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,250
to run a marathon. You still
have to go through the process

63
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,833
of learning how to walk.

64
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,708
[IZUKU]
Yeah... Wait!

65
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,291
You knew I was gonna
get hurt that badly?

66
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,291
Well... We were
in a time crunch.

67
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,875
But it turned out all right.

68
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,791
Plus, now you know what
you're dealing with.

69
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,333
[IZUKU gasps]

70
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,916
[ALL MIGHT] Right now, your
Quirk is either all or nothing.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,333
One day, you'll learn how
to control your output.

72
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,500
Then you'll be able to adjust

73
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,458
exactly how much
power you're using.

74
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,291
[gasps] I just need control?

75
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,750
[ALL MIGHT] You're overflowing
with energy at the moment.

76
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,291
With training, your
body'll hold it better.

77
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,083
Then it's yours to command.

78
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,500
[gasps]

79
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,625
[MAN 5A]
Look, it really is All Might!

80
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,791
[WOMAN 5A]
No way! Where'd he come from?

81
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,791
Right. Now we run!

82
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,083
[IZUKU]
Huh? Okay!

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,416
[ALL MIGHT]
The torch I passed on to you

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,416
is but a small flame right now.

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,166
In time, it will be kindled,

86
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,125
until you wield
a raging inferno.

87
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,958
The more powerful you become,

88
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,208
the more you'll outshine me.
Eventually, I'll retire.

89
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,291
My job complete.

90
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,166
Hoo! Deep stuff, All Might.

91
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,333
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Izuku. You're all set?

92
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,208
[IZUKU]
Yeah.

93
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,416
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Are ya sure?

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,750
You didn't just pack
action figures, right?

95
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,250
I have everything.

96
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,083
Now I gotta go.
I don't wanna be late.

97
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:20,833
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Izuku!

98
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,416
[IZUKU groans]
What?

99
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,083
I'm really proud of you, son.

100
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,000
[gasps]

101
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:33,041
[IZUKU] That day, I began
my high school career.

102
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,875
I'll see you soon.

103
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,291
[IZUKU] The acceptance rate
that year was just as small

104
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,000
as it always had been.
One in 300.

105
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,250
Four people got in because
of recommendations,

106
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,166
and 36 through
the regular exams.

107
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,333
We were split into two
classes of 20 students each.

108
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,166
Class 1-A... 1-A...

109
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,541
C'mon, where is it? Ah! There!

110
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:04,375
[IZUKU] Man, this thing is huge.
Are there giants here?

111
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,333
The most promising
students in the country

112
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,125
are waiting behind this door.

113
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,583
[gasps]

114
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,791
Maybe we're in
different classes.

115
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,666
Maybe everyone in here is nice.

116
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,708
Take your feet off
of that desk now!

117
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,125
Huh?

118
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,875
It's the first day and you're
already disrespecting

119
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,375
this academy by scuffing
school property, you cretin!

120
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,958
You're kidding me, right?

121
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,958
Your old school put
a stick up your ass?

122
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,083
Or were you born with it?

123
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,333
[IZUKU]
Just my luck.

124
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,208
Uh--

125
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,458
Let's start over.

126
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,625
I'm Tenya Iida from the
Somei Private Academy.

Somei, huh?

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,916
So you must think
you're better than me.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,916
I'm gonna have fun
tearin' you a new one.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,583
[gasps] You would threaten me?

131
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,958
Your own classmate?

132
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,541
Are you sure you're
in the right place?

133
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,666
Ha!

134
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,000

Good morning!

Yeah, I-I know.

140
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,333
I'm Izuku Midoriya.

141
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,250
It's super nice to meet you.

142
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,833
[TENYA]
Midoriya. You realized that

143
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,041
there was something more to the
practical exam, didn't you?

144
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,125
Huh?

145
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,041
You must be very perceptive.

146
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,041
And I completely
misjudged you, I admit.

147
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,416
As a student, you're
far superior to me.

148
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,250
[IZUKU]
Um.

149
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,416
I find that hard to believe.

Oh, hey, hi! Oh my gosh!

156
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,166
So, uh, I should
probably be thanking you

Oh, I-- Um-- What?

160
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,916
[TEACHER 1A]
I can't believe we have not one,

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,375
but two students from our
school heading off to UA!

162
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,583
And to think, you're
one of them, Midoriya.

163
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,500
It's a miracle.

[KATSUKI, IZUKU grunt]

165
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,250
[KATSUKI]
What'd you do to pass the exam?

166
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,083
You must've cheated
somehow, right?

167
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,125
I'm supposed to be the
first and only student

168
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,125
from this crappy school
to get into UA,

169
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,333
but you had to go and
screw that all up.

170
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,041
I warned you not to apply!

171
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,208
[IZUKU]
Kacchan.

172
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,250
[grunts]

173
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,500
[IZUKU]
Someone I look up to told me

174
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,125
that I can become a hero.

175
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:17,000
That's why I applied.
That's why I'm going.

176
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,000
Huh?

177
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,833
Like it or not,
you can't stop me.

178
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,708
[KATSUKI] I'm gonna ruin
that little bastard.

179
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,125
Right after I figure
out how he got in.

180
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,666
What do you think
we're doing today

181
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,125
besides orientation? I wonder
what our teachers are like.

182
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,083
I can't wait to meet everybody!

183
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,333
If you're just here
to make friends

184
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,333
then you can pack up
your stuff now.

185
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,291
Ah!

186
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,000
U-Uh--

[OCHACO whimpers]

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,833
Welcome to UA's hero course.

189
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,666
[ALL gasp]
What is that thing?

190
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,125
[AIZAWA] It took eight seconds
before you all shut up.

191
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,250
That's not gonna work.
Time is precious.

192
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,083
Rational students would
understand that.

193
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,208
[IZUKU]
Who is this guy?

194
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,000
If he's here, then he
must be some kinda pro.

195
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,916
But he looks so worn out.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,083
What's his deal?

197
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,333
Hello, I'm Shota Aizawa.
Your teacher.

198
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,041
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,583
[IZUKU]
Our teacher?

00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,958
Right, let's get to it.

201
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,208
Put these on and head outside.

202
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,166
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

203
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,041
[ALL MIGHT] UA's course doesn't
follow the normal academic path.

204
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,458
[sighs]

205
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,000
[ALL MIGHT]
Get the wrong homeroom teacher,

206
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,333
and life is hell.

207
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,416
[STUDENTS]
What? A Quirk assessment test?

208
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,958
But orientation!
We're gonna miss it!

209
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,541
[AIZAWA] If you really wanna
make the big leagues,

210
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,166
you can't waste time on
pointless ceremonies.

211
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,375
[STUDENTS gasp]

212
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,333
[AIZAWA] Here at UA, we're
not tethered to traditions.

213
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,500
That means that I get to run
my class however I see fit.

214
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,208
[STUDENTS gasp]

215
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,833
[AIZAWA] You've been taking
standardized tests

216
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,375
most of your lives. But you
never got to use your Quirks

217
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,875
in physical exams before.

218
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,375
The country's still
trying to pretend

219
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,458
we're all created equal
by not letting those

220
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,958
with the most power excel.
It's not rational.

221
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,500
One day, the Ministry of
Education will learn.

222
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,625
Bakugo, you managed
to get the most points

223
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,583
on the entrance exam.

224
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,791
What was your farthest distance
throw with a softball

225
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,916
when you were in Junior High?

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,750
Sixty-seven meters, I think.

227
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:22,458
[AIZAWA] Right. Try doing
it with your Quirk.

228
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,791
Anything goes, just
stay in the circle.

229
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,833
Go on. You're wasting our time.

230
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,208
All right, man,
you asked for it.

231
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,708
[KATSUKI] I'll add a little heat
to my pitch and drop their jaws.

Oh, whoa.

234

[AIZAWA] All of you need to know
your maximum capabilities.

235
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,166
It's the most rational
way of figuring out

236
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,083
your potential as a pro hero.

are you kidding me?

I wanna go! That looks like fun!

about, usin' our Quirks

as much as we want!

00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,041
So this looks fun, huh?

[gasps]

00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,541
[AIZAWA] You have three years
here to become a hero.

245
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,625
You think it's all gonna
be games and play time?

Idiots.

Today you'll compete
in eight physical tests

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,208
to gauge your potential.

249

Whoever comes in last has none,

250
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,083

Aw crap, he got Aizawa.

Midoriya's gonna be
singled-out from the start.

00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,708
[IZUKU]
Immediate expulsion?

255
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,958
Eight tests? Oh, crap. Not good.

[pants]

257

[IZUKU] I can only use
One For All at either

00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,791
zero or 100 percent right now.

259
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,416
I don't have any control yet.

260
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,666
[AIZAWA] Like I said, I get
to decide how this class runs.

261
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,125
Understand?

262
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,541
If that's a problem, you
can head home right now.

263
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,166
[IZUKU] A huge test on
the first day of school?

What the crap am I gonna do?

00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,541
You can't send one of us home!
I mean, we just got here!

266
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,541
Even if it wasn't the
first day, that isn't fair!

00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,416
[AIZAWA] Oh, and you think
natural disasters are?

[AIZAWA]
Or power-hungry villains? Hm?

00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,166
Or catastrophic accidents
that wipe out whole cities?

271
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,291
No, the world is
full of unfairness.

272
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,291
It's a hero's job to try
to combat that unfairness.

273
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,583
If you wanna be
a pro, you're gonna

have to push yourself
to the brink.

[MEASURING DEVICE 5A]
Five point five one seconds.

316
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,416
[AOYAMA] Hm. Shooting my
beautiful beam for more

317
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,875
than a second hurts my tummy.

318
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,041
[SERO, KIRISHIMA, KAMINARI,
ASHIDO, AIZAWA] What a tool.

319
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,125
[AIZAWA] Testing the upper
limits of their powers

320
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,625
helps me assess their
room for growth.

321
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,166
It becomes clear what
they can and can't do.

322
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,875
Their true potential.

00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,375
My power has more uses
than anyone else's

333
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,208
in this school.

334
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,875
[KATSUKI]
Pathetic.

335
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,833
[IZUKU]
There are still seven tests.

336
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,791
Everyone's gonna be using
their Quirks on all of 'em

337
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,875
and getting awesome results.

338
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,375
[IZUKU]
So what do I do?

339
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,208
I've got a ton of power,
but I can only use it once.

340
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,708
And it'll break me.

341
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,041
Control! That's what I need.

342
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,916
Maybe I can focus like
All Might suggested.

343
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:38,666
[ALL MIGHT] You can harness
One For All. It's simple.

344
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,791
You have to feel it!

345
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,666
Can you be a little
more specific?

346
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,291
So you already
know what it's like

347
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,583
to fire on all cylinders.

348
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,458
[IZUKU] Yeah, like
a lot of broken bones.

349
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,458
No, I'm talking about
the rush inside.

350
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,375
You must have felt it
coursing through you.

351
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,833
What was it like?

352
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:57,291
Mm... A bzzt, or no, like,
whoosh or maybe kapow, or--

353
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,458
Um... Ooh, I know!

354
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,208
Like an egg about to
explode in a microwave!

355
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,666
That's pretty boring, but okay!

356
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,958
If that's the metaphor
you wanna go with,

357
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,916
then lower the wattage, or
decrease the cooking time.

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,250
Whichever one works.

359
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,083
Keep focusing on that
image and keeping the egg

360
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,750
from exploding, all right?

361
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,333
[IZUKU]
I can do that.

362
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,625
You've got three
weeks until school.

363

The more you concentrate,
the faster you'll learn.

364
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,166
Control over One For All

365
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,250
isn't gonna happen overnight.
But you'll nail it one day.

366
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,416
You just gotta keep trying.

367

[whistle blows]

368
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:41,125

[IZUKU]
This is bad.

387
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,208
I've gotta come up with
some kind of a game plan.

Everyone's had at least one
crazy-good score already.

is this, the distance run,

sit-ups, and the seated
toe touch. It's now or never.

This is my best chance
to use One For All.

He has a Quirk.

I think he works
on the down-low.

[ALL MIGHT] Aizawa's one of
those guys who doesn't like

420
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,791
the media because he thinks
they interfere with our work.

421
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,750
And he judges celebrity
heroes like me

00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,291
because I look good
in the spotlight.

You're not ready.

Counting on someone else
to save your useless body?

No! That's not what
I was trying to do!

No matter what
your intentions are,

430
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,000
you would be nothing more

[AIZAWA] You have the

One who saved 1,000 people by
himself and became a legend.

435
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,250
But even with that drive,
you're worthless

436
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,041
if you can only throw a single
punch before breaking down.

Sorry, Midoriya.

Wait, who are you, again?

I've only got one
shot at nailing this,

448
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,166
so what am I gonna do?

449
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,625
[AIZAWA]
Is he going to use his Quirk

450
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,500
and have to forfeit the rest
of the events like a fool?

Or admit defeat and
settle into last place?

Either way, he
doesn't belong here.

But I can't just
give up, either.

Do I let the egg explode?

It might be my only
shot at staying at UA.

00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,083
I have to try something.

470
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:42,708
[IZUKU] It hurts...
But not as bad as before.

471
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,250
[AIZAWA] Were you planning
to break your bones again?

472
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,708
Counting on someone else
to save your useless body?

473
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,708
[IZUKU]
Mr. Aizawa.

474
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,916
You see? I'm still standing.

475
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,291
This kid...

476
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,416
[ALL MIGHT] I was worried
about you, young man,

477
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,708
but you're doin' a great job.

478
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,291
You knew you had to
use One For All,

479
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,125
but not at full power
or else you'd be KO'd.

480
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,250
So, you propelled the ball

481
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,041
at the last possible
point of contact--

482
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,541
by sending the
power of your Quirk

483
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,666
shooting through your fingertip.

484
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,375
Minimizing the injury
to your body

485
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,750
while maximizing the throw.

486
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,250
[ALL MIGHT]
What the heck, young Midoriya?

487
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,250
How did you go
and get so cool?

488
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,791
[IZUKU] Hero Basic Training,
a class only available

489
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,458
in the UA hero course.

490
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,208
[OCHACO] Deku, let's do our best
in this combat exercise, okay?

491
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:21,458
[IZUKU] Oh my gosh, I talked
to a girl again! [squeals]

492
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,000
[OCHACO] Looks like we're up
against Team Iida and Bakugo.

493
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:28,291
[IZUKU gasps] You mean, I'm
going to have to fight Kacchan?

494
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,416
Next time:
"Rage, You Damn Nerd"!

495
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,041
[OCHACO]
Look at Deku's bunny ears!

496
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,416
Oh my goodness! They're so cute!

497
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,875
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

498
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,833
[IZUKU, OCHACO]
Plus Ultra!
