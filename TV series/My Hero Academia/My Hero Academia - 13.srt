A real hero

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,791
will always find a way
for justice to be served!

3
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,666
Now for a lesson.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,791
You may have heard
these words before,

5
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,500
but perhaps it's time
someone taught you...

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:27,416
...what it means...
to go beyond!

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Plus... Ultra!

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,208
[ALL MIGHT]
I really have gotten weaker.

00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,875
Back in my heyday,

10
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,458
five hits woulda been enough
to knock that guy out.

11
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,791
But today, it took more
than 300 mighty blows.

[sighs]

13

You've been bested, villains.

15
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,541

over with quickly.

[SHIGARAKI]
No... He beat me.

18
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,625
He's not any weaker at all.

19
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,875
And look what he did to my Nomu.

20
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,416
He cheated!

21
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,916

And no Quirks, got it?

24
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,833
Use your powers, and I'll
kill your friend here.

Damn villain.

27
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,083
He totally caught us
with our pants down.

28
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,500
I thought that
electric blast would've

29
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,833
fried them all. We're so stupid.

How did we not see this coming?

31
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,125
[ELECTRIC VILLAIN A]
I feel a little brotherhood

32
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,375
with other electric types,
so I don't want to kill him.

33
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,375
But I will if you make me.

An electric type.

36

He's probably the
one Todoroki said

37
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,208
was jamming our communications.

Y'know, you two

People with electric type Quirks

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,708

mainstream success.

00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,958
I mean, even if you
didn't wanna be a hero,

47
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,625
there are tons of jobs you
could do in the city, right?

48
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,666

So, I'm wondering--

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,208
Why would you become a
villain in the first place?

52

[YAOYOROZU]
I see.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,166

moving if she can

manage to get her earphone
jack plugged in.

You don't have to answer.

Think you can distract
me that easily?

Big mistake, sweetheart.

62
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,791
I'm not some dumb thug

who can be outsmarted
by a couple'a kids.

You need to learn to take

So here's the new deal.

to die, or you are.

to clear this level earlier?

We should regroup
with the other guys.

The last thing we wanna
do is get taken hostage

or get in his way.

This isn't right.

He's bluffing.

It's almost hidden by the
dust, but I can see it.

93
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,041
The steam coming off
his body is the same

94
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,875
as when he's about to transform.

too much out of me.

I'm pretty sure that
if I make one more move,

00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,458
I'll be forced to go
back to my weak form.

up much longer.

Sorry, everyone!

I know we're a bit late.

But I got the teachers over
here as fast as I could.

Let's go home and try
this when we can--

All Might. Symbol of Peace.

I am going to kill you.

194
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,875
[IZUKU] That day, we learned
what pros could do.

195
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,583
And what they fight against...
to keep us all safe.

196
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,625
It was a revelation
we weren't prepared for.

197
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,958
But somehow, we survived.

Well, my, my, my.

I can't believe we
let them escape,

after everything they did here.

completely by surprise.

all the students are okay.

[PRESENT MIC]
Cementoss! His Quirk: Cement.

237
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,083
He can manipulate any
cement he touches,

238
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,458
which makes him a heck of a
fighter in the concrete jungle.

239
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,791
[CEMENTOSS]
We should sneak you out of here

and get you both to
the nurse's office.

Seriously, All Might.
That could've been really bad.

or else I'd be dead now.

All those underlings wiped out.

248
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,416
Even Nomu was beaten.

249
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,833
We failed. Those kids
were so strong.

250
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,500
And the Symbol of Peace
wasn't weakened at all.

251
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,375
You were wrong,
Master. So wrong!

252
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,208
[MASTER]
No, I wasn't.

253
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,000
We just weren't as prepared
as we should've been.

254
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,583
[DOCTOR]
I agree. We underestimated them.

255
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,666
Thankfully, we failed
under that cheap

256
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,416
"League of Villains"
name and not our own.

257
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,583
And what about the creature

258
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,708
the Master and I created?
Where is Nomu?

259
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,958
[MASTER]
Yes, why is he not with you?

260
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,291
[KUROGIRI]
He was blown away.

What?!

262
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,250
[KUROGIRI]
It was All Might's doing.

263
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,500
Without coordinates to
his precise location,

264
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,041
I couldn't use my warp
to bring him with us.

265
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,125
We didn't have any time
to search for him.

266
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,708
[DOCTOR]
This is a travesty!

267
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,125
And after all we did to make
him as powerful as All Might.

268
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,416
[MASTER] Well, I suppose
it can't be helped.

269
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,458
Unfortunately.

270
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,875
[SHIGARAKI]
Power... That reminds me.

271
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,541
There was a kid there who
tried to protect All Might.

272
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,833
He was just as fast as him.

273
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,083
[MASTER]
Oh?

274
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,791
[SHIGARAKI]
If he hadn't gotten in our way,

275
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,458
we might have killed
the Symbol of Peace.

276
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,791
That brat... That brat!

277
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,583
[MASTER]
Naturally, you're upset.

278
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,500
But this was not
a futile mission.

279
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,916
We've learned many things.

280

Gather the villainous elite.

00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,125
Take all the time you need.

282
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,333
I must remain hidden
in the shadows,

283
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,000
which is why I need
you to be my face.

284
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,083
A symbol of your own.

285
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,125
Tomura Shigaraki.

286
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,500
Next time, you will
show the world

287
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,083
that it should be afraid of you.

288

[police sirens blaring]

289
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,583
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19.

290
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,125
Everyone seems to be unharmed

291
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,166
except for that boy whose
legs were all messed up.

292

[HAGAKURE]
Ojiro.

293
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,416
Huh?

294
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,000
[HAGAKURE] I heard you were
a really good fighter.

295
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,000
I had no idea you
were so strong!

296
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,250
I didn't know I was
the only one on my own.

297
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,583
I survived using
hit-and-run tactics.

298
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,375
So where did you end up
fighting, Hagakure?

299
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,875
[HAGAKURE]
The landslide zone!

300
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,875
You wouldn't believe
how strong Todoroki was.

301
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,375
He's amazing!

302
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,666
You don't say! Well, I'm just
glad you didn't get hurt.

303
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,375
[TODOROKI] I didn't even
know she was there.

304
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,750
I could've frozen her.

305
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,750
Aren't you wondering about moi?

306
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,250
Where was my sparkling light?

307
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,583
Interesting.

308
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,041
So the people you fought
were also low-level thugs.

309
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,208
Yeah, they messed with
the wrong kids, huh?

310
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,750
Did you miss me?

311
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,416
[SERO] So All Might put that
hole in the dome after all.

312
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,291
I figured.

313
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,000
That took some hardcore power.

314
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,541
[SHOJI]
Yeah, It was crazy.

315
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,416
Where do you think I was?

316
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,166

They've been through a lot.

We don't need to question
them right away.

What about Mr. Aizawa?

[RESCUE SQUAD MEMBER A]
The bones in his arms

324
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,875
are splintered and he's
got facial fracturing.

325
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,791
Fortunately there doesn't seem
to be any serious brain damage.

But, his orbital floor has been
almost completely destroyed.

knowing if his eyesight

There's no need to worry there.

Agreed.

and can completely change
the course of a battle.
