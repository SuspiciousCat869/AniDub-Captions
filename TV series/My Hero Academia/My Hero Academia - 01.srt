in the city without
damaging lotsa things.

107

That means, she might
not be very useful.

00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,416
My world was crumbling.

315
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
There was only one thing
I wanted to hear.

316
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,208
[IZUKU]
I made a decision that day.

317
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,041
No matter what
anyone else thinks,

318
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,250
I have to believe in myself.

319
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,208
And I'll keep smiling,
just like him.

320
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,541
[grunts]

321
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:31,958
[IZUKU laughs]

322
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,541
[gasps]

323
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,333
[IZUKU]
A villain?

324
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,666
[whimpers]

325
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,750
[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A]
You'll make a perfect skin suit

326
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,208
for me to hide in, kid.

327
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,875
[IZUKU screams]

328
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,875
[IZUKU muffled screaming]

329
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,416
[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] Don't worry,
I'm just taking over your body.

330
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,750
It'll be easier for both of
us if you don't fight back.

331
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:00,958
It'll only hurt for a minute.
You'll feel better soon.

332
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,125
[IZUKU]
I can't... breathe!

333
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,333
[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A]
Grab all you want.

334
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,541
My body's made of fluid.
Thanks for the help.

335
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,833
You're a real hero to me, kid.

336
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,750
I didn't know he
was in the city.

337
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,875
I gotta get outta here fast
before he tracks me down.

338
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:24,583
[IZUKU]
My body... Getting... weak...

339
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,916
I... I think I'm dying.

340
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:34,833
[IZUKU] No way. This can't
be the end. Somebody!

341
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,416
[IZUKU]
Help!

342
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,333
[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A gasps]

343
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,958
[ALL MIGHT]
Have no fear, you're safe.

344
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,541
Now that I am here, that is.

345
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,916
[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A yelps]

346
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:10,458
[ALL MIGHT]
Texas... Smash!

347
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,250
[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A groaning]

348
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,541
[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A]
I can't... hold... together!

349
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:40,125
[IZUKU]
Is that... All... Might?

350
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:48,000
[ALL MIGHT]
Hey! Wake up! Hey--

351
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,916
Thought we lost you there.

352
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,250
[gasps]

353
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,708
[IZUKU screams]

354
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,875
Well, looks like you're
moving around all right.

355
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,625
Sorry 'bout that back there.

356
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,375
I didn't mean to get you
caught up in my justicing.

357
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,375
Usually I pay more attention
to keeping bystanders safe.

358
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,083
But it turns out this
city's sewer system

359
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,083
is pretty difficult to navigate.

360
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,833
[laughs]

361
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,000
[gasping]

362
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,791
[ALL MIGHT]
Anyway, you were a big help.

363
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,750
Thank you! I've captured
the evil-doer!

364
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,541
[IZUKU] The most amazing
hero in the entire world...

365
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,458
All Might! The real thing.
In the flesh.

366
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,125
Standing right in front of me!

367
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,375
He looks so much
cooler in person!

368
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,083
Holy crap. I gotta
get an autograph,

369
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,125
I've got a pen
around here somewhere.

370
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,000
Please sign my notebook!

371
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,250
[IZUKU squeals]
He already did!

372
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,916
Thank you so much!
This will be an heirloom.

373
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,125
A family treasure passed down
for generations to come!

374
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Uh-huh!

375
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,708
Welp. I've gotta get
this guy to the police

376
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,333
so they can take care of 'im.

377
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,083
Stay out of trouble.
See you 'round!

378
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,083
Wait. You're leaving? Already?

379
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,041
Pro heroes are
constantly fighting time

380
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,708
as well as enemies.

381
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,125
[gasps]

382
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,541
[IZUKU]
He can't go yet.

383
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,708
There are still so many
questions I have to ask him.

384
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,083
Now stand back. I'm taking off.

385
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,666
Thanks for your
continued support!

386
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,000
Huh?

387
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,875
[screaming]

388
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,416
Hey, hey, hey, what do
you think you're doing?

389
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,750
Let go! I love my fans,
but this is too much!

390
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,750
[IZUKU] No way! We're flying.
If I let go now, I'll die!

391
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,583
Oh. That's a good point.

392
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,708
I just have a lot...

393
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,291
...of things I wanna ask you.

394
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,666
Personally... you're my
all-time favorite hero,

395
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,291
All Might, please...

396
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,083
[ALL MIGHT]
Okay, okay! I get it.

397
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,375
Just keep your eyes
and mouth shut.

398
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,583
--[ALL MIGHT sighs]
--[IZUKU whimpers]

399
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,083
[ALL MIGHT coughs]

400
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,333
[ALL MIGHT]
Shit.

401
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,958
[panting]

402
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,916
My whole life just
flashed before my eyes.

403
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,791
[ALL MIGHT]
Not a very smart move.

404
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,541
Bang on the door for a while.
Someone will let you in.

405
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,416
Now, I have to go.
See you on the flip side.

406
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,416
Wait, not yet. One second.

407
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,125
[ALL MIGHT]
No! I don't have any time.

408
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,375
I have to know!

409
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,375
[DOCTOR 1A] Sorry, kid,
it's not gonna happen.

410
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,916
[IZUKU'S MOM]
I'm sorry, Izuku.

411
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,458
I wish things were different.

412
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,625
[KATSUKI]
Defenseless Izuku.

413
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,125
This school's already crappy,

414
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,708
you really wanna embarrass
it more by failing so hard?

415
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,541
[IZUKU] Sometimes I do
feel like I'm a failure,

416
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,541
like there's no hope for me.

417
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:51,500
But even so. I'm not
gonna give up. Ever.

418
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,583
[IZUKU]
Is it possible to become a hero,

419
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,666
even if I don't have a Quirk?

420
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,916
[IZUKU] I'm a normal kid
without any powers.

421
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Could I ever hope to
be someone like you?

422
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,541
[IZUKU] Meeting All Might
was a dream come true.

423
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,166
A real miracle.

424
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,750
Standing in front
of me was the hero

425
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,791
I'd idolized most of my life.

426
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,750
I didn't realize it at the time,
but that chance encounter

427
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,541
would change the
course of my future.

428
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,708
[ALL MIGHT]
Never fear, adoring public!

429
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,625
I am here for the
next episode preview!

430
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,125
That goo villain...

431
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,666
It's taken a boy hostage and
is running amok in the town?

432
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,958
This isn't good!

433
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,125
But...

434
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,791
But I can't use my
powers much longer or...

435
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:28,625
Oooh! You're a pathetic
fraud, All Might!

436
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,000
Next time: "What it
Takes to be a Hero!"

437
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,083
We pros risk our lives,
for it's our duty

438
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,541
to put our Quirks to the test,

439
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:38,250
and go beyond our
limits! Plus Ultra!
