00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,000
And I'm done playing with you!

This thing'll kill him!

[ALL MIGHT]
I really am pathetic.

320
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:44,000
[gasps] All Might. But...

321
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,166
I told you the traits
that make a great champion,

322
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,666
But I see now I wasn't
living up to my own ideal.

323
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,541
Pros are always
risking their lives!

324
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,208
That's the true test of a hero!

325
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,666
[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A]
Damn you, All Might!

00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,625
Huh?

331
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,583
It's raining.

332
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,250
[ONLOOKER 2G] Don't tell me
all that wind just now was...

333
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,291
[ONLOOKER 2J] Look at
the clouds. They're moving!

00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,041
[DEATH ARMS]
Holy crap.

335
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,291
He changed the weather.

00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,166
[ONLOOKER 2K]
Did that really just happen?

[CROWD cheers]

338
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,125
[ONLOOKER 2J] He changed the

339
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,166
like it was nothing!

[IZUKU]
After that,

343
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,541
the heroes collected all the
scattered mounds of sludge.

344
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,791
And the villain went into police
custody where he belonged.

345
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,833
[KAMUI WOODS] You moron.
Do you have a death wish?

346
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,375
[DEATH ARMS]
There was absolutely no reason

347
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,375
for you to put yourself
in danger like that!

348
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,375
[IZUKU] I got chewed out
by the heroes, big time.

349
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,333
While Kacchan was praised
for his bravery.

350
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,083
Man, you're tough, kid!

351
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,958
And that Quirk
is somethin' else!

When you wanna go pro,
head over to my agency first!

I'd love for you to be my
sidekick while you're training!

354
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,916
[IZUKU] I wanted to
apologize to All Might,

355
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,875
but he was swarmed
by interviewers.

356
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,000
I didn't wanna interrupt.

357
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,500
I can always try
to send a message

358
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,375
through his website
when I get home.

Listen.

363
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,208
I would never ask for a
weakling like you to help me.

364
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,125
Don't think you can
look down on me.

Huh? Got that?
I was fine by myself.

366
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,583
You're just a Quirkless failure

367
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,416
who won't even cut it
as a rent-a-cop.

368
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,708
You didn't help me.
You did nothing.

369
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,208
Don't forget it.

370
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,958
I don't owe you anything!

371
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,375
[IZUKU]
What was that?

372
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,208
[IZUKU]
Kacchan is right, though.

373
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,125
It's not like I actually did
anything to help today.

374
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,000
But... At least I tried.

375
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,375
Guess now I should get back
to giving up on my dreams.

Where'd you come from?

Uh, how'd you get rid
of all those reporters?

Young man. I came
here to thank you.

00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,041
And also to discuss your
question from earlier.

[IZUKU]
Huh?

387
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,666
[ALL MIGHT] If I you hadn't
told me about your life...

388
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,833
If you hadn't run
into that fight...

389
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,750
...I would've been
a worthless bystander

390
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,375
watching from the crowd.

391
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,083
So thanks.

392
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,291
Oh, no.

393
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,833
It was my fault he was
there to begin with.

394
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,250
I got in the way
of your hard work.

395
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,791
I wasted your energy.

396
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,583
And... not to mention your time.

397
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,875
[ALL MIGHT]
I'm not done.

398
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,083
You told me you
didn't have a power.

399
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,208
So when I saw this
timid, Quirkless boy

400
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,583
try to save a life.

401
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,458
It inspired me to act, too.

00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,458
[gasps]

403
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,291
[ALL MIGHT] There are
stories about every hero.

404
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,583
How they became great.

405
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,250
Most have one thing in common.

406
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,625
[ALL MIGHT]
Their bodies moved

407
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,958
before they had
a chance to think.

408
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,958
Almost on their own.

[IZUKU sniffles]

410
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,083
[IZUKU]
For some reason,

411
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,916
I remembered my mother's
words in that moment.

412
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,541
[IZUKU'S MOM]
I'm sorry, Izuku.

413
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,458
I wish things were different.

00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,833
And today, that's what
happened to you.

[sobbing]

417
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:58,083
[IZUKU]
You never told me, Mom.

418
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,333
Back then... The thing
I wanted you to say...

419
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,750
[IZUKU]
The words I needed to hear.

420
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:15,583

can become a hero.

Dreams can become reality.

00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,791
[IZUKU]
Oh, by the way.

424
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,166
I forgot to mention
that this is the story

425
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,583
of how I became the
world's greatest hero.

426
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,791
[ALL MIGHT]
Young man!

427
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,166
I have deemed you
worthy of inheriting

428
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,291
the glorious power of All Might!

429
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,416
[IZUKU]
Wait. What do you mean inherit?

430
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,708
[ALL MIGHT]
When you're ready,

431
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,833
you'll take my unstoppable
Quirk. One For All!

432
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,583
[IZUKU]
So... It's that easy?

433
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,083
I can become a hero,
just like that?

434
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,250
[ALL MIGHT laughs]
Of course not, kid,

435
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,708
not with that frail
body of yours.

436
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,250

Huh?

437

going to be super buff

through with him!
