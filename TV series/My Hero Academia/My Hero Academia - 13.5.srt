since I was just a little kid.

00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,833
And I dream of being
one in the future.

00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,125

with a video online.

14
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,416
I started learning everything
I could about heros.

15
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,791
[IZUKU]
I studied because I wanted to be

16
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,083
just like him when I grew up.

17
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,791
[IZUKU] Eighty percent of the
population of this world

18
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,416
has some kind of
uncanny superpower.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,583
Those abilities
are called Quirks.

20
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,541
Since people started
manifesting them,

21
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,541
there's been one profession

22
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,791
that's dominated
all of our minds.

23
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,875
[IZUKU] With the explosion
of crime and disasters

24
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,333
brought about by Quirks,

25
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,916
humanity needed people
to protect the innocent.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,166
We gave the name to those
brave enough to take action:

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,125
Heroes.

28
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,458
They're the ones who put
thier lives on the line,

29
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,416
who defend us from evil.

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,375
Without them,
diabolical villians

31
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,583
would destroy our
cities, our lives--

32
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,250
maybe even the planet.

33
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,083
Then there's him.

34
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,750
Now that I am here, that is!

35
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,875
[IZUKU]
The greatest among them...

36
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,875
All Might!

37
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,375
The Symbol of Peace and Justice.

38
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:15,666
He lives up to his title
of "Number One Hero."

39
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,083
No matter the situation,

00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:21,208
he always save people with
a huge smile on his face.

41
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,875
I admit, I'm kind of
obsessed with him.

42
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,208
I admire All Might with
every ounce of my being.

Oh, yeah.

I'm Izuku Midoriya.

45
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,166
[IZUKU] Right now, I'm

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,000
putting my all into
trying to become a hero.

47
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,958
[IZUKU] That's why, despite
what I'm about to tell you,

48
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,375
this isn't actually a sad story.

[DOCTOR 1A] Based on the
research that's available,

52
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,125
it's safe to say your son
isn't going to develop a Quirk.

53
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,458
[IZUKU] This was the harsh
reality I had to face

54
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,541
when I was only four years old.

55
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,458
My goals of becoming
a hero were dashed.

56
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,625
I was Quirkless.

All Might. But...

160
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,250
I told you the traits that
make a great champion,

161
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,708
but I see now I wasn't
living up to my own ideal.

162
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,666
Pros are always
risking their lives!

163
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,541
That's the true test of a hero!

[SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A]
Damn you, All Might!

168
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,791
[IZUKU]
Is it possible to become a hero,

169
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,541
even if I don't have a Quirk?

170
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,000
Could I ever hope to be
someone like you?

171
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,708
[ALL MIGHT] There are
stories about every hero.

172
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,083
How they became great.

173
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,500
Most have one thing in common.

Their bodies moved

before they had
a chance to think.

176

Almost on their own.

[IZUKU whimpers]

And today, that's
what happened to you.

unexpected things happen.

The impossible can
become achievable.

185
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,416
[ALL MIGHT] Young man,
you, too, can become a hero.

I deem you worthy of my power.

My Quirk is yours to inherit.

188
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,208
Huh?

189
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
I wasn't born with this power.

190
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,958
It's a sacred torch
that was passed onto me

191
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,000
from someone else.

192

No way.

Yes way.

195

And you're next.

196
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,208
I can give you my abilities.

Okay, I'll do it.

Yes!

199
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,625
[IZUKU] And so began my
ten months of total hell.

This gift:

You earned it with your
own valiant efforts.

My dream was becoming reality.

215

trusted me with his power,

220
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,000
and, unbelievably,
before I knew it,

221
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,583
I was taking the entrance
exam to get into UA High,

training school for heros.

was gonna be okay.

[IZUKU]
Kacchan has it in for me,

but that's nothing new.

252
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,291
and since I was
Quirkless until recently,

I have to work twice
as hard as him.

I guess none of us came
to UA to make friends.

00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,125
Still...

know what you were saying

during that match,
but you were all fired up!

268

here range from weird

269

to downright irriplaceable.

270
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,833
I like "Deku."

271
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,458
It could make a great hero name!

272
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,041
Plus, I think it
sounds kinda cute.

273
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,791
[IZUKU]
I've got friends,

274
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,625
and friendly rivals.

275
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,375
[IZUKU] And I'm still
doing my research, too.

276
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,583
I take plenty of notes about
everyone in my hero notebooks.

277
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,541
[IZUKU] First off, my
childhood friend: Kacchan.

278
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,333
He can secrete
nitroglycerin-like sweat

279
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,291
from his hands and
make it explode.

280
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,458
He really excells when
it comes to combat--

281
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,083
he even took first place
in the entrance exam.

282
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,583
[IZUKU] Uraraka can make
anything she touches

283
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,875
totally weightless.

284
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,583
Plus, she can
make herself float!

285
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,500
The only thing is, if she
uses her Quirk too much...

286
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,500
It can get messy.

287
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,250
So she has to be careful.

288
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,208
Simply put, Iida can
run really fast.

289
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,500
Apparently, he can increase
his speed in stages.

290
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,125
His accelerated kick
is crazy powerful.

291
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,541
Then there's Todoroki.

292
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,416
His Quirk lets him freeze
with his right hand

293
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,625
and burn with his left.

294
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,333
At least, that's what I hear.

295
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:49,125
He only ever shows us
what his ice powers can do.

296
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,625
Asui's abilities allow her to
swim super fast under water,

297
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,291
jump really high,

298
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,791
and even cling to walls.

299
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,625
So, basically,
whatever a frog can do.

300
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,833
The balls on Mineta's head

301
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,375
will stick like glue
to anything they touch.

302
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,791
He can't pick off
too many though,

303
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,333
or he'll start bleeding.

304
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,541
[IZUKU]
That's not everyone.

305
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,083
All my classmates
have incredible Quirks.

306
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,166
We're constantly training
and trying to figure out

307
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,875
how we can use our powers
to their fullest potential.

308
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,458
Not just when we're fighting.

309
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,625
There might be lots of other
ways for us to use our Quriks

310
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,041
that we haven't even
begun to think of yet.

311
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,958
[IZUKU]
The teachers that guide us at UA

312
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,833
are all impressive, too.

313
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,541
They're pro heros.

314
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,166
[IZUKU] Mr. Aizawa can erase the
Quirks of anyone he looks at.

315
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,666
He's also an agile fighter,

316
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,958
particularly when he uses

317
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,583
the special cloth
wrapped around his neck

318
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,458
to snare a bunch of
villians at the same time.

319
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,791
And then, of course,

320
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,833
the greatest pro ever is
a teacher at UA this year.

321
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,375
The Number One hero:

322
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,583
All Might.

323
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,875
His Quirk can be used to channel
overwhelming amounts of power.

324
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,000
It's known as "One For All."

325
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:04,708
[ALL MIGHT]
Texas... Smash!

326
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,375
[IZUKU] He's got a bunch
of different Smash attacks

327
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,791
in his arsenal.

328
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,500
And his ability to
jump long distances

329
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,000
definitely comes in handy.

330
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,375
I've inherited
All Might's power.

331
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,708
Though I can't really
control it yet...

332
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,708
[IZUKU] It looks like it's
going to take some time

333
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,833
for me to make his Quirk my own.

334
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,666
But that just means I have
to keep pushing myself.

335
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,875
I won't stop.

336
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,041
I'm positive I'll become

337
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,833
a legendary superhero
like him one day.

338
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,041
[RECOVERY GIRL] Do you have
to be the "Symbol of Peace"?

339
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,000
Is it that important?

340
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,458
If they knew I wasn't,

341
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,541
the temptation of this power
could corrupt our society.

342
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,750
This Quirk...

343
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:46,875
Those who wield it

344
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,333
are responsible for
mankind's safety.

345
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:54,916
[IZUKU] So, yeah. Everyone
at UA is pretty incredible.

346
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,375
But what's the point
of having these Quirks?

347
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,541
What should we be
doing with them?

348
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,791
And why did we all fight
so hard to get into UA?

349
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,708
Why are we trying to be heros?

350
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,625
At the heart of the matter,

351
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,250
there's only one motivation.

352
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,750
We want to help people.

353
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,916
And to do that, we have to be
able to take on villians.

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,666
That's a lesson we
learned the hard way--

355
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,916
far earlier than any
of us expected to.

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,500
The day that we were
attacked while training.

357
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,583
When we met pure evil.

358
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,833
[SHIGARAKI]
Hey.

359
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,416
What do you think'll happen...

360
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,625
...when the mighty
Symbol of Peace...

361
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,541
...is finally killed
by the villains?

362
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,500
[IZUKU]
Tomura Shigaraki.

363
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,666
The boss of a group

364
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,458
calling themselves
the League of Villains.

365
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,708
He has a fearsome Quirk
that lets him disintegrate

366
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,416
anything or anyone he
touches in an instant.

367
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,625
[SHIGARAKI] You think you're
the Symbol of Peace?

368
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,791
Ha.

369
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,291
You're just another
government-sponsored

370
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,583
instrument of violence.

371
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,416
[SHIGARAKI]
Nomu. Kurogiri.

372
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,750
Kill him.

373
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,708
[ALL MIGHT]
I'm afraid that I barely

374
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,333
have a minute left in this form.

375
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,500
My power's declining faster
than I thought it would.

376
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,833
[SHIGARAKI] Let's clear
this level and go home.

377
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:36,541
[ALL MIGHT] Even so, I have
to stop these villains.

378
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,875
Because I am...

379
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,541
[ALL MIGHT] ...the world's
Symbol of Peace and Justice!

380
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,125
[ALL MIGHT yells]

381
00:18:55,958 --> 00:19:00,708
[ALL MIGHT yelling]

382
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,583
He's gonna fight that
brain guy head on?

383
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,750
Whoa, they're... so fast!

384
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,125
[KUROGIRI]
No! I can't get near them!

385
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,416
[ALL MIGHT] He said your Quirk
was only shock absorption

386
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,208
not nullification.

387
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,375
That means there's a limit
to what you can take, right?

388
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:27,958
[ALL MIGHT groans, growls]

389
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,708
[ALL MIGHT] So, you were
made to fight me, big guy.

390
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,208
If you can really
withstand me firing

391
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,208
at 100 percent of my power...

392
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:39,166
...then I'll have to go beyond
that and force you to surrender.

393
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:46,208
[IZUKU] He's giving it his all
even though he's injured!

394
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,666
Those aren't just
random punches, either.

395
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,083
They're targeted, and every
single one of them...

396
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,958
...is more than 100
percent of his power.

397
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,833
[yells]

398
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,291
[ALL MIGHT]
A real hero...

399
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,083
[ALL MIGHT] ...will always find
a way for justice to be served!

400
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,541
[ALL MIGHT yelling]

401
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,208
[ALL MIGHT]
Now for a lesson.

402
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,291
You may have heard
these words before,

403
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,125
but I'll teach you
what they really mean.

404
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,916
Go beyond!

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,291
Plus Ultra!

406
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,541
[IZUKU]
Thanks to All Might's help,

407
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,125
and the bravery of my
teachers and classmates,

408
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,000
we were able to escape.

409
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,208
The whole experience made us
more resolved than ever

410
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,333
to become powerful,
fearless heros,

411
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,208
so we can stop evil.

412
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,375
So we can protect the world.

413
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,333
Those villains made
a mistake attacking them.

414
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,041
This class is strong.

415
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,125
They're filled with
courage and drive.

416
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,250
Mark my words.

417
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,291
They'll become great heroes.

418
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,208
[IZUKU] And now, a life-changing
event is about to take place--

419
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,916
the UA Sports Festival.

420
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,166
After surviving a fight
with real villains,

421
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sure everyone will be
even more focused than before.

422
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,583
I know I will be.

423
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,041
I'm going to give
everything I've got.

424
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,375
[IZUKU]
What is justice?

425
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,583
What does it mean to be a hero?

426
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,291
I'm still figuring all that out,

427
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,958
but I have learned some things.

428
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,875
It's okay to fall.

429
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,875
It's okay to cry.

430
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,500
You just have to
keep moving forward.

431
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,125
You have to go beyond!

432
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,666
Plus Ultra!

433
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,833
[IZUKU] The new season
of My Hero Academia

434
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,166
is finally about to begin!

435
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,333
Don't miss the UA Sports
Festival that everyone's

436
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,708
going to be watching.

437
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,208
The student who
wins the competition

438
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,333
will basically have their future
as a pro hero in the bag.

439
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,333
Everyone'll be
fighting for the top.

440
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,333
We're all enrolled
in this school

441
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,208
to become pros, after all.

442
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,041
So you bet I'm
gonna give it my all!

443
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,375
Next time:
"That's the Idea, Ochaco"!

444
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,541
Uraraka finally tells
us why she's here.

445
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,625
Go beyond!

446
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,666
Plus Ultra!
