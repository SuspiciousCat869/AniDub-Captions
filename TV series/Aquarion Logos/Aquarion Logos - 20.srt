[SAKURAKO]
Meow.

2
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,958
I don't know what to do.

3
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,708
For the Third Anniversary bash?

4
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,041
I'm sure you'll come up with
something super awesome.

5
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,000
Plus, you still have two days.

6
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,083
Don't forget, we have a freshly
written Reading Theater script.

7
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,166
Honestly, I imagine
that would suffice.

8
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,333
[TSUTOMU] No way, bro!
We gotta go all out!

9
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,125
Something bigger than
just a new Staged Reading!

10
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,375
Exactly!

11
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,750
We only get one third
anniversary after all,

12
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,625
so I want something a
little less run-of-the-mill

13
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,666
to celebrate such
an auspicious day!

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,916
[TSUTOMU]
Mh-hm.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,250
That's why I'm thinkin'
we should make a movie!

16
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,166
Yeah! I say we make
a gory splatter-fest!

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,541
We'll have Tsutomu
get mauled by zombies.

18
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,333
Ooh! We should make
him explode, too!

19
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,583
Don't I have any
basic human rights?

20
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,833
I might enjoy a splatter movie.

21
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,583
Yeah? Zombies plus boom!

22
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,083
A movie.

23
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,291
Y'don't need to say what kind
of movie you want, Akira,

24
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,708
we already kno--
Oh, jeez, that was fast!

25
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:25,875
[KOKONE gasps]

26
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,041
That sounds nice.

27
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,541
If that's the movie we make,

28
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,291
I'd like to be the sword the
Savior pulls from the stone.

29
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,625
[giggles]

30
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,416
You aim too low. At least
play something living.

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,250
[KENTO]
Whoa! That's too much!

32
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,875
The eye! The eye! The eye!

33
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:45,250
[NESTA] When he vanishes
entirely, you'll be to blame.

34
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,666
She's trying to tell me
something, but what?

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,958
And that voice. I know
I've heard it before.

36
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:55,083
[gasping]

37
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,875
[MAIA]
Uh.

00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,666
[MAIA laughs nervously]

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,208
[MAIA gasps]

41
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,708
Something wrong?

42
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,958
[MAIA]
Of course. I must... save Akira.

43
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,416
[MAIA]
DEAVA was created

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,291
to resist Nesta
and the M.J.B.K.s.

45
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,583
If Akira's situation
is due to writing,

46
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,458
we must have data on it.

47
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,458
[gasps]

48
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,083
Took a pretty big risk, y'know.

49
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,625
Access files you're
not supposed to

50
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,250
and the security system
sets off an alarm.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,750
[SAKURAKO]
Hm.

52
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,208
What were you doing in here?

53
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,958
And don't try to tell me you
wanted to play solitaire.

54
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,125
[MAIA sighs]

55
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,333
Commander, I find
myself in desperate need

56
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,583
of your assistance!

57
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,250
I ask because I
respect you as a man.

58
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,833
"As a woman"?

59
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,208
[SAKURAKO] From the outside, it
looks like an ordinary library.

60
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,583
But what lies beneath.

61
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,208
A secret government facility
dedicated to collecting

62
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,291
and studying a
variety of artifacts

63
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,166
from the ancient
writing culture.

64
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,750
There's so much.

65
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,625
Counting all the material
that's been excavated so far,

66
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,083
this vault is just
the tip of the iceberg

67
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,541
because the vast majority of it

68
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,458
has fallen into the
hands of Nesta.

69
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,541
Here you go, but
try to work quickly,

70
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,666
'cause if we get caught down
here, it's my butt on the line.

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,125
Don't worry about a thing.

72
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,333
If you get canned,

73
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,041
there's always a job
for you at Shirobaco.

74
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,041
[MAIA] I thought Kento was
already part of the café staff.

75
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,916
I advise DEAVA, as well
as manage this site.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,500
Basically, I'm on loan
from the government.

77
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,000
[SAKURAKO]
If there's some kind of problem

78
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,958
going on with Akira's body,

79
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,625
it's highly likely it has
something to do with Vector-Ga.

80
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,791
[MAIA] I thought that
might be the case.

81
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,875
[KENTO]
It's our fault, then.

82
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,875
We knew the dangers that
machine represented.

83
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,958
[SAKURAKO] That's true. But he
piloted it of his own free will

84
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,708
in order to save the world.

85
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,458
So having regret for that choice
now does no good for anyone.

86
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,416
We've got to do the best we can.

87
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,583
We won't let him be
sacrificed. Not ever.

88
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,041
[MAIA]
Uh.

89
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,291
Oh. "We found this piece of art,

90
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,416
and believe it depicts
the Writing War."

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,291
There was a Writing War?

92
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,041
[SAKURAKO]
According to legend,

93
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,708
there was a time
when attuned people

94
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,458
could make manifest
the words they spoke.

95
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,083
For example, take
the word "rain."

96
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,750
By simply saying it, they could
create a torrential downpour.

97
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,750
[MAIA] No way. How
is that even possible?

98
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,166
[SAKURAKO] In the right
place, at the right time,

99
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,416
by uttering words filled with
the vibrancy of emotion,

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,166
they could gain access
to the World of Truth.

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,875
However, for those people,

102
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,708
the only option was to live
their lives moment to moment.

103
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,958
There was no means to leave
anything to future generations.

104
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,250
They wanted to leave behind
their wills, their dreams,

105
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,708
and this desire led them
to create a technology

106
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,000
of untold power.

107
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,833
[MAIA]
And that was?

108
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,125
[SAKURAKO] That was the
invention of writing.

109
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,833
With writing enabling
communication

110
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,791
with those far away, or
even later generations,

111
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,458
civilization was able to evolve
at an accelerated pace.

112
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,541
But there was one tribe
that felt this evolution

113
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,875
was dangerous.

114
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,458
They were worried, and
perhaps, rightly so,

115
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,208
that our reliance on
writing would lead us

116
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,833
to lose our connection
to the World of Truth.

117
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,833
[KENTO] Some wished to further
develop the culture of writing,

118
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,125
and they were opposed by those

119
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,916
who saw it as blasphemy
to the World of Truth.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,375
Eventually, those disagreements
turned to conflict.

121
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,375
These altercations were the
beginning of the Writing War.

122
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,125
[MAIA]
I never knew.

123
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,791
Master Sougon never told
me about any of this.

124
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,500
He must've felt it wasn't
necessary for you to know.

125
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,875
To create blind followers, you
have to limit the knowledge

126
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,833
they have access to,
narrowing their point of view.

127
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,916
And that ghostly woman.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,250
It seems she was
symbolic of something.

129
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,583
Of what exactly, we don't know.

130
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,625
However, the giants
you can see behind her

131
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,750
are referred to in the records
as the "Angels of Slaughter."

132
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,708
Ultimately, the
ancient war concluded

133
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,083
with the Writing Tribe
completely victorious.

134
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,166
Though most details of the
events leading up to that

135
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,791
were lost to the
ravages of time,

136
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,875
there is one thing we know
with absolute certainty.

137
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,708
We know what weapon
finally brought an end

138
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,208
to their conflict.

139
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,375
It's name.

140
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,250
Aquarion Logos.

141
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,583
Aquarion... Logos?

142
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,666
[MAIA]
What is this feeling?

143
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,916
Aquarion Logos. I know
that name... somehow.

144
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,250
[KENTO] In the end,
we never found anything.

145
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,500
[MAIA]
Commander, about Akira...

146
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,958
[SAKURAKO]
I know. Don't worry,

147
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,291
I won't say anything to
the other club members.

148
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,125
Including Akira himself.

149
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,958
You aren't tellin' him?

150
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
We could warn him about
the dangers of Vector-Ga,

151
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,541
and forbid him from using
it in future operations.

152
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,291
[MAIA]
It's pointless.

153
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,125
He'll keep fighting, no
matter what you tell him.

154
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,166
That's just who he is.

155
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,416
We'll be targeting
our female customers.

156
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,333
Women do love things that
are for a limited time only.

157
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,541
Y-Yeah! Th-They'll be
lined up out the door.

00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,250
[SUBETE]
You certainly took your time.

316
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,333
Hello, Subete.

317
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,666
Why do you look so surprised?
Surely, you knew I'd be here.

318
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,583
Even so, you deemed
me a pushover,

319
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,583
incapable of impeding
your progress.

320
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,958
I assume you plan to subdue me

321
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,750
and use me as a hostage
during your escape?

322
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,166
You've underestimated me, Maia.

323
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,000
How'd you--?

324
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,333
[NESTA]
How does he know?

325
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,625
I thought that much
would be obvious by now.

326
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,958
[MAIA gasps]

327
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,083
[NESTA] You had to have
realized that you are me.

[MAIA grunts]

329
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,250
That's nonsense!

330
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,750
How terrific.

331
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,833
I can't tell you what a relief
it is that you can see me.

332
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,833
Though I guess it
makes perfect sense.

[giggles]

334
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,833
I mean this is our
first proper meeting.

[GROUP] Cheers to three
years of business!

[OURA, OKAZAKI, SUZUKI,

As long as Kokone's
here, it's always time!

Hayato! Can I eat
mine off your abs?

340

We're still waiting
on a few people.

341

Where are Maia and Akira?
This isn't like them.

342
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,208
Huh. Come to think of it,
Maia wasn't at Digibaco earlier.

343
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,208
I wonder where
she could've gone.

344
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,875
A-Akira, why?

345
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:17,291
[VECTOR-GA growling]

346
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,250
Didn't expect to see you again.

347
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,750
You thrust yourself alone,

348
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,250
into the breach, to
save Akira Kaibuki.

349
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,791
Your devotion is touching.

350
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,291
If you know something,
then just spit it out!

351
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,875
[NESTA] Akira Kaibuki
is slowly being erased,

352
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,791
due to the power you
refer to as Vector-Ga.

353
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,041
That accursed entity
devours concepts,

354
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,791
erasing their
meaning completely.

355
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,291
At the current rate,

356
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,666
the concept known as Akira
Kaibuki will simply disappear.

357
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,250
Do you understand what
this inevitability means?

358
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,750
With his concept lost, no one
will be able to see him.

359
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,750
He will become
wholly imperceptible.

360
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,583
And that's not all.

361
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,125
Eventually, his entire
existence will slip from memory.

362
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,250
The time you spent together,
the memories you shared,

363
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,083
they'll all be gone
without a trace.

364
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:09,333
Soon, Akira Kaibuki will cease
to exist. Even in your heart.

365
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,583
That can't be. Akira.

366
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,458
Are you sad? That's a pity,

367
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:18,166
since you have absolutely
no right to feel that way.

368
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,416
Didn't you know?

369
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,833
His disappearance is
entirely your fault.

370
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,416
Because Akira Kaibuki
is taking your place.

371
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,375
[VECTOR-GA]
Devour.

372
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,541
Not today. Stay put.

373
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,833
[VECTOR-GA]
I will devour.

374
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,208
[AKIRA] You're gonna stay
right where you are.

375
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,416
[NESTA]
Just remember,

376
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,166
the one the Vector-Ga
truly wants to erase...

377
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,375
...is you, Maia.

378
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,541
[gasps]

379
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,333
[NESTA]
Vector-Ga was initially created

380
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,416
as a counter-measure to
defeat Aquarion Logos.

381
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,041
And that unflinching sense of
purpose drives it ever forward,

382
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,708
even over the course
of 12 thousand years.

383
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,208
If that's true...

384
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,916
When the mighty Aquarion Logos

385
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,958
finally appeared during
the Writing War,

386
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,416
there were two
people piloting it.

387
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,375
One of those crew
members was me. Nesta.

388
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,666
[MAIA]
Nesta?

389
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,083
True love gave me the
strength to fight back.

390
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:18,083
I found that strength in my
co-pilot. My beloved Kiryu.

391
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,083
Ultimately, Aquarion
Logos fell in battle,

392
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,250
and Kiryu and I both perished.

393
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,833
But in the present day,
a man who desired our power

394
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,958
called out to us
across the void.

395
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,166
[SUBETE]
My father.

396
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,625
[MAIA]
Master Sougon?

397
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,666
[SUBETE] He yearned for
Aquarion Logos's power.

398
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,166
[NESTA] And so, after the
passing of 12 millennia,

399
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,500
he found the child born
under the right stars

400
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,041
to be the reincarnated Kiryu.

401
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,750
You can't mean.

402
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,625
Yes. Him.

403
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,916
Subete Kenzaki, former
Aquarion Logos pilot reborn,

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,583
the inheritor of Kiryu's legacy.

405
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,750
And...

406
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,916
[SOUGON] You were meant
to be with Subete.

407
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,708
This was your destiny from
the day you were born.

408
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,833
[NESTA] Using the remaining
fragments of my soul,

409
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,958
which had dissolved
into the Logos World,

410
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,208
he created a being to one
day act as the master key.

411
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,791
To unlock Subete's strength.

412
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,250
[MAIA]
I don't wanna hear this!

413

It's here!
Connection successful!

415
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,000
[SUBETE] Verbalism was the
catalyst in the reaction

416
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,291
that created you
from Nesta's soul.

417
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,791
A puppet on a string,
you could say.

418
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,083
That is exactly
what you are, Maia.

419
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,666
You're wrong. It can't be true.

420
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,791
To put it bluntly,
you're not even human.

421
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,250
You're no more than
a replacement for me.

My pretty puppet.

423
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,250
Nothing more than his puppet.

[MAIA]
Liar!

426
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,916
I didn't know it myself

427
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,208
until I took in the Book
of Verbalism's power.

428
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,041
No, it would be more appropriate
to say that I'd forgotten.

429
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,541
Every memory I had of your
origin had been sealed away.

430

Subete.

431
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,000
But now I remember everything
as clear as crystal.

432
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,166
Even how I created you
from the Logos World

433
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,291
as my father watched.

434
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,625
What's your earliest memory?
How about your parents?

435
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,333
Have you ever tried to
remember these things?

436
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,541
What's wrong? Nothing there?

437
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,333
You were created
as a blank slate.

438
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,375
There's nothing to remember.

439
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,041
Shut up! Stop it!

The rain. Did she
make that happen?

441
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,541
Now you can see
the Power of Truth.

442
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,583
Just being with Subete, you
were able to manifest a power

443
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,625
you never could've
found on your own.

444
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,958
Limited though it may be,

445
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,750
you've tapped into the
wellspring of my power.

446
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,125
But surely, even you
can see it by now,
