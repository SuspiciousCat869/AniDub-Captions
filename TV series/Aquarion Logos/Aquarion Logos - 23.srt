[IWAGAMI]
Hello, Shoko.

3
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,875
It's been some time.

4
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,000
What's the trouble?
Why the petrified look?

5
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,208
Why do you think?

6
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,666
Isn't this the look
most people would have

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,333
if their father sent a
squad of armed men after them?

8
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,125
[IWAGAMI] You were in
harm's way by choice,

9
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,708
if memory serves.

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:53,541
Did I not tell you repeatedly
to cut all ties with DEAVA?

11
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:54,750
You refused to listen.

12
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,541
I see, and not
listening to you

13
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,250
is ample grounds
for having me killed?

14
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,666
[IWAGAMI]
Don't twist my words.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,541
You know very well
I had no intention

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,166
of letting things go that far.

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,166
Even so,

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,291

be allowed to exist!

Well, will you look at that.

30
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,125
He really was being
controlled by someone!

31
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,625
[SAKURAKO]
Captain Sakamoto,

32
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,666
thank you for putting yourself
on the line like this.

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,541
Good thing Shoko knew you.

34
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,250
Before dad let him go last year,

35
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,958
he'd been a part of our security
staff since I was a little girl.

36
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,458
Sakurako. Shoko's ability.

37
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,208
Did you have any idea?

38
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,916
I had a hunch,
but 'til now, I wasn't sure.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The technical term
for what she's able to do is

40
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,791
"Zero Verbalism Ability."

41
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,958
She absorbs writing's power.

42
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,375
Zero?

43
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,583
All that aside,

44
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,250
we now have a proper
chance of striking back.

45

[KOBAYAKAWA] They've
released an announcement.

47
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,875
You'll be glad to know
DEAVA's been cleared

48
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,541
of all terrorism charges.
Officially.

[HAYATO]
Yes, sir.

52
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,375
[SUBETE]
It is time.

53

Come with me.

54
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,541
I will show you the truth of
that long ago moonlit night.

55
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,625
[HAYATO] I realize most of you
have never seen me before

56
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,541
nor have any clue who I am.

57
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,041
My name's Hayato Kujyo.
I'm a second year student

58
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,625
at Seisou's School of
Politics and Economics.

59
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,500
I'm also a member of
the organization, DEAVA.

60
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,250
I'll have to ask you
to bear with me.

61
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,500
What I'm about to say
will sound beyond absurd.

62
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,291
But you have my word it's true.

63
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,666
We've been keeping a secret--

64
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,291
One that concerns
all of you. Directly.

65
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,875
Our civilization is in crisis.

66
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,000
The written word
is under attack.

67
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,000
In fact, it's on
the brink of extinction.

68
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,875
Surely no one
would deny the barrage

69
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,166
of inexplicable things
we've all witnessed

70
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,958
over the past few months.

71
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,541
Every one of them
was the result

72
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,916
of a written word
being corrupted.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,708
DEAVA was formed to push back

74
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,125
against the onslaught
of that corruption,

75
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,791
to make things right again.

76
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,125
Believe it or not,

77
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,000
we've been fighting in
the shadows all this time

78
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,250
to protect you.

79
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,333
[SAKURAKO]
What's he doing?

80
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,541
[HAYATO]
You didn't know

81
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,083
because you weren't
allowed to know.

82
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,541
And you weren't
allowed to know

83
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,708
because we flat out
didn't trust you.

84
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,833
We feared you'd panic,

85
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,666
that none of you
would have what it takes

86
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,666
to stand up in a time of crisis.

87
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,291
Right or wrong,
we felt it best

88
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,875
to tell only a select few
what was really going on.

89
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,083
We didn't think the
public could handle it.

90
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,416
Well, he certainly
doesn't mince words.

91
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,166
[HAYATO] In reality,
our secrecy was arrogant.

92
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,500
Time and again, we won the day,
and you were none the wiser.

93
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,708
Then we lost one of our own.

94
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,958
A friend. A comrade.

95
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,375
When a loved one dies,

96
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,208
we have a whole slew of cheap,
sentimental platitudes

97
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:52,083
to choose from to help us
negotiate our grief.

98
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,166
"Until we meet again," we say.

99
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,083
Or if we don't
believe in an afterlife,

100
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,083
"He'll live on in our hearts."

101
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,458
Sorry...

102
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,083
But it's a load of bull!

When someone you love dies,
that's it!

105
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,083
We're flesh and blood!

106
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,916
Even if there is a soul,
what good does it do us?

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,291
You can't touch it!

108
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,625
Can't talk to it
or laugh at its jokes.

109
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,333
All you're left with
are a handful of synapses!

110

And that's it.

111

That's all that's left
of the guy you knew.

The real person is gone.

He made you laugh.
Drove you crazy.

114
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,375
He was a character, always.

115
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,875
And now he's...

He's gone.

And without him,
the fight's not just harder,

00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,208
it's all but impossible
