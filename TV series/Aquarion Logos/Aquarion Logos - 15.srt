311
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,791
because people give up on them.

312
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,625
People have to set
aside their dreams

313
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,666
because they won't come true.

314
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,166
Hard work alone
isn't everything.

315
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,666
Do you think the best
pitcher in the world

316
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,833
is the guy who put in
the most hard work?

00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,791
The guy who practiced
the hardest?

318
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,125
That's seldom the case at all!

319
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,791
Every person has their
own special traits

320
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,291
where you can and can't go
is delineated by talent.

321
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,416
Yet you... you promise
their dreams will come true

322
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,208
if they simply
work hard enough.

323
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,166
That mistaken teaching only
gives people false hope.

324
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,375
And ultimately,
brings them misfortune.

325
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,125
Listen, most dreams
never come true.

326
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,583
More often than not, all your
misplaced work goes to waste.

327
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,750
And now, you're chasing after
yours this late in the game?

328
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,083
You'd be crazy to expect
positive results.

329
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:18,875
Go home to your families,
your wives, your kids.

330
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,125
If you're that fortunate,

331
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,333
stop wasting time here
on impossible dreams.

332
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,791
Instead go take care
of the ones you love.

333
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,208
And be sure to teach
your children this:

334
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,541
"You were born to
an unimpressive,

Project.

469
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,333
[SHOKO] Why'd the monitor
turn on by itself?

470
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,750
[SAKURAKO]
The M.J.B.K.s have reverted

471
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,625
to their original sizes?

472
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,333
[SUBETE]
Sit down and watch.

473
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,416
Who?

474
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,375
[SUBETE] O pitiful souls
of the departed...

475
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,666
[SUBETE]
...let all of you be reduced...

476
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,333
...to pure light.

477
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,958
With one strike.

478
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,958
[SHOKO]
No. It can't be!

479
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,083
[MAIA]
Akira.

480
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,833
[SD MAKI]
What's an excavation, Maki?

481
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,291
[SD YUME] It means digging
up old stuff, Yume.

482
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,833
[SD MUSHI]
No, Mushi. The dig site is.

483
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,375
[SD UZU]
In a foreign desert, whirl!

484
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,833
[SD MU]
It's hot, Mu.

485
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:29,875
[SD NATSU] They don't speak
our language there, Natsu.

486
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,083
[SD MAKI]
Maki!

487
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,500
[SD YUME] You can't
watch Logos there, Yume!

488
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,833
[SD MUSHI]
Episode 16.

489
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,958
[SD NATSU] "Carve Them In!
The Scars of Destiny."

490
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:37,916
[MAIA]
I'm scared.
