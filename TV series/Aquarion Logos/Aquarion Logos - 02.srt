317
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,750
That's one of my dust cloths!

318
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,750
[laughter]

319
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,916
[MAIA]
Master Sougon. Forgive me.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,375
I cannot imagine these women
to be in the depths of despair.

321
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,791
[SOUGON]
Verbalize. Rejoice.

322
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,708
Today I deign to set you free!

323
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:34,791
[M.J.B.K. ILLNESS]
Byoooooooou!

324
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:43,000
[M.J.B.K. ILLNESS]
Byoooooooou!

325
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,291
[groaning, grunting]

326
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,000
[SHOKO]
Kento! He's burning up!

327
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,291
That was quick!

328
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,666
They're here.

329
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,166
DEAVA System, activate!

330
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,458
Rescue team: transfer
the afflicted immediately!

331
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,166
[SHOKO] Contact the nearest ER,
let them know you're en route.

332
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,916
[SHOKO] I've gotten in touch
with Hayato and Kokone.

333
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,875
They're on their way.

334
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,916
[FEMALE OPERATOR 1A]
Confirmed.

335
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,166
They're inbound.

336
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,333
A lot of people were sick today.

337
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,000
Is this an M.J.B.K.?

338
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,875
Yes. Likely the
kanji for "fever"

339
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,833
has become hollow
and is running amok.

340
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,208
Unless we act quickly, the
damage will be exponential.

341
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,250
We need our star pilots.

342
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,291
Uh, speaking of which,
anyone seen "Savior"?

343
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,000
Sorry!

344
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,000
It's gonna take time!

345
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,750
We need to make
extensive repairs!

346
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,875
Hayato's and Tsutomu's vectors
were badly banged up, y'know!

347
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,916
[coughing]

348
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,916
This feeling.
Is it an M.J.B.K.?

349
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,708
And what of the people who must
be sacrificed for that ideal?

350
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,416
Is his Utopia worth their lives?

351
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I can't. This can't be!

352
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,083
[TSUTOMU]
Ease up, man!

353
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,583
What good's it gonna
do you to go alone?

354
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,208
Oh, hey. It's that
cute enemy girl.

355
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,583
I gotta do
that thing I do.

356
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,208
By my will.

357
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,708
[AKIRA]
Handle these people for me?

358
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,416
[TSUTOMU]
C'mon, wait! You're killin' me!

359
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,125
[AKIRA]
Verbalize.

360
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:35,000
[M.J.B.K. ILLNESS]
Byou.

361
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,041
[SHOKO]
What the...? Is that fog?

362
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,666
[MAIA]
Please. What should I do?

363
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,500
[MAIA]
Master Sougon.

364
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,208
No more than his puppet.

365
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,208
[gasps]

366
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,625
[MAIA]
No! My voice is my own!

367
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,500
[M.J.B.K. ILLNESS]
Byou.

368
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,375
Byou.

369
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,708
Byou!

370
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,833
[MAIA]
I... I am!

371
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,500
[grunts]

372
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,833
[SHOKO] Rear propulsion balancer
functionality dropping.

373
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,458
He's gonna crash any second!

374
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,708
Ugh! Kaibuki,
pull back now!

375
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,875
[AKIRA]
I don't need to.

376
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,750
[SAKURAKO]
You can't do this alone!

377
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,375
[AKIRA]
I'm not.

378
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,416
If my master's vision
involves a world

379
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,708
where people truly
understand one another.

380
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,750
Then M.J.B.K.'s are a
betrayal of that vision!

381
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,916
They're a grave error!

382
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,916
I am loyal!

383
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Even now I serve Master Sougon's
vision for a better world!

384
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,000
If he would abolish suffering.

385
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,500
I will do everything in my power
to protect these people!

386
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,541
[AKIRA] You're late.
What took you so long?

387
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,083
Ugh! Do not give me attitude!

388
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,000
That was your
own voice just now.

389
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:09,625
[MAIA]
Huh?

390
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,166
It's kind of nice.

391
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,791
C'mon! Gimme a hand!

392
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,375
Verbalize Merge. Now shout!

393
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,250
Aquariooooooon!

394
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,250
[AKIRA, MAIA]
Kou!

395
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,000
[AKIRA]
We have one soul, one body.

396
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,333
When the soul is healthy,

397
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,666
the body follows suit
and finds balance.

398
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,875
To treat illness,
treat the soul!

399
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,041
Yes! Let there be light!

400
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,000
[AKIRA, MAIA]
Shine!

401
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:21,041
[M.J.B.K. ILLNESS]
Byo... ou...

[groans]

403
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,125
[TSUTOMU]
Whoa! Okay?

404
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,291
Right!

405
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,291
Everyone up, time
for the afternoon shift!

406
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,166
Come on, girls!

407
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,666
We don't have time to sleep!

408
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,750
Let's get back to work!

409
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,625
Yeah!

410
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,958

[TANAKA]
Uh, hey Kokone?

412
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,833
Oh. Are... Are you...
Are you okay?

413
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,083
Long as you're in our corner,

414
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,750
we've got the energy of
at least a thousand men!

415
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,375
Akira did this?
You're kidding.

416
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,333
[SHOKO]
It's so bright!

417
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,458
[SAKURAKO] They called
back the power of the word

418
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,458
with their voice.

419
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,875
Darkness was banished by light!

420
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,916
They don't just
possess Verbalism.

421
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,625
They were chosen by it!

422
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
[gasps]

423
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,750
I have to go back.

424
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,833
Master Sougon will be waiting.

425
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,916
[MAIA]
What is this?

426
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,291
[SOUGON]
Maia.

427
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,708
[MAIA]
Master Sougon! Yes! It's me!

428
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,625
I shall return
to your side at once!

429
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:43,958
[SOUGON]
There is no need.

430
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,250
[MAIA]
Huh?

431
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,000
[SOUGON] It is my will
that you remain there.

432
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,333
Monitor the pilot of
the red vector closely.

433
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,041
[gasps]

434
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:28,958
Hello there!

435
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,916
Today we girls handle
the next episode preview!

436
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,125
No offense, manager, but
you're too old to be a "girl."

437
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,541
That was totally uncalled for!

438
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,416
I'm cutting your pay,
effective immediately!

439
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,958
Then you can find
yourself another waitress!

440
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,166
Not a problem!

441
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,375
I'll just have Kokone
pick up your shifts!

442
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,666
If I work hard, I can
b-be a manager, too!

443
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,666
Look who's got ambition!

444
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,750
[SHOKO]
Episode Three...

445
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,958
[KOKONE]
"Resound! A Dream for me Alone."
