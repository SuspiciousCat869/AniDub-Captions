You want to know
why I was with him?

I am being gentle, dork.

[TRAINERS groaning]

170
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,833
[HAYASHI] I'm the curious sort,
so I have to ask.

171
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,583
Why do you feel the need
to train your body?

172
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,750
Do you plan to
engage in fisticuffs?

173
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,583
Verbalism Ability
is the power to give voice

174
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,583
to your feelings.
Someone with high Verbalism

175
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,208
can strengthen their gift
by training the voice.

176
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,208
But there's more to it.

177
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,291
These feelings humans have

178
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,291
are not always
easy to control.

179
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,333
[HAYASHI]
Hmmm.

180
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,375
[SUBETE] When an animal
confronts an enemy

181
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,166
it instinctively
makes a judgment call

182
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,958
on whether it believes
it can defeat it.

183
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,375
We humans
do the very same thing.

184
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,708
This guy, I can beat.
But that guy would beat me.

185
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,333
Of those two,
which one leaves you

186
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,916
with the stronger emotion?

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,750
[HAYASHI] The former option,
generally speaking.

188
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,916
[SUBETE] The confidence that you
can dominate your opponent.

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,375
What it boils down to is,

190
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,833
do you believe in your own
strength or do you doubt it?

191
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,291
If you're going to
have faith in yourself,

192
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,166
you have to be strong.

193
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,625
Heh. Well, at least
according to my father.

194
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,416
[HAYASHI] I see. Exactly the
sort of straightforward logic

195
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,916
I expect from you.

196
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,708
That said,
here's another thought.

197
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,791
[SUBETE]
Go on.

198
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,125
Whether you're
strong or not,

199
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,041
victory is never guaranteed.

200
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,750
[SUBETE sighs]

201
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,083
[HAYASHI] There's really only
one logical choice to be made

202
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,791
when facing an opponent
far too powerful to beat

203
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,541
and that's to give up
fighting entirely.

204
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,375
But, from time
to time there are those

205
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,541
who would make
the illogical choice.

206
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,291
Would you consider
those people to be fools?

207
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,708
Yes, I think so.

208
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,791
[lighter clicks]

209
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,208
Of course.
And it's mostly accurate.

210
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,666
However, such a fool should
never be underestimated.

211
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,750
For the man
foolhardy in confidence

212
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,166
will face down any opponent,

213
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,500
no matter how
outmatched he might be.

214
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,500
Stubbornness can be
surprisingly dangerous.

215
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,875
I don't really get it.
The stronger one should win.

216
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,000
Doesn't matter who you face.

217
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,791
[HAYASHI] Your heart is a lot
like that glass in your hand.

218
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,833
So crystalline and clear.

219
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,208
Only the straightforward
approach is visible through it.

220
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:38,500
Thank you. I think.

221
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,958
[HAYASHI] I would
advise you to be cautious.

222
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,083
The more beautiful the glass.
The more easily it shatters.

Better come soon,
or I'm gonna eat it myself!

[TSUTOMU] You think
ringing the dinner bell's

232
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,083
gonna make her show up?

What, is she the
token glutton character?

[KARAN] Stop being lazy
and help me call her!

235

Or so help me,
I will take you down!

236
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,916
[TSUTOMU]
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,458
I'm not seeing
any sign of her.

238
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,250
[TSUTOMU] Hayato, you gotta
start shouting too, bro! Ooh!

239
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,625
Wouldn't it be bitchin'
to call her out

240
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,541
with a big speech,
politician style?

241
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,958
[HAYATO] No chance. Besides,
shouting wears me out.

242
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,583
Don't you worry your
bespectacled head

243
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,333
about shouting.
Not your style.

244
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,291
[TSUTOMU] What? So he can
be lazy, but I can't?

245
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,666
[HAYATO] My concentration
is focused on

246
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,708
using the sensors to find Maia.

247
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,916
All three of us shouting isn't
that much more effective.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,583
[SAKURAKO] It's been
eight hours since Maia

249
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,333
and Vector Two vanished.

250
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,708
I never expected things to
go on this long with no news.

251
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,333
[SHOKO] As soon as she
entered the Logos World,

252
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,041
Maia's Vector was swallowed
up by those shadows.

253
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,083
We've lost all contact
with her since.

254
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,750
[SAKURAKO] She has to be
in there somewhere.

255
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,000
She can't have just disappeared.

256
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,291
The M.J.B.K.
learned from Tsukigane.

257
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,083
It followed her example,
and its body became a shadow.

258
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,500
Without a physical form,
there's no way

259
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,500
to effectively attack it.

260
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,583
So what are we
supposed to do now?

261
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,875
[SHOKO] So far, the M.J.B.K.
has had no significant effect.

262
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,208
The word corrosion rate
has remained

263
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,250
fairly stagnant, actually.

264
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,625
Maybe we just need to
tough it out and wait?

265
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,416
Where are you going?

266
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,250
[AKIRA]
I've rested long enough.

267
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,500
[HAYATO] Kaibuki,
you were out here

268
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,708
searching for
five hours straight.

269
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,500
You may have been in
a Vector the whole time,

270
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,916
but your Verbalism Ability has
to be considerably drained.

271
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,333
Going off half-cocked
makes you a liability

272
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,083
we can't afford.

273
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,750
Maia, come out!
This is getting old!

274
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,833
[gasps]

275
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,500
Huh?

276
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,041
[SAKURAKO] So you're fine
fighting by our sides

277
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,250
from here on out?
Until the big win?

278
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,041
Mm! My dream
just changed from being

279
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,458
a pop idol to a voice actor!

280
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,041
So I'm still on board
if it makes me famous!

281
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,416
[SAKURAKO]
Hm. Just like we promised.

282
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Once the M.J.B.K.
threat has passed,

283
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,583
we'll give your rising career
all the backing we can muster.

284
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,541
Oh, heck yeah!

285
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,000
[TSUTOMU]
Count me in!

286
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,666
Sounds like we're gonna
be fightin' for justice

287
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,458
and nothing could be cooler!

288
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,833
[sighs]

289
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,375
I'd rather you not make this
decision so flippantly.

290
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,208
So, like,
this Verbalism Ability.

291
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,416
If I train it,
it's like putting

292
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
my communications skills
on steroids?

293
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,541
That sounds ultra kickass!

294
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,916
[SAKURAKO]
Yeah. I suppose so.

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,708
Rockin'! I wanna take
the comedy world by storm!

296
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,666
I crank up my ability
to reach people.

297
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,041
I raise my ability
to make 'em laugh!

298
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,958
Boom, one step
closer to domination.

299
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,041
How could I not be into that?

300
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,541
Yeah, sold, ya got me.

301
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,833
I'll join your little club.
Thanks for having me!

302
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,541
[SAKURAKO laughs nervously]

303
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,750
It's all changed again.

304
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,375
[HAYATO] My goal? Wide
ranging political reform.

305
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,625
[SAKURAKO] So, you want to
be a politician?

306
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,500
Then I suppose fighting
on the front lines

307
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,583
isn't something
that would interest you.

308
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,083
I never said that.

309
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,875
This "Verbalism"
thing intrigues me.

310
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,916
It could be a great help.

311
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,291
[SAKURAKO]
Hm.

312
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,833
What is the greatest weapon
a politician can wield?

313
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,708
Money? Connections? Neither.

314
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,833
For a politician,
that weapon is his voice.

if Verbalism can bring out
the power in words,

317
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,458
then it's an ability
I think I'll need.

318
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,708
Sign me up. I'll join the club.

[MAIA gasps]

[NESTA] You came here
to accomplish something.

322
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,666
That's right,
I came with a purpose.

323
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,416
To monitor Kaibuki.

[NESTA]
But you aren't like them.

325

There's a place
waiting for your return.

326
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,583
I'm well aware of that.

327
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,416
I'm here under
specific orders.

328
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,708
[NESTA] Now open
your mind. Remember.

329
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,750
I remember.

330
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,125
[NESTA] Then you should recall
this is not where you belong.

Why's it so dark
all of a sudden?

There's no need to be afraid.

[NESTA] Has he ever
led you astray before?

00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,333
Surely the wisest course
is to follow your fate

[MAIA] Please Master,
I'd like some answers.

You taught me that humanity's
path to true happiness

lies in a world devoid of words.

justify hurting so many

innocent people
to achieve that goal?

363

Say something! Answer me!

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,458
Is everything
I think I know a lie?

Turn back, Outsider.

You stand outside

see me. It was all... her.

So, that's how it is.

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,333
From the very beginning

376
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,250
I was no more than a means
to an end for you.

377
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,583
A puppet. A fool!

378

[NESTA]
Begone, Outsider.

You have overstayed
your welcome.

You're starting to annoy me.

Everything. It's all been a lie.

Where do I go?
What do I live for?

It's so dark here. So cold.

It's the one that will
always save me.
