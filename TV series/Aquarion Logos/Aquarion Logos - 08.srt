Thank you folks for
coming all this way

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,083
in the middle of a busy weekday.

00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,791
It's a good thing so
many people out there

Hey, I didn't know
if you saw I was here.

00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,958
'Course I did. Why'd you
sneak out after the show?

Aw, you know, man,

00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,541
I was just trying not
to steal your thunder.

[TSUTOMU] Anyway,

of comedy for its own sake.

In times past,

But the written word,
for all we prospered from it,

You should get some rest.

but being overly reliant
on a single person

49
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,125
is a sure sign of an
organization's weakness.

50
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,541
At this rate, I worry...

quite differently.

to devour his concept,

been wiped from this world.

for anything greater.

more elaborate comedy?

00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,750
where a very healthy
daikon is growing.

160
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,625
I spoke with the owner
of a small daikon farm,

161
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,291
a man named Hideki,
who recently relocated

162
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,083
from the nearby Nerima Ward
after building a concert venue

163
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,000
over his previous farm
there. Hideki believes...

164
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,291
Not yet. No.

This is not yet "The
World's Best Tempura."

has gotten into you?

You haven't slept a
wink since yesterday.

They've called him
a prodigy for years.

Since I was born into a "comedy
family," as the second son,

278
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,666
a lot of people expected
the same from me.

279

But Mom and Dad
thought it was cruel

to burden me with
such expectations.

So, to keep there from ever
being any kind of conflict

they gave me a name I could
never be a rakugo comedian with.

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,041
That's Tsutomu's
private property.

314
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,875
[KOKONE]
Wha-- A-Akira?

315
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,291
As such, the youth who are
concentrated in cities...

316
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,333
[TSUTOMU] To paraphrase a wise
man: Life moves pretty fast.

317
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,583
if you don't stop and face
your fears once in a while,

318
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,125
you could miss it.

319
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,208
[TSUTOMU]
Hello, fine folks.

320
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,458
Lemme sit right down and
tell you a truly trivial tale.

321
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,875
I woke up one morning

322
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,708
just in time to see a little bug
crawl up onto my pillow.

323
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,750
You're a]disgusting
little thing!

324
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,333
I must destroy you!

325
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,583
And when I lifted my hand back
up, I heard this tiny voice.

326
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,916
Please, spare me!

327
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,833
Oh my! A bug that can talk?

328
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,833
Yes, good sir...

329
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,750
What is that he's doing?

330
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,166
It's rakugo.

331
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,541
[TSUTOMU] Holy Roly Poly,
you really can speak!

332
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,541
I have definitely never
seen that before.

333
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,125
"Colic Bug," huh?

334
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,875
I feel like I've heard of that.
Hm. Are you a good bug or bad?

335
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,458
[SAKURAKO]
Of course.

336
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:20,166
This M.J.B.K. is making itself
grow by literally eating kanji.

337
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,041
But if all of that
kanji it's consuming

338
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,625
were to suddenly start conveying
different meanings than usual.

339
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,625
You mean, if these obsession
bugs, or whatever they are,

340
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,791
were to somehow
lose their focus,

341
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,541
it would most likely affect
the M.J.B.K., too?

342
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,708
[KARAN]
Uh.

343
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:39,291
Ha! We need to make
the bug kanji laugh!

344
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,375
[KOKONE]
B... B-B-B...

345
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,500
But... The b-bug's voice is
too loud. Th-They can't hear!

346
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,875
[AKIRA]
No problem.

347
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:52,041
For I am, the savior of comedy.

348
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,458
I dunno, sir,

349
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,333
he just told us to hook
loudspeakers up to his Vector,

350
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,875
so we jerry-rigged one
of the base's big ones.

351
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,500
What? The order didn't come
down from the commander?

352
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,041
Wait a minnit, Colic Bug?

353
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,583
You mean like a
stomach bug! You pain!

354
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,750
You make me sick! Literally!
I must destroy you!

355
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,541
[M.J.B.K.]
Mushi!

356
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,541
[TSUTOMU]
Please! Spare me!

357
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,750
If you let me live, I'll tell
you our secret weakness!

358
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,500
Your secret weakness?

359
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,291
By all means: speak up.

360
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,583
Well, it's kind of
embarrassing, but...

361
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,333
...we hate red peppers.

362
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,666
When we're in a
person's stomach

363
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,625
and they send red
peppers our way,

364
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,291
we've gotta hustle down south...

365
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,041
[AKIRA]
Speaker: On!

366
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,291
[TSUTOMU]
Your other home?

367
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,125
Think of it like a
summer rental. Real nice!

368
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,250
It's on that little "peninsula"
dangling between a man's legs.

369
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,375
[KOKONE]
Wha-- W-W-Wha--?

370
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,041
Am I too young for this?

371
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,708
"The Colic Bug." Classic rakugo.

372
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,083
[TSUTOMU]
"Peninsula?"

373
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,875
More like, "pe-nis-ula!"
That's valuable real estate!

374
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,125
Do you all hear that?
The kanji are laughing.

375
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:53,916
Oh, man! 

376
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,416
Hayato, what's wrong?

377
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,625
What a ridiculous story.

378
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,333
[TSUTOMU]
Okay, fine,

379
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,916
so on men you've got another
dangly little safehouse.

380
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,666
How 'bout when it's a lady?

381
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,416
Oh, well. In that case,
we've got nowhere to run.

382
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,041
Aquarion's being washed
away in the monster's bile.

383
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,791
So the bug's trying to
expel them from its body.

384
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,333
In other words, the bug
is debugging itself.

385
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,500
[TSUTOMU] All right, now here
comes the punch line.

386
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,958
You ready, Hayato?

387
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,666
Ready! Genesis Merge.

388
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,041
[TSUTOMU]
Pierce it!

389
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:35,000
[BOTH]
Aquarion!

390
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,458
[TSUTOMU, HAYATO]
Ryu!

391
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,791
[AKIRA]
The kanji for "insect"

392
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,875
came from a variation
of the one for "dragon."

393
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,750
[TSUTOMU] You've been
layin' eggs all over.

394
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,208
Which means we know
you're female.

395
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,333
Ladies don't have another house.

396
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,833
A woman's womb,

397
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,333
we gotta pierce through that
on our way to a new future!

398
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,500
[BOTH]
Go, Tsutomu!

399
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,541
Pierce it!

400
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,750
Pierce it!

401
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,500
[AKIRA]
Do it! Be a dragon!

402
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,125
A dragon that
pierces the heavens!

403
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:13,958
[TSUTOMU]
Pierce it!

404
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,333
And the dragon,
born of her womb,

405
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,250
rose to the heavens
as a rainbow!

406
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:40,625
[M.J.B.K.]
Mushi! Mushi! Mushi!

407
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,916
[TSUTOMU] Not sure when or
how it all got turned around.

408
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,166
But you know? I really
did want to love comedy.

409
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,291
[TSUTOMU]
I wanted to learn to love it.

410
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,458
I just wasn't ready
to recognize that yet.

411
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,625
[TSUTOMU]
But, from here on,

412
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,458
I'm gonna try my
best to face it.

413
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,791
You're the one who made
me realize that, Haruka.

414
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,000
Let me show you my thanks.

415
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,291
Aw, man. Palms are sweating.

416
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,708
[HARUKA]
Are you Tsutomu?

417
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,541
Yes!

418
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,458
[yelps]

419
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,166
My, quite a looker in person.

420
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,041
You... must be...
Miss... Haruka?

421
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,125
Yes. That's me. I'm Haruka.

422
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,333
[HARUKA]
Oh, dear.

423
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,750
[chuckles] Ba-dum-bum,
ba-dum-bum.

424
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:28,958
[SHOKO]
Oh, hey, Maia.

425
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,208
Have you ever played
hide and seek?

426
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,625
[MAIA]
Never heard of it.

427
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:32,833
[SHOKO] Holy cats, I knew
you were kinda sheltered,

428
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,666
but did you grow up
under a rock, or what?

429
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,875
[MAIA]
What?

430
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:36,958
Why would I need to be
placed under a rock?

431
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,666
Do you mean to
imprison me again?

432
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,375
[SHOKO]
Huh?

433
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,375
[AKIRA]
No worries.

434
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,791
I won't let anyone
lock you away.

435
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,125
For I am--

436
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:45,000
[SHOKO] Yes, yes, we know!
Next time, Episode 9.

437

The Inviting Shadows."
