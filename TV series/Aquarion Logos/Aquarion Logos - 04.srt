[KOKONE]
Here I, uh,

2
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,166
I w-washed it for you.

3
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,125
So it's... it's
nice and c-clean.

4
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,541
The others, too.

5
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,375
I-I don't wear these that
o-often, so, so, you know.

6
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,958
[MAIA]
That is helpful.

7
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,916
Yes?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,166
Oh, nothing.

9
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,791
I was just k-kind
of wondering...

10
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,291
[KOKONE]
...h-ho-how, uh...

11
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,666
...you felt about Akira.

12
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,291
Not sure I follow.

13
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,708
[MAIA]
No, it's impossible.

14
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,083
Surely this creature isn't
aware I'm monitoring him?

15
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,708
My cover is secure.

16
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,833
[gasps]

17
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,375
[KOKONE] What would
possess me to ask that?

18
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,958
Great. Now she's upset
with me. I knew it!

19
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,958
[SHOKO]
A-ha. There you are.

20
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,333
[KOKONE]
Sh-Shoko. I was just...

21
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,750
Verbalism Club
meeting in 5, hon.

22
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,583
Four words, it's
Tanabata Festival time!

23
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,041
Huh? What do you mean?

24
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,833
It's August. Isn't all
that stuff over with?

25
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,125
It would be, but the Asagaya

26
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,416
Shopping District's still
on the old calendar.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,125
Enough people still
appreciate tradition

28
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,250
that the powers that be
hold it in the summer.

29
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,083
And what a glorious
tradition this Festival is!

30
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,416
Thanks to huge support
from local retailers,

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,958
it's become Asagaya's
largest annual event,

32
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,416
with stalls as far
as the eye can see.

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,875
Though, of course, the real draw

34
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:09,375
is the plethora of marvelous
papier mâché displays!

35
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,166
On the day of, every
store in the district

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,291
showcases entries
from local students.

37
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,875
There's an award
for best display,

38
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,750
so competition is fierce.

39
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,416
And naturally, the creativity
involved is breathtaking.

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,375
[SHOKO] Last year the winner
was a two story tall

41
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,791

of the Chikuwa Pie Hermit,

42
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,333
from the Lacross Plus anime.

43
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,250
Yes. I recall being
impressed by the quality.

44
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh! Wow!

45
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,916
We are proud residents
of the district.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,583
As such, we are duty
bound to participate.

47
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,125
One could even go so far
as to call it a mission!

48
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,458
Seems a bit of a stretch.

49
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,958
Listen up! We will represent!

50
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,875
In fact, not only will
the Verbalism Club

51
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,208
make a bold showing in the
papier mâché competition,

52
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,625
we will put on a celebratory
Reading Theatre follies!

53
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,250
R-Reading Theatre?

54
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,625
You mean like, in front
of actual people?

55
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,125
Excuse me, ma'am,
but counting today,

56
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,875
that only gives us a week.

57
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,041
Even if we started right this
instant, we'd never finish!

58
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,625
[SAKURAKO]
So it would seem.

59
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,708
[SAKURAKO giggles] Which is why,
from now until the festival...

60
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,041
...we'll be camping out
right here at Shirobaco!

61
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,041
Camp?

62
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,583
Uh... C-Could be...
It could be fun!

63
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,083
[SOUGON] In times past,
humanity was at one

64
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,041
with the world of truth.
But the written word,

65
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:30,541
for all we prospered from it,
wrought incalculable suffering.

Kids these days.

Oh, what I wouldn't
give to be young.

Don'cha think I'm good enough?

Maybe.

Whaddya say you an' me hit up
the festival together?

Of course.

Though, to be fair, I'd say
everyone's giving it their all.

It looks so difficult.

[SAKURAKO]
Difficult is good.

106

It helps strengthen the

What the hell happened

to the sweet little

Don't tell me. The cutie
thing was a front.

Less lip, more teamwork!
