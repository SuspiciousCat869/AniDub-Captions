1
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,916
[SAKURAKO] It's been almost
a month since our battle

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,833
with Sougon Kenzaki's enormous
"Nothingness" M.J.B.K.

3
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,000
Sougon, the co-founder,
lead developer, and now CEO

4
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,916
of the world's largest social
networking service, Nesta,

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,583
has suddenly vanished,

6
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,166
along with his son,
Subete Kenzaki.

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,208
Given their obviously
high public profile,

8
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:54,041
this has seen major news
coverage every day since.

9
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,666
As speculation over their
whereabouts ran rampant,

10
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,083
Nesta's stock price
began to plummet.

11
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,083
There was concern over the
company's continued existence.

12
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,708
Until the appointment of a new
president and upper management

13
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:08,458
eased public concerns over
their ability to recover.

14
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,125
Although numerous
talks have been held

15
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,500
in regards to what
will become of DEAVA,

16
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,041
consensus has
yet to be reached.

17
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,041
Further deliberations
will likely touch on

18
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,166
whether the organization
will be permitted to continue.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,958
[SAKURAKO sighs]

20
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,500
[beeping]

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,333
[SAKURAKO]
Who's there?

22
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,625
[SAKURAKO]
You can't be.

23
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,958
[SAKURAKO]
You are!

24
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,375
[SOUGON]
In times past,

25
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,625
humanity was at one
with the world of truth,

26
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,708
but the written word, for
all we prospered from it,

27
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,541
wrought incalculable suffering.

28
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,250
[TSUTOMU]
A humanoid M.J.B.K.?

29
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,875
Jeez, I guess nothin's
sacred with these things.

30
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,208
So why is he just
staring at the manager?

31
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,375
[SAKURAKO]
Meow?

32
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,875
There are many animals,
such as ducklings,

33
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,666
which imprint on the first
living being they see.

34
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,166
Perhaps this is a
similar situation?

35
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,583
[SHOKO]
So, what?

36
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,583
You're saying he thinks of
the manager as his mother?

37
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,416
Manager Mama!

38
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,166
[SAKURAKO]
Hey, meow! That's rude!

39
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,125
I can't have a kid this big,
people will think I'm old!

40
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,708
S-So, what do we call him?

41
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,416
[TSUTOMU] Yeah, I'd feel bad
if he didn't have a name.

42
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,250
We can't just call him M.J.B.K.

43
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,333
He has a point. Any ideas?

44
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,458
[AKIRA]
Hito.

45
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,041
[TSUTOMU groans]

46
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,750
[TSUTOMU] "Hito" because it
means person? Too on the nose!

47
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,125
Isn't that like naming
your dog, Dog?

48
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,375
Or even worse, naming your
refrigerator, Rey Frigerator?

49
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,625
[KARAN]
No one names their refrigerator.

50
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,583
[KOKONE] B-But... I think
Hito is a g-good name.

51
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,291
[MAIA]
Easy to remember, too.

52
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,708
Fine, whatever. We can
call him Hito for now.

53
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,708
[SAKURAKO]
Nice to meet you, Hito.

54
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,166
[KENTO] Why do you think
the little guy showed up?

55
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,916
Without Sougon around,
there should be no way

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,583
for distorted words
to become M.J.B.K.s.

57
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,458
[SAKURAKO] I've been
giving that some thought.

58
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,541
Best I can figure is
maybe the Logos World

59
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,333
was somehow destabilized
during our last battle.

60
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,666
Meaning who knows
what could happen next.

61
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,541
We've gotta get the
Vectors fixed up fast.

62
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,833
Ugh. Too bad they
slashed our budget.

63
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,916
[SHOKO] Then I'll go tell them
to raise it for you. No bigs.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,375
[BOTH]
Sorry? Tell who?

65
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,291
What's up?

66
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,458
You tell me. Why're we here?

67
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,125
[AKIRA]
Because of this weight,

68
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,416
Shinjuku's out of
the way, but I got it,

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,333
so coming here was worth it.

70
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,041
[MAIA]
I see. You sound happy.

71
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,375
[WORKMAN]
Yo, more to the left.

72
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,541
[MAIA] Anyway, Sougon
and Subete died, right?

73
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,916
I can't imagine how they
could've survived that.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,541
If they had, then
there's no reason

75
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,083
they'd still be missing
after a whole month.

76
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,250
But still...

77
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,208
Which outcome would
you prefer to be true?

78
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,291
I don't know anymore.

79
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,791
Maybe that's the
reason I came here.

80
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:03,000
[MAIA] Am I just being silly?
I mean, it's all over now.

81
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,166
[AKIRA]
Not yet. Hito still came.

82
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,708
So M.J.B.K.s that threaten us
are sure to keep coming as well.

83
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,250
My battle has not yet been won.

84
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,083
[SAKURAKO] This is my apartment.
Where I live. Understand?

85
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,625
I can't leave you with
someone I don't know.

86
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,291
C'mon upstairs, Hito.

87
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,833
Oh, Ms. Soda, how are you?

88
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,375
[SAKURAKO]
Evening. Good. Heading out?

89
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,833
[OHTSUKA] Yeah, down to the
diner to finish my report.

90
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,333
Fewer distractions than at home.

91
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,416
I hear ya there.
College is tough.

92
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,208
[OHTSUKA] Hey, d'ja see
the bulletin board?

93
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,041
The day caredown on one
says they're increasing

94
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,041
the number of kids
they can take overnight.

95
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,750
[SAKURAKO]
Oh, they are, huh?

96
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
[SAKURAKO giggles]

97
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,250
[OHTSUKA]
Well, see ya later.

98
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,375
[SAKURAKO]
Ohtsuka, wait!

99
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,583
Great, someone else
who thinks I'm old now.

100
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,916
Are you hungry? Or--
No, I guess you don't eat.

101
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:21,333
That? You noticed, huh?
That's my treasure.

102
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,791
Based on the debriefing reports

103
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,250
of both Akira Kaibuki
and Maia Tsukigane,

104
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,875
the likelihood of Sougon
Kenzaki having survived

105
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,458
is considered extremely low.

106
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,458
This means that the M.J.B.K.
threat has effectively passed,

107
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,041
and that the DEAVA
organization was instrumental

108
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,250
in saving the world.

109
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,791
Sougon Kenzaki.

110
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,208
You can read, right?

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,166
Okay!

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,166
Here. "Dog." Do you understand?

113
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,541
Woof! Woof!

114
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:11,958
[HITO]
Woof! Woof!

115
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,250
[SAKURAKO giggles]

116
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,750
Yes! Nicely done! What's next?

117
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,333
Well?

118
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,208
Yes, it says crab!
And, how 'bout.

119
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:29,916
[HITO]
Bang.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,916
[groaning]

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,416
[SAKURAKO]
Oh! No! You got me!

122
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,000
You're amazing, Hito!
Best student ever!

123
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,791
Let's see, next.

124
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,166
What's this one?

125
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,541
[MAIA]
"Preposterous!

126
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,750
You claim to be that
Urashima Mantarou?"

127
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,583
"Indeed! I have waited
for this moment.

128
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,583
At last, I shall
have my revenge!"

129
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,875
[MAIA]
"Curse you!

130
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,208
To arms! My turtle warriors!
To arms! To arms!"

131
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,458
[KOKONE]
"I am sorry, Princess Otohime.

132
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,625
Your t-turtle army is no more.

133
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,083
You sacrificed all of them
yesterday to m-make your soup."

134
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,666
[MAIA]
"And they were delicious!

135
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,208
But oh, what a blunder!"

136
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:13,166
"Evil was vanquished, and we
all lived happily ever after."

137
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,000
[HAYATO clears throat]

138
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,708
"Ever after!"

139
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,375
Hito!

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,333
H-Hito, you d-did
a really g-good job!

141
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,375
[TSUTOMU] So like, if the
battle's over and all,

142
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,291
do we get to keep
the Club going?

143
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,625
Or is this the last hurrah?

144
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,208
Not sure yet.

145
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,583
"The matter is still
up for discussion."

146
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,125
[MAIA] If we do get to keep
going, Hito should join, too.

147
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,541
[KARAN]
Totally!

148
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,125
So he can read but
he's unable to speak.

149
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,041
Is that common among M.J.B.K.s?

150
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,708
[TSUTOMU] Does it really
matter? Don't stress, man.

151
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,750
[KARAN giggles]

152
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,208
[SAKURAKO chuckles]

153
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:59,125
[TSUTOMU]
He's good. With that penmanship?

154
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,875
Y-You got it right!

155
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,333
My penmanship's fine!

He is the written

So, he tries to communicate
the words he sees literally.

But people don't always
mean things literally.

lightly, as a joke,

[AKIRA]
It's tricky.

180
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,041
Your words may come across
with a different meaning

181
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,208
than you intend.

182
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,916
When you think of it that
way, writing is kinda scary.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,583

so much more than
the writer felt.

is the words being used,

00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,416
I can't... can't breathe.

312
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,166
[EMERGENCY RESPONDER] Just
hang in there and be strong!

313
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,916
We'll be there as soon
as we can, I promise!

314
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Help... me.

315
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,625
[MAN E]
Seriously?

316
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,041
[WOMAN E]
Someone nearby, go help her!

317
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,000
[MAN F]
She's messing with us.

318
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,375
[MAN G]
It'll take me two hours.

319
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,125
[WOMAN F] Wasn't there a
little earthquake just now?

320
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,375
[WOMAN G]
If this is true, it's awful.

321
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,833
Stop the car.

322
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,416
[SAKURAKO groaning]

323
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,041
[SAKURAKO crying]

324
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,333
What?

325
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,041
Where's his bookbag?

326
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:03,541
[CHILD crying]

327
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,041
Run! Hurry!

328
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,291
[SAKURAKO coughing]

329
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,083
I had to defeat Sougon
so I could save the world.

330
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:57,166
But not for peace. Not to
protect the culture of writing.

331
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,791
Those were just
lies I told myself.

332
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,625
This was personal,
I was mad at him.

333
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,791
The bonds of writing are
what had brought us together.

334
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,833
He saved me, but
denied those bonds.

335
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,750
That light, that hope,
it shone on me.

336
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:18,666
Then he made it feel as though
it never happened. So...

337
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,250
So I fought, and I fought

338
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,625
because I wanted to somehow try
and convince President Sougon,

339
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,666
"You're wrong,
don't you get it?"

340
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,333
I was selfish.

341
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,625
[laughs]

342
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,416
Honestly... I'm the worst.

343
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,250
[HITO]
Hito!

344
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:39,791
L-Look!

345
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,000
What is that?

346
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,791
It takes a true voice to lend
strength to the written word.

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,333
[wood clattering]

348
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,041
Hito, what...?

349
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,666
[SAKURAKO]
Hito, you can't do this.

350
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,666
Just leave me. At
least get yourself out.

351
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,041
[HAYATO]
Commander!

352
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,791
Don't tell me she's--

353
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,916
[HAYATO, SOKO gasp]

354
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,875
[KENTO]
Manager!

355
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,958
[TSUTOMU]
We got'cha. Hang in there!

356
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,291
[KARAN]
Hito! No! No!

357
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,708
[TSUTOMU] You can't get taken
out by somethin' like this!

358
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,958
You're an M.J.B.K., aren'tcha?

359
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,625
He's not. At least not anymore.

360
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,041
Hito, no!

361
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,458
[HITO]
Thank you.

362
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:06,541
Thank you for playing
with me, Manager Mama.

363
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,375
[AKIRA] That was your
own true voice just now.

364
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,625
And now that you have your
own will, you're human.

365
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,000
He is... He's human.

366
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,958
Dummy. Who're you callin'
"Mama"? I'm not that old.

367
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:42,333
You'll make me mad... Hito...

368
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,916
[SAKURAKO]
Wait, you're telling me

369
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,541
none of you know
what nata de coco is?

370
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,916
[KARAN]
Nata? Coco?

371
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,541
[KOKONE]
S-Sorry, Manager, I don't.

372
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,500
[SHOKO] I'm guessing it has
something to do with coconut?

373
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,333
[SAKURAKO] This generation
gap should not be so wide!

374
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,458
I'm only around 30,
for cryin' out loud!

375
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:34,041
[SHOKO] Like bubbles, fads
never last. Next: Episode 15!

376
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,458
[KARAN]
"Ah! Days of Our Youth!"

377
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,416
[SAKURAKO]
Ya better watch, or else!
