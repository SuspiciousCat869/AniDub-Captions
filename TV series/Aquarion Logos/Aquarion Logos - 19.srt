1
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,333
[TSUTOMU]
No, seriously!

2
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,333
It's called "Destiny
on the Asagaya."

3
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,625
[SCHOOLGIRL]
Yeah, no thanks.

4
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,166
[groans]

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,166
More like "Dissed
on the Asagaya."

6
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,666
Heavens! A real live
pick-up artist!

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,458
What do we do? I'm scared!

8
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,083
[SHOKO] Calm down.
We'll just ignore him.

9
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:50,500
[TSUTOMU] 'Ey, Shoko!
Wanna find your destiny with me?

10
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,500
I'll buy you a ton a chocolates!

11
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,625
Sorry?

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,333
[AKIRA]
What's up?

13
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,416
[MAIA]
Uh...

14
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,875
Nothin'.

15
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,166
[AKIRA]
Hm?

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,208
Hi-ee! It's Destiny
on the Asagaya.

17
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,625
Bascially a romance-themed
scavenger hunt around town

18
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,791
where all the contestants
participate as couples.

19
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,666
The couple that completes
the most objectives,

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,833
in a super-duper,
lovey way, of course,

21
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,833
wins a coupon good for all sorts
of fun couples activities!

22
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:27,333
Who does Karan love, you ask?
Why, her fans, silly!

23
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:28,541
[KOKONE giggles]

24
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:29,833
Is this some new type
of Reading Theatre?

25
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,541
No, I'm practicing
'cause I'm the emcee.

26
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,583
Hey!

27
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,583
[AKIRA] Maia, you an'
me are taking part.

28
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,000
[MAIA]
Huh?

29
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,458
[AKIRA] That's required
headgear for a Savior.

30
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,041
[MAIA]
You need a crown?

31
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,583
Y'know they're just
plastic, right?

32
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,666
You said the contestants
have to be a couple?

33
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,166
[KARAN] Yeah, but not
necessarily a real one.

34
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,916
[MAIA]
What're you getting at?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,458
Heh, heh. You two should
pretend to be lovers.

36
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,208
Pretend to be... what?

37
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,083
[KARAN]
What?! Why would you do that?!

38
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,750
You don't actually
have to be a thing.

39
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,333
It's just for the contest!

40
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,791
Oh god. Tsutomu?!

41
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,583
What can I say?
It just happened.

42
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,291
Man, rippin' me off!

43
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,541
Shoulda secured the copyright
when I had the chance!

44
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,166
News flash: No one cares.

45
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,083
Anyways, it sounds fun.
And I'm off work that day.

46
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,833
[TSUTOMU] Let's practice.
"Shoko, my love!"

47
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,625
But why pretend?
Wanna go out for real?

48
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,750
Yeah, okay.

49
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,916
--[SAKURAKO] Ah?
--[TSUTOMU] Really?

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
[SHOKO] How much can
I really know about you

51
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,000
till we've gone out, right?

52
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,791
There's a distinct possibility
I'll fall head over heels.

53
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,541
But just to be clear,
let's set some boundaries.

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,416
Until we've gotten
to that point...

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,333
...no "boyfriend
girlfriend" stuff.

56
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,250
Uh, yeah, 'course!

57
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,500
You're so mature
for your age, Shoko.

58
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,791
Oh wow.

59
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,250
So... romantic.

60
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,958
What's boyfriend
girlfriend stuff?

61
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,291
[KARAN]
Uh?

62
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,666
[KOKONE]
Uhh.

63
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,583
Uh...

64
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,166
L-Like...

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,083
Kissing!

66
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,000
Kissing?

67
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,166
[KARAN]
Hugging, too.

68
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,833
[MAIA]
Right. What else?

69
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,958
[KARAN]
Uh. Well, it's kinda pervy.

70
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm so confused.
Explain in detail.

71
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,125
Oh, jeez, Maia! It's so gross!

72
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,333
You know what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,958
--[MAIA] Karan!
--Don't make me say it!

74
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,833
Oh, my darling, I...

75
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,208
We can't fight this, George.

76
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,083
What am I watching?

77
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,166
[KARAN] You're killin' me.
This is how people kiss.

78
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,125
It's what you do with the
person you love. For starters.

79
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,291
[ACTOR A]
Oh, my darling...

80
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,958
With the person you love?

81
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,541
Well, to be fair,
in some countries,

82
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,166
it's just how people say hello,

83
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,208
but these two are
definitely in love.

84
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,333
Fascinating.

85
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,791
[gasps]

86
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,875
Wait. So, I have to do this
sort of thing with Akira?

87
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,125
[gasps]

88
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,125
Oh, ew, no. You'll just
need to fake it. Easy.

89
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,666
[MAIA] But won't our opponents
smell the ruse from a mile away?

90
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,458
You'll just have to fake it
convincingly then, won't you?

91
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh. I see. I'll make
sure no one catches on.

92
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,708
[Where're you going?

93
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,166
J-Just m-making some tea.

94
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,583
[MAIA]
What's taking so long?

95
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,291
[KOKONE gasps] Oh. S-Sorry, I--

96
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,458
[MAIA]
You should go in my place.

97
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,500
[KOKONE]
Huh?

98
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,041
[MAIA] You're better
suited to it, really.

99
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,500
Because of all the movies
you've watched, I mean.

100
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:07,291
You know how proper couples
are supposed to behave.

101
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,000
[KOKONE]
R-Romantic movies are just

102
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,250
a g-g-guilty pleasure for me.

103
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,333
And b-besides, Akira asked
y-you to go with him.

104
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,875
I'd just mess things up.

105
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,458
[MAIA]
The guy's a consummate imbecile.

106
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:25,750
[KOKONE] B-But... he
chose you. Isn't that...?

107
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,583
[MAIA]
Huh?

108
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,208
[KOKONE] D-doesn't that
make you feel good?

109
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,416
[MAIA]
How so?

110
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:37,250
W-Well, some p-part of you
must think that A-Akira is...

111
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,708
[MAIA groans]

112
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,083
[MAIA]
He's a pain.

113
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,250
[KOKONE]
Huh?

114
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,166
[MAIA] You have to
watch him like a hawk.

115
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,208
Take your eyes off
the idiot for a second,

116
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,041
there's no telling
the havoc he'll cause.

117
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,375
'Cept the one part of me that
doesn't think he's a pain

118
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,208
worries about him constantly.

119
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,750
That s-sounds--

120
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,833
[MAIA]
Huh?

121
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,208
[KOKONE]
Uhh...

122
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:05,083
[KOKONE] M-Maybe Akira
f-feels the same way.

123
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,333
[MAIA]
Hm?

124
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:10,083
[KOKONE] I mean, h-he's
always l-looking at you.

125
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,333
Always s-seems to be worried.

126
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,250
[MAIA]
That doesn't make me special.

127
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,000
[KOKONE]
Huh?

128
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,791
[MAIA]
He's that way with everyone.

129
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,208
He's the Savior.

130
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,583
Sorry! Hope you
weren't waiting long!

131
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,875
[smack]

132
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:37,916
Ouch.

133
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,458
The event coordinators
could be monitoring us

134
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,958
from several angles.

135
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,125
We give them any reason to
suspect we're not a real couple,

136
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,125
the jig is up.

137
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,375
[AKIRA]
Mh-hm.

138
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,041
Sorry! Hope you
weren't waiting long!

139
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,166
No. Only just got here.

140
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,333
[MAIA]
Passable. It'll have to do.

141
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,333
Since when are you
two scene partners?

142
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,833
[SHOKO]
G'morning. Nice to see you.

143
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,375
Check it out! She's
wearing this on our date!

144
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,708
[SHOKO] I don't see what
you're excited about

145
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,125
it's just a school uniform.

146
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,666
Which is the perfect choice!

147
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,083
A uniform is the best outfit
a girl has in her wardrobe!

148
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,750
Curses, perhaps we
should have opted

149
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,958
to go with our flightsuits.

150
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,041
Why, are we launching?

151
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,833
[HAYATO]
Bit early to be this pumped.

152
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,791
Milkman, hey! Look at you!

153
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,500
Couldn't resist the chance to
watch our lovey-dovey antics,

154
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,458
hmm?

155
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,166
Personal space.

156
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,791
Actually we're participating.

157
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,750
[TSUTOMU]
Hm? We?

158
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,291

How well you do is measured

00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,750
by how much your

Well, all right,
