[HAYATO] It's causing a wide

which could deal the deathblow
to society as we know it.

[MAIA] It has the power

And it's strong enough
to prevent our Merge.

would save these fools,

314
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,041
rather than leave them
to their just desserts.

315
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,041
But how. Why?

316
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,000
I hear them.

317
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,083
They're calling to me!

318
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:33,458
It's all coming back.
I remember you now.

319
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,750
You stole Maia from me, but
I'm going to bring her back!

320
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,375
[SUBETE yells]

321
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,208
Their voices.

322
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,333
Cry out to be saved!

323
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,166
What the--?

324
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,791
You did it.

325
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,833
[SHOKO] By enveloping
themselves in flame,

326
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,625
the Vectors are
somehow insulated

327
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,208
from the external heat.

328
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,125
But how does it work?

329
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:07,500
With you on our side,
I'm okay not having answers.

330
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,041
Kaibuki.

331
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,916
Akira.

332
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,708
Genesis. M-Merge.

333
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,250
[MAIA, AKIRA]
Dance!

334
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:24,916
Aquarion!

335
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,458
[AKIRA, MAIA]
Zai.

336
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,666
You want flame?

337
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,500
This is the fire
of absolute resolve.

338
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,791
[AKIRA, MAIA]
Heat Haze Dance!

339
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:09,500
[M.J.B.K. B]
En. En. En. En. En. En. En.

340
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,125
Is that the best
you've got, Red Vector?

341
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,750
[SUBETE]
Maia.

342
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,375
Wait! No! I'm stuck!

343
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,000
[AKIRA] As long as people
cry out to be saved,

344
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,708
I will deliver
each and every one.

345
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,541
[AKIRA]
For I am...

346
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,708
[AKIRA]
...the Savior!

347
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,000
That Red Vector guy
even saved me.

348
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,833
[SUBETE]
Akira Kaibuki.

349
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,833
[AKIRA]
Subete Kenzaki.

350
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:16,291
Kai... Kaibuki!

351
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,708
Subete.

352
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:34,416
[HAYASHI] So tell me,
how was your first flight?

353
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,166
[SUBETE]
It was awful.

354
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,916
I'll never forget this.

355
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,708
I'll make Kaibuki pay.

356
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:49,041
[SOUGON] The Pendulum
of Fate swings yet again.

357
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:54,000
How will your eyes view
this planet when you arrive...

358
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,166
...o, Nesta?

359
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:28,958
[BOTH screaming]

360
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,208
[AKIRA]
What's wrong?

361
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,583
[KARAN] There's a giant
cicada buzzing around!

362
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,333
[AKIRA] I don't discriminate
when it comes to saving.

363
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,458
For I am--

364
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,958
[KARAN]
Yeah, yeah! Just do something!

365
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,166
[KOKONE]
He c-caught it!

366
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,000
[BOTH]
Wow! Our savior!

367
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,083
[KARAN] That is so much
better! Next, Episode 8.

368
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:45,083
[KOKONE]
"Pierce It! The Insect Part!"

369
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,958
[BOTH]
Wait, an insect?
