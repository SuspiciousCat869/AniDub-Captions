At least look at the facts

Do you really
think human beings

could be responsible
for all this devastation?

Does this little girl strike
you as a cold-blooded killer?

322

Save it for the firing squad.

you off the streets

like it was yesterday.

342
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,250
I'll never forget what you
told us in the beginning:

343
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,750
Without a hint of irony, you
said you'd become The Savior.

344

Those words are your essence,

the very foundation
of who you are.

"This is my chance."

I guess I w-wanted
her out of the picture,
