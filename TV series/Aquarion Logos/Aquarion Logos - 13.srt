1
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,125
[CHILD SUBETE] We were
supposed to be together.

2
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,625
Remember? I made a promise.

3
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,541
[SUBETE]
Why? Why?!

4
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,791
[AKIRA]
Combine.

5
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,541

00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,791

00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:14,458

8
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,750
[SUBETE]
No.

9
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,500
Damn it.

10
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,125
Why can't I beat you?

11
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,875
[SOUGON] In times past,
humanity was at one

12
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,666
with the world of truth.

13
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,791
But the written word,
for all we prospered from it,

14
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,541
wrought incalculable suffering.

15
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,625
I can't do it.
This is far too painful.

16
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,333
If this is what
it means to be alive,

17
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,500
the world can't disappear
soon enough.

18
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,250
This is fate. I'll happily
embrace nothingness.

19
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,875
Is something wrong?

20
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,166
It's coming.

21
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,000
[SHOKO] Heads up.
Registering a new M.J.B.K.!

22
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,916
What are you talking about?

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,083
[SOUGON] The Great Word
reacted to Subete's aura

24
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,250
and assumed a different
form accordingly.

25
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,208
We now witness its
original shape restored.

26
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,000
[HAYASHI] Ah. So the Great Word
is "Nothingness," is it?

27
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,458
Interesting for an M.J.B.K.
to come into being

28
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,166
without an ampule.

29
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,625
We owe that to Subete as well?

30
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,958
Pray tell, what is it that
binds your heart so tightly?

31
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,750
A dream? Or could it
perhaps be her?

32
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,083
So, yet another
human being vanished.

33
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,708
Stolen by one already gone.

34
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,750
For us poor
wretches left behind

35
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,666
there are few things
more anticlimactic.

36
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,916
Huh.

37
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,916
This place. It's familiar.

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,916
It's the place where
words come from,

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,083
the Logos World.
[gasps]

40
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,541
[M.J.B.K. 13A]
Mmmm...

41
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,791
What's going on?
What is that?

42
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,291
[SOUGON] At last,
it has become manifest.

43
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,583
Master Sougon!

44
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,791
[SOUGON] Behold the kanji
for "Nothingness" set free!

45
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,833
All concepts shall be erased!

46
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,875
Akira. I need a favor.

47
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,833
Hm?

48
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,333
Master Sougon.
Please, sir.

49
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,041
Permit me to speak
with you one last time.

50
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000
You once said to me,

51
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,458
"Humankind is shackled
by the world of language,

52
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,916
words condemn man
to live a life apart."

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,333
And I understand.

54
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,875
Sometimes we can't see
the forest for the trees.

55
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,625
We mistake the word
for the thing.

56
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,583
But is that so wrong?
Is it weakness?

57
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:04,791
Do we live apart
when we can be moved?

58
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,833
Words can
break a heart, yes.

59
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,166
What we say to each other
can cut like a knife.

60
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,166
But the right words
can also make us laugh

61
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,500
or... fall in love.

62
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:28,333
People make the most
of what they have!

63
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:32,041
My dear. How very
humbling to see the manner

64
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,916
in which you've grown.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,875
I wished to make you proud.

66
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,708
Grown into a feeble minded
wastrel poisoned by

67
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,125
the folly of those
she was sent to observe.

68
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,458
[gasps]

69
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,083
[SOUGON]
You understand nothing.

70
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,916
Yet you presume to
lecture me on the relationship

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,458
between mankind and language.

72
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,000
[MAIA]
No, not at all.

73
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,916
In the distant past we
invented the written word

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,333
to keep our thoughts
from being lost to time.

75
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,791
To convey feelings and ideas
that would otherwise

76
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:04,541
remain inaccessible
to future generations.

77
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,000
The selfsame motivating
force behind our need to speak

78
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,333
drove us to record and preserve.

79
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:15,708
And yet look at the cost
to modern society!

80
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,791
Language proliferates
without end!

81
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:22,041
"Social" media abounds in empty
buzzwords and bankrupt memes,

82
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,500
all vying for the
short attention spans

83
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,416
of an increasingly isolated,
infantile public

84
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,416
desperate to fill
the emotional void

85
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,541
left in the wake of
now meaningless words!

86
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,875
Such madness!

87
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,916
The tool has run amok
of its intended purpose.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,166
What once ordered our
thoughts now scatters

89
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,708
and undermines them.

90
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:43,000
We live in a world
of superficialities.

91
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,041
It must be decimated.

92
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:49,000
Then and only then may Truth and
Utterance be reconnected.

93
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,291
[grunts]
That's not true!

94
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,791
Some people can't express
themselves without words!

95
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,708
What happens to them?
How do they "reconnect"?

96
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:00,458
[SOUGON] You've had your talk.
There's no more to discuss.

97
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,666
Why must it be this way?

98
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,750
No! You're wrong!

99
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,125
I can't stand here
and let you do this!

100
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,958
I'm sorry, but if
you won't listen to reason

101
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,666
you leave me no other choice!

102
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,291
I will... I will stop you.

103
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,166
[SOUGON]
Impossible.

104

pick you up from the station,

00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,375
I thought you were asking me
to pick you up from work.

What did you do,

Didn't they have
anything for you?

Well, uh, you know how it is:
they just wanted to

go over some details
of the upcoming shoot.

110

You could've told me
you were coming here.

No! We've lost a concept!

124
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,250
When a word vanishes
from the Logos World,

its corresponding concept
disappears from reality.

Gone. Erased from
our collective minds

like it was never there.

128

See, words give
people context.

129
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,458

131

we lose a piece of reality.

132
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,750
If this keeps up, before long
we'll lose everything.

133
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,500
The world as we know it
will be reduced to a void.

134
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,583
When the concept
for "people" disappears,

135
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,666
we'll no longer even
perceive each other.

136

We'll cease to exist in the eyes

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,916
She was just here a second ago.

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,375
Now she's gone.
Where--Where is she?

162
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,583
[HAYATO]
Hang in there!

163
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,958
Hayato, is that you?

164
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,333
[HAYATO] Akira's got this.
The world's in his hands!

165
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,541
Believe in him. He's fighting
to save us all!

166
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,416
We're not all that
different, he and I.

167
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,666
I became a politician,
he became a savior.

168
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,000
We wanted to change things.

169
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,708
Whatever I stand
to lose doesn't matter.

170
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,291
So long as there's
a shred of hope,

171
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,416
I have to go on fighting
for the good of mankind!

172
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,750
The same
holds true for all of us!

173
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,958
Milkman, is that--
is that you?

174
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,166
[HAYATO]
Our hopes. Our dreams.

175
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,250
If we cling to them, there's a
chance of turning this around!

176
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:37,500
[AKIRA] I'm not about
to let go! For I am...!

177
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,125
[HAYATO] Actually, the
world's in all our hands.

178
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,000
Each and every
one of us is a beacon!

[M.J.B.K. 13A]

It isn't over!

181
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,125
I am... the savior!

182
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,708
[HAYATO] Yes! We all are!
Even in our darkest hour.

183
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,125
Something deep within us
continues to shine!

184
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,041
[AKIRA]
Damn right.

185

Heh. Well, lookie there.

186
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,041
[HAYATO]
That's reality.

187
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,625
Ours is the light that gives
the world its substance!

188
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,875
This is the word!

189
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,625
Ours is the voice!

I hear them. Do you?

Our friends won't be silenced.

Never. They're way too strong
and together unstoppable.

Words imprison the mind.

And let's be honest.

With or without language you've
never truly connected to anyone.

How lonely you
must've been. I'm sorry.

You know what
the real problem is?

You blame the world
for your own weakness.

Language might be
a prison for you,

They use it to express
themselves, reach out.

Maybe we didn't
carve the path,

00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,125
[MAIA] Grow up.
That's not how it works.

318
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,750
You barely know who I am.

319
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,291
You've never really
seen me as a human being.

320
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,833
All you see is
a projection of yourself.

321
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,125
[SUBETE gasps shakily]

322
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,458
[MAIA] You might as well have
been looking into a mirror.

323
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,333
I'm a fantasy
for all these years,

324
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,500
just something
to put on a pedestal.

325
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,208
Something you wanted to be.

326
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,541
[SUBETE]
No. That's not true.

327
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,000
[MAIA] You're not
the person I used to know.

328
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:45,208
The boy who saved me all those
years ago in the moonlight.

329
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,666
He's long gone.

330
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,833
[gasps]

331
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,333
[rumbling]

332
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,791
[SOUGON groans]

333
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,958
This is futile.

334
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:02,166
Living by your own will,
cannot bring salvation.

335
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,333
--[SUBETE] Father!
--[AKIRA] Let's go.

336
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,000
[MAIA]
What? We can't just--

337
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,708
--[SUBETE] Father!
--[SOUGON] Akira.

338
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,375
--[SUBETE] Father!
--[SOUGON] Of course.

339
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,958
I remember.

340
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,541
[MAIA]
Master Sougon! Subete!

341
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,250
[screams]
No!

342
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,958
[CROWD chatters]

343
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,875
Huh, okay.
That's kinda strange.

344
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,458
Was I surrounded by darkness?

345
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,208
We defeated the M.J.B.K.

346
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,583
The concepts that were lost
have been restored.

347
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,583
[SHOKO]
That means we won, right?

348
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:46,541
[CROWD gasping]

349
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,875
Karan.

350
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,916
[OPERATORS gasp]

351
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,958
[ALL panting]

352
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,583
Hey! You kids okay?

353
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,791
Wait, where'd
Maia and Akira go?

354
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,291
[HAYATO] Iwagami,
put them onscreen!

355
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,458
[SHOKO]
Uh, right!

356
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,916
[beeping]

357
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,916
[ALL gasp]

358
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,000
[HAYATO]
Look!

359
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,416
All right!

360
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,083
[TSUTOMU]
Woo hoo!

361
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,958
[KOKONE]
What a ruh relief.

362
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,625
[SAKURAKO]
We actually did it.

363
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,708
Without having to play
our forbidden trump card.

364
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,416
You holdin' up okay?

365
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,875
[MAIA]
Yeah, I think.

366
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,791
[AKIRA] We can
talk later if you want.

367
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:30,375
For now, there's really
only one thing to say.

368
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,375
What's that?

369
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,541
One, two.

370
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,041
[ALL]
Welcome home!

371
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:44,125
[gasps]

372
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,416
[AKIRA]
We're back.

373
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,833
[MAIA]
Yeah! They know!

374
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,041
[SHOKO, KARAN, HAYATO, TSUTOMU,
SAKURAKO, KENTO laugh]

375
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,208
[chuckles]

376
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,958
[NESTA] Good to
have you back, legend.

377
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:28,916
[TSUTOMU] I notice
you haven't been drinking

378
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,083
much milk lately, Milkman.

379
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,375
[HAYATO] Will you
stop calling me that?

380
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,833
[AKIRA] What's the matter?
It's good for you.

381
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,208
You got something
against nutrition?

382
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,625
[HAYATO]
Not you, too! Cut it out!

383
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,208
[TSUTOMU]
Love the sarcasm, Savior Boy!

384
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,250
Good to see you loosen up
after the fighting's done!

385
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,666
[HAYATO]
Next: Episode Fourteen.

386
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,250
[TSUTOMU] "Show It!
You at Your Worst!"

387
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,208
[TSUTOMU] Yeah, we've still got
a lot more to get through.

388
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,541
[HAYATO]
It's not over just yet.

389
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,000
[AKIRA]
What's not?
