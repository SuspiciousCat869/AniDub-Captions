00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,208
[KENTO]
The Vectors we've used until now

198
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,333
were assembled using modern
technology and resources

199
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,958
based on blueprints
dug up in ancient ruins.

200
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,916
However, this "final
Vector" I mentioned,

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,083
that's a whole different beast.

202
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,708
You see, deep within the ruins
of the writing culture,

203
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,666
it was enshrined at some
kind of central altar.

204
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,583
It was as though the Vector
had been sealed away,

205
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,625
as though even approaching
it was taboo.

206
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,750
And emblazoned on the
walls were these words,

207
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,791
"Destroyer of Legends."

And now it's at our Saigon Base?

00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,375
What we managed to
salvage of it is,

210
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,458
but we could hardly
have called it a success.

211
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:36,208
No matter how we tuned it, the
machine never once activated.

212
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,708
To make matters worse,

213
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,625
there were rumors that some
mysterious magical energy

214
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,958
was hidden inside it.

215
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,666
During one activation attempt,

216
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,166
every engineer and
test pilot involved,

217

on the restoration project,

218

Why isn't it working?

312
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,666
We Merged, but my
cockpit hasn't changed.

313
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,208
[SAN]
I will consume all.

314
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:25,583
I will consume all. Devour all.

315
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,833
[KENTO whimpers]

316
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,000
[SHOKO]
I don't get what's happening.

317
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,708
It's swallowing 'em. The
M.J.B.K. and its words.

318
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,958
Oh man, this is
just like when...

319
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,500
I understand now.

320
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,125
Why the Monument
worked as a counter

321
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,833
to the Book of Verbalism.

322
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,875
[SAKURAKO] It's because it's
an entity that devours words,

323
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,541
concept and all.

324
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,375
It needs them.

325
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,916
[KENTO]
So then--

326
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,208
[SAKURAKO] The M.J.B.K.s and
the Monument are similar beings.

327
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,958
[SUBETE] Having touched
his voice, I understand.

328
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:13,625
Savior. That word has lost all
meaning or reason for Akira.

329
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,000
And without a true
sense of purpose,

330
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,583
he's driven only by instinct
telling him he must become

331
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,708
what he can no
longer believe in.

332
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:26,500
Because saving things is the
only way he knows he exists.

333
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,333
One day, he will realize
there's no one left to save.

334
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:36,000
He destroyed them all because he
decided they were his enemies.

335
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:42,541
[SUBETE] And so, he will
continue seeking new enemies.

336
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,333
All that lies at the end
of his path is ruin.

337
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,791
Word corrosion rate
is rising rapidly!

338
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,166
It's already exceeded 80%!

339
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,750
[SAKURAKO]
That Aquarion is consuming

340
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,875
the M.J.B.K.'s
word and concepts.

341
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,125
There might as well be

342
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,875
two M.J.B.K.s fighting
each other out there!

343
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,458
So does that mean Akira's
turned into an M.J.B.K.?

344
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:08,416
[AKIRA panting]

345
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,250
Enemy. I will strike you down!

346
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,708
Akira, stop this! Our friends
are still trapped inside!

347
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,416
Enemies! Not friends!

348
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,875
Not even people! Enemies!

349
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,291
Akira!

350
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,541
[gasps]

351
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,958
I am the Savior.

352
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,041
And I will save the world.

353
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:40,083
Enemies. That's us. Enemies!

354
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,250
[gasps]

355
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,083
Damn it, Akira, stop!

356
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,750
What is she doing?

357
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,333
Maia, get out of there!

358
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,250
[MAIA]
Save me!

359
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,625
[M.J.B.K.]
Techi!

360
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,166
[MAIA gasps]

361
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,000
I admit it. I did all
I could to seek out enemies.

362
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,916
But that.... that
is not who I am.

363
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:30,958
[M.J.B.K.]
Enemy. Teki!

364
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,000
[AKIRA]
What I am is a Savior!

365
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,791
Now, Maia! Come!

366
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay!

367
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,666
[AKIRA] Even if there's
nothing at the end of it all,

368
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,333
I'll keep right on
doing what I do.

369
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,583
As long and as far as I can.

370
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,000
[MAIA]
Yes, as far as we can!

371
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,041
[BOTH]
Into infinity.

372
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:05,208
[BOTH]
Fist of Unending Salvation!

373
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:22,625
[M.J.B.K.]
Teki. Enemy. Enemy! Teki!

374
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,625
[HAYATO]
What were we just doing?

375
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,458
[KOKONE, KARAN gasp]

376
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,583
[SUBETE]
Heh. Oh, I love it.

377
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,458
Now, Nesta. Preparations.

378
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,125
Preparations?

379
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,625
[SUBETE] To destroy
the world he would save,

380
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,583
I must awaken Aquarion Logos.

381
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,083
[KOKONE] Our next reading
theater performance!

382
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,500
[TSUTOMU]
I'm playin' an old lady again?

383
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:22,791
[HAYATO] You want me to
learn all of these lines

384
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,083
in time for the school festival?

385
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,625
Between that, seminar,
debate club,

386
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,458
and work for the senator,
when will I sleep?

387
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,833
Is the manager a total sadist?

388
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,291
[TSUTOMU]
But you read 'em so smooth!

389
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,333
[KOKONE]
Wish I could do that!

390
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,416
[HAYATO]
Give it a rest.

391
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
[KOKONE]
Episode 18.

"Howl! An Honest Beaten Dog."

394

Mucho tsundere!
