00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,041
[SAKURAKO]
I've already registered you

2
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,875
into our database.

3
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,125
So you are now an official
member of the Verbalism Club.

4
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,333
[SOUGON] It is my will
that you remain there.

5
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,708
Monitor the pilot of
the red vector closely.

6
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,000
[gasps]

7
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,500
[SAKURAKO] I also have
some pretty cool new gear

8
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,041
to outfit you guys with.

9
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,416
[TSUTOMU]
What're those?

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,291
[SAKURAKO] Portable,
personal communication terminals

11
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,250
developed by DEAVA.

12
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,041
Even in areas affected by
an M.J.B.K., these allow us

13
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,666
to stay in contact over
independent channels.

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,875
We call them. Aquariphones.

15
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,666
Huh? Aquari-what-now?

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,583
Aquariphones.

17
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,750
Uhh, you're n-not
turning yours on?

18
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,250
I'm not using it right now.

19
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,041
Oh come on, man.

20
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,583
Are you serious?

21
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,833
If you don't turn it on, we
won't be able to contact you!

22
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,625
Yeah, I guess not.

23
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:39,041
[gasps] Buh... But Akira.
D-Does that mean...

24
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,791
[ALL THREE]
You don't have any friends?

25
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,041
Question. Does this
Aquariphone pack any lasers,

26
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,125
knock out gas,
or other lethal tricks?

27
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,791
None at all! Honestly,
this girl's no better.

28
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:53,875
Back off!

29
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,916
It isn't Maia's
fault she's like that.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,708
She's been cooped up
by this Sougon creep

31
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,125
since she was a little girl!

32
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,666
I mean, that old bastard
wouldn't even let

33
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,916
the poor kid go outside.
Ain't that right?

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,541
Yes. I suppose.

35
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,541
But at long last,
her eyes have been opened,

36
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,166
and she has now joined
our epic struggle for justice!

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,416
Ah, the feels! The feels!

38
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,916
Hey! Always remember,
I've got your back!

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,958
Great. Thanks a lot.

40
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,333
[SAKURAKO]
One more thing.

41
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,083
[FEMALE VOICE]
Salutations!

42
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,166
Our group keeps growing.

43
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,166
We have another new member

44
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,583
ready to join the
Verbalism Club!

45
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,791
Hello, everyone!
I'm Karan Uminagi!

46
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,041
And I have a dream to
keep all of our spirits up

47
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,500
by becoming the next pop idol!

48
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,708
[giggles]

49
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,250
[SOUGON]
In times past,

50
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,333
humanity was at one
with the world of truth.

51
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,500
But the written word,
for all we prospered from it,

52
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,333
wrought incalculable suffering.

53
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,083
[TSUTOMU] "I speak for
the rest of the little pigs.

54
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,833
Our one desire is
to build sturdy houses

55
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,625
that will stand strong
even against a big bad wolf."

56
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,208
"I understand.

57
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,708
But this lake means everything
to my dear swan sisters and I."

58
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,750
"That's why we ask you to leave.

59
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,333
But have no fear..."

60
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,500
What is this?

61
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,375
It's a rehearsal for
our Reading Theatre.

62
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,000
They're just running
through their lines.

63
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,250
This is a story we call

64
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,208
"The Three Little Pigs
Relocate to Swan Lake."

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,583
A Shirobaco Original Production!

66
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,416
Shirobaco isn't just a café.

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,333
It's also a place for the
Verbalism Club to perform!

68
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,291
We do dramatic readings,
full on plays,

69
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,541
even the occasional
mini concert.

70
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,083
In fact, we have
regular customers

71
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,791
who come in just to
check out our shows!

72

"You've slowed down
our operations enough!

73
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,625
Now beat it!"

74
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,833
Hang on, bro!

75
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,000
We're not even done
with the exposition yet!

76
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,083
Performing for an
audience is necessary.

77
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,125
It helps develop
our Verbalism Ability.

78
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,333
It brings out the true
power of the written word.

79
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,041
which in turn, enhances
our combat capabilities.

80
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,250
I can't think of a better
excuse for hosting Club events!

81
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,375
[SHOKO] I think you've seen
just about everything we've got.

82
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,250
But I can't help feeling
something's slipping my mind.

83
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,333
Oh! The hangar bay!

84
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,041
You've probably already been,

85
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,833
but would you like
to go take a look?

86
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,208
I would.

87
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,750
[SHOKO] A brand new Vector
arrived earlier today!

88
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,333
[SAKURAKO]
You can't keep doing that!

89
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,833
I told you no pictures!

90
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,833
[RANKO] Don't be such
a stick in the mud!

91
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,666
Okay, Karan, break
out your next pose!

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,791
[KARAN]
You got it!

93
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:52,833
[RANKO]
Now mix it up.

94
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,916
Give me a brighter smile!

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,208
Okay!

96
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,916
Did I not just ask you to stop?

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,708
[SHOKO] Excuse me.
Uh, ma'am? Who's this?

98
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,541
What's wrong? We have
a contract, don't we?

99
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,208
[SAKURAKO]
That's not the point at all!

100
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,083
Huh? She's trying to market
her daughter as a pop idol.

101
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,625
And that's the only reason
she let her join the Club?

102
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,708
[SHOKO]
At the moment, our existence

103
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,750
remains a secret
to the general public.

104
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,750
But the manager said she
plans to disclose everything

105
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,000
about DEAVA's operations
once the threat has passed.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,083
When that happens,

107
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,625
Karan will be mentioned
in the interviews.

108
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,125
So the plan is to
really push her career

109
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,625
from that point onwards.

110
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,208
Everyone'll love the pop idol
who helped save the world.

111
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,625
That's actually a
shockingly good idea!

112
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,083
So those pictures they took

113
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,541
were like an early
promotional photo shoot?

114
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,791
That makes sense.

115
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,625
The whole thing's
fairly complicated.

116
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,000
But we were the
ones who reached out

117
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,041
to Karan after discovering
her Verbalism Ability.

118
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,625
Yeah, I guess that's legit.

119
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,333
Everyone else joined
the Verbalism Club

120
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,791
to chase down their
dreams, what's one more?

121
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,000
Your dreams?

122
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,333
Y-Yes.

123
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,541
K-Karan is here for
the same reason we all are,

124
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,875
to h-hone our skills.

125
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,916
W-We all dream of
using our v-voices.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,416
Like m'boy Hayato here,

127
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,666
who wants to be remembered
for kick-ass political speeches!

128
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,416
Though, it is weird he uses his
gift to power a campaign car.

129
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,625
They let me borrow it

130
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,416
free of charge outside
the election period.

131
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,250
So I can't complain.

132
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,375
[MAIA]
Here, sorry it took so long.

133
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,875
[TSUTOMU]
What are you doing, Maia?

134
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,791
As of today, someone's
gonna start working

135
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,291
for her room and board.

136
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,500
It's a great privilege
to work with you.

137
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,333
I doubt that's a good idea.

138
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,166
Nobody asked for
your opinion, imbecile!

139
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,125
'Scuse me, Shoko!
I'll take the usual.

140
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,125
Sure! Coming right up!

141
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:37,333
Sorry for the wait! Shirobaco's
special: The Redeye Latte.

142
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,375
Awww! Poor guy!
Your eyes are all red!

143
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,833
I bet you were up
all night working again!

144
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,333
[TANAKA]
Is it that obvious?

145
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,000
[SHOKO] There. Drink this,
and it should perk you right up!

146
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,500
[giggles]

147
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,458
[TSUTOMU] Well, Maia?
Think you could do that?

148
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,875
[MAIA] I have committed
the manual to memory so yes.

149
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:56,916
[TSUTOMU]
Cool!

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,416
Then I'll have
a Redeye Latte, too.

151
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,250
[MAIA]
Sorry for the wait.

152
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,416
Shirobaco's special:
The Redeye Latte.

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,750
[TSUTOMU]
Huh?

154
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,750
Poor individual.

155
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,291
Looks like your
eyes are all red.

156
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,291
[TSUTOMU] Uh. Wait.
I don't think this is right!

157
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,125
Were you up
all night working again?

158
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,041

People at auditions say
I have a nice smile!

So you smile to be told
how nice your smile is?

Maybe that's why
it seems so fake.

There's one problem.

He's right we're
missing something.

A shimmering,
perfect top idol beauty!

I must become an idol.

I'll stand on the stage,
and sing for all the world!

An idol.

See for yourself.

Huh? But...!

Guess what, Momma.
I knew that already.

00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:02,000
I knew it was never my dream
you wanted to bring to life.

366
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,750
It was always your own.

[RANKO]
Karan. But you...

368

[KARAN] You're the one who
wants to be an idol, Mom.

369
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,791
It had nothing to do
with what I wanted.

370
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,708
But because you couldn't do it.

371
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,833
You passed your dream on to me!

that happened with Akira.

[SAKURAKO]
Indeed she did.

to be said is given voice

at the right time.

387

It bestows power onto the
word and can alter reality.

The perfect time.
The perfect place.

Dreams are ephemeral things.

Which is why we have to
be ready to risk everything

for that one fleeting
moment and then unleash it.

For the man who
created the M.J.B.K.

that was just destroyed, you're
taking things awfully well.

Don't call me that!

"create" M.J.B.K.'s.

Just the ampules.

The things that make
the kanji go mega-mutated.

[SUBETE] If you have time,
I could use help.

There's something
I'd like to create.

serious than usual.

Of course I've gotten serious.
