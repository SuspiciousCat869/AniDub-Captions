Duh! They're true justice!

162
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,125
Justice? Is that so?

163
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,916
[TSUTOMU]
You're a bikini man?

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,416
Who can blame ya? Me, too!

165
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,166
[SAKURAKO sighs]

166
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,625
[HAYATO]
This is stupid.

167
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,000
[SHOKO]
You can say anything.

168
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,833
So long as you use the
kanji radical for clothing!

169
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,291
Sleeves!

170
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,041
Hakama!

171
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,291
Nudity!

172
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,458
What's radical clothing
got to do with it?

173
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,583
[MAIA, KOKONE, SHOKO giggle]

174
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
[KOKONE] This is the
radical for clothing.

175
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,958
This one's too hard.
Let's do something easier.

176
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,583
You'll never beat an M.J.B.K.
with an attitude like that!

177
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,125
How's that considered training?

178
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,458
It sh-sharpens our
critical thinking.

179
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,166
Someone's gettin'
some kanji homework

180
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,583
when we head back!

181
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,833
Huh?! No thanks. I'll just
use my Verbalism Ability!

182
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,125
Uh-huh.

183
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,333
Maybe we should put
that ability to the test!

184
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,000
Now stand up, face the
sea, look deep inside,

185
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,083
and shout out the name
of the one you love!

186
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,416
[KARAN]
What for?

187
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,250
[SHOKO] Verbalism is all
about harnessing the power

188
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,875
that lays dormant in kanji!

189
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,333
Which means if you want
the absolute best results,

190
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,041
it only makes sense
for you to choose a word

191
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,916
you can put some
extra "oomph" into!

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,666
In fact, all three of you
should give it a shot!

193
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,833
And, if we're lucky,
we might even

194
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,375
see some sparks fly!

195
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,250
[MAIA]
Master Sougon!

196
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,791
If I yelled Master's
name at the ocean,

197
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,375
they'd realize I was a spy.

198
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,458
I nearly fell into
her ingenious trap.

199
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,125
Well played, Shoko.

200
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,125
You'll do it, too, won't ya?

201
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,541
Unfortunately, I don't
have Verbalism Ability,

202
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,666
so it would be pointless.
But never mind all that.

203
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,958
You try!

204
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,958
[KARAN] I don't feel
that way about anyone!

205
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,958
[SHOKO]
Oh, come on, are you sure?

206
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,500
Ah! Maybe someone from
back at the Club?

207
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,583
[KARAN]
Uh...

208
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,750
My mother...?

209
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,625
[KOKONE, MAIA, SHOKO]
Huh?

210
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,458
I said it! I'm done!

211
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,500
One more time, louder!

212
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,375
I don't wanna!

213
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,708
[SHOKO]
Ta-dah!

214

215
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,916
What, is that all?

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,166
There a problem?

217
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,416
Why are you getting
offended, Maia?

218

Thank you for the food!

00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,416
Oh, wow!

221
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,958
So, why are you even
involved with DEAVA?

222
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,208
I was originally
scouted out because

223
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,625
they thought I might have
Verbalism Ability, but--

224
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,916
We have the results
from your second exam.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,791
I'm afraid it shows
conclusively you have

226
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,291
no aptitude for the gift.

227
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,458
[gasps]

228
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,708
I'm very sorry.

229
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,333
But to your credit,
making it this far

230
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,375
without it is impressive.

231
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,583
Doesn't matter.

232
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,750
There's got to be
something else I can do.

233
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,583
Let me help!

234
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,000
I started working at Shirobaco

235
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,041
as a part time
waitress that day.

236
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,833
Before long, I was an operator.

237
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,750
So the part time job came first?

238
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,916
As for me.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,666
I didn't even know
there was a cr-crisis

240
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,125
until the M.J.B.K.'s
started running wild.

241
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,083
But Sh-Shoko was already
on board, at that point!

242
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,041
Yeah, for all the good I did.

243
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,916
You're our Ace in
the Hole, Kokone.

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
[gasps]

245
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,958
[SHOKO]
And of course, you, too, Maia.

246
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,166
[KARAN]
What about me?

247
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,000
[SHOKO] You still need
to study your kanji!

248
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,208
[KARAN]
Not this again!

249
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,666
C-Can't sleep?

250
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,416
No.

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,041
[KOKONE]
I d-didn't join up with DEAVA

252
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,541
to s-save the world.

253

need t-to do something

255
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:35,750
about the M.J.B.K.'s, and
I'm g-glad we fight them.

256
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,625
But I want to be an actress.

257
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,916
Th-That's the real
reason I joined.

258
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,333
I know I may not
seem c-cut out for it.

259
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,250
[MAIA]
An actress?

260
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,708
I'm tr-training my voice.

261
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,208
Honing its power. M-Maybe
that way... my dream...

...will c-come true. I h-hope.

And you, M-Maia?

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,291
What made you decide to stay

and f-fight alongside
p-perfect strangers?

Monitor Akira Kaibuki.

There's been no further
word since Master Sougon

270
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,958
gave me that order.

271
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,458
And to that end, I fight
alongside the enemy.

272
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,958
Is that what he'd
have wanted me to do?

273
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,708
I don't know.

to do with Akira?

Why do you keep trying
to get close to Akira?

more than all the others.
Just like in our last battle.

cared about performing

477
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,041
I wish I could have gone, too!

478
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,500
You should keep
the school swimsuit

479
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,583
limited to use at Shirobaco.

480
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,083
S-S-School swimsuit?

481
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,458
Nothing for you to worry about.

482
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,125
Next episode, I'm gonna
give it everything I've got!

483
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,208
[KOKONE] M-Manager's finally
entering the battle?

484
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,291
[AKIRA]
Episode Six!

485
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,625
[SAKURAKO]
"Light up! Your Strength!"

486
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,333
[AKIRA] One more thing.
Gym shorts are off limits.

487
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,000
Fine, I won't wear 'em.
