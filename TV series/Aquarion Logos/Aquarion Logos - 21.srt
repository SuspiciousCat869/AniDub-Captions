I'm sorry,
but I have my orders.

17
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,416
[IWAGAMI] It is the official
stance of this government

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,666
that DEAVA represents
a clear and present threat.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,083
They are the enemy.

20

Whereas in Nesta,
Japan has a staunch friend.

21

DEAVA will be dismantled.

24
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,041
If after uncovering it he'd
gone straight to this country's

25
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,958

my father would have

26

turned the tide in
his favor from the outset.

I will beat Akira.

If his one true desire is
to save the world, well...

36
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,666
I shall be the one to end it.

Only a first step,
rest assured.

Destroying the very
culture of written language?

That requires Aquarion Logos.

to wield my power.

I'm almost moved to pity.

An artificial body like
this could never contain me.

It's far too unstable
to be a proper vessel.

At least, like this.

On the other hand,
raising her power to my level

278
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,791
would make her the perfect
repository for my essence.

yourself quite so much.

I'll die if it lets you
save the world!

It's your only chance! Do it!

Are you out of your mind?

298
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,000
You seem worried.

299
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,458
Is it because in a physical body
you can actually be killed?

300
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,833
You whore! This was your plan?

301
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,083
None of us will walk away
from this unscathed,

302
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,791
not even you.

303
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,291
You're a puppet! Nothing more!

b-buy us some time.

Don't falter, Akira!

We're running out of time.

It's all I can do to keep
her trapped inside me!

323
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,333
[AKIRA gasps]

324
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,333
If we wait any longer,
more people will die.

325
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,666
[AKIRA] I...
I'll save the entire world!

326
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,250
Including you!

327
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,083
That's not possible.

328
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,125
Well I don't believe that!

329
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,333
Please, Akira.

330
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,333
If you end this,
you'll never have to fly

331
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,333
another Vector again, I swear.

332
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,958
You... You won't
have to disappear!

333
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,666
I'm begging you! Please!

334
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,791
[MAIA] If the alternative
is forgetting you,

335
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,750
then I'd honestly
rather be dead.

336
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,333
Do this for me.

337
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,958
[AKIRA]
Don't give in to that bullshit!

338
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:07,333
[AKIRA growling]

339
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,958
[MAIA]
Damn it, Akira!

340
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,833
[crying]

341
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,125
It's too late to save me,

342
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,083
but you can still
save everyone else!

343
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:27,166
I can't. I don't have it in me.
I'm not a savior.

344
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,458
Akira...

345
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,833
[NESTA]
It's over.

346
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,833
[SHOKO]
No!

347
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,083
It's n-not gonna work.

348
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,083
[TSUTOMU] Now why you gotta
go and make my woman cry?

349
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,541
[KOKONE gasps]
Ts-Tsutomu?

350
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,083
[M.J.B.K. laughing]

351
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:15,166
[TSUTOMU]
Come on, Hayato. Akira.

352
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,083
Think it's time we merged.

353
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,583
Genesis Merge!

354
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,125
Roar, Aquarion!

355
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,250
[TSUTOMU] Dude. That look
on your face has gotta go.

356
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,166
[TSUTOMU] I mean,
I know there's nothing fun

357
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,333
about what's happening
right now, but damn.

358
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,958
[SHOKO]
Tsutomu!

359
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,791
[TSUTOMU]
We have to laugh, man.

360
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,958
Especially in times like this.

361
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,916
That's the
Comedian's Philosophy!

362
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,750
I'm gonna bring 'em back.

363
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,041
Every smile in the world.

364
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,375
Tsutomu. Thank you.

365
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,000
[M.J.B.K. laughing]

366
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,458
[TSUTOMU, AKIRA, HAYATO]
Amaterasu!

367
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,416
[M.J.B.K. laughing]

368
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,208
[MAIA] This light is
so... bright. Beautiful.

369
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,166
It gives me strength.

370
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,583
This goes no further.

371
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,708
[NESTA]
Impossible!

372
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:08,333
[TSUTOMU] I wonder...
Was I able to make Shoko smile?

373
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:12,041
Seriously.
Girl's got a fantastic one.

374
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,500
I love it.

375
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,708
He did it!

376
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,208
Tsutomu, you beautiful
bastard, you did it!

377
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:29,541
[KARAN, KOKONE sobbing]

378
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,125
Damn it.

379
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,208
You said...

380
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,208
You were gonna
bring the smiles back.

381
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:41,000
Where's mine?
Where's my smile?

382
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:47,541
[SHOKO sobbing]

383
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,958
[KARAN] I just got a gig
for a bonsai-growing show!

384
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,125
[KOKONE]
That's awesome!

385
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,375
[HAYATO]
I may not know how pop idols

386
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,833
normally do it, Karan,
but something tells me

387
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,583
a late-night program
aimed at old people

388
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,541
won't exactly be
your ticket to fame.

389
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,541
[KARAN] I'm trying to reach as
wide an audience as possible,

390
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,250
not just you!

391
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,583
[HAYATO]
Episode 22.

392
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,666
[KOKONE] "Listen! The Voice
Calling Out to You."

393
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,291
I can r-reach out, too!
