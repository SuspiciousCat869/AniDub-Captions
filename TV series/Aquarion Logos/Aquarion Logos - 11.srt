Huh.

[HAYATO]
Kaibuki?

4
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,666
Well I'm at Shirobaco
and Akira's not.

5
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,708
He's not answering
his his cell, either.

6
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,708
So what about you,
heard anything?

7
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,833
[HAYATO] No. But why
are you asking me?

8
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,416
[TSUTOMU]
Cuz everyone else is here!

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
For all I know, you could
be going out for drinks

10
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,500
with the rest
of the political drones.

11
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,375
You left me out,
but it's your loss:

12
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,125
I'm internet famous.

13
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,458
Uh huh. Remember,
this line is supposed to be

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,791
for emergencies only. Goodbye.

15
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,250
[TSUTOMU]
Hold on, bro--

16
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,500
[SHOKO]
Let me get this straight.

17
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,583
They won't be speaking at all?

18
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,166
[SAKURAKO]
Avant garde, am I right?

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,208
True art is a perpetually
evolving ani-meow-l.

20
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,583
Is this some
new training style

21
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,583
to hone their Verbalism
Ability without letting them

22
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,791
rely on actual vocalization?

23
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,750
Wow. Sounds tons more
valid than the excuses

24
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,708
I came up with!

25
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,375
I don't know if you've
noticed it, sir,

26
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,625
but Kujyo's seemed
kind of down lately.

27
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,958
He's always been
too serious for his own good.

28
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,125
But, maybe he's having
problems outside the office?

29
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,291
[keyboard keys clicking]

30
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,875
[SOUGON] In times past,
humanity was at one

31
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,750
with the world of truth,

32
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,833
but the written word,
for all we prospered from it,

33
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,333
wrought incalculable suffering.

34
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,708
[HAYASHI] Repairs and
upgrades on the Vector

35
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,000
are nearly complete.
Its ability to link

36
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,708
with an M.J.B.K.
has been improved as well.

37
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,958
Is it 100% safe?

38
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,583
Well. There are no absolutes,

39
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,875
even when it
comes to machines.

40
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,791
You listening?

41
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,833
[SOUGON]
Hm?

42
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,000
What is this?
Something writhing.

43
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,291
[HAYASHI]
Hello?

44
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,833
[sighs]

45
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,291
Another word
is being distorted?

46
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,541
So it's "whirl" this time.

47
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,208
This one's different
from the others.

48
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,541
It's giving off
strange readings.

49
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:15,500
[SOUGON] It's trying to be born
from within a whirling vortex.

50
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,875
[HAYASHI]
Born?

51
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,625
Have the keys all
gathered as was foretold?

52
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,791
Perhaps that is its message.

53
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,416
It's beginning to move.

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,666
The mighty word
which will come to save us

55
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,708
from the concepts
ensnaring mankind.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So, uh...
you collect paper?

57
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,583
[HAYATO] It's a proposal
for an operation I've devised.

58
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,000
I felt we should prepare
for the unexpected.

59
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,583
And thus, considered
countermeasures

60
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,625
for all possible occurrences.

61
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,000
Myew wrote this
all by yourself?

62
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,166
[HAYATO] I'd appreciate
you giving this

63
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,708
a read through by tomorrow.

64
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,833
Eeh?

65
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,375
Uh. I'm grateful,
don't get me wrong,

66
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,041
but aren't you pushing
yourself a tad too hard?

67
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,125
[HAYATO] The only reason
I joined the Verbalism Club

68
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,708
was to train my voice
to be the best it could be.

69
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,208
Because I believed doing so

70
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,875
would come to my advantage
as a politician.

71
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,250
Yes, I know that.

72
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,708
[HAYATO]
But, now that the M.J.B.K.s

73
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,291
have become an actual threat,

74
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,750
I refuse to be lax
in my response.

75
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,791
This is a battle
for the fate of our world.

76
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,583
Has the gravity of that
hit you yet, Iwagami?

77
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,791
Why you askin' me?
I know what's at stake.

78
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,791
[HAYATO] In order to reliably
neutralize M.J.B.K.s,

79
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,708
it logically follows
that we should devise

80
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,750
the best possible responses.
Am I wrong?

81
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,958
[SAKURAKO] I think
we all know you're not.

82
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,250
[SHOKO] But things have worked
out okay for us so far.

83
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,958
Why fix what's not broken?

84
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,666
[HAYATO] There's no
guarantee that will continue

85
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,791
to be the case.

86
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,500
Except when Akira
shows up and manages

87
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,083
to set things right.

88
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,833
So you're fine
pinning your hopes on him?

89
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,541
A single man?

90
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,458
That's not fair.

91
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,333
[TSUTOMU] So, you bought
a brand new brush, huh?

92
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,375
[KOKONE] Th-That's why you went
to Sh-Shinjuku yesterday?

93
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,958
To b-buy a brush?

94
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,541
[AKIRA] Yes. The craftsman who
made it is highly skilled,

95
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,750
but his only store
is in Shinjuku.

96
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,875
[TSUTOMU] Look, it's fine
to go out shopping and all,

97
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,416
but at least
let us know first, bro!

98
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,000
I wrote a note.

99
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,291
[DELIVERYMAN 11A] Special
delivery for Shirobaco!

100
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,791
Thank you.

101
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,583
[AKIRA]
See?

102
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,750
[TSUTOMU] You couldn't
just tape it to the fridge

103
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,083
like a normal person?

104
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,791
[KOKONE] Akira? C-Can you
use a phone next time?

105
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,541
[MAIA] Does the brush you use
really matter that much?

106
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,375
[AKIRA] Of course.
A good brush will write

107
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,083
exactly what
you want to express.

108
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,916
For the characters
to have meaning,

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,791
you have to write
without hesitation.

110
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,375
To be at one with their intent.

111
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,541
[grunts lightly]

112
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,875
[KARAN] Think you've
got enough of those?

113
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,083
[AKIRA]
I'm trying the brush out.

114
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,750
[TSUTOMU] How much
testing does it need?

115
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,458
[KARAN] Oh hey,
I'm gonna keep one of 'em.

116
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,083
maybe it'll work
like a good luck charm!

117
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,625
[TSUTOMU] Yeah, why not?
Hang on to one of those babies.

118
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,875
Just looking at it could give
you Akira-like confidence

119
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,458
in your Verbalism Ability!

120
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,791
[KOKONE]
Huh?! Um...

121
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,875
That's excessive.

122
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,166
Aah.

123
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,625
[KARAN] Ah! Oh hey, Hayato!
Check these out!

124
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,541
--[HAYATO sighs]
--[AKIRA] What's wrong?

125
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,208
I have to leave early.

126
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,083
I have an appointment
with Mister Hatano later.

127
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,666
[TSUTOMU]
Uh. Hey!

128
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,833
That was strange.

129
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,833
[SUBETE]
Happy birthday.

130
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,916
Another birthday celebration.

131
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,541
But there's nothing
from Dad. Again.

132
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,791
[SUBETE gasps]

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,958
[inhales, exhales deeply]

134
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,208
What was that?

135
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,416
Hayashi! Where are you?

136
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,416
[SUBETE]
Father?

137
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,666
Listen to me.
I just had a vision.

138
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,458
And there's something
enormous headed our way.

139
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,250
[SOUGON]
Hmmm.

140
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,791
Resonance, eh? Doesn't matter.

141
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,625
He was bound
to find out eventually.

142
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,708
The culture of words
is coming to an end.

143
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:13,250
It is inevitable. One need only
remain quiet and watch.

144
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,083
What are you talking about?

145
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,000
[SOUGON]
Do not interfere.

146
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,083
[gasps]

147
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,333
No, I can't just
sit back and watch!

148
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,500
I swore that I'd defeat him
and bring Maia back home.

149
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:28,583
I have to do it. I must.
With my own two hands!

150
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,208
If something's
coming to end it all,

151
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,000
I need to leave
this very moment.

152
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,750
Before it no longer
means anything!

153
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,208
Come forth.

154
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,708
[gasps]

155
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,541
[SUBETE]
What are you doing, father?

156
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,333
[SOUGON] You will stay there
until it is over.

157
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,541
You could never hope to win
against the chosen one.

158
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,333
Not against the man

00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,250
[groans]

161
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,250
The distortion.
It just keeps growing!

162
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,041
[SOUGON] I had hoped
to wait and see

163
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,875
what would be born
of this newest word.

164
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,041
But to keep such a powerful
distortion locked in a cage

165
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,916
would be far too cruel.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,500
The curtains rise on
the First Act. Ruination.

167
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,041
[ITOU] I was a bit worried
about the aftermath

168
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,666
of that online "imbroglio."

169
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,791
But, fortunately, it seems
it was just a passing fad.

170
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,291
Right, Hatano?

171
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,541
I'm sorry for any
concern I caused.

172
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,041
I hope you will
continue to look after

173
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,916
both Kujyo and me
as the years go by.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,375
[HAYATO]
Hm!

175
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,666
You boys can count on me.
I'll rally my support base.

176
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,083
Shouldn't be
too hard to get such a

177
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,000
promising young man elected.

178
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,500
What a politician really needs
is a solid base he can rely on.

179
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,083
[HATANO]
Yes, well.

180
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,208
Your family has been playing the
politics game for generations.

181
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,208
[ITOU] Nothing's as steadfast
as an inherited voter base.

182
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,333
My father,
may he rest in peace,

183
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,291
was a politician too.

184
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,791
[ITOU] Oh was he?
What was his name?

185
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,666
[HAYATO] Hanetaro Kujyo. He was
elected once, eight years ago.

186
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,333
Representing Suginami,
Tokyo's Fourth Ward.

187
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,875
[ITOU]
Just the one term?

188
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,000
[HATANO] He was a classmate of
Foreign Minister Kobayakawa,

189
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,958
if I'm remembering
correctly. At the time,

190
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,625
they were considered
two rising stars

191
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,916
of the political scene.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,250
[ITOU] Kobayakawa.
His meteoric rise was really

193
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,541
quite unprecedented and
he was a truly eloquent man.

194
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,125
His skill with words
was beyond remarkable.

195
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,500
Even if the logic and reasoning
behind his ideas were lacking.

196
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,541
There was something about his
words that could move people.

197
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,000
No logic or reasoning?

198
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,833
My father was the opposite.

199
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,666
He could be
ineloquent, I suppose.

200
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,291
But he worked tirelessly for
ways to build a better future.

201
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,791
He stayed focused
on authoring

202
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,625
sound political policies.

203
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,916
[HATANO] It's true. Hanetaro
worked hard up until

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,333
the day he passed away.
He was a good man.

205
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,541
[ITOU] But he failed to gain
support, and was defeated.

but didn't want to admit it.

accept Kaibuki's methods.

Huh? Is that?

I think that's Foreign
