I can hear his voice.
But what is his name?

I may not remember,
but that voice...

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,375

Society's Achilles' Heel.

12
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,833
Modern man is only
capable of understanding

13
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,708
what can be put into words.

14
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,291
When the Logos World vanishes

15
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,041
and takes written
language with it,

16
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,000
the concepts that define
us will cease to exist.

17
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,666
Civilization will at
last come to an end.

18

[AKIRA]
Give Maia back, you bastard!

[SUBETE]
Over my dead body!

[AKIRA yells]

21
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,375
Seven years ago, the efforts
of Sougon Kenzaki

22
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,291
drew my body from the
Logos World and created you,

23
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,541
a makeshift vessel for
my spiritual essence.

24
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,291
In doing so, he radically
destabilized the balance

25
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,541
between that sphere and
the physical plane.

26
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,791
Balance?

27
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,916
[NESTA] The Logos World
is a fusion of my Self

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,666
and the Aquarion Logos
of ages past.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,041
Remove me from the equation,
even if only in body,

30
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,000
and the delicate
equilibrium unravels.

31
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,125
Consequently, things began to
go awry in the Logos World

32
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,208
and written language became
hopelessly distorted.

33
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,458
Sougon exploited the mockery
kanji had become as a result

34
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,750
and created M.J.B.K's to
further upset the balance.

35
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,583
Of course.

36
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,125
It's your fault.

this would happen.

to go through with it.

Whereas mankind
could touch reality

only through abstraction,

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,041
with their cognitive
crutch kicked away,

103

the line separating "I"
and "Thou" is obliterated.

Harmony is restored.

105
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,166
The discrete consciousness
of each individual

106

gives way to unity.

We begin to see ourselves and
our fellow travelers as One.

Any possibility of that perished
with the invention of writing.

Harmony is a lost cause.

113

Modern man cannot
establish his identity

The sum of your life's work

was to childishly force your

With the Logos World gone,

318
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:15,083
the World of Truth is
accessible to all mankind.

319
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,708
Am I ever gonna get a break?

[PEOPLE screaming]

[SAKURAKO]
Trouble is, as a culture,

322
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,833
for centuries we've only dealt
with Truth in the abstract.

323
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,458
We think in language.

324
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,000
We can't process
reality in the raw.

325
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,833
[KARAN]
Then, you mean...?

326
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,625
[SAKURAKO] I'm afraid so.
We're not out of the woods yet.

327
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:46,000
I hate to say it, but humanity
needs the Logos World.

328
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,750
That settles it.
Aquarion and I will merge.

329
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,125
And together form
a Logos of our own.

[AKIRA, SUBETE gasp]

331
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,083
The original was born
of Nesta's hatred.

332
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,166
But if I can merge
with love in my heart,

333
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,875
then in stands to reason
I can create a new one.

334
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,125
A Logos World founded
on compassion.

335

Maia.

336
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,958
Akira. I'm so grateful to you.

337
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:16,125
I'm just a puppet, but even
with Nesta gone I still exist.

338
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,750
That has to be your doing.

339
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,583
I have feelings for you.

340
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,333
Those feelings
made me human.

341
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,875
When I become the Logos World,

342
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,625
the human part of me will
most likely vanish altogether.

343
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,333
But that's okay. I'm satisfied.

344

[AKIRA]
You're an idiot.

Huh?!

Jeez, of all the times
to sling insults!

I made a promise to save you
and this world, remember?

350
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,833
You're not gonna
sacrifice yourself.

351
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,708
Then how are we supposed--

352
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,125
Let me do it.

353
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,166
I'll become the new Logos World.

makin' this sacrifice!
