[KARAN]
Right!

00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,625
If we make enough
noise, he'll win!

Yeah, c'mon! You've got
this one in the bag!

You're the Savior!

Show him what you can do!

For DEAVA!

I don't know what's going
on, but good luck!

[KARAN]
We believe in you!

him. What the hell?

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,666
[MAIA] It's them. They're
not listening to anybody.

[KOKONE]
Maia! You're all right!

34
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,833
[KARAN]
You had us worried sick!

35
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,208
Glad you made it back.

Thank g-goodness.

Uh, wait a sec.

39
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:11,041
If you're down here, that means,
Akira's piloting Deava alone?

40
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,500
Huh, but then who's at the
controls of the other Aquarion?

41
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,250
You're not gonna believe
this, but Subete.

42
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,666
I thought the M.J.B.K.
was defeated?

43
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,041
Why on earth are they
still up there fighting?

44
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,166
[MAIA] No idea. They didn't
feel the need to explain.

45
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,916
[SAKURAKO]
They just left you behind?

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,125
[MAIA] They're not interested
in saving the world

47
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,458
and they're not duking
it out over me.

48
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,041
Those two are bent on
crushing each other.

[KOKONE]
B-But why?

50

It's your son.
He's becoming a man.

to beat the M.J.B.K., Savior.

Sorry, but... you will
never defeat me!

we should be running away?

Where we supposed to go?

69
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,958
It's pretty spectacular.

00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,250
Yeah, no kidding!
Real life sci fi!

[KENTO]
If this battle's pointless,

72
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,791
shouldn't we be trying to
stop them or something?

73
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,833
I'm not sure. Look.

Hey, are you watching?

[PON]
I am!

76
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,958

It's incredible.

All eyes across the globe
are on this battle.

Everyone is completely riveted.

83
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,708
Their attention
is utterly seized

84
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,916
by the drama unfolding
above them.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,500
So much so, no one has
the least inclination

to think hostile thoughts.

[HAYATO]
Of course.

88
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,250
As long as their focus
is on the battle,

89
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,416
people won't inadvertently
cause the kanji to run amok.

is s-saving the world after all?

Absolutely.

People will remember where
they were on this day.

93

They're writing about it,
even as I speak.

94
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,250
[SAKURAKO] The impetus to
communicate will thrive,

95
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,916
creating a history all its own.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,250
This is how legends
are born. It's beautiful.

threshold of a new era.

After all this time,
I've found my answer.

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,041
I proudly dedicate my life to
protecting the written word,

101
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,875
that our lives my touch
a future beyond our years.

102

will know my voice.

[SUBETE]
Maia was the axis of our fate.

106
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,583
On that moonlit night,
our paths diverged.

107
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,791
How differently our lives
might've played out

108
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,041
had we changed places.

109
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,625
[AKIRA]
So what?

110
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,458
[SUBETE] This is why I can't
stand you, you're so boring.

111
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,916
[AKIRA] You're saying
that's what drives you?

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,875
[SUBETE chuckles]

113
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,208
[SUBETE]
So you do understand.

114
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,791
What a lovely moon.

115
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:49,500
No risk is too great.
No sacrifice too high!

116
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,000
[SUBETE]
I shall strike you down!

117
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,166
Reach him.

118
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,833
My fist is as the sun.

119
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,500
Now, Subete, let's finish this!

Come at me with
everything you've got!

129

Get between me and the
world I promised to save,

130

nothing to end you!

Akira!

137
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,375
[AKIRA] By the way,
I've been meaning to ask,

138
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,083
don't you have any friends?

139
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,958
[SUBETE] Oh, that's hilarious!
You think I'm like you!

140
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,250
Difference is,
I'm alone by choice!

141
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,708
I am... my own man!

142
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,875
For I am the Savior!
I can't be tied down!

143
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,083
[SUBETE]
See what I mean? You're boring!

144
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,708
Living your whole damn life
in the shadow of a curse:

145
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,791
That's what being
a Savior really is!

146
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
[AKIRA]
A curse?!

147
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,000
[SUBETE]
What else would you call it?

148
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:27,416
You're just a prisoner of
your own ideals! A slave!

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,791
[AKIRA]
To hell with that!

161
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,916
Look at you. And here I
thought you were my Savior!

162
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,333
You're supposed to be
protecting me, you idiot!

163
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,791
You're not supposed
to up and vanish on me!

164
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,500
[AKIRA]
Sorry.

165
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,625
Tsukigane.

166
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,375
Akira.

167
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,625
[MAO] Your name will be Subete.
Your name means "everything."

168
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,000
[SOUGON] Indeed. A fitting
name for the Chosen One.

169
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,791
[MAO] Protect the one you love.

170
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,541
[SOUGON]
Strike down your fated enemy.

171
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,333
[SUBETE yells]

172
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,416
Subete! Stop!

173
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,958
[SUBETE]
Verbalize!

174
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,750
[AKIRA]
No! Don't do it!

175
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:24,791
[SUBETE] Genesis Merge!
Draw! Aquarion Logos!

176
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,833
What the...?

177
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,708
I believe the rogue
kanji are clearing out.

178
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,791
A new Logos World
has been created.

179
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,500
[SAKURAKO]
Yes. That's exactly it.

180
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,458
The written word
has a new home.

181
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,500
[SUBETE]
What do you think, Akira?

182
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,083
How does it feel to know I'm
the one who saved the day?

183
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,083
[AKIRA]
Thank you, Subete.

184
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,791
Without a doubt, you
are the true Savior.

185
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,958
[SUBETE]
Victory is mine. In your face.

186
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,458
Oh, Subete.

187
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,666
[MALE REPORTER A]
Excuse me, Madam President.

188
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,750
Are we to assume this
means Nesta will continue

189
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,625
providing its services
as before?

190
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,125
[SAKURAKO]
That is our intention, yes.

191
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,958
[FEMALE REPORTER A] Most of
us realize that DEAVA's role

192
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,500
was to protect the public from
written language gone awry,

193
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,291
but given the organization's
secrecy,

194
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,000
people are understandably wary.

195
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,333
[FEMALE REPORTER B]
As DEAVA's former commander,

196
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:26,291
do you think you're the right
choice to head Nesta?

197
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,708
I am aware of the extent

198
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,125
to which my misleading
the public regarding DEAVA

199
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,833
would tend to cast doubt.

200
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,000
This new position
how I'll atone.

201
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,916
Without trust, there
is no communication.

202
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,458
[SAKURAKO]
Ugh, meow, I'm exhausted.

203
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,333
[KENTO]
I wish you had time to relax,

204
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,541
but you've got three meetings
scheduled for this afternoon.

205
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,625
[SAKURAKO] The second I hired
you as my secretary,

206
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,666
you became the biggest
bully that ever lived!

207
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,458
[KENTO] You knew what the job
was when you signed up for it.

208
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:55,291
If it's so difficult,
why'd you even accept?

209
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,583
Sometimes to make your point
you've gotta take charge

210
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,916
and act like a boss.

211
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,125
And your point is writing
is vital to humanity?

212
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,416
More that it can bring
happiness if used properly.

213
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,208
I think.

214
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,125
[SHOKO]
Meowwww!

215
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,375
You can't be serious
about leaving, Kokone!

216
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,500
Shoko will be so lonesome
without you!

217
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,125
[KARAN] "Acting manager"
doesn't mean you have to act

218
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,666
like the old one.

219
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,708
[SHOKO] What? I thought it'd
be a nice homage to her style.

220
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,875
[HAYATO] Anyway, Kikogami, are
you sure about studying abroad?

221
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:26,916
[KOKONE]
Y-Yes.

222
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,791
If I want to g-grow
as a performer,

223
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,125
I need to hone my skills
in a new environment.

224
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,916
N-No offense to this place.

225
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,916
[KARAN] Well, yeah, but it's
still so out of the blue.

226
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
[SHOKO]
That's what I'm sayin'.

227
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,083
With the Logos World stabilized
we don't have to fight anymore,

228
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,333
but Shirobaco's Reading Theatre
is getting rave reviews!

229
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,416
That angelic voice of yours is
one of the star attractions!

230
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,708
What're we supposed to
do without our Kokone?

231
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,833
Girls, knock it off.

232
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:53,166
I'm sure she's given
this a lot of thought.

233
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,625
[KOKONE]
Yeah.

234
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,041
[KOKONE]
It-It dawned on me recently

235
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,458
how s-small my
world is, you know?

236
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,291
Not that I haven't enjoyed
it. You're all wonderful.

237
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:09,125
I've just been so sh-sheltered.
I kept my dreams small.

238
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,750
I only wanted things
that were in arm's reach.

239
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,666
Oh, Kokone!

240
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,750
I am not gonna start crying.

241
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,708
[KOKONE] But then, I saw
Akira and Tsutomu fight

242
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,750
and I thought, "Wow, the
world goes on forever!

243
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,666
The possibilities are endless!

244
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,791
What a waste to
stay in one place.

245
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,125
I have to get out there."

246
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,583
So...

247
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,083
...I made up my mind to see
as much of it as I could.

248
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,375
And to dream as big as I can!

249
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,375
[MAIA]
You are an amazing human being.

250
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,125
N-Not really!
I'm just me. That's all.

251
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,083
Well, now ya've got me
all fired up, too!

252
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,791
That's it, I'm goin'
out there, and becoming

253
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,833
the biggest, bestest voice
actor the world's ever known!

254
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,083
How can I not follow
that example?

255
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,833
[SHOKO] Weren't you
telling me the other day

256
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,458
Senator Kobayakawa asked
you to be his secretary?

257
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,750
Seems like that'd be
too good to pass up.

258
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,041
[KARAN] Wow! Secretary
to the next Prime Minister?

259
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,958
[HAYATO] Well I, uh, haven't
decided whether I'll accept yet.

260
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,041
[KARAN]
Oh, whatever! Come on!

261
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,333
Think of all the power
you'd have, Big Bro!

262
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,750
You could pull strings for me!

263
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,916
Like you could get them to
cast me as the female lead

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,583
in a blockbuster movie!

265
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,375
Yeah, 'cause politicians
run the film industry.

266
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,208
Hey, uh, I noticed you got
something under your arm there.

267
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,041
What is it?

268
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,833
[HAYATO]
Oh, right.

269
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,958
The Verbalism Club will
carry on with our without us.

270
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,625
Bearing that in mind, there
is someone whose memory

271
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,458
I feel we should
endeavor to keep alive.

272
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,208
[KOKONE]
You mean Tsutomu.

273
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,000
[HAYATO]
It's inevitable the mark he left

274
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,541
will fade with time.

275
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,708
But I thought perhaps if we
commemorated him physically.

276
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,250
I was thinking a statue.
Here in the shop.

277
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,541
That's really--

278
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,916
Let me stop you. It's awful.

279
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,916
It's t-too much!

280
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,166
I couldn't!

281
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,416
[TSUTOMU]
Yeah, Milkman, seriously.

282
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,250
[BOTH gasp]

283
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,916
Aw, well. Just a thought.

284
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,250
Oh, Tsutomu.

285
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,208
[MAN A] Hey. What are
you always scribbling

286
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,958
in that book of yours?

287
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,583
[HAYASHI]
A memoir of sorts, I suppose.

288
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,166
Not my own, though.

289
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,666
[MAN A] You're writing
about some else's life?

290
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,916
A rather epic father son story.

291
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,041
Two men willing to tempt Fate
for the women they love.

292
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,416
Seizing the past,
forging the future.

293
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,666
Truly, the stuff of legend.

294
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,208
[MAN A] Yeah? I don't know
what you're talkin' about,

295
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,916
but sounds like
it could be big.

296
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,583
What'ya call it, so I can pick
up a copy when it comes out?

297
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,375
Hell, I'll buy ten copies.
Give 'em to friends.

298
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,750
What should I call it? Hmph.

299
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:44,166
Aquarion Logos.
That has a ring to it.

300
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,125
[WOMAN A screams]
Stop thief!

301
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,291
[THIEF A groaning]

302
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,125
[WOMAN A]
Serves you right!

303
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,500
[WOMAN B]
Call the police! Hurry!

304
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,541
Thank you so much!

305
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,208
You're amazing.
How' you do that?

306
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,958
Wherever there are voices
seeking salvation.

307
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,333
I am there. Always.

308
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,000
For I am...

309
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,583
[gasps]

310
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,500
Uh, okay.

311
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,916
I guess he's just a weirdo.
Nice of him to help, though.

312
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,333
[WOMAN A]
Yeah, but what was that?
