"Twelve thousand years ago...

At a time when civilization
did not yet exist,

00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,250
humankind lived
in harmony with Truth,

upon the physical world.

Drawing from the World of Truth

draw from a well,

12
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,208
merely by saying the
words 'rain' or 'wind,'

13
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,083

torrential downpours

or fierce, howling gales.

15
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:13,000
They had only to speak
from the heart to make it so.

16
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,583
Alas, they held no means
of recording their emotions

17

or transmitting
them across time.

18
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,333
Thus did the written
word come to be,

19

and the world was changed.

20

00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,125
Wait till your nephew smiles.

316
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,916
Ugh. Is a picture
really necessary?

317
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,125
Don't be obtuse.

318
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,541
This is a special occasion,
of course it is!

319
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,583
[MAO]
Ooh! Here we go!

320
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,375
Hurry, before he
gets restless again.

321
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,125
[HAYASHI]
Uh, right.

322
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,791
[SUBETE] Even if it
means hurting Maia,

323
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,291
there remains only
one path open before me now.

324
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,750
Akira Kaibuki...
I will see you defeated!

325
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,083
[coughs]

326
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,708
With my name. My existence.

327
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,083
My everything on the line!

328
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,625
[M.J.B.K. croaking]

329
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,833
[SAKURAKO]
You're telling me every word

330
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,375
in the Logos World
has begun to distort?

331
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,666
Oh my god.

332
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,375
[KARAN]
What's gonna happen?

333
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,083
[KENTO] Once the distorted
words are absorbed

334
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,375
by the giant M.J.B.K.,
their concepts will disappear,

335
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,541
just like with Nothingness.
Except even faster!

336
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,083
[HAYATO]
I'll launch immediately!

337
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,500
[SHOKO]
You can't!

338
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,791
The corrosion density of
that space is off the charts!

339
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,833
If you plunge into that,
even with a Vector,

340
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,458
your existence will warp
beyond recognition!

341
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,041
S-So does that mean...?

342
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,208
It's him.

343
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,791
All of the kanji
representing all our names

344
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,250
will have gone rogue.

345
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,750
You and your vectors will
be devoured by the M.J.B.K.

346
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,791
Well then obviously we can't go!

347
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,375
I can.

348
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,625
That thing's power
stems from warping the kanji

349
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,166
for the word "everything."

350
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,583
My name doesn't
mean anything anymore.

351
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,625
Verbalize.

352
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,625
[SHOKO] I'm getting activation
signals from all Vectors!

353
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,333
[HAYATO]
But who's controlling them?

354
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,833
[KARAN] We're all
right here. Who can it be?

355
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:36,708
[phone ringing]

356
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,333
[KOKONE]
Th-The Aquariphone!

357
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,541
What is this?

358
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,958
I think this word's important...

359
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,333
It's a word that
led us all forward.

360
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,125
That's right!
We have a friend in there!

361
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,291
We have to help!

362
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,500
[KOKONE]
You c-can't go alone!

363
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,125
[HAYATO]
This is so typical of him.

364
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,708
[KARAN] Yeah!
You can't hog all the glory!

365
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,291
You guys...

366
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,625
But if you are the
only one who can do it,

367
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,125
then we believe in you!

368
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,958
Just come back in one piece.

369
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,625
And when you do,
prepare to get an earful.

370
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,416
And a buncha bonks
from my Pico Hammer!

371
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,958
Sorry the adults
are so useless, buddy.

372
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,666
We're all counting
on you, though!

373
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,250
Go kick some ass!

374
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,666
Godspeed!

375
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,958
Get out there and
make good on that promise!

376
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,958
Akira Kaibuki launch!

377
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,625
[HAYASHI] I've loaded your
precious Maia onboard.

378
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,458
I had to be somewhat
less than delicate,

379
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,500
but it's safer this way.

380
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,750
Once the writing in
the Logos World vanishes,

381
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,583
everything will be ready.

382
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,208
All you'll have to do is
trigger the annihilation pairing

383
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,791
with Aquarion Logos.

384
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,583
[SUBETE] And the culture of the
written word shall fall to ruin,

385
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,500
as will everything born of it.

386
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,791
[HAYASHI] The end is
only a matter of time.

387
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,291
Do you suppose there's anyone
left foolish enough to stop you?

388
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,500
[SUBETE]
I certainly hope so.

389
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,166
A fool who upholds his
lost cause to the bitter end

390
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,166
is a fool I dearly want to see.

391
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:16,958
[HAYASHI]
Subete.

392
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,708
I've always maintained a certain
professional distance from you,

393
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,625
have I not?

394
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,083
Yes. Why?

395
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,916
Forgive me if it's hardly
my place to say this,

396
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,333
but nonetheless...

397
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,833
Well, do your best.

398
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,166
[SUBETE]
I'm headed out.

399
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,000
[M.J.B.K.]
Su... be... te!

400
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,458
Is he here?

401
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,291
In the beginning
was the word.

402
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,500
Alpha and Omega.

403
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,208
Genesis Merge. Give praise!

404
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,541
Genesis Merge! Savior!

405
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,666
Aquarion!

406
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,875
He's here.

407
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,083
[SUBETE]
Logos!

408
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,333
[AKIRA]
Deava!

409
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,791
I can hear his voice.
But what is his name?

410
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,250
I may not remember,
but that voice...

411
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,375
...that voice... is amazing!

412
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:33,541
[M.J.B.K.]
Su... be... te!

413
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,750
Subete Kenzaki. Set Maia free!

414
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,666
Akira Kaibuki. Let's end this!

415
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,250
[SAKURAKO] To think I'd
have to rely on you poor kids

416
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,375
till the very end!
I'm in the wrong line of work.

417
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,541
[SHOKO]
I think the Calligraphy Class

418
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:24,791
is looking for instructors.

419
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,125
[SUBETE] When she was
Father's secretary,

420
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,000
he always complained
about her handwriting.

421
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,791
[SAKURAKO] I thought we agreed
not to bring that up again!

422
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,083
[SUBETE]
Writing's a window to the soul!

423
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,458
[SAKURAKO] What exactly
are you trying to say?

424
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,166
[SHOKO]
Next time, Episode 25.

425
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,083
[SUBETE]
"Gather! Voices for Tomorrow."

426
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,750
[SAKURAKO]
Someone get me an Aquaripen!
