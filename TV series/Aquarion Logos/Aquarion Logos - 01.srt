Hey!

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,208
Where do you get off
appearing out of nowhere?

316
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,625
That's right,
I'm talkin' to you!

You dare defy Master Sougon?

322
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,166
I'm The Savior. Duh.

323
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,083
Will you stop saying that?

324
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,208
