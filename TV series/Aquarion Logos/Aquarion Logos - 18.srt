[GIRL A]
Ta-da!

00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,833
Wow, it's a Marin Sparkling
Mode! Those are ultra-rare!

3
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,000
[GIRL C]
That's so cool!

00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,333
Hey, congrats! That's awesome!

5
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:41,541
Yeah, right?
Oh, hey! Check it out!

6
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,583
That child-like
innocence is so refreshing.

7
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,583
Here, Tinoa, have a look.

8
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,208
I don't really care
'bout that kinda stuff.

9
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,541
Oh.

10
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:56,208
Mika, look at this! I got
a Marin Sparkling Mode!

11

[SHOKO]
A school festival performance?

12
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,541
Yes indeedy, sweetie!

13
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,208
Hayato's University
is hosting the festival.

14
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,708
And they've been gracious enough

15
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,000
to let the Verbalism Club
Reading Theatre troupe perform!

16
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,708
He goes to Seiso
University, doesn't he?

17
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,750
If I'm not mistaken, Seiso U
holds a big deal debate contest

18
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,041
every year during that festival.

19
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,875
Aren't any of the
boys working today?

20
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,041
[OURA sighs]

21
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,125
No beefcakes?!

00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,000
[SAKURAKO]
Meow.

23
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,458
[KOKONE]
A-Akira's not here.

24
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,000
And n-neither are
the other guys.

25
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,333
If you're looking for Akira
or Hayato, they're gone.

26
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,625
Tsutomu took them
out for something

27
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,458
he referred to as a
"group blind date".

28
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,041
[gasps] A d-date?

29
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,750
[BOTH]
Oh god!

30
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,208
Uh... Don't go.

31
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,875
Retreating? We win.

32
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,791
No, we lost! Three strikes,
and they're out the door!

33
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,041
Ah, I'm screwed!

34
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,833
So much for findin' a
girlfriend in November

35
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,875
so our romance can blossom
into a Christmas miracle!

36
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,375
How boring.

37
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,625
I have better things to do
than to get dragged into this.

38
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,208
I'll remember that next time.

39
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,291
Things only got weird when you
opened your big, stupid mouth.

40
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Aren't my nails,
like, totes cute?

41
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,041
They're not.

42
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,208
Decorating your fingers with
cooked eels is disconcerting.

43
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,666
Don't ruin this for me.

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,416
She asked for my opinion,
which I gave her.

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,583
And I'm tellin' ya,
that's not how it works.

46
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,208
You gotta be Mister Compliments,
even when it's a lie.

47
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,041
Smile and say,
"looks nice", got it?

48
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,083
Just lie? I could never do that.

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,625
[RANKO]
What more is there to say?

50
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,708
My daughter's potential
to become the mascot

51
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,875
for My Storm is obvious.

52
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,208
I've heard the same spiel before
from innumerable parents.

53
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,625
A lot of it depends on
how eager Karan here is

54
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,125
to join this project.

55
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,541
I really wanna do it!

56
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,916
Is that so?

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,333
Ugh! I was lying, obviously!

58
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,250
I don't wanna do it,
I don't wanna!

[RANKO] Karan, mind
your manners, young lady.

00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,041
I don't like that guy.
He looks at me weird.

61
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,541
[RANKO] This weekend
you have a performance

62
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,125
with the Verbalism Club.

63
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,916
Oh, during Seiso
University's festival?

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,375
How nice!

65
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,916
The perfect opportunity to
make a good first impression

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
with some future elites.

67
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,000
I guess.

68
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,833
A friend of yours?

69
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,708
Sorta, we're in the same class.

70
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,333
But we've never really
talked with each other much.

71
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,125
There's not a lotta trash,

72
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,666
we could say we emptied it,
and no one would even know.

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,833
Good idea!

You wanna go to Seiso

00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,125
with me?

I'm part of a reading
theater troupe.

00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,916
It would be great if you could
come and watch me perform.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,541
Why me?

00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,500
[KARAN]
Hmm. Well, I guess...

The thing is, you seem cool,

have a cellphone.

true. That's impossible.

to draw focus.

Suction be with you!"

Oh, yummy!

00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,666
I never thought eating
a Shirobaco lunch box

107
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,375
out in nature could be
so absolutely perfect!

This must be what
they call a picnic!

Cute, but crazy.

Excuse me.

00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,625
I was wondering if
you'd seen someone?

Some who?

114
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,916
Well, she's got bright
colored twin tails

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,916
and she's shorter than me
and has real big eyes.

Whoa, what a total hottie.

He's so perfect. Think
he has a girlfriend?

Good afternoon, and
welcome to Seiso University.

The debate contest
will begin shortly.

an elimination
tournament format.

132
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,750
This year, the winner will also
get to have an exhibition debate

with our special guest, rising

Akira Kaibuki!

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,500
And his theme:
"On the Merits of a Savior".

143
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,916
[AKIRA]
The issue's not up for debate.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,375
Because I...

...am the Savior!

complete your argument?

Indeed.

[HAYATO]
As citizens of our nation,

00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,750
we must each think of ways
to improve the economy.

Seriously? Let's check it out!

Our school's debate competition

Now it's nothing more than a
rambling popularity contest.

You proved your point
to me, at least.

As opposed to that fart-brained

captivate the audience.

in someone who's right.

It was a sentiment shared
by most of his peers.

I used to look down
on my father for that,

When I was in middle school,

cheating on tests was
rampant among my friends.

with letting the other kids
look over their answers.

Except me. I wasn't comfortable
following that trend

210
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,916
and I refused to
lie to the teacher.

211
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,125
When I let him know
what was happening,

212
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,375
several of them were suspended.

213
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,875
Naturally, that would make
facing them difficult.

214
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,416
So I left,

before their suspension was up.

my righteousness made
me their bad guy.

320
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,250
And thinking for yourself?

321
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,708
Why bother if you can
let someone else?

322
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,458
[HAYATO]
If you're afraid of being hurt,

323
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,375
you can live surrounded
by pleasant-sounding lies.

324
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,791
Giving yourself over
to a big lie is simple

325
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,291
and seems like a
happy way to live.

326
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,791
[KARAN]
But it's not.

327
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,833
[HAYATO]
Yeah, I know that much.

328
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,791
But that's the life
too many citizens choose.

329
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,875
If the masses want to be
caught up in the current,

330
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,416
the proper move for a politician

331
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,291
is to lead them down
the path they've chosen.

332
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,708
But I can't in good conscience.

333
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,666
[MAN A]
What's your problem, runt?

334
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,708
[KARAN]
Tinoa.

335
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,625
[TINOA] Apologize!
You broke it, say sorry.

336
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,666
No, I'm telling you,
you're mistaken.

337
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,083
[TINOA]
I saw it happen!

338
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,125
Don't worry about it.
It's fine, okay?

339
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,291
[TINOA]
It's not fine!

340
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,416
Hey stop blaming our
princess, all right?

341
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,250
The lady who made it even
said everything's fine!

342
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,583
What's with this kid?

343
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,833
So, we're free to go, aren't we?

344
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,041
Of course.

345
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,375
[chuckles] It wasn't
anything special anyway.

346
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,541
Why are you smiling?
I saw 'em do it!

347
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,791
[ALL laughing]

348
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,166
[TINOA]
You looked so sad when it broke.

349
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,750
Stop lying to yourself!

350
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,625
[WOMAN A]
Shut up, you dumb brat!

351
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,291
[HAYATO]
I understand.

352
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,125
No matter what other people say,

353
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,750
there are some things you
just can't back down from.

354
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:28,500
You're so awkward that living
honestly is the only way.

355
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,666
Never forget... there are
other kids like you, too.

356
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,208
[MAIA]
What now?

357
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,708
It's quite simple.

358
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,333
We just have to clear
out this fog of lies.

359
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,708
But how?

360
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,166
The people's will...
must be restored.

361
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,083
[KOBAYAKAWA]
I will say it once again.

362
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,666
Keep believing! Have faith!
Your future is bright!

363
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,875
[thud]

364
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,166
No, Kobayakawa.

365
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,833
Everything you say
is a candy-coated lie!

366
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,875
Lie? About what?

367
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,958
Come on, it's this way.

368
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,291
[HAYATO] You spoke of a utopia
of happiness and equality.

369
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,500
But are you and I equal?
Absolutely not.

370
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,875
You were born into a family

371
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,375
that's been in politics
for generations.

372
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,208
You were virtually
guaranteed success

373
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,166
from the moment you were born.

374
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,416
Athletic ability,
intelligence, personality.

375
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,291
Every single one of us was born
with unique characteristics.

376
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,583
It's one of those things we all
learn when we're still young.

377
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,083
No two people are exactly alike.

378
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,958
And if that's the truth,
how can we all be equal?

379
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,750
In spite of these facts,
people still delude themselves

380
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,208
with the sweet lie
of equality, and why?

381
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,958
Because they refuse to
recognize their own inferiority

382
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,416
in the grand scheme.

383
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,458
Instead, they cling to
the false comfort of a lie.

384
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,458
Your pessimistic line of
thought underestimates people.

385
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,541
Indeed, it is true there
are differences between us,

386
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,708
but those differences
give more meaning to us

387
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,000
walking hand in hand.

388
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,875
Pretty words, but hollow.

389
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,666
"Hand in hand," then what?

390
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,000
We form these bonds,
but to what end?

391
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,125
Without thinking further ahead,
the very means you suggested

392
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,000
have devolved into
their own end.

393
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,583
What meaning could be
found in that existence?

394
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,583
What's truly necessary
is for us all

395
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,708
to exercise critical thought.

396
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,458
Without that, you brandish
the idea of connections,

397
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,833
but betray their meaning.

398
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
Such knee-jerk abandonment
of critical thinking

399
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,708
will lead to a society
of brain-dead zombies.

400
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,041
Who's this jerk?
He's pissin' me off.

401
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,375
How lame.

402
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,000
You need to have more
faith in your fellow man.

403
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,041
Believe in the
potential of people.

404
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,250
Faith alone will change nothing.

405
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,000
Why bother connecting with
others if it leads to a society

406
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,833
where you have to just
accept how things are?

407
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,458
Where you have to
lie about yourself

408
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,375
if you hope to
fit in with others?

409
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,958
And where you
ostracize the people

410
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,541
who aren't callow
enough to live a lie.

411
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,541
[HAYATO]
Dishonesty has become

412
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,208
an almost necessary
societal lubricant.

413
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,125
But no more.
I reject that notion.

414
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,291
I choose not accept your lies!

415
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,666
I choose the more
difficult path!

416
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,041
I choose the path of honesty!

417
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,875
The sad truth is honest people
are seen as weaklings, fools.

418
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,375
However, there are outsiders
who will never cling to lies,

419
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,875
no matter how much
they might suffer!

420

Those are the people
I'm speaking to now.

421
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,291
Even though you know
the truth can never win

422
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,041
against the ocean of lies,

423
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,500
there's a fool here who
will stand against it,

424
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,791
fighting all of
their glib posturing.

425
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,875
And I am that fool!

You awkward, honest people,

like she's so great.
