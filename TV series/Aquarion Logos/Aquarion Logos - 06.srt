One more time.

00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,583
Let's go over the specific
capabilities of each vector.

115
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,000
Kaibuki's Vector One
is a multipurpose type

116
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,958
with a variety of uses.

117
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,500
Tsukigane's Vector Two
has superior power,

118
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,875
giving it a bit
more maneuverability.

119
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,208
Kikogami's Vector Three
primarily disrupts

120
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,625
the enemy and
provides rear support.

121
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,416
'Stomu's Vector Four is our
tank: the heavy attacker.

122
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,250
It specializes in
hit and run tactics.

123
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,166
My own Vector Five
is the fastest:

a high speed, range
of mobility type.

125
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,458
Finally, Uminagi's Vector Six.

126
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,541
The strengths of this unit
are Ambush and Reconnaissance.

127
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,708
Why do I get stuck with
the unlucky number?

128

129
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,625
Why do we use
Vector Two so often?

130
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,083
With Vector One
always in the field,

131
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,083
it doesn't really contribute
any unique functions.

132
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,500

are anything to go by,

00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,541
[KARAN] If they're doing
that, I'm going with...

159
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,541
No chance in hell. Ugh.

160
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,375
What do you people
think Vectors are?

161
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,208
[KARAN]
Ew.

162
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,583
Hey. Heading home?

163
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,583
Yep.

164
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,416
Have a good one.

165
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,416
Bye-bye!

166
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,208
S-See you tomorrow.

167
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,375
[KARAN] "Savior Go"
totally isn't happening.

168
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,708
[TSUTOMU] What goes into
makin' a guy like Akira?

169
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,583
Like, how was he raised?

170
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,208
Master ordered me to keep
a watchful eye on him.

171
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,750
But so far, my observations are
limited to what I see here.

172
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,458
[KARAN]
That reminds me, Mr. Hayato.

173
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,041
My mother has kind of a
special request for you.

174
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:45,958
[HAYATO]
A request?

175
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,416
[KARAN]
Uh-huh!

176
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,250
I don't dare go to Master
Sougon with so little intel.

177
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,458
[MAIA]
Leaving early!

178
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,916
Wait! You're pulling
this again? Maia!

179
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,458
That's right, Akira.

180
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,166
I'm going to find out
what makes you tick.

181
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,791
[gasps] What on Earth
is that creature?

182
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,458
No, not Earth.

183
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,708
Clearly not indigenous
to this community,

184
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,875
or even to this solar system.

185
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,041
So, where is it from?

186
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,625
[gasps]

187
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,625
[MAIA grunts]

00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,958
[growls]

189
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,083
[MAIA]
Exterminate!

00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,416
[KIDS shouting]

191
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,291
Hey, you! Stop bein' a bully!

192
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,125
Who do you think you are, lady?

193
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,833
What is wrong with you, larvae?

194
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,500
Why are you defending
this hideous beast!

195
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,166
--Let go of me! Ow!
--[sighs]

196
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,500
[MAIA]
This must be...

197
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,625
[AKIRA] Quit dragging
your feet. Come inside.

198
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,416
We'll put on some tea.

199
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,375
But how could he have known?

200
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,708
Remember: it is not the ink
that abides in your brush.

201
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,458
The bristles must be
permeated by your soul!

202
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,458
[AKIRA] That's my grandpa.
He teaches calligraphy.

203
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,041
[SHIZUKA] Well, I have to say,
it's not like our boy

204
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,916
to bring friends home.

205
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,083
So a cute little thing
like you is unheard of.

206
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,000
[AKIRA]
Technically, I didn't bring her.

207
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,708
She's here because
she followed me.

208
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,541
[SHIZUKA chuckles]

209
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,916
Pay no attention, my dear,

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,541
he's happy as a
clam to have you.

211
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:41,250
Consider our door open any
old time you'd like to drop by.

212
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,208
I'll consider it.

213
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,958
[coughs]

214
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,916
Oh, no, I brewed it too strong!

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,541
Guess she's picky.

216
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,750
You dirty rat, poisoning
me in your own home.

217
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,666
[door scrapes]

218
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,916
My thanks. A token.

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
[SUBETE GUARD 6A]
Oh. That's not...

220
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,916
Now, to have a proper
word with my father!

221
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,791
[SAKURAKO] It's been quite
a while since I've come here.

222
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,000
This is the source
of the M.J.B.K.s.

223
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,291
No doubt in my mind.
I have to do something.

224
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,166
Anything to make
their fight easier.

225
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,083
It's the least I owe them.

226
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,125
[alarm beeps]

227
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,125
[SAKURAKO]
Hm. Well, it was worth a shot.

228
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,500
I haven't been his
secretary in years.

229
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,916
[yelps]

230
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,083
Ugh, ow, dammit.

231
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,083
[SUBETE] Terribly sorry!
Are you all right?

232
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,166
You're... Miss Sakurako?

233
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,916
Subete.

234
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,833
[TSUTOMU]
Showtime, folks!

235
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,708
For my first trick,
I shall make the contents

236
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,791
of this delectable oden vanish
in the blink of an eye...

237
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,458
...into the dark
recesses of my belly!

238
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,208
[sighs] Looks like
nobody's favorite

239
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,541
"online comedian" is at it
again with the oden schtick.

240
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,833
Poor bastard.

241
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,916
View count's so low
it's almost sad.

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,291
You still not havin' any luck
gettin' through to Sakurako?

243
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,458
I don't know what to do.

244
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,833
I've been shootin' her
texts for an hour.

245
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,333
[KENTO]
Hm...

246
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,291
Uh?!

247
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,708
[SAKURAKO] Easy there,
Subete. People are looking.

248
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,583
I... I'm sorry.

249
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,541
I never imagined your
reasons for stealing

250
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,250
Father's vectors was so...

251
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,750
I mean, upholding your invalid
mother's dearest wish...

252
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,166
Yes, Mother.

253
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,458
[SUBETE]
She wanted to see one so badly.

254
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,458
I can only imagine what
that must have been like

255
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,791
for you--such a caring daughter!

256
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,500
Willing... Willing to move
heaven and earth for the woman

257
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,666
who gave birth to you!

258
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,916
[SAKURAKO]
Least I could do.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,458
Who in their right mind
falls for a story like that?

260
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,166
Is she... Is she still
with us, or, uh...?

261
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,208
Oh, she's great! Fit as
a fiddle, truth be told.

262
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,750
Seems the sight of
a vector in action

263
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,708
is just the cure
for what ails ya!

264
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,333
Ah! That's wonderful news!

265
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,708
I'd planned to return
them all along.

266
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,083
If only I had a better
home security system.

267
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,625
See, a burglar broke in while I
was running errands and made off

268
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,083
with the darn things before
I could bring them back.

269
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,625
Oh, my! Sounds so violating!

270
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,166
[SAKURAKO] Well, it's not
like I can lay everything

271
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,375
out on the table and tell
him I'm using the vectors,

272
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,750
now is it?

273
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,250
[SUBETE]
Now I'm almost sure:

274
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,500
Maia's with those reprobates
responsible for the theft!

275
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,666
If only I could probe
a little further.

276
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,791
Trouble is, I don't dare
let the world know

277
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,833
I piloted a vector into battle.

278
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:47,500
[SAKURAKO, SUBETE
laugh nervously]

279
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,333
[SUBETE]
Sakurako?

280
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,583
[SAKURAKO]
Yes?

281
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,625
[SUBETE] I'm sorry for
thinking poorly of you.

282
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,041
[SAKURAKO]
Don't worry about it.

283
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,125
[SUBETE]
No. I oughtta have

284
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,875
given you the benefit
of the doubt.

285
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,500
When I heard that
you'd taken the vectors,

286
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,333
I assumed you'd betrayed us.
You deserved better of me.

287
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,875
Period. I'm sorry.

288
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm the one who's sorry.

289
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,250
What did I expect
everyone to believe?

290
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,541
[SUBETE]
Let me make it up to you.

291
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,208
Anything you want, it's yours!

292
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,250
Huh?

293
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,041
And don't be conservative!

294
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,583
I have this! Makes the
whole world my oyster!

295
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,000
[SAKURAKO]
Uh... Ha...

296
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,333
Yes. I've seen this.

297
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,583
[RANKO] You can't deny those
dance moves are on point.

298
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,625
And Karan's angelic vocals
are 100% not auto tuned.

299
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,750
[HATANO]
Uh-huh.

300
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,250
Yes, I know. Ugh.

301
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,583
The ad only played locally.

302
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,000
And I'm pretty sure
the only people

303
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,833
who've seen it
are the film crew.

304
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,000
That being said!

305
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,125
Mr. Hatano, your support
among young voters

306
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,041
is the highest in the
country! Kids worship you!

307
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,666
If you put this track
in your next commercial,

308
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,666
it'll be huge for you and her!

309
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,666
Huh?

310
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,500
My Karan is a voice actress now.

311
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,375
Wouldn't the perfect debut for
her be as the voice of youth

312
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,791
for your whole campaign?

313
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,916
Excuse me.

314
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,875
Yes?

315
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,375
Granted, I'm not as up to speed

316
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,041
on the "young idol" phenomenon
as someone in my position

317
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,541
probably should be but, uh,
grabbing the hearts and minds

318
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,083
of a whole generation?

319
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,875
Seems a pretty ambitious goal
for this stage of the game.

320
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,291
Well, if you're gonna dream,
you've gotta dream big.

321
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,041
Maybe, but you've
got to be realistic

322
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,500
about the industry.

323
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,291
The fact of the matter is,
very few newcomers last.

324
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,458
Most pop idols amount
to a flash in the pan

325
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,375
before simply disappearing.

326
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,916
Same with voice actors.

327
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,416
It sounds harsh, but
that's just the reality.

328
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,083
I feel like I've seen
a lot of young talent

329
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,750
ground up and spit out.
Fame is a fickle bitch.

330
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,583
Pardon the language,
ma'am, but...

331
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,333
I don't wanna see
that happen to Karan.

332
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,083
If she's in this
for the notoriety,

333
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,916
she's in it for
the wrong reasons.

334
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,208
What's important is letting
her talent be fulfilling

335
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,125
in and of itself.

336
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,708
You're adorable.

337
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,750
Yep. Still bitter.

338
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,500
[SHIZUKA] He said give you these
to help with the aftertaste.

339
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,041
Huh?

340
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,458
[SHIZUKA]
He doesn't like to show it,

341
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:09,166
but he's actually
a very nice boy.

342
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,250
Has he... Has he
always been like that?

343
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,666
I mean, with the
whole "savior" thing?

344
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,708
Since the day he was born,
believe it or not.

345
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,333
We can't even tell you why
he's hung up on the idea

346
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,625
of playing the hero--
it's just been part of him

347
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:28,708
from the beginning. I can
tell you this much, however.

348
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,791
If he can help,
that boy never shows

349
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,000
the slightest sign
of hesitation.

350
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,875
He's gifted with the
knowledge of what to do

351
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,041
in any situation where
someone needs rescuing.

352
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,500
He just knows what
to do? Must be nice.

353
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,333
[SUBETE]
Hey, c'mon! Don't hold back!

354
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,708
[SUBETE laughs]

355
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,291
[SUBETE]
Oh, you're in for it now!

356
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,458
Tornado... Strike!

357
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,958
Yeah!

358
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,958
You sure it's okay
for you to do this?

359
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,458
[SUBETE]
Do what?

360
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,625
[SAKURAKO] I don't know,
mingle with the commoners?

361
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,666
[SUBETE] But I'm enjoying
myself immensely!

362
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,750
I think of it as giving
the people a gift.

363
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,375
Who wouldn't want
to be in my presence?

364
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,541
That sense of superiority
is gonna get your ass kicked.

365
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,541
--[BOY 6D] Bye-Bye!
--[MOTHER] Thank you both

366
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,208
--[BOY 6D] Bye-Bye!
--so much!

367
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,750
[SAKURAKO] Still the
same old Subete, I see.

368
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,958
Huh?

369
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,041
I always questioned whether

370
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,000
that environment
was good for you.

371
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,666
[SAKURAKO] Your luncheon
with President Ringosberg

372
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,291
is set for two PM.

373
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,166
After that, you've got
a quorum meeting at three.

374
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,750
[SUBETE]
Daddy!

375
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,583
You'll be so proud of me,
I came in first place!

376
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,250
[SOUGON]
Throw the intruder out, please.

377
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,416
Excuse me?

378
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,125
[SOUGON]
This is a place of business.

379
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,333
I am decidedly not
running a daycare.

380
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,625
[SUBETE]
But, Daddy! I'm sorry!

381
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,708
[SUBETE] I certainly had
my share of disappointments.

382
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,541
But... at the very least,
I didn't suffer them alone.

383
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,500
And having faith got us
through the worst of it.

384
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,541
Believing always pays
you back in strength.

385
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,750
In the end, I knew in my heart
Father would be proud of me.

386
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,750
I understood that
I was the chosen one.

387
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,708
In the grand scheme of
things, I had a place.

388
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,375
Life can be tough, but being
special makes it all worthwhile.

389
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,125
Call it what it is, Subete.

390
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,958
You do nothing on your own and
rely on others for everything.

391
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,208
Huh?

392
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,958
That's just sad.

393
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,416
[crashing]

394
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,833
What was that?

[M.J.B.K. 6A]
Dan!

396

Hm.

[TSUTOMU grunting, panting]

398
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,083

getting all of this.

[KOKONE] Um. Maybe?
The internet's d-down.

401
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,333
[KARAN] I'm here with
the hot young senator

402
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,791
everyone's talking
about, Mr. Hatano.

403
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,958
I question the wisdom of getting
her involved in politics.

404
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,833
I get that an actor has to
follow the work, but still.

405
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,416
[RANKO]
I know. It's boring.

406
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,875
But her delivery!

407
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,333
Ugh. Are you kidding me?!

[SHOKO] I'm afraid the commander
won't make it back in time.

420

I'll stand in for her
until she gets here,

but don't expect miracles.

422
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,666
Not the sort of
thing that inspires

confidence in your pilots.

424

Let's do this.

425
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,875

Now I'm the a-hole.

What was I saying about
relying on others?

429

[SUBETE] Miss Sakurako!
I've gotta find my father!

00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,083
This is chaos.

431

But if I can get there,
I have a pretty good idea

where to find him.

If there's anyone capable of
bringing her back, it's him!

Nobody else in the world is more
important to me than that girl!

We've got a situation.

441
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,083
Father simply misunderstands

442
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,875
my point of view, is all.
If I explain it to him...

443

[SAKURAKO]
Don't be so naive!

Huh?

445
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,041
[SAKURAKO] This girl is
the most important person

446
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,708
in the world to you, and
the first place you go is

447
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,875
"I'll just talk to Daddy?" 

448
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,291
Then what should I do?

449
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,375
[SAKURAKO] I dunno, how
about stop being a baby

450
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,291
and find a way to get
her back yourself!

right before he lets others
do the fighting for him!

455
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,041
It's pathetic!

456

And trust me. I'm no better.

457
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,375
If anything, I'm actually worse.

458
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,791
I don't just rely on others.
I rely on children.

[SUBETE] You're right.
Belief is meaningless.

If I can't stand
on my own two feet,

what good does it do me?
If I want Maia back,

466

I have to fight for her.
That's all there is to it!

Dan! Dan! Dan! Da-Dan!

[SUBETE]
I have to grow up!

472
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,000
Time to put away
childish things!

473
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,583
If I ever want
Maia restored to me,

474
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:51,166
I must first learn
to be worthy of her!

475
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,750
Oh, hell.

476
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,208
Hey, Maia!

477
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,750
Didja know my Nesta timeline
is totally on fire right now?

478
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:31,958
That sounds like a bad thing.

479
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,291
Traditionally, "on fire"

480
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,083
carries negative connotations,
but youth culture

481
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,583
has turned the phrase
on its head to mean

482
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,666
"amazing," or "awesome." 

483
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,916
That's stupid!

484
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,541
Pics of little fur babies
are totes adorbs!

485
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,583
The language is dying.

486
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,708
Or evolving.
