[SHOKO]
The Verbalism Ability emanating

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,958
from the black Aquarion
unit is insanely high!

3
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,416
But these sensor readings,

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,541
are radically different
from Akira's. It's strange.

5
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,208
A different kind of energy?

6
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,250
Is that what drew in the
M.J.B.K., and revitalized them?

7
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,750
So you're still alive, Subete.

[SUBETE] It's just
flooding out on its own.

The answer your son has chosen?

The decision your son

[SOUGON]
In times past,

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,708
humanity was at one
with the world of truth,

26
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,833
but the written word, for
all we prospered from it,

27
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,541
wrought incalculable suffering.

28
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,291
[MAO] In this new
era of globalization,

29
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:36,000
the internet has become
an indispensible tool.

30
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll make a prediction.

31
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,541
In the not too distant future,

32
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,416
communication between people
will become nearly impossible

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,708
without the aid of
this emerging tech.

34
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,958
The brave new world
ushered in by the internet

35
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,000
instantly connects people
across thousands of miles.

36
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,666
This breakthrough
will revolutionize

37
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,916
our current business and take
us into the new millennium!

38
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,666
[HAYASHI] It was 22 years
ago, when CEO Mao Hayashi,

39
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,750
with assistance from
her technical adviser,

40
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,208
Sougon Kenzaki,

41
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,041
established Japan's first
network management company,

42
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,958
called Nesta.

43
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,041
The internet, now a major
aspect of everyday life,

44
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,708
was originally brought
to this country by Nesta.

45
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,541
And as their
infrastructure developed.

46
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,875
Nesta succeeded in rapidly
expanding their business.

47
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,375
Can't believe it's
been five years.

48
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,916
Over that time, Nesta has
grown into one of the world's

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,291
leading companies, just like
you always said we would.

50
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,125
All due to your ability
to explain the importance

51
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,250
of the network to our
potential investors.

52
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,333
I'd never've gotten
this far alone.

53
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,000
It just proves to me that making
you the company president

54
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,208
was the right decision.

55
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,208
The whole world can
start fresh from here.

56
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,916
As the network
continues to develop,

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,250
communication density
will increase accordingly.

58
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,958
Which means your dream
can come to fruition.

59
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,666
Your vision to reestablish the
nearly forgotten world of truth.

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,333
Until 12 thousand years ago,

61
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,625
the world of truth had long
existed adjacent to our own.

62
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,125
By merely touching it, people
were able to make the rain fall,

63
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,625
just by wishing it so.

64
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,833
Or with a request for wind,
they could summon a typhoon.

65
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,375
Put plainly,

66
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,833
it was the power to materialize
their thoughts and feelings.

67
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,791
Those wishes coaxed the
phenomena across to our world.

68
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,250
They could make magic.

69
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,958
[SOUGON] And the baby
that will be the key

70
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,250
to realizing that dream-like
world will be born tomorrow,

71
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,083
according to the prophecy.

72
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,083
Do you honestly believe in that?

73
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,125
That a child is to be born
chosen by Verbalism?

74
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,375
But exploiting a miracle
to skip straight to results?

75
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,333
That feels like cheating.

76
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,541
As communication
continues to develop,

77
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,166
the world of truth will
reappear eventually.

78
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,875
Why isn't that enough?

79
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,333
The development of Communication
and the chosen one's coming,

80
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,833
I believe both are
necessary to achieve success.

81
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,833
[MAO]
No, you misunderstand me.

82
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:55,916
In what way?

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,333
[MAO]
Having your fate determined

84
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,583
before you've even been born?

85
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,708
What a truly sad life.

86
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,333
So then, that's her stance.

87
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,166
For better or worse,
Mao is very human.

88
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,250
Well, too bad her brother's
such an inhuman monster.

89
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,625
[DOCTOR]
Normally, I would never abuse

90
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,083
a patient's privacy
like I'm about to.

91
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,833
But a boy was born
earlier today,

92
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,958
at the precise time
you said he would be.

93
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,791
How could you have known that?

94
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,333
[HAYASHI]
From what we had been told,

95
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,000
the mother died
from complications

96
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,833
shortly after giving birth,

97
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,208
and the child had
no other relatives.

98
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,458
It felt like everything was
following the whim of fate.

99
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,916
I know. Your name
will be Subete.

100
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,625
A perfect name for the
child who lost everything

101
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,083
the moment he was
thrust into this world.

102
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,375
But, you know, not having a
thing you can call your own,

103
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,916
only means that you've
everything to gain.

104
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,458
It is my hope that over
the course of your life,

105
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,875
you will gain everything
you could want.

106
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,458
May you be the master
of your own destiny.

107
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,416
May you chase love, dreams,
and all that is good.

108
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,250
Your name means "everything."

109
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,041
I see.

110
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,750
[HAYASHI] Even after adopting
the orphaned Subete,

111
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,166
Sougon never married Mao.

112
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,958
Sougon saw Subete as a tool

113
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,500
to reach the World of
Truth he had yearned for.

114
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,000
Meanwhile, Mao wanted
him to live freely,

115
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,833
as a normal human child.

116
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,208
The stark difference in
their views may have created

117
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,166
the invisible wall
that separated them

118
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,916
from that point on.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,750
Eventually, Sougon
and I delegated

120
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,333
all of Nesta's
management to my sister.

121
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,916
The two of us were
heading overseas

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,416
to excavate and study ruins.

123
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,291
We needed to gain a
deeper understanding

124
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,291
of written culture, otherwise,
we would never stand a chance

125
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,708
of recreating the
World of Truth.

126

you and Subete both well?

I'm getting along

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,833
We recently excavated a relic

from an as-yet unknown
ancient writing culture.

If we succeed in
deciphering their script,

it should prove a
valuable resource for us.

I'd very much like
to hear your voice.

Not yet, but there's

We shouldn't tie this
child down with fate.

Thanks to the power
of the network,

She's what?!

166
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,750
[IIDA] She was speeding away,
trying to shake a journalist,

167
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,583
but then she lost control.

168
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,708
The car collided
with a noise barrier.

This is all lies!

The country was focused
on Nesta's rapid growth.

They believe the
network we built

worth nationalizing.

for a government takeover.

I'm sorry. Ever since
you left the country,

they've been waiting
for an opportunity.

But the president utterly
refused to cave in,

177
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,083
so they used the media.

178
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,083
They began attacking her
character, smearing her name.

179
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,458
It left her feeling
alone and cornered.

control or if she chose--

She said she didn't wanna
get in the way of your work.

[HAYASHI] Subete was
miraculously untouched,

despite being in the car
at the time of the accident.

I hate it!

199

Civilization is infested with

[HAYASHI] When he at last took
hold of the Book of Verbalism,

My father's recognition.

That meant everything
to me back then.

Dad! Please don't go!

[SUBETE]
I had no mother. She was gone.

My father was all I had left.

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,375
And yet, I couldn't even
get him to look at me.

It's not because you've
done anything wrong.

It's just... whenever
he looks at your face,

00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,791
it brings back a wave
of painful memories.

I felt totally lost.

I couldn't understand what
Hayashi tried to tell me.

225
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,291
[SUBETE]
I was becoming desperate.

226
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,333
If I could only
do what dad asked,

227

I believed it would finally
make him look my way.

Nothing again.

That's another failed attempt.

All right, take the equipment
down for recalibration!

come to visit me?

You were clearly
never the chosen one.

You are a failure. I have
found replacements.

I can create someone
compatible from among them.

I no longer need you,
it would seem.

Far away.

It felt like he was going
beyond the horizon,

[SUBETE]
But...

246
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Even after that, my father
never looked at me.

It's a bit late for that.

00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,416
[SUBETE] You called yourself
a Savior, isn't that right?

317
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,666
I understand all there is
to know about your voice now.

318
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,458
The Savior. The title that
defines your very existence.

319
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,125
That's why you've been looking
for me your whole life.

320
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,958
[SUBETE] A Savior is
someone who saves others.

321
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,666
For you to be your ideal self,

322
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,666
there must always be something
threatening the world

323
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,541
to give you a sense of purpose.

324
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,416
Stop talking.

325
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,666
[SUBETE]
Accept it.

326
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,833
Without a threat to the
world, you're nothing.

327
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,125
Akira.

328
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:53,208
Scorching Fire! Sun Mugen Punch!

329
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,791
Rejoice, Akira.

330
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,791
Your most heartfelt wish?
I've come to grant it!

331
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,291
Wishes are one of those things
a person can never leave behind.

332
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,625
The wishes of the departed

333
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,708
get washed away
with their lives,

334
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,750
and lost in the stream of time.

335
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,458
Yet still, you will live on.

336
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,291
Even though I lost
everything I thought I had.

337
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,833
[SUBETE]
No. That's wrong.

338
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,833
[SUBETE]
I will always have my pain.

339
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,166
The pain is the one thing I own.

340
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,500
[MAO] It is my hope that over
the course of your life,

341
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,500
you will gain everything
you could want.

342
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,958
May you be the master
of your own destiny.

343
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,083
May you chase love, dreams,
and all that is good.

344
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:43,958
I can choose.

345
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,208
I can exercise my
own will. At last!

346
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,791
[SUBETE] Defeating you
is everything to me!

347
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,916
He broke the Mugen Punch!

348
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,833
I'll be taking that!

349
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,708
[BOTH yelp]

350
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:09,833
Akira!

351
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,500
Subete.

352
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,125
[SUBETE] Now, to reduce
everything to ash.

353
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,583
[SUBETE]
You wanna be the Savior?

354
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,666
I can be the Destroyer.

355
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,250
[MAIA]
What's Subete doing here?

356
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,083
[SUBETE] Maia, you
were fabulous as always!

357
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,583
[MAIA]
It was no big deal, really.

358
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,541
[SUBETE] No way! You were
cuter than cute. Right, Akira?

359
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,958
[AKIRA]
Gross.

360
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,541
Talking to you is bad enough,
now stop touching me.

361
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,666
Besides, I distinctly
remember you calling Kokone

362
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,375
and Karan cute, too.

363
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,125
[MAIA]
He's an enemy.

364
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,083
[AKIRA]
Definitely.

365
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,416
[SUBETE] Uh, next,
Episode 17:

366
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,916
"Shatter! The One
I Must Strike Down!"

367
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,958
[MAIA]
Don't come back.
