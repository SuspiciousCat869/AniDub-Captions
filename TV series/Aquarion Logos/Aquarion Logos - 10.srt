Bravo! Marvelous!

[laughs]

4
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,750
[KOKONE] That was the first
time I ever saw a play.

5
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:53,125
Since then,
all I've ever wanted...

6
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,583
Kokone sings
like an angel!

7
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,250
She's gonna be a
household name in no time!

8
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,541
[KOKONE] All I've ever dreamed
of was to be an actress.

9
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,958
[SOUGON] In times past,
humanity was at one

10
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,708
with the world of truth.

11
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,833
But the written word,
for all we prospered from it,

12
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,416
wrought incalculable suffering.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,958
[HAYATO] A play?
Not a dramatic reading?

14
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,583
[SAKURAKO] Correct! Our first,
open air theatrical performance!

15
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,208
[SHOKO]
And the venue is terrific!

16
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,291
Get this: we spoke
with the Shinmei Shrine

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,541
and they're letting us
use their stage!

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,875
[SAKURAKO] Everyone,
study your scripts.

19
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,250
They're super radical!

20
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,458
D'you just say "radical"?

21
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,875
Who talks like that?

22
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,458
Careful. People might
think you're trying to sound

23
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,833
younger than you are.

24
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,083

Let's review the cast list!

Excuse me?

00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:16,833
[KARAN]
Huuuuh?

27
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,000
[KOKONE]
I g-get the th-theme song?

28
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,416
[AKIRA]
Why isn't there a savior?

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,916
[MAIA] Um, what country is
this Kaguya a princess of?

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,416
[TSUTOMU]
You made me the grandma?

31
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,875
I want to be a prince!

32
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,250
[KARAN] This is an outrage!
Why aren't I the princess?

33
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,833
Karan doesn't play kappa!

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,833
[TSUTOMU]
This sucks!

35
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,958
[HAYATO]
Both of you, calm down.

36
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,291
--Oh, put a sock
--Says the guy who

37
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,041
--gets to play a prince!
--in it, big bro!

38
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:39,125
Suh so, I'm g-guessing all
you want me to do is s-sing?

39
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,250
Right! You have
the job of establishing

40
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,833
the mood of the whole play!

41
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,166
One of the most
important roles, really.

42
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,500
I suh-see.

43
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,833
Hey, manager? Can we
rework the part of the Sage

44
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,250
so he was once a savior?

45
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,000
Wait a minute, I don't
remember a sage being in this.

46
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,875
And, what about Hanako?

47
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,208
I vote Kikogami plays her.

48
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,458
[TSUTOMU] I dunno if
this whole drag thing's

49
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,500
where I want
my comedy career going.

50
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,583
[SAKURAKO]
It softens your appearance.

51
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,083
And besides, it's a good part.

52
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,375
[HAYATO]
With all due respect,

53
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,416
I don't think Kokone
is ready for a lead role.

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,625
[AKIRA] Why don't we
ask her if she's ready?

55
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,416
Huh?

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,208
What do you say?

57
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,458
Well. I, uh...
I enjoy singing.

58
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,291
B-But what I r-really, um.

59
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,000
What I really
want to do is act!

60
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,625
Okay, we'll give it a shot.

61
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,250
Study the part
backwards and forwards.

62
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:32,083

It's just random noise.

Because I'm not communicating.

on stage or in life,

if the words tumbling
out of my mouth don't have

my voice doesn't reach anyone.
