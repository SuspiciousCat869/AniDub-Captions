without getting
the others involved.

318
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,041
[MAIA] So that's
what he had planned.

319
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,291
What an imbecile!

320
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,791
[SAKURAKO] I thought
his sudden attitude shift

321
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,666
was totally out of place,

322
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,541
but I never knew
he'd take things this far.

323
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,708
[SHOKO] But there's no way
he can beat an M.J.B.K.

324
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,458
with a single Vector!

325
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,916
[SAKURAKO] I assume
Akira is aware of that.

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,958
I'm sure that in his heart
of hearts, he's waiting.

327
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,791
Waiting for someone
who's still willing to

328
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,583
try to bridge
the gap between them.

329
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,375
[MAIA panting]

330
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,666
Idiot! Moron! Damn you!

331
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,500
I never learned how to give up,
and I'm not gonna start!

332
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,041
[SUBETE] Coming at
me solo? Are you nuts?

333
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,083
D'you know, Subete.

334
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,875
The etymology of
the kanji for "separation"?

335
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,458
It's a bird and a snake.

336
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,958
Both intertwined
and inseparable.

337
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,916
That's one theory on how
this kanji came to be.

338
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,583
[AKIRA] So, I will
become the bird,

339
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,041
and peck this kanji away!

340
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,750
[SUBETE] Trying to bust my kanji
into its constituent parts?

341
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,375
It won't work!

342
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,291
Oh no!
He can't access enough

343
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,875
of his Verbalism Ability!

344
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,541
[SUBETE] Give it up!
I've already won!

345
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,625
Maia?

346
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,041
[thud]

347
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,500
[SUBETE] What are you doing,
Maia? It's over now!

348
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,375
That Kaibuki jerk is gone.

349
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,916
You're free now, you can
return home with me.

350
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,416
[MAIA]
Akira. Do you read me?

351
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,208
[SUBETE]
That's their comms.

352
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,666
So, am I picking them up because
I swallowed the Red Vector?

353
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,958
[MAIA]
You're always too obstinate

354
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,625
for your own good, you know?

355
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,458
But I could never let you
do this on your own.

356
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,958
That's why... I made the
decision to go with you.

357
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,291
[SUBETE]
Maia, why?

358
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,541
[MAIA] It took some time,
but I've finally come

359
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,541
to the realization that
you're the only one for me!

360
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,208
Yes, ever since then.

361
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,416
Subete just couldn't cut it.
It had to be you!

362
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,000
[SUBETE]
Maia, what are you saying?

363
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,041
What I mean is.
I want to Merge with you!

364
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,083
Akira!

365
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,958
No, don't!
Get away! Stop it!

366
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,750
Get away from her
this instant!

367
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,000
[grunts]

368
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,875
Genesis Merge!

369
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,250
Shout it out!

370
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,625
[BOTH]
Aquarion!

371
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:26,916
[MAIA] Yes. I never want to be
separated from you again.

372
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,250
Because. Merging
with you, feels so good!

373
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,375
[AKIRA, MAIA]
Kou!

374
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,083
[SUBETE yells]

375
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:48,500
[SUBETE grunts]

376
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,708
I hate you, Kaibuki!

377
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,625
I will finish this.
I swear on my life.

378
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,875
[KARAN] I've got
the decorations ready!

379
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,833
[MAIA] And I just want to try
throwing someone in the air!

380
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,250
[KOKONE] What are you
talking about?

381
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,166
[AKIRA] I've already bought
a daruma doll for us!

382
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,625
[KARAN]
I wanna draw in the eyes!

383
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,250
[MAIA] We're all getting
ready for the launch!

384
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,708
[KOKONE] Are you sure?
Don't get carried away, now!

385
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,291
[AKIRA]
Next: Episode Thirteen.

386
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,791
[AKIRA, KARAN, KOKONE, MAIA]
"A Great Victory! Our Savior."

387
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,416
[KOKONE] Do you guys really
think we have a shot at winning?
