1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,333
Hurry. Time is running out...

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,500
School Rumble is about
to begin. Don't miss it.

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,625
Bring it!

4
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,125
Here you go.

5
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,416
Wheel a monitor and a
player to class and set it up.

6
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,833
We've got a video to watch.

7
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,583
No problem, sir.

8
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,875
Thanks for being
such a good sport.

9
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,333
I only ask because
you seem to enjoy media.

10
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,375
Yes, sir...

11
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,541
That I do...
And especially videos.

12
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,416
Bless your heart,
you poor little thing...

13
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,125
Are you running
errands for Itoko?

14
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,583
Oh... Yes, ma'am...

15
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:21,125
I don't mind.
Please excuse me. I have to go.

16
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,375
Wow, what a sweetheart.

17
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,416
Yeah. She's well-mannered,
polite, and proper, too.

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,125
So everything you weren't
when you were her age, huh...?

19
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,125
You hellion...

20
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,000
Say that again and I'll cut you!

21
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,333
I was only teasing.

22
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,083
Oh...! Before I forget,
have you considered it...?

23
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,083
Being my model for
the art show? Well?

24
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,833
Yeah...! About that...

25
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,583
Well, I guess I'll...
do it... just 'cause it's you.

26
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,125
Thanks a bunch, Itoko.

27
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,375
Go, go! Yeah!

28
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,375
Come on, you can do it!
Go, go! Yeah!

29
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,250
Gentlemen, I have information!

30
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:00,916
Huh?

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,375
Huh??

32
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,833
I don't get it.

33
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,625
Me, neither.
What are they doing?

34
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,625
A war council.

35
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,916
Huh?

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,250
Well, Nishimoto...
Your report, please?

37
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,583
At oh-nine-hundred,

38
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,500
I learned Ms. Sasakura
is holding an art exhibit.

39
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,750
And the model who's going
to pose for her paintings?

40
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,583
Better hold onto
your seats, men...

41
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,250
According to my
top secret sources,

42
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,083
that model is none other
than Itoko Osakabe...

43
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,125
And the theme?

44
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,208
"The Female Nude
in Form and Figure."

45
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,916
They might just be paintings,

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,083
but they're still a way
to see Ms. Itoko's hot bod!

47
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,333
Mmm, those slinky curves...!

48
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,958
Oh, man! We'll see the
engine and the caboose!

49
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,166
Nishimoto's da bomb

50
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,333
when it comes to sexy
pictures and movies!

51
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,833
Yeah, the guy rules!

52
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,875
He's always able to get his
hands on adult-only videos!

53
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,041
Do you mean
pornographic materials?

54
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,375
Settle down, men.
We have a mission.

55
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,375
Ganji Nishimoto...

56
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,833
Due to his gentle nature, his
influence over the male students

57
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,875
of Class 2-C,
and his large belly,

58
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,708
he's also known as
"Buddha Nishimoto."

59
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,833
Imadori, report...
What's our target's size?

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,708
D-cup... No doubt about it.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,583
Kyousuke Imadori...
aka "Hummingbird."

62
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,083
One of Buddha Nishimoto's
most trusted lieutenants,

63
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,541
and a partner in the
famous "Video Store Pact."

64
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,666
He is also a pervert.

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,583
And Fuyuki... For your job...

66
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,916
Don't tell me...!
Surveillance, right? I'm on it!

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,583
I'll pass out pics of
Ms. Itoko to my sources!

68
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,333
Takeichi Fuyuki...
aka "White Heron."

69
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,375
Recruited with a video
entitled "Three Hot Babes."

70
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,583
He, too, is a pervert.

71
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,208
Hey, Nara... Pass these
out for me, will ya?

72
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,625
Uh...

73
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,541
Kentaro Nara... Ah, who cares?

74
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,375
Idiots.

75
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,875
I know, right?

76
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,375
We're completely surrounded
by perverts. It's pathetic.

77
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,791
But isn't the
body a work of art?

78
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,291
Maybe it's something
we should see.

79
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,666
Yeah, I guess that's true...

80
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Ms. Itoko does have
a nice figure, after all.

81
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,208
Does Karasuma want
to gawk at her, too?

82
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,583
Thank goodness...!

83
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,916
Guess Karasuma's
just not interested.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,041
It's nice to know he's not a
deviant like the other guys.

85
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:27,541
Huh?

86
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,833
So anyway.

87
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,375
Some of the other
guys aren't slimeballs.

88
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,458
Just check it out.

89
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,750
Asou...

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,291
Umezu...

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,083
Harima?

92
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,791
Wait, I thought he'd be into it.

93
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,333
Don't be fooled...

94
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,208
I bet that dirty mind of his
is chock-full of nasty thoughts.

95
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,041
Just look at the way
he's playing with his nuts.

96
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,875
These creeps are gonna
get crushed by Itoko...

97
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:52,833
They'll find out why her
nickname is "The Nutcracker."

98
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,125
I guess we can count
Hanai out. Good boy.

99
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,666
He's always so... serious.

100
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,666
We have a lot of
work ahead of us

101
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,958
if we're to reach our objective.

102
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,041
Good luck, men.
You're dismissed.

103
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,375
Fuyuki...

104
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,458
Can I keep some of these
pictures of Ms. Itoko?

105
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,791
Sure!

106
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,166
Woo hoo hoo...!
They're so sexy! Oh yeah!

107
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,500
Whoa!

108
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,250
I think the sleeping
giant has finally awakened!

109
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,208
Show me what you've got,
Imadori, right now!

110
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,791
No, they're mine!

111
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:26,083
But I'm the...
Class rep...! Do it!

112
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,916
I was wrong... He's a perv.

113
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,583
It's Yakumo!

114
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,458
Uh... Me? Are you sure?

115
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,541
Yes... You'll be fantastic.

116
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,541
I want you to take
part in my exhibit.

117
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,083
Did she say-?

118
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,416
I guess I can do it then.

119
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,708
Thanks so much.
You're a big help!

120
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,416
Then... that means...!

121
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,583
Yakumo, she's...
She's going to pose nude!

122
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,250
Her... Naked...

123
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,125
But that means
all the other guys

124
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,250
who go to the exhibit will see
nude paintings of Yakumo, too!

125
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,916
I can't let them see
my true love in the buff!

126
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,875
Hey!

127
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,708
Oh, what should I do...?
The exhibit...

128
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,458
Huh?

129
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,958
Nude...

130
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,791
What's with him?

131
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,750
What...?! You're gonna be part

132
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,041
of Ms. Sasakura's
exhibit, Yakumo?

133
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:24,916
Yes.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,458
Wow, that is so cool...!

135
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,000
Maybe I should help out,
too! It'd be fun!

136
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,916
Really...? Thank you...

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,958
I'd be so nervous
doing it alone.

138
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,583
Nothing to worry about, Sis!

139
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,666
We'll just grin and bear it!

140
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,291
That means...!

141
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,875
Tenma's gonna pose nude!

142
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,541
Her... Naked... Wait!

143
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,416
But that means all
the other guys who go to

144
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,875
the exhibit will see nude
paintings of Tenma, too!

145
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,666
I can't let them see
my true love in the buff!

146
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,583
Oh, what should I do?!

147
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,750
...so Star B appears
as a double image

148
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,416
when Star A is aligned with it.

149
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,708
The scientific term
is microlensing.

150
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,375
Does everyone follow?
Any questions?

151
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,916
Wow, something's really
inspired a lot of you...

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,166
Wish I knew what it was.

153
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,625
She is so...

154
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,541
Pass it on. The opening
date's been announced.

155
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,916
When...? Where?

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,416
It's next Saturday
at the Yagami Gallery.

157
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,708
Roger that. Got any new info
about the featured paintings?

158
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,250
Rumor has it they'll be
stylish, sexy, and eye-popping.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,416
Tenma...

160
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,250
I heard you were going to
be in Ms. Sasakura's exhibit.

161
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,541
Oh yeah!

162
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,375
I'm gonna show...
off... what... I've... got!

163
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,208
She's gonna do it...

164
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,125
I can't wait!

165
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,625
Everyone's gonna
see her goodies.

166
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,083
Oh, Tenma...
You know not what you do.

167
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,791
Hey, Sis.

168
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,083
Here. You forgot
your lunch again.

169
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,208
Thanks, you're the best!

170
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,250
So you're going to be in
the art exhibit, too, huh?

171
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,375
Yes.

172
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,500
Good luck pulling
it all off, Yakumo.

173
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,291
Wow... Just think
of all the exposure!

174
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,416
All the exposure?

175
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,416
Oh, sweet, precious Yakumo,
what am I supposed to do?!

176
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,583
Did you know they're going

177
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,750
to sell prints of
all the paintings, too?

178
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,541
No...! How cool!

179
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,916
I know. I might even
be tempted to buy one.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,833
Why stop with just one?

181
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,000
That's it!

182
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:37,791
I'll get there before
all the other guys

183
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,708
and buy up all the prints!

184
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,208
What a genius plan!

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,250
I miss those days.

186
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,541
Getting misty-eyed
over our wayward youth?

187
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,583
I believe someone
is getting soft.

188
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,041
Maybe. Some of my students
remind me of us at that age...

189
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,958
Makes me realize that nothing
ever really changes, you know?

190
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,250
You and I. We've
been through a lot.

191
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,916
Yes. Yes, we have...

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,125
Good times and bad, we've
stuck together through them all.

193
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,250
Yes, that's affirmative.
Good work.

194
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,666
We strike at nine a.m...
this Saturday!

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,958
It's been said that "art is
in the eye of the beholder."

196
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,958
But the guys from
Class 2-C are looking

197
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,250
with another part of the body.

198
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,000
Get ready, men...! This is it!

199
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,666
Ms. Sasakura...

200
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,250
Congratulations on your exhibit.

201
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,166
Glad you could
make it... Thank you.

202
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,208
All guests need
to sign in, please!

203
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,708
Tenma... Hey, you guys are
workin' pretty hard, huh?

204
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,125
Actually, I knew it
would be pretty easy...

205
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,041
And to think Yakumo was
too nervous to do it alone.

206
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,958
Oh, excuse me,
you forgot to sign in!

207
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,208
I can't believe it!
We didn't see anything!

208
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,416
The only ass at
that exhibit was you.

209
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,875
I'm not sure I understand
what she meant,

210
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,541
but Ms. Itoko told me
this the day of the exhibit...

211
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,375
"Nothing ever really changes
in life, especially boys."

212
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,958
You want to put on
a staged wedding?

213
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,000
Uh-huh... It's just to
advertise the church, you see...

214
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,083
We'll stage a wedding,
take lots of pictures,

215
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,291
and use the best
photos in a brochure.

216
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,750
And so... you want
me to play the bride?

217
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,916
Of course, you'd be perfect.

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,916
Hey, are you gonna get
married, Ms. Yakumo?!

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,541
Can I be your flower girl?!

220
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,416
Can I? Pretty please,
can I, Ms. Yakumo?

221
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,416
Well?

222
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,416
Um... But who-

223
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,833
Wait, let me guess.

224
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,166
You want to know who's
playing the groom...?

225
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,458
Don't ya?

226
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,416
I'm a plane! Vroom!

227
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,791
No need to worry...!

228
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,625
A co-worker at my part-time
job would be perfect!

229
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,791
It's time, love muffin!

230
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,958
I-I'm sorry, Yakumo...

231
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,458
My co-worker couldn't
make it, so Hanai volunteered.

232
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,291
Do you want to just call it off?

233
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,041
We can, but we'll
miss the deadline

234
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,750
to get the brochure printed.

235
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,416
It's okay.

236
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,541
Yeah...? Really...!
Thank you...! You're the best!

237
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,458
Okay, here we go.

238
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,958
Now, Hanai, I need you
to give me a serious look.

239
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,250
Huh...? Serious, you say...?

240
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,583
How 'bout this?

241
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,208
Oh...! That's great...!

242
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,708
You'll be just perfect!

243
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,750
It'll be even better
if you don't talk!

244
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,958
Flattery will get
you everywhere!

245
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,541
You're a real moron, Asou!

246
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,541
I can't believe you didn't
want to be the groom!

247
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,083
What...?! Are you crazy?!

248
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,375
Look, I wanted to do it,
but I couldn't get off...

249
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,666
Your orders, please?

250
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,000
Man, I would have just quit!

251
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,833
Dude, you could have
been in a picture with that

252
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,291
hot Tsukamoto chick when
she's wearing a wedding dress!

253
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,458
Yeah, you jackass!

254
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,583
Are you guys ever
gonna order anything?

255
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,708
The oolong tea you ordered, sir.

256
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,916
Keep it cold.

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,625
I'll be back after
some ass-kicking.

258
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,875
Huh?

259
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,375
Now that blowhard Hanai's
gonna be the groom.

260
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:50,166
Not for long...! The nerve
of that beardless geek...!

261
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,916
No one's good enough
to play Tenma's husband!

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,500
No one that is... but me!

263
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,958
She's beautiful...

264
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,458
That does it!

265
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,458
I can't hold my
feelings in anymore!

266
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,125
If I do, I'm going to burst...!

267
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,250
Here... goes nothing!

268
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,791
Oh, Yakumo...
I must tell you something.

269
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,458
Stop the wedding! Now!

270
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:47,416
Huh?

271
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,958
Hail... Mary!

272
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,791
Let's roll.

273
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,958
Hold it!

274
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,791
Explain yourself, Harima!

275
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,875
Back off, Four Eyes...

276
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,083
Go find yourself
another girl, got it?

277
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,333
He's bad...!
Hope he kicks his butt!

278
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,166
Do it...! Beat him, Four Eyes!

279
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,875
Another girl? I think not...

280
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,833
There will never be a woman
more incredible than she is!

281
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,375
We agree on somethin'.

282
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,791
This shouldn't take long.

283
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,083
Now take a hike,
beardless boy...

284
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,250
I'm gonna be her
husband! Not you!

285
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,791
Wrong!

286
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,666
I never thought it
would end... like this...

287
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,041
Had enough yet?

288
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,833
Oh, Harima!

289
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:08,041
Harima, dear!

290
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,625
Tenma, no!

291
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,583
What...?! How...?!
But you were out cold!

292
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,625
I'll never stop coming back,
jerk...! Because I'm in love!

293
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,916
So say your prayers!

294
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,083
Had enough yet?

295
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,250
Oh, Hanai!

296
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,041
Hanai, dear!

297
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,791
My Yakumo!

298
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,083
What...?! I thought
I broke your face!

299
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,750
Never! My love makes me strong!

300
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,125
All right...! Do you really
love this girl that much?

301
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,583
Answer me!

302
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,125
Of course!

303
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,708
She can only have one guy in
her life and that's gonna be me!

304
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,208
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

305
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,458
but that's a position
I'm going to be filling shortly!

306
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,291
Not after...
my Hurricane Dragon Punch!

307
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,541
Mere child's play...

308
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,125
compared to my Hundred
Flowers Tiger Attack!

309
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,333
Gentlemen, the shoot
has been completed!

310
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,833
No thanks to you two.

311
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,291
You're...?

312
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,291
I'm Yakumo Tsukamoto.

313
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,916
You're...?

314
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,166
Stepping up to be the man

315
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,541
that you couldn't be
in this blessed union.

316
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,500
You guys were fighting for

317
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,041
so long that I had
to find someone,

318
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,750
and Akira was the
only one available.

319
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,250
Yakumo and I are going out
to dinner now. Take care.

320
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,375
Thanks for all the help today.

321
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,125
You guys were great.
See you in class.

322
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,541
Look, dude, I'm... sorry. Okay?

323
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,666
Forget it...

324
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,875
Hey, you never told me...

325
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,166
So why did you come
to the church anyway?

326
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,833
Meteor shower?

327
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,083
Yeah...! And it's going
to be visible in a few hours!

328
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,916
I'm so there... When?

329
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,958
According to Ms. Itoko,
tomorrow night.

330
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,041
Hey, we should all get
together and watch it!

331
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,041
Sounds like fun!

332
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,166
Where would be the best place?

333
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,416
Yagami Shrine.

334
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,458
Perfect! I'll get Yakumo
to make us box lunches!

335
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,458
Yeah! Free food, baby!

336
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,583
Meteor shower, huh?

337
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,958
Yakumo... You're the only
shooting star for me...

338
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,541
Better start making my list.

339
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,458
For what?

340
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,416
All the wishes I want to make...

341
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,708
If you see a falling star,
your wish will come true

342
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,416
if you repeat it three times
before the star burns out.

343
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,625
Oh, so that's how it works?

344
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,375
I better think of some wishes.

345
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,375
Don't just stop with some.
Think of a lot.

346
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,625
There'll be plenty of shooting
stars to make wishes on!

347
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,916
Is wishing three
times even possible...?

348
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,416
Stars fall pretty quickly.

349
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,666
Come on!

350
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,666
With that attitude you
won't get any wishes.

351
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,416
Well, I'm game if you guys are.

352
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,375
So speak up, what's
everybody gonna wish for?

353
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,916
Uh...

354
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,708
I hope the sky's
clear tomorrow night.

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,541
Please stay clear, skies!

356
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,333
Right...

357
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,083
Yeah, I guess
we'll have to cancel.

358
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,666
The weatherman said it's
going to pour all night...

359
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,291
Yeah, I wanted to see it, too.

360
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,541
It's not fair.

361
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,958
How are...

362
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,041
the wishes going to come
true if I can't see the stars?

363
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,625
Here, Sis. You don't
want to catch cold.

364
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,458
What's the fuss, Iori...?
Is there something outside?

365
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,750

00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,833
Ow!

376
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,250
You sleep... like a log.

377

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,125
I want my sister to have
a life full of happiness.

380
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,958
I want a nice, soft pillow.

381
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,458
I've been growing my beard
long to impress Tenma!

382
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,625
But when I woke up this morning,

383
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,791
someone had cut it
all off...! Who did it?!

384
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,083
They'll be takin'
a dirt nap real soon!

385
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,916
Next time on School Rumble:

386
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,791
"That's Gone! This is
Gone! Options, Gone!"...

387
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,666
Did you do it,
spoiled rich girl?!
