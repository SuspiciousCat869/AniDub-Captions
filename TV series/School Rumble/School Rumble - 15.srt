1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:11,666
Ooh, I love School Rumble,
and it's comin' up next!

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,583
Oh, thanks.

3
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,416
Wow, what a scorcher, huh?

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,666
I mean, could it get any hotter?

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,916
Yeah... Is there
something wrong, Mikoto?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,458
Huh?

7
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,625
Mikoto isn't really
all that pretty.

8
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,458
No, don't be silly... I'm fine.

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,583
Well, it's not a good idea

10
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,583
to keep things all
bottled up inside...

11
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,166
It's just not like you.

12
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,250
Yeah... You're right as usual.

13
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,916
It was all my fault.

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,833
Forgive me, Harima!

15
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,208
It doesn't matter.

16
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,458
Wow! You've really
changed your style!

17
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,208
Yeah...

18
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,750
It's great, Tazawa!

19
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,958
Fantastic...! You just
keep getting better!

20
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,208
Thank you, sir...

21
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,666
By the way, it's Harima.

22
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,083
I love the way
you've laid this out!

23
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,500
You've got a real flair
for the dramatic...!

24
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,708
You're going places,
kid, no doubt about it!

25
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,041
Man, I only wish... it was
actually this easy with Tenma.

26
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,791
It's too bad real life
isn't more like comic books.

27
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,125
Maybe then I'd actually
have a chance with Ten...

28
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,166
Damn it...! I can't let Blondie
see what's in these pages...!

29
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,166
There's no telling
what Tenma would do

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,583
if she ever found out
what I've been writing...

31
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,458
Oh, Harima!

32
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,125
How could you do such a thing?

33
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,250
That spoiled little princess
is sure to spill the beans!

34
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,291
I just know it!

35
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,083
Hey, wait a minute!
Come back here!

36
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,041
What the hell?!

37
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,833
She must be after my pages!

38
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,250
Why are you running
away from me?!

39
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,416
Aghhhh...! I can't
let her see my work!

40
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,541
Hey! Slow down!

41
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,333
Ugh.

42
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,500
Dammit!

43
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,916
Eri's still not picking
up her cell phone.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,416
And I still have no
idea why she laid into me

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,666
like that when we were
over at Tenma's place.

46
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,291
Whatever it is, it seems to have
something to do with Harima.

47
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,000
Move it, sister!

48
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,125
Harima!

49
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,958
Hey...! Can I talk to you?

50
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,416
I hope you don't mind that
I dragged you in here like this.

51
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,625
Uh, no, not at all.

52
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,000
What is this?

53
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,416
What's going on...?
Is she after my manuscript, too?

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,791
Well, see, it's kinda
like this... uh...

55
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,500
Ah, hell, I know
there's something up

56
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,791
and I need to know what it is.

57
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,583
I was right!

58
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,708
Everyone's after my drawings!

59
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,458
Look, Harima...

60
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:48,250
Crap...! I'm surrounded...! How
did they find out about this?

61
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,166
Gosh... she really
is pretty, isn't she?

62
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,833
But why does she look so guilty?

63
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,541
I'm very sorry...

64
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,791
I really didn't mean
to interrupt your date.

65
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,166
You've got it all wrong...

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,916
This isn't what it looks like,

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,333
we just had something
important to discuss...

68
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,916
Wait!

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,083
I confess!

70
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,625
I draw comics! Don't judge me!

71
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,375
Harima!

72
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,125
Get the tab!

73
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,541
Get the tab?

74
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,875
You can't get blood
from a stone, silly broad.

75
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,125
I said stop!!

76
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,750
But does she?! Of course not!

77
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,041
Because she's an
inconsiderate blonde brat!

78
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,458
Wait a minute!

79
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,666
Why am I running away
from her? Oh, well. Whatever.

80
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,416
She's fast all right,

81
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,916
but you should never
underestimate a black belt!

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,875
She's not getting away from me!

83
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,708
Ahh, that hurts... Huh?

84
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,833
Damn it!

85
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,833
I wonder if she gave up?

86
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,791
Hey, Hanai... Guess who's back?

87
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,250
Yeah, I really messed
up big time today.

88
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,750
Wait...! What happened to you?!

89
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,333
I ripped my dress so
I came back here to change.

90
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,666
Tell me what happened!

91
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,625
I tripped and fell, that's all.

92
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,166
You're not getting
off that easy. Hey!

93
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,750
'Scuse me!

94
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,541
Would you mind giving
these back to Mikoto?

95
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,375
She forgot them
when she ran away.

96
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,958
What did you do, you pig?!

97
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,125
Huh?

98
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,375
I don't know what's
going on, Big Man,

99
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,750
but you don't want to start
anything you can't finish.

100
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,333
I don't know what's
going on either,

101
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,083
and normally I'd much
prefer to talk things out

102
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,875
like civilized human
beings... but you...

103
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,625
You're a greasy punk who
only understands violence...

104
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,833
I think it's about time
somebody taught you a lesson,

105
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,958
and it looks like I'm elected.

106
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,708
Then bring it on.

107
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,208
Hey...! My manuscript!

108
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,875
Tough luck, Shakespeare!

109
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,375
Why didn't he dodge that one?

110
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,125
That's why!

111
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:56,250
You... you bastard...!
Why did you pull your kick?

112
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,041
I didn't give a
crap about you...

113
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,750
I didn't think you were worth
wasting any real effort on...

114
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,083
But I hate it when people
don't take me seriously.

115
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,166
So, Big Man... bring it.

116
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,125
Hmph!

117
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,791
Well, that suits me just fine...

118
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,958
'cause I'm done holding back.

119
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,416
Yes?

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,000
Hey, Eri, it's me!

121
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,208
Um, about tomorrow's
fireworks show...

122
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,875
We haven't set the place
or time yet, have we?

123
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,875
No.

124
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,208
How about we meet
a little early,

125
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,541
say, five o'clock in
front of the train station?

126
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,041
I guess.

127
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,250
Okay then, five o'clock it is.
Don't be late now!

128
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,250
Don't worry about me...!
Just don't be late yourself!

129
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,166
Who, me?

130
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,333
When have I ever been late?

131
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,541
I'm talking about real
time... not Tenma Time.

132
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,125
Hm...? Tenma Time?
What's Tenma Time?

133
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,375
Coming at five-thirty
for a five o'clock date.

134
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,791
What are you talking about?!
I've never done that before!

135
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,916
If I'm late, I'll treat you to
all the ice cream you can eat!

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,541
That'd be... about ten gallons.

137
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,541
But, just to prove
what a good friend I am,

138
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,625
I'll help you eat it
so you don't get fat...

139
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,000
So, uh, Tenma, listen.

140
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,208
Hm?

141
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,916
Thanks.

142
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,000
See you later.

143
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,750
I'm sorry, Tenma...

144
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,625
I don't think...
I'll be able to make it.

145
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,333
I wonder if Eri's
coming to the fireworks...

146
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,250
Tenma must've asked her.

147
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,250
Huh?

148
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,583
A text message...?
Maybe it's from Eri!

149
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:06,333
Tomorrow...?! It can't be...!
Why now, of all times?!

150
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,250
He's coming back...
I don't believe it.

151
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,833
How do you do...?
I'm Masahiro Kouzu...

152
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,208
and I'm going to
be your new tutor.

153
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,333
Oh, come on,
don't be such a stick.

154
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,208
It's not like we
haven't met before.

155
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,875
Uh... right...
Okay, so shall we begin?

156
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,916
Kouzu had always
been a brainiac...

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,333
even way back
in middle school...

158
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,583
And since our
parents were friends...

159
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,625
he got roped
into being my tutor.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,541
Oh... that's wrong...

161
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,708
And that... That's wrong, too.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,083
Okay, jackass,
I get it! I'm stupid!!

163
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,416
It really pisses me off
when you just say it like that!

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,750
Can't you find a more tactful
way to call me an idiot?

165
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,916
Sorry...

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,416
"Sorry"...? You just
roll over that easy?

167
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,583
If you're gonna
work with me here,

168
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,833
you need to join my
dojo and toughen up!

169
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,458
That way, we'll be even!

170
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,875
What?!

171
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,125
To my surprise...
he really did join.

172
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,791
I thought being smart was easy
for Kouzu, but I was wrong...

173
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,416
He was a hard worker...

174
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,375
And for some reason,
watching him work so hard...

175
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,500
made me want to study harder.

176
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:33,208
It turned out that studying
was more fun than I thought.

177
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,625
A lot more fun...
thanks to Kouzu.

178
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,458
And so...

179
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,208
But once the exam was over...

180
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,833
We weren't teacher
and student anymore.

181
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,750
We'd pass each
other in the hallway...

182
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,208
and we wouldn't even say hello.

183
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,666
Aw, crap!

184
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,291
I don't have time for this!

185
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,083
It's just so sudden...

186
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,416
He's coming back...

187
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,750
He's coming back!

188
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,791
But the party's at the
same time as the fireworks!

189
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,333
Why does my life have to suck?!

190
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,333
Whaddaya mean... you can't come?

191
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,916
I'm so sorry, Tenma,
but something's come up

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,375
and I can't get out of it.

193
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,375
But what am I going to tell Eri?

194
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,083
I'll call her myself. Okay?
I'm really sorry, Tenma!

195
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,458
Okay... Talk to you later.

196
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,041
I wonder if she'll even
answer the phone...

197
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,041
Yes?

198
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,291
Oh, uh, hey, Eri, it's Mikoto!

199
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,500
What is it?

200
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,375
Uh, well, I was just
calling to let you know

201
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,583
that I won't be there tomorrow
because something's come up.

202
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,291
I see...

203
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,416
So you want to break our date,

204
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,625
no questions
asked, is that it...?

205
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,500
What's going on?

206
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,083
Uh, nothing!

207
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,916
Tell the truth...

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,375
This is about a guy, isn't it?

209
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,375
Yeah.

210
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,666
See, there's this
guy that I like...

211
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,791
and I've liked
him since last year...

212
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,958
And well...

213
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,833
I was too scared to ever tell
him how I felt about him...

214
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,333
and I've regretted
it ever since!

215
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,500
It's been six months!
You have to understand...!

216
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,083
This could be my last chance.
I have to tell him how I feel!

217
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,666
I understand.

218
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,708
This guy is more important
than your best friends.

219
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,833
Why, you stuck-up, snotty
little trash-talking tramp!

220
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,083
I can't believe you
would have the nerve

221
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,000
to judge me like that,
after you insulted me!

222
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:13,916
Aghhh, that's it!

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,125
No more nice Mikoto!

224
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,291
I'm sick of you always
playing the victim!

225
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,791
The number you have dialed
has been switched off...

226
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,250
Good...! I didn't want
to talk to her anyway!

227
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to bed!

228
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,875
Maybe Eri's right
about me. But still...

229
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,875
I can't let him get
away a second time.

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Maybe I should have had

231
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,583
something special
done with my hair...

232
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,625
No, no... I wouldn't want to
look like I'm trying too hard...

233
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,083
This is it.

234
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,958
Something about meeting in
a bar makes me kinda nervous.

235
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,333
Just think of it
like a karate match.

236
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,083
Stay calm, Mikoto...
Stay calm...

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,625
I have to tell him...
I have to tell him everything.

238
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,583
Hey, Mikoto...! Over here!

239
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,166
Take a look at this joker!
He hasn't changed a bit!

240
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,750
Hey, good to see you, Mikoto.

241
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,458
You're kidding me!

242
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,916
That's Mikoto...?

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,083
I guess you forgot to tell me

244
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,291
your tutoring student
was such a cutie!

245
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,458
Unbelievable, huh...?

246
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,541
Who'da thunk that this timid
little mouse would bring home

247
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,291
such a gorgeous
babe for a girlfriend?

248
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,083
What...? What?

249
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,375
It's a lie.

250
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,625
Please.

251
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,958
It can't be...

252
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,208
But how...

253
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:18,458
How could I...
have been... such a fool?

254
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,041
Well, hey there,
I'm Mikoto Suou!

255
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,791
If it wasn't for Kouzu,
I wouldn't be in high school!

256
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,458
Wow, way to go, Teach,
she sure is a looker!

257
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,416
Woo, woo!

258
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,250
What a gorgeous couple!

259
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,916
I can't believe I'm laughing...

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,291
Ha... I really am a fool...

261
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:44,708
I hate this... To have it
end this way... I hate it...

262
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,250
You want me to go out with you?

263
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,791
I'm sorry... but I'm afraid
I'm going to have to say no.

264
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,458
Bye!

265
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,458
She got asked out again?

266
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:10,125
I know, right! It's like
no guys can resist her!

267
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,375
Don't you think
she's a little stuck up?

268
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,708
Oh, absolutely!

269
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,833
She totally
thinks she's all that!

270
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,875
Hey...! Sawachika, right?

271
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:20,750
Huh?

272
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,791
What's up?

273
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,083
Never seen you
around here before.

274
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,916
Uh... well, I was just...

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,791
I thought I might watch a
movie by myself for a change.

276
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,208
Really?

277
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,666
'Cause you don't strike me
as the horror movie type.

278
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,625
Huh...? Oh...! I didn't...

279
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,125
Well, maybe I'll
just head on home then.

280
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,708
You can come over to my house...

281
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,875
If you're free.

282
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm making beef stew.

283
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,083
Of course, you have
to carry the groceries.

284
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,791
I mean, it's only fair.

285
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,416
Hey, gorgeous,
have a beer with me?

286
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,625
So you're Mikoto's
friend from school, huh?

287
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,625
Lookin' good there,
sweet cheeks!

288
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,916
Hey, reality check, Tetsu...!

289
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,875
You're twenty years too old
and she's way outta your league!

290
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,083
What are you talking about?

291
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,750
I still got the old moves!

292
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,416
You just come on out with me
and see if I don't, girlie!

293
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,583
Ah, well, that's very kind...

294
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,083
But I can't!

295
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,916
In your face, dude!

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,666
Oh my god, she got me!

297
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,958
Way to go, Sawachika!
Talk about entertainment!

298
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,125
Glad you insisted
on coming over!

299
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,166
Are you nuts? You're the one
who dragged me here, freak!

300
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,166
Oh, wow.

301
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,000
Never thought you could
make a face like that.

302
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,416
Yeah, well... it's none
of your business... is it?

303
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,916
You're right...

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,625
But if you've got that kind
of spunk, it makes me wonder

305
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,458
why you just smile and put up

306
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,416
with all the dirt that
gets dished on you...

307
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,583
I sure wouldn't.

308
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,291
She knows about that,
and she still...?

309
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,750
What do you mean?

310
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,666
You don't know what you're
talking about and besides...

311
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,833
it's none of...

312
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,791
...of my business,
I know, you said that...

313
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,750
Sorry, I'm afraid
that's my nature.

314
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,708
Oh, so that's your nature?

315
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,375
Yep, that's what I said.

316
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,000
I see.

317
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,750
You've never seen the
summer fireworks display...?

318
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,375
Then you are so coming
with me to the next one.

319
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,083
My friends and I have
a special viewing spot...

320
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,958
You know the
Yagami Shrine, right?

321
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,416
Just go through the
woods in the back.

322
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,666
But you have to be careful,

323
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,291
'cause the path is
narrow and pretty rugged.

324
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,625
But it's worth it...

325
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,416
'cause when you
get to the end...

326
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,125
Mikoto... you came.

327
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,458
Yeah.

328
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,625
Am I... bothering you?

329
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,083
No...

330
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,083
It's just...

331
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,583
What?

332
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,000
Nothing.

333
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,500
Maybe I should go... for now.

334
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,000
They're pretty, aren't they?

335
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,416
Yeah.

336
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,875
Guess what?

337
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,458
I got myself dumped.

338
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,208
Any guy who'd
dump you is an idiot.

339
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,083
Thanks... but...

340
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,833
it was all one-sided
on my part anyway...

341
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,458
And of all the
people in the world,

342
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,333
you're the one
here to comfort me.

343
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,583
Huh...! What a waste, the two of
us watching fireworks alone...

344
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,333
Hey, Tenma, it's me.

345
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,583
I'm at the fireworks
with Mikoto...

346
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,458
Are you coming?

347
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,416
Hey, you guys!

348
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,250
I brought the rest of the gang!

349
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,583
Wow! The view from
up here is incredible!

350
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,291
Tenma! You're late!

351
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,875
I'm sorry, I got lost.

352
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,041
You should be used
to it by now, Eri.

353
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,416
So pretty!

354
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,625
Let's go toward the light!

355
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,958
Tenma, look out!

356
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,291
What are you,
a freakin' June bug?

357
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,666
What the hell
were you thinking?!

358
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,458
Are you all right?

359
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,708
Okay, remind me again why the
hell we're fighting up here?

360
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,000
Damned if I can remember.

361
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,458
The gang gets together for
an outing for the tea club!

362
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,583
Wait, is that Harima
talking to Yakumo?

363
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:21,208
After Eri and Mikoto, now he's
chasing after my little sister?

364
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,083
Big sister is going to have
something to say about that!

365
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,250
Next time on School Rumble!

366
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,791
You sure are a player,
aren't you, Harima?
