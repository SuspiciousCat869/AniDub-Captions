1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,291
School Rumble is
about to begin after this.

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,916
Hey, is this yours? Holy crap!

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,750
I actually spoke to Tsukamoto!

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,625
This must be my lucky day!

5
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,833
Itoko! Pass me the pepper!

6
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,166
A "please" would be nice,
and that's Ms.Itoko to you.

7
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,541
Come on!

8
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,500
You don't really expect
me to call you that, do you?

9
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,916
Of course I do.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,333
And when you learn some
manners, I'll pass the pepper.

11
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,875
Pretty please, Ms. Itoko!

12
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,250
Much better.

13
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,291
Geez! It doesn't
matter to you, does it?

14
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,083
I mean, it's embarrassing
for me to call you "Ms."

15
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,750
Well, get used to it.

16
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,083
By the way Kenji,

17
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,125
there's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

18
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:32,291
Have you made any progress
asking out Tenma Tsukamoto yet?

19
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,000
What?

20
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,583
Why would you ask me a question
like that all of a sudden?

21
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,500
Well, what do you know?

22
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,958
This pepper shaker was empty!

23
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,750
Don't try to change the subject.

24
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,166
Since I'm acting
as your guardian,

25
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,583
I need to know what's
going on in your life, Kenji.

26
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,375
If I'm the one paying the bills,

27
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,083
and you're living under my roof,

28
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,458
and in a comfortable
apartment, I might add,

29
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:54,000
I think that alone gives me
more than enough right to know.

30
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,500
Damn! I move in with my cousin,

31
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,916
and all of a sudden she
thinks she's my mother.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,625
I've got to give you
credit for leaving home

33
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,250
and trying to live on your own,

34
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,458
but when you found out
how hard that was--

35
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,333
Have you forgotten I was the
only one willing to take you in?

36
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,916
Well, don't you think you
owe me something for that?

37
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,750
I can't believe it.
You're forcing me?

38
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,708
You catch on quick.

39
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:18,458
But I'm sure you're so grateful
you would've told me anyway.

40
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,541
You've got to admit,
she's really cute.

41
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,083
She's got that whole
"girl-next-door" vibe about her.

42
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,083
A real traditional
beauty, I'd say.

43
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,250
Huh?

44
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,958
I bet that's what
you like about her, huh?

45
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,083
What? My wallet!

46
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,416
How did you--? When did you--?

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,333
You only have two
dollars to your name,

48
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,416
but somehow found the money
to laminate this photo. My, my.

49
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,291
Uh, that picture, it isn't mine!

50
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,500
It belongs to one of my buddies!

51
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,500
He asked me to keep
it for him! I swear!

52
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,833
I guess this fake ID in here
doesn't belong to you, either.

53
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,875
What's the matter?

54
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,250
Cat got your tongue?
Oh, never mind.

55
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,750
That school boy stammer
of yours says plenty.

56
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,083
Let's see.

57
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,666
The ideal date for the
typical girl-next-door

58
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,000
would be the
typical boy-next-door.

59
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,583
But a bad-boy with a goatee?

60
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,541
Not so much, I'm afraid.

61
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,541
I better eat this
before this gets cold!

62
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,375
Kenji, do you want
a little fried rice

63
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,916
with your black pepper?

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,916
Well, that looked painful.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That was nothing!

66
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,916
You know, I've got reasons for
the way I dress and my goatee!

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,125
So tell me.

68
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,166
No! You're being
really nosy, you know that?

69
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,708
Just stop it!
You're acting all weird.

70
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,208
It's freaking me out!

71
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,375
Normally, you don't give a
damn about what girls I date,

72
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,750
but now you can't stop
asking me about my love life.

73
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,958
What's the deal?

74
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,875
Don't you have
anything else better to do?

75
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,416
Hey, you're up to
something, aren't you?

76
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, maybe.

77
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,833
Honestly, I'm just curious why
you're interested in this girl.

78
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,083
My cousin brags for years
that he's "his own man"

79
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,583
and not tied down to one girl

80
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,583
and now there's one
he can't even talk to.

81
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,750
Sounds like love to me.

82
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,208
I'm concerned about you.

83
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,916
Come on.

84
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,875
I can't believe you're
making me do this!

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,750
Alright! I'll tell you.

86
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,416
This is how it all
started with her.

87
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,708
Two orders of miso pork, please!

88
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,708
No pork for me,
Sis, just veggies.

89
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,875
Well, come on,
let's hear it. Spit it out.

90
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,791
Wow, you don't beat
around the bush, do you?

91
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,041
Why don't you
admit you're worried

92
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,041
about your little cousin?

93
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,875
Fine. I'll admit it.
I'm worried.

94
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,750
Hmph. I'm so touched.
I'll never forget it.

95
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,625
I was fifteen the
first time I saw her.

96
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,375
All the punks in this
neighborhood are so weak!

97
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,958
What I wouldn't give
for a real challenge!

98
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,916
Please, please don't hurt me!

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,625
Keep quiet now, sweetie!

100
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,208
Excuse me, Miss? Are you okay?

101
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,083
Didn't matter who it was.

102
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,125
I just wanted to
beat someone up.

103
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,125
Uh.

104
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,791
You saved my life.
Thank you so much.

105
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,541
And that's how I met her.

106
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,916
I've been hooked
ever since then.

107
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,333
I'm gonna carve
you like a turkey!

108
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,208
You say somethin'?

109
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,666
Uh, are you--

110
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,875
You're-you're bleeding!

111
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,791
I didn't even feel it!

112
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,208
Great, what now?

113
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,541
Can't call the police.

114
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,291
With my record, they'd
just haul me off to jail.

115
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,583
You're coming with me, 'kay?

116
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,916
Just taking you to a safe place.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,208
I won't try anything
funny, I swear.

118
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,916
Man, she's light.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,291
Does this kid eat anything?

120
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,625
You know, this is the kind

121
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,875
of thing I could
get into trouble for.

122
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,458
She looks so innocent.

123
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,375
Just who are you, mystery girl?

124
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,291
I can't eat anymore. I'm full.

125
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,416
Uh! She's just a kid!

126
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,875
Hello? Come on!

127
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,916
Get up and get
out of here, okay?

128
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,875
Can't believe I'm saying this,

129
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,708
but up close, this girl
is actually pretty cute.

130
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,791
She's cute enough to kiss.

131
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,250
Sorry, kid,
but can you blame me?

132
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,208
Your lips just look so kissable.

133
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,416
If another guy
was in my position,

134
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,333
he'd do the same thing, right?

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Arggh! What the--? What is this?

136
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,166
Some kind of joke or something?

137
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,583
Pretending to be half-asleep?

138
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,083
Knock it off!

139
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,500
Believe it or not,
I'm not as dumb as I look!

140
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,375
I love you.

141
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,666
Huh?

142
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,125
I love you.

143
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,333
Are--? Are you really serious?

144
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,083
Uh. Of course you're
not really serious!

145
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,666
You're still half
asleep, aren't you?

146
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,125
Uh, I'm sorry!

147
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,250
Wh-where am I?

148
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,750
Look, I know what
you're thinking, okay?

149
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,875
This looks weird.

150
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,708
But before you
scream or say anything,

151
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,541
please let me
explain a few things!

152
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,375
Hey, no need to get physical!

153
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,708
Look, you're not
making this any easier

154
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,958
by not saying anything,
you know that, kid?

155
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,250
Hey!

156
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,791
Just listen to me, okay?

157
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,041
Nothing happened.
I didn't do anything, I swear.

158
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,750
What the hell was that?

159
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,541
This--this girl.

160
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,000
I love her.

161
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,833
Um, thanks, for saving me.

162
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,625
I really wish I could
be more grateful,

163
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,250
but you tried to
take advantage of me,

164
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,333
so thanks for
nothing, Mr. Pervert!

165
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,583
I have to see her again,
but how can I?

166
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,958
I know.

167
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,500
I'll just become somebody else.

168
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,500
Someone she won't recognize.

169
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,625
Yeah, that's it.

170
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,708
So you started
dressing like a thug

171
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,250
and went with the
old goatee disguise.

172
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,708
How original.

173
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,416
I couldn't think
of anything else!

174
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,541
It was the best that I could do!

175
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,000
You know how hard
it is to live like this?

176
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,000
Hiding your face
from the one you love?

177
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,583
Try to understand!

178
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,958
I understand!

179
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,625
It's that girl's
fault if you ask me!

180
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,875
You know, for some reason, that
story sounds really familiar.

181
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,666
Itoko! You knew
she was back there!

182
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,875
Come on, it's reunion time.

183
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,875
Don't do it! No!

184
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,250
Huh?

185
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,708
One order of miso pork!
Bon appetit!

186
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,125
Yay!

187
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,250
I'm gonna eat
the whole thing!

188
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,291
Delish!

189
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,458
Damn Itoko!
She knew Tenma was there!

190
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,416
She just wanted to embarrass the
hell out of me in front of her!

191
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,583
Man, that Ms. Itoko's something.

192
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,375
Talk about a real woman!

193
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,541
Wouldn't it be great

194
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,416
if all female teachers
looked that sexy?

195
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,375
Huh?

196
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,083
Looks like someone left a
dirty footprint on this wall.

197
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,416
How thoughtless!
I'll clean it up.

198
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,416
Did Harima seem scared of her?

199
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,750
Yeah, but why
would a thug like him

200
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,583
be scared of a teacher like her?

201
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,541
Okay, now it's all clean.

202
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,291
Please have some.

203
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,416
We've brewed the
Tea Club's famous milk tea,

204
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,416
plus there's raspberry pie.

205
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,708
It's delicious.

206
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,333
Think so? That's great.

207
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,333
I thought that you might
not like your tea too sweet,

208
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,750
so I took a chance.

209
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,583
I sprinkled in a little
cinnamon to enhance the flavor.

210
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,208
What do you say, Yakumo?

211
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,916
Does this mean you're interested
in joining the Tea Club?

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,750
I know I speak for everyone when
I say we'd love to have you.

213
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,541
Right, Miss Itoko?

214
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,541
She'd make a fine
addition to the club.

215
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,750
Look, I'm just the advisor

216
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,208
and I really have no
say in its operation.

217
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,083
But I've got to ask.

218
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,958
Just what in the world is that
young man doing on the floor?

219
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,791
Oh please! Oh please!
Please I beg of you!

220
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,791
Please, Ms. Itoko,
allow me to join the Tea Club!

221
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,791
Having tea with
Yakumo would be wonderful!

222
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,583
Hanai, you're so honest.

223
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,750
Wait a minute.

224
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,458
Don't you have the
Aikido Club to go to?

225
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,916
What are you doing here?

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,375
Well, ma'am.

227
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,083
I really wanted
Yakumo to join but,

228
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:29,750
you see--She wouldn't have it!

229
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,083
Yakumo's been invited

230
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,041
to join a lot of the
school's most popular clubs,

231
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,375
but Hanai chases after
her like a puppy dog.

232
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,125
He always ends up
disrupting their activities

233
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,083
and embarrassing
Yakumo in the process.

234
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,583
Please forgive me, Yakumo!

235
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,416
Uh, it's okay, Hanai.

236
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,791
Wow, this guy is
completely hopeless.

237
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,708
Reminds me of someone.

238
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,125
As I said earlier,
I'm just the faculty advisor.

239
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,916
At this school, we
respect the independence

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,875
of both the students
and their clubs.

241
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,083
All membership decisions

242
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,458
are left to the
chairperson's discretion.

243
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,791
It's up to you, Chairperson.

244
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,125
Mhm.

245
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,166
No way.

246
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,000
What? That's it?
I don't understand! Why?

247
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,458
Hanai, tell me?

248
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,791
Do you even like tea?

249
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,083
Not at all!

250
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,458
I told you he was honest.

251
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,375
Not liking tea is
beside the point!

252
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,416
"Having tea" is just another
term for a social gathering,

253
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,583
i.e., people getting
together, like on a date,

254
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,125
and I want to date Yakumo!

255
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,541
So you see, I should be given
the chance to join the club!

256
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,708
Oh, I see.

257
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,000
Uh, you do?

258
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,250
Perhaps, but if
he wants to join us,

259
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,083
first he'll have to pass a test.

260
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,541
Pass a test?

261
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,833
A taste test.

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,625
Taste them and tell me
which one Yakumo brewed.

263
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,000
Are--are you nuts?

264
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,458
How should I know
which one she brewed?

265
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,541
That's impossi-

266
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,583
Let me make this
easier to understand.

267
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,083
The taste of tea
mirrors its maker's heart.

268
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,041
So if you truly
know Yakumo's heart,

269
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,666
this will be an easy test.

270
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,750
Say, is that true?

271
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,583
A real man never backs
down from a challenge!

272
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,916
Only a coward would turn
his back and run away!

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,791
I am a real man and
I accept your challenge!

274
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,750
Akira, what kind of tea is that?

275
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,750
It's got a pinch of
hot green pepper in it.

276
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,958
Oh.

277
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,250
My--my whole face is on fire!

278
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,416
This sensation comes
from only one flavor.

279
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,250
The flavor of sweet, sweet love!

280
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,750
This is it! Yakumo
brewed this one!

281
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,000
You're sure?

282
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,208
Huh?

283
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,625
I'll try this one, just in case.

284
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,583
Oh, it's--it's like
hot blood pumping

285
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,916
through the heart
of someone in love!

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,416
And that is the
proof of pure love!

287
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,000
Yakumo made this one, too!

288
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,708
Yakumo's heart is in only one
of the two teas, so which is it?

289
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,958
This--this is crazy.

290
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,958
How can I not know the true
nature of Yakumo's heart?

291
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:02,125
Why? Why can't I tell?

292
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,750
Disqualified.

293
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,875
You didn't show him any mercy.

294
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,625
He didn't deserve any.

295
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,875
So, Yakumo.

296
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,416
Now that you've seen
how we handle people

297
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,541
who don't take tea seriously,
welcome to the club.

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Uh!

299
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,125
Oh good, you're finally awake!

300
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,958
Where's Yakumo?

301
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,750
Sorry. She went home already.

302
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,625
Here, I made you
some sweet milk tea.

303
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,208
It'll get rid of that bad taste.

304
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,375
Why, thank you.

305
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,583
Akira said you can come

306
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,916
and go as long as you abide
by the club's posted rules.

307
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Takano said that?

308
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,791
Let's enjoy tea together
again sometime soon, okay?

309
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,208
Hm.

310
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,125
Guess I owe you one.

311
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,125
Oh, Akira.

312
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:07,958
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,458
I'm afraid I misjudged you.

314
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,958
Did you now?

315
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,333
In order for the class to learn
about a little something called

316
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,041
teamwork, our homeroom
assignment today

317
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,125
is to play a friendly
game of softball!

318
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,916
I think I'll pass.

319
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,125
Softball? But I'm
just so bad at sports.

320
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,000
Tenma, my sweet.

321
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,250
That sad look doesn't match
that beautiful face of yours.

322
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,583
It's a beautiful day,
so let's not waste it!

323
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,583
Let's get out there and
forge the bonds of friendship

324
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,958
and teamwork with sweat!

325
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,625
Come on, Tenma, cheer up!

326
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,375
Yeah, let's do it!

327
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,833
Harima's on fire!

328
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,250
Do you think he's
trying to blend in?

329
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,583
I had almost forgotten that
sports are a great outlet,

330
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,833
where delinquents can channel
their aggression productively.

331
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,625
Oh, awesome!

332
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,208
That's great! Way to go!

333
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,791
She certainly sent that
one flying, didn't she?

334
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,916
Mikoto's really good at this.

335
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,250
Time to defend our lead.

336
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,500
You think you can handle this?

337
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,958
How tough can it be?

338
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,041
Besides, I just
learned a few pointers

339
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,625
from someone on
the softball team.

340
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,583
You just learned?

341
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,125
A few pointers?

342
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,000
So stand back! Watch this!

343
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,416
Boy, Eri sure is a fast learner!

344
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,083
It's hard to believe she's
never played sports before.

345
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,291
Third!

346
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,958
Good catch, Akira!

347
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,541
Gotta hand it to you.
You're quick.

348
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,583
Your form could use a little
improvement if you ask me,

349
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,208
but your speed is impressive.

350
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,250
Those three were incredible.

351
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,875
Not only on the field but
in the looks department, too!

352
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,083
Totally hot.

353
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,833
Oh, man! Look at that photo op!

354
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,500
I can't believe
I forgot my freaking camera!

355
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,416
Okay, now's my chance,
so don't screw up!

356
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,958
Hit the ball and Karasuma
will finally notice me!

357
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,916
Strike three!

358
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,875
I got it! I got it!

359
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,583
Oh, Miko, why do I have to
always be so clumsy? Why?

360
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,375
You shouldn't get so down,
especially on my chest.

361
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,833
Instead of wasting time crying,

362
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,833
why don't you
practice a little bit?

363
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,750
You're mean, Eri!
Anyone ever tell you that?

364
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,541
That's the way I am.

365
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,416
Look, Tenma,
there's a lot at stake here.

366
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,750
The score is tied.

367
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,250
We can't let them gain
any points in this inning,

368
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,208
and that means no screw-ups!

369
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,625
Hey, hey, there's no reason
to get rude about this.

370
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,833
Before we started, you thought
this game was a waste of time.

371
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,250
If we have to play,
let's win at least.

372
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,875
Well, bases are loaded.

373
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,375
How 'bout letting me pitch, huh?

374
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,541
What are you doing here?

375
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,791
Thought you were going to skip?

376
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,166
Yeah, I was going to,

377
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,083
but then all my girlfriends
wanted to see me play.

378
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,291
Chicks always dig the pitcher.

379
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,250
Do they now?

380
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,500
We're all rooting for you!

381
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,500
Win the game for us, Imadori!

382
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,291
Sorry, our team
roster's already full.

383
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:19,083
It's not anymore.
Someone's sitting this one out.

384
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,583
Tenma?

385
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,500
Uh, yeah.

386
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,708
He's a much better choice
if you really want to win.

387
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,916
Of course, you know those
are her words, not mine.

388
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,250
Tenma, you pushover.

389
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,708
Hey, isn't it best to
cut the weakest players?

390
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,375
Okay. Have it your way.

391
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,291
This first one's
just a practice pitch--

392
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,583
Though some mistake
it for a fastball!

393
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,750
Hah! It's so slow,
it's putting me to sleep!

394
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:54,333
Dude! Oh! Man!

395
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,958
I think practice is over.

396
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,916
Just lay still now, Imadori.

397
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,583
Is he breathing?

398
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,625
Kay, so, we need a new pitcher.

399
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,541
It's the manager!
He's gonna pick a new pitcher!

400
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,750
What manager?

401
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,541
I didn't know we had one!

402
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,083
Pitcher Tsukamoto.

403
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,333
What?

404
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,416
Me? Are you sure?

405
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,125
But, Karasuma.

406
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,791
I really don't think
I've got what it takes!

407
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,916
Miss Tsukamoto.

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,916
There's something
I want to tell you.

409
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,583
You don't need to worry about
what others may think of you.

410
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,416
Just believe in yourself and
give it everything you've got.

411
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,416
At least that's what Eri
Sawachika wanted me to tell you.

412
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,583
Wow! You said that?

413
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,458
Just drop it okay!

414
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,083
Oh Karasuma.

415
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,333
I'm so moved by what you said!

416
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,750
I really, really am!

417
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,416
Karasuma, I'll do my best!

418
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,708
Hey you, glove boy!

419
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,041
If I strike out, her team's
gonna win, right?

420
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,166
Uh, yeah, so no
pressure or anything.

421
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,458
Look at that fastball!

422
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,250
Uh. Where's the ball?

423
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,458
It's a dead ball!

424
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,125
Runner on third walked in!

425
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,000
And that's the game, guys!

426
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,583
He's so heavy!

427
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,250
Just take some
deep breaths, Nara.

428
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,333
Has anyone checked
Harima's pulse?

429
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,500
What did you
think you were doing?

430
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,083
Didn't you hear me?
I said no screw-ups!

431
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,333
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

432
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,375
Well at least it's over now.

433
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,041
Hey, who's this guy
that Tenma's in love with?

434
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,583
Huh? She's looking over here.

435
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,208
Could it be me? Is it me?

436
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,750
Next time on School Rumble:

437
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,916
"Survival After School!
Arrival When Confessing!

438
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,125
Hospital For Two!"

439
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,166
I have to tell
you this right now!
