1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,083
School Rumble is coming up next!

2
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,416
Wow, it all looks so good!

3
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,208
Let's dig in!

4
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,375
I almost forgot to ask...

5
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,500
how far was everyone
able to swim today?

6
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,291
Two meters.

7
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,916
Zero meters.

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
Oh, get with it, you guys...!

9
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,208
I can't believe you didn't
make any progress at all...!

10
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,625
The class klutz here swam twenty
meters, a new personal best...!

11
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,458
What about you, Mikoto?

12
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,041
Five kilometers.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,666
Oh my god! That's incredible.

14
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,416
How could you
possibly swim so far?

15
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,041
Imadori must be the
greatest swimming coach ever!

16
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,375
Hey, Imadori...!

17
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,750
Think you can give me
swimming lessons next?

18
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,416
Sure thing...!

19
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,875
I bet I can take
you pretty far

20
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,541
in a very short
time, no problem!

21
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,625
Oh no! How clumsy of me.

22
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,125
Don't get cocky, kid...

23
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,250
Wow... He's hardcore.

24
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,500
Oh my goodness,
are you all right?

25
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,583
It's nothing really.

26
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,500
Here, let me get that.

27
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,916
That's very kind of you, Tenma!

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,750
I really appreciate it!

29
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,958
Hot soup! I spilled
hot soup in my lap!

30
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,541
It's really hot, no kidding!

31
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,541
Calm down, you big baby,
I've got it.

32
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,875
Don't get fresh
with me, you jerk!

33
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,875
Mikoto, you
little devil, you...!

34
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,500
Pretty smooth the way you got
that guy all alone for so long!

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,666
What did you do?

36
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,041
Come on, tell us!

37
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,125
We wanna hear all the
dirty little details later!

38
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,541
Woah, there.

39
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,458
Oh, Miko, you're
such a bashful flower!

40
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,833
Wait a minute...!

41
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,708
Could this be the reason Harima
has been in such a bad mood...?

42
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,750
Because he's jealous
of Mikoto and Imadori...?

43
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,291
Of course...! She must
be the one he's sweet on!

44
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,500
Psst...! Hey, Harima!

45
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,250
Could you come outside with me?

46
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,458
There's something
personal I'd like

47
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,166
to talk to you
about... Okay?

48
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,583
All right...!
It took a little while...

49
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,958
Okay, a long while...

50
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,500
but Tenma's finally noticed
my irresistible charm!

51
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,708
This is kind of...
awkward for me...

52
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:02,916
But I understand...

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,083
there's someone
special you like...

54
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,416
Yes! Yes!

55
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,250
Have you told this
someone how you feel?

56
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,083
What...? Oh...! Ah, well...

57
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,333
I've tried more than once

58
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,083
but she has an odd way
of missing the point.

59
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,208
I can imagine...

60
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,875
She's pretty dense
about these things.

61
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,458
No, it's okay...!
It's all my fault!

62
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,333
Oh, you sweetie...!
Gosh...! What a guy...!

63
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,083
You're a real
old-fashioned gentleman!

64
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,291
Okay, then...!
You can count me in!

65
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,416
Holy crap, I'm so happy!

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,541
Tenma! I just wanna hug you!

67
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,041
Let me help you practice...

68
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,541
Say, "I love you."

69
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,791
I... I luh...

70
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,333
That is, I...

71
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,833
Luh...

72
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,875
Luh...

73
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,291
Luh-oo!

74
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,916
Argh, it's no good!

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,166
Oh...! Come on, now...!
That's 23 times!

76
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,375
Toughen up...!

77
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,083
I mean, you're a big
strong guy, right...?

78
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,583
Three words!
How hard can it be? Geez!

79
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,458
I'm sorry, Tenma...

80
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,500
Never mind...

81
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,500
Well, I guess I have
no other choice

82
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,333
but to show you by example.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,458
No...! Wait!

84
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,583
Hold on a sec...

85
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,125
I'll be right with you.

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,916
That was close...

87
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,583
Harima...

88
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,083
Here's the deal...

89
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,958
It's like this:
I love ya, beautiful.

90
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,416
Hey!

91
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,250
If you're just gonna
laugh at me, forget it!

92
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,250
I'm trying to help you!

93
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,791
Now straighten up
and get serious!

94
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,875
Listen, babe, how many times

95
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,458
do I have to spell
it out for you...?

96
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,833
You shoulda realized
how I felt ages ago!

97
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,000
That's it!

98
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,791
Yeah...? Really...?
Did I do a good job?

99
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,875
Okay...

100
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,708
Now you give it a try,
just like that!

101
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,708
Well, that's weird... huh...

102
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,500
You look like someone.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,916
Wow, look at the time!

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,875
Back to work!

105
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:59,208
I, uh... I... Can't say it!

106
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,333
Okay, I'll do it for you again.

107
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,416
Hey, babe...! What do I have to
do, paint a picture for you...?

108
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,708
You sure can be thick!

109
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,958
That's it on the nose...!

110
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,125
You changed the words
a little from before,

111
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,625
but that's exactly
what I'm trying to say!

112
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:18,833
Hold on...

113
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,250
I think it's
coming back to me...

114
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,250
No, no, it isn't!

115
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,333
Yes, I've almost got it.

116
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,208
Enough!

117
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,333
Babe!

118
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,541
You're so thick...!
Now listen to me!

119
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,791
I...

120
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,875
Love...

121
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,708
Yuhaaa... I can't say it!

122
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,291
But that was perfect...!

123
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,041
All right, let's take
it from the top...

124
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,208
I'll do it for you once more.

125
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,083
Look, how many times do I have
to tell you that I love you...?

126
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,833
You must be dumber than dirt...!

127
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,666
Do you have any idea what
you've been putting me through?

128
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,875
Aw man, if she only knew!

129
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,750
Tenma's right over there...

130
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,083
Maybe I can snuggle
up next to her...

131
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,875
D cup, D cup, it's got to
be a D cup, D cup, D cup,

132
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,333
it's got to be ...

133
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:42,750
D cup, D cup, it's got
to be a D cup, D cup...

134
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,500
D cup, D cup, D cup, D cup...

135
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,291
That's the fifth
time he's gone around...

136
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,416
You'd think he'd
get the hint by now.

137
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,125
Ah! I'll just sneak in from
behind... easy does it...

138
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,083
Just a little farther,
and then...

139
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,291
I've finally got you,
Yakumo, my beloved...

140
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:27,916
Oh, no! This bastard's
gonna ruin my whole plan!

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,125
Yakumo, hold me...

142
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,458
Holy crap, this guy is strong!

143
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,583
He's breaking my ribs!
Let go! Let go, dammit!

144
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,708
Argh...! It's okay...!

145
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,125
Don't... resist me!

146
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,791
What's going on?

147
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,291
Are we having an earthquake?

148
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,666
Hey... Wait a minute...

149
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,875
Hmph!

150
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,041
Hey, what's wrong with
you guys...? Rough night?

151
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, you could say that.

152
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,250
I had the worst nightmare.

153
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,750
And what happened to your faces?

154
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,000
You look awful!

155
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,583
Don't ask.

156
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,166
Hey, Akira, are we gonna
get to see your video later?

157
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,166
That's a very good question...

158
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,500
That's enough!

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,125
Well done, Haruki. Good job!

160
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,625
The old man's losing it.

161
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,916
Did he really think
these newcomers

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
had a chance against our school?

163
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,416
Maybe he should let his son take
over the dojo; he's terrific.

164
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,291
It'd be a waste of brains.
He's a straight A student, too.

165
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,791
That's true.

166
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,416
Hey, Yasaburo, how 'bout a
little praise for your kid here?

167
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,916
Don't worry about it.

168
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,291
Pretty impressive, Mikoto,
that guy was nationally ranked!

169
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,666
Aw, no big deal, I got lucky!

170
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,000
Huh?

171
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,000
Hey, Grumpzilla...!
You won your round too,

172
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,833
so let's see that
happy face...? Hiya!

173
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,291
Hey...! Ow...! Watch it!

174
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,708
Mikoto's birthday party...

175
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,041
And they want me to
perform something again...

176
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,250
But if I do another
martial arts demonstration,

177
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,333
Mikoto will be mad at me...

178
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,750
Hm...

179
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,750
Ah, crap...

180
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,916
I can't possibly think

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,875
of something that
everybody will enjoy!

182
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,833
But my honor as a
man is at stake...!

183
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,333
Haruki Hanai cannot
let anyone down!

184
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,750
I must have something
stashed away...

185
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,708
A magic set, juggling
balls, anything...

186
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,583
Hm?

187
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,208
Yes...

188
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,416
That was the summer

189
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,416
of our second year in
elementary school...

190
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,916
Man, you are so
pathetic, you know that?

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,958
You suck!

192
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,958
And your dad teaches
martial arts?!

193
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,250
Imagine a useless little loser
like you trying to do aikido!

194
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,500
You haven't got a
chance, dorkface!

195
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,791
They were right...

196
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,625
I couldn't cut it in aikido...

197
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,958
I only took it up
because Dad made me.

198
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,000
Maybe you'd be better if you
stuck to studying, four eyes!

199
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,541
The bullies never
left me alone...

200
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,833
I'm finished!

201
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,291
Haruki!

202
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,750
Get back and finish your food!

203
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,166
If you don't eat it all,

204
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,250
you know Mikoto's
going to leave you behind!

205
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,750
I don't know why they
always compare us...

206
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm the quiet brainy type.

207
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,291
Mikoto is outgoing and friendly.

208
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,125
Everyone admires
her... but me...

209
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,958
You need some help up?

210
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,041
Everyone is going out for
noodles after practice...

211
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,750
So let's be sure and make
ourselves extra hungry!

212
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,958
There's no way I'll
ever be as good as her.

213
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,041
Ya want some more?

214
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,333
No thanks, I'm good.

215
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,625
You're not full already...!

216
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,583
Come on, have
some more noodles!

217
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,791
Ulp! No, really, I'm full!

218
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,750
Look out, you're spilling!

219
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,458
Oh, sorry!

220
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,500
One a hero, the other
a punching bag for bullies...

221
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,791
and it just kept
getting worse...

222
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,708
Now for our next class
we'll be doing duets,

223
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,958
so I want you to form into
pairs and start practicing!

224
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,000
Everyone in my class
started giving me

225
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,291
the silent treatment,...

226
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,916
pretending like I didn't exist.

227
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,250
I was as invisible as the air...

228
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,291
It was so weird,
I couldn't stand it...

229
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,875
Finally, I just stopped
going to school.

230
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,625
I didn't do anything wrong...

231
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,708
I just decided to leave,
all by myself...

232
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,958
Hanai!

233
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,833
Mikoto?

234
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,750
I'm here about the duet...!

235
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,375
Because I'm the class
music monitor this term...

236
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,791
The teacher says you
should pair up with me!

237
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,916
No! I'll never go
back there again...

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,750
There's no way!

239
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,125
What?!

240
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,458
You come out of there or
I'll keep blowing this thing!

241
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,625
I should have given up,
but I was too stubborn...

242
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,708
Mikoto didn't give up either.

243
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,208
She was there on hot days.

244
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,625
She was there on windy days.

245
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,458
She was there on rainy days.

246
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,041
Mikoto's running late today...

247
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,458
Mikoto!

248
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,708
I told you, you didn't
have to go to school today!

249
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,250
Now come on,
let's get you back home!

250
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,250
It's Mikoto's mom!

251
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,750
No, I'm staying here!

252
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,916
What's gotten into you?

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,875
You know you're running a fever!

254
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,041
I'm such a jerk.

255
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,166
So, you decided to
come back to school, huh?

256
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,916
Good, 'cause
the teacher's really

257
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,083
been buggin'
me about this duet...!

258
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,041
So let's do it, Hanai!

259
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,625
She never said a word...

260
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,958
not about being sick... or
about her mother scolding her...

261
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,291
Nothing...

262
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,416
Hey...!

263
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,833
Aren't you afraid you're
gonna catch loser cooties

264
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:04,958
from that geek?

265
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,125
What a cute couple!

266
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,250
Yeah, when are you
two gonna get married?

267
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,166
Hey... That's none
of your business...!

268
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,541
Now get lost!

269
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,208
Why'd you pair up with a
nerd like Hanai anyway?

270
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,125
It's not like the teacher
forced you to do it.

271
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,916
She wanted you to pair up
with somebody else all along!

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,833
What...? So Mikoto teamed up
with me because she wanted to?

273
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,916
Aren't you embarrassed
to be seen with him?!

274
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,750
No, I'm not!

275
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,041
I'm not embarrassed
by him at all!

276
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,458
Yeah, you better run, wimps!

277
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,583
Well...?! Don't just
stand there. Practice!

278
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,000
I think she was really

279
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,250
so embarrassed she
could hardly stand it.

280
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:02,958
Stop crying!

281
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,208
It's annoying...!

282
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,791
On top of that, you're
playing it all wrong...!

283
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,000
Now shape up, we got
a performance...! Hmph!

284
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,541
Right then...

285
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,625
I decided I was going to be
a hero, just like Mikoto...

286
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,125
Hooray.

287
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,083
Okay, Hanai,
let's see what you got!

288
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,333
Give it your best shot,
we're pulling for you!

289
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,583
I hope you'll enjoy my
performance today, Yakumo.

290
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,791
I can't read his mind today...

291
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,791
Today I, Haruki Hanai...
will play the recorder!

292
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,625
Man, you suck!

293
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,083
It's too hot!!

294
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,083
Hot-hot-hot-hot!

295
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,750
Yakumo, something's gone haywire
with the air conditioner!

296
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,500
I think it's from when you
were playing samurai last night,

297
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,041
chasing Iori with the broom,
and you hit the air conditioner

298
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,458
because you decided
it was a bandit.

299
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,708
The repairman said he'd be
here some time this evening.

300
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:15,208
I'll never make it...!
I'll... die... for... sure!

301
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,083
Okay, here's the deal!

302
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,291
Hm?

303
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,083
We're gonna play
"rock, paper, scissors!"...

304
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,916
Winner goes and cools off,
loser watches the house...

305
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,416
Now get your game face on!

306
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,416
Tell me again why
I should agree to this.

307
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,666
Okay, then, one, two... three!

308
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,458
Rock...! It's a tie!

309
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,125
One, two... three!

310
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,250
Yee... haa!

311
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,958
I hate to say it, but you're
really bad at this game...!

312
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,541
You know what...?

313
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,791
There's a trick to reading what
the other person is gonna do!

314
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,416
See...? You hold your hands
like this and peek through!

315
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,666
Sorry, Yakumo! I'm outta here!

316
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,458
Be careful!

317
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,750
Hello...? The electrician...?

318
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:08,541
You can't come tonight...?
I see... Goodbye.

319
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,916
Now what...?

320
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,291
I've gotta find some way to cool
things off for Tenma later...

321
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,458
Wait a minute... I know...

322
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,166
Sure...

323
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,666
If I can just convince her to
wear a summer kimono ...

324
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,875
Alright...!

325
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,375
I'm a princess, I'm a princess,
hm... hm-hm... hm... hm.!

326
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,291
Even if it isn't
actually cooler,

327
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,875
it'll make her feel cooler.

328
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,291
And a cool foot
bath should help, too...

329
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,375
Hello, there...

330
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,291
How'd you like a bath?

331
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,750
Iori?

332
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,291
You shouldn't run
off like that, kitty!

333
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,125
You found a nice cool
spot in the shade, huh?

334
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,625
Dum... plings...
dum... plings...

335
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,791
gonna get some dum...
plings, dum... plings...

336
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:04,666
Sis?

337
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,000
What is it, Yakumo?

338
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,875
Hey, is there
something the matter?

339
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,541
Did you wanna get
something special?

340
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,666
Mm-hm.

341
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,500
Well, what is it...?
You can tell me...

342
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,625
Right...? After all,
I'm your older sister!

343
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,041
Leave it to me...!

344
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,875
I'll take care of it,
'cause that's what sisters do!

345
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,958
That's it... Of course...

346
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,791
I'll get that out...

347
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:53,333
Yoohoo...! I'm home...!
And I brought ice cream!

348
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,000
A wind chime...!
That's so awesome!

349
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,291
For some reason just looking

350
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,416
at it totally takes
my mind off all the heat!

351
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,458
You're the best, Yakumo!

352
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,375
Ah, Miss Tsukamoto...

353
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,458
Karasuma!

354
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,166
But I didn't think
I'd see you here!

355
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,250
I'm on my way to a
pro-wrestling match...

356
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,208
Do you want to go?

357
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,000
With you? You know it!

358
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,541
Next time on School Rumble...

359
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:26,375
I've got a pro-wrestling date
with Karasuma...! Alright!
