1
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,958
Please don't go away.
School Rumble is next.

2
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,958
C'mon, you guys!
Let's go swimming!

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,000
Hurry up! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!!

4
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,750
Gosh, what are you,
nine? Calm down!

5
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:28,708
But you just ate.

6
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,583
You shouldn't go swimming.

7
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,750
You might get cramps!

8
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,500
What? I never heard of that!

9
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,916
I'm getting in!
You guys are boring!

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,916
Wait, Tenma!

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,458
It's slippery,
you're gonna fall!

12
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,958
She never listens.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,291
Whee!

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,083
Round and round I'm spinning!

15
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,708
Wow, she's cheerful today!

16
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,125
Ugh!

17
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,500
But seriously can we do
something about that inner tube?

18
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,375
Ya, I know what you mean.

19
00:00:58,708 --> 00:00:59,583
Hey, guys!

20
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,708
Those chicks are totally hot!

21
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,875
Yeah!

22
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,333
Now you're talkin' !

23
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:08,416
Look at the blonde
with the brown eyes...

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,625
She's a hotty.

25
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,833
Check out the hood
on the one next to her.

26
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,083
Brilliant? I think so!

27
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,041
That one with the
short hair looks smart.

28
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,625
She's probably got experience,
you know what I mean?

29
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,375
Yay! Around the world I go!

30
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,875
My friends are
gonna get burned...

31
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,375
and turn red like watermelons!

32
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,875
They're being hit on!

33
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,083
Yay! I'm gonna join 'em!

34
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,500
Wait a minute.

35
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,791
If I went over there right now,
I might be interrupting.

36
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,750
I'd be the fifth wheel.

37
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,291
They would make nice couples.

38
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,458
Actually, there are
couples everywhere!

39
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,250
So, you wanna watch
me work out later?

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,208
It's sad, but lately
things don't seem to be going

41
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,666
all that great with Karasuma.

42
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Ugh! How much stinkin' curry
does a girl have to make!

43
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,041
That's it!

44
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,416
I want to get hit on, too!
Come on! Any takers?

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,125
I'm willing and vulnerable!

46
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,333
Are you asking me?

47
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,083
Yes, I happen to be
studying here in Japan.

48
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,916
You see my mom's
in Sweden right now.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,541
She's running a
company over there.

50
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,583
Cool.

51
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,208
I think I'd rather not.

52
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,583
Aw...

53
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,458
I just wanna talk so
I can get to know you a little.

54
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,583
Come on now, don't make me

55
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,666
look like a loser in
front of everyone.

56
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,083
So, what's your
capital-per-asset ratio like?

57
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,375
Okay, I've circled
around twice now.

58
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,833
Huh?! Seriously?!
They're still at it?!

59
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,250
I guess I'll have
to go around again.

60
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,375
Okay...

61
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,333
This time I'll break
my current record

62
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,291
for the fastest time around.

63
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,208
Are you okay? Hey...

64
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,416
Aren't you Tenma Tsukamoto?

65
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,541
Phew, sorry for a
second there I thought

66
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,333
I'd almost killed
a middle school kid.

67
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,333
Huh?! Middle school?

68
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,916
For your information,
I'm 16 years old.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,250
Obviously, you're the one
that's in middle school,

70
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,458
so you should
speak more politely

71
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,083
to your elders, young man!

72
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,583
Are you kidding me...!
Have you gone mental?

73
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,083
I'm Kentaro Nara!
We're in the same class!

74
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,500
Ha-ha! I got you! Stupid.

75
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,166
You might as well be
a middle schooler...

76
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,208
I mean, that was totally lame.

77
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,666
I think I understand.

78
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,375
You just wanna get hit on
by guys like your friends,

79
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,791
there's nothing wrong with that.

80
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,333
I mean, I know I'm kinda
childish compared to them,

81
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,916
but I just wanna be
treated like... a woman.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,041
I don't think that's
asking too much.

83
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,541
But Tenma, you come
across as a fun girl

84
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,833
that's easy for guys to talk to.

85
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,583
I don't think they think
of you as the dating type.

86
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,125
That's mean!

87
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,541
It's true that I get along
really well with guys

88
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,708
and have a lot of fun with them.

89
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,125
But I wonder why none of them
ever wanna get serious with me.

90
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,666
I wonder why, I wonder why...

91
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,791
Why don't boys
want to date me...

92
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,708
Why don't they want
to get serious...? Why?!

93
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,083
Uh,... If that's the case...
maybe I should ask you out.

94
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,291
Uh, like I said... maybe
I should try asking you out.

95
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,791
I mean, if you don't mind

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,291
That's great!

97
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,500
Now I can tell the
girls a guy hit on me!

98
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,000
Uh, so... Do you...
wanna go to Karaoke tonight?

99
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,666
Nara is such a nice person...

100
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,333
Karasuma was never
this sweet to me.

101
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,708
What's wrong?

102
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,125
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,416
Thank you so much,

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,625
but I kinda have a
crush on this other boy.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,083
Please don't let go!

106
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,833
You're okay.
I promise I won't let go.

107
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,208
I wonder who Tenma
has a crush on.

108
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:42,791
Nara?

109
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,208
Hmm?

110
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,000
Maybe I should let go and
try to swim by myself now.

111
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,541
Do you think I'm ready?

112
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,708
You can try.

113
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,083
Tenma!!

114
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,666
That was awful!

115
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,791
But I was able to swim
fifteen whole meters this time!

116
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,625
That's a brand new record!

117
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,666
What's wrong?

118
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,583
Uh... Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

119
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,250
You're a weird boy!

120
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,666
Wow... her skin is so soft.

121
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,250
So, you came here with
some friends of yours?

122
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,083
Yeah. They're really great guys.

123
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,416
I think you'll like 'em.

124
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,791
I can't wait to meet 'em!

125
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,708
Maybe they'll become
my new friends, too.

126
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,458
Yeah! Oh...
there they are. Hey!!

127
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,500
There's Nara...

128
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,250
Where the heck have you been?

129
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,125
Uh, Tenma...

130
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,750
What are you doing with Nara?

131
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,125
When you said you came with
friends, you meant these guys?

132
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,250
Yeah.

133
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,916
You sly dog.
You two been hanging out?

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,791
I don't believe it,
this is perfect.

135
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,583
Let's all go on a date.

136
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,708
I don't know if we should.

137
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,416
Let's decide with a contest.

138
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,208
Contest?

139
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,625
Hey, that could be fun.

140
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,250
Wha? Are you serious?!

141
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,541
If the girls win,
dinner is on you guys.

142
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,500
And it will be expensive.
You have my word.

143
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,125
Hey, Akira, don't you
think that's a bit harsh?

144
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,708
I mean, we were planning
to go to my favorite restaurant.

145
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,416
I don't think a high school
student's allowance

146
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,750
could even cover the appetizer.

147
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,166
What? You're crazy.

148
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,791
But that is one good bluff.

149
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,416
Sure beats the hell
out of the noodle stand.

150
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,916
Hey! If these two get
serious, we could win!

151
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,625
All right!
We're game if you guys are.

152
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,916
Let's see... What kind
of contest should we have?

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,291
We'll swim for it!

154
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,583
So, whoever is the fastest
swimmer out of all of us

155
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,875
wins for their team, Okay?

156
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,458
I can't lose.

157
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,625
If I go on a date, it'll be like
I'm cheating on the guy I like.

158
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,875
I know I can't win...

159
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,833
But...

160
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,083
One of us will definitely win!

161
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,416
On your marks ... get set ...

162
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,416
Go!

163
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,833
You guys are so stupid!

164
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,333
Why didn't any of you tell
me that you couldn't swim?

165
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,333
We're sorry.

166
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,208
I thought at least
one of us could swim.

167
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,583
Oh, man, ...

168
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,583
I should have listened to
that weather forecast today.

169
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,791
Huh?

170
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,083
Yes!

171
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,875
My sanctuary
from nature's wrath!

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,958
Oh, hey. Are you
waiting out the rain?

173
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,291
Yeah.

174
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,791
This is awkward.

175
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,875
Things haven't been
going well with Karasuma

176
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,958
since the curry incident.

177
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,500
I've gotta make it up to him.

178
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,166
Maybe this rain is fate's
way of giving me that chance.

179
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,250
I wonder if Karasuma
is mad at me,

180
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,041
or if he's gotten
bored of me already.

181
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,500
I'd really like to be
friends with him again.

182
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,833
Uh... Karasuma...

183
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,791
A water imp costume...?

184
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,166
Oh yeah, that's
Karasuma's rain gear...

185
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,000
It may be too late
to say anything now,

186
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,083
but someone should really
tell him how silly that is!

187
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,500
No, no! I can't!

188
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,583
If I tell him he looks stupid,
then he'll really be mad at me.

189
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,791
I love Karasuma.
So, I've gotta be quiet.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,916
No, I have to say something!

191
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,958
Karasuma... um...

192
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,875
Well, there's something that
I really have to tell you...

193
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,041
Um... It's just...

194
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,625
Here you go.

195
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,041
Would you like to
borrow this to keep dry?

196
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,166
Huh?

197
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,666
I'm not going to let you
get soaked and catch a cold.

198
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:19,041
But, this Water Imp costume
will only protect one person.

199
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,208
You were worried because
you thought I was going

200
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,791
to leave you
here all alone, right?

201
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,000
You thought I was going

202
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,041
to just take off and
let you get soaked...

203
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,708
I'm not that mean.

204
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,250
Did I misunderstand
you, after all?

205
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,791
No. You were right, Karasuma.

206
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,291
Tenma...! She must be
around here somewhere.

207
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,125
Yakumo! Did you
come to pick me up?

208
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,083
Tenma!

209
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,125
What the... Is that...?

210
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,416
Karasuma let me borrow
his water imp costume...!

211
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,791
It's a boy's size, though,
so it's a little big on me.

212
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,041
Karasuma said he'd be
fine with just the head piece.

213
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,708
Isn't he nice?!

214
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,791
Yes. He's very nice.

215
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,250
Hey, look. It's Harima.

216
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,125
Yeah.

217
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,541
They say he's back in school.

218
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,416
There's a rumor going
around that he had to disappear

219
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,208
for a while because he had a
fight with some gang members.

220
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,291
I'm not surprised.

221
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,416
I've heard rumors
like that before.

222
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,791
He's like a wolf that's been
living too long in a dark

223
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,125
and desolate world where
guys like us just don't belong.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,791
So what are you gonna
do for summer vacation?

225
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,041
The beach! I've always
wanted to go to the beach.

226
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,166
Do you think Eri and Akira
would be up for it?

227
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,791
It's not like I confessed
and she rejected me.

228
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,250
That means
I still have a chance.

229
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,958
So, from now on, my main
purpose in school is to spend

230
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,125
every possible
moment with Tenma!

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,083
And with that said...

232
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,333
School's out for
summer vacation!

233
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,208
Yay!

234
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,291
Dammit!

235
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,791
Why does school
have to be out now?!

236
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,125
Like I was saying...

237
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,500
We'll hit the beach first.

238
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,250
Yeah, I mean we did
promise those guys

239
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,791
we would go with them!

240
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,916
I really don't understand why we
have to go out with a bunch

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,666
of stupid guys who are
all talk, but have no brains.

242
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,333
Ugh, Don't listen to her.

243
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,916
Mikoto is just way
too much of a prude.

244
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,166
Besides, you should try
to get more experience.

245
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,791
Otherwise, you'll
just screw it up

246
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,916
when you finally
go on a real date.

247
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,500
What?!

248
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,708
Did you watch

249
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,416
too many after-school
specials growing up?

250
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,375
I think it's beautiful
that Mikoto wants

251
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,250
to wait for true love.

252
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,791
You're acting
really weird, lately.

253
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,250
That's because it's summer.

254
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,791
What does that mean...?

255
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,666
As if summer has anything to
do with you acting like a freak!

256
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,416
What are they talking about?

257
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,541
Tenma's going to the
beach with some guy?!

258
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:45,375
Not if I can help it.
I've got to hear more.

259
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,875
I'll just casually
get a little bit closer.

260
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,958
I can't wait!

261
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,333
What the...?

262
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,375
Uh... I've gotta go.

263
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,541
That woman is insane!

264
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,916
She has no right
to still be pissed

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,416
over what happened
the other day!

266
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,666
It was a mistake!

267
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,875
Who in their right mind
could ever fall in love

268
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,375
with a woman like that!

269
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,041
I've got no choice.

270
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,541
I'm gonna beat the
crap out of that guy

271
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,416
if he doesn't
forget about Tenma!

272
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,333
Help.

273
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,041
Aw, no way!

274
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,375
Even if I did that,

275
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,750
I still wouldn't get to go
to the beach with her.

276
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,416
Maybe I should get some guts
and ask her to the beach myself!

277
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,750
Maybe she'd prefer that
over me beating up that guy.

278
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,041
Ah, yes. That could
be a good idea.

279
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,041
You know, I think
I might just do that.

280
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,791
Okay... I'm handing
out your report cards.

281
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,125
Harima!

282
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,958
Yeah.

283
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,416
I have to talk to you.

284
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,541
I'm a little confused about

285
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,000
that letter you gave
me a while ago...

286
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,875
Better shut up or I'll kill you.

287
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,666
Damn, nothin' but turtles.

288
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,708
Hey, you did the same as me!

289
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:14,083
Oh, uh... What was that?

290
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,291
I got all turtles, too!

291
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,666
Thank God, I was born stupid!

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,666
Okay.

293
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,000
So, Tenma?

294
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,541
I've been wanting to talk
to you about something.

295
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:39,250
If you want...
I would like to ask you...

296
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,250
I'd really enjoy it if you came
to see a movie with me tonight!

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,916
Right there...

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,083
That's where
we'll be going. See?

299
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,625
Mhm! Wow.

300
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,083
It looks really nice...
I'm glad we're going...

301
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't think Tenma
knows this is sort of a date...

302
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,666
so it's kinda sneaky.
But, I really do like her.

303
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,416
Please, don't do this.

304
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,041
Don't take our daughter.
She's all we have.

305
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,208
Please don't!

306
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,250
Are you okay with this, Harima?

307
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,708
Yeah.

308
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,375
Why do I have to
go to summer school?

309
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,333
I should be on vacation!

310
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,291
Well, at least there's
one thing to look forward to.

311
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,208
So, x squared y
plus 43... equals 149.

312
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,500
I have Akira as my tutor!

313
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,041
Score one for me!

314
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,458
Ah, stupidity has
brought us together!

315
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,583
Oh yeah, that reminds me...

316
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,375
The trip we're going on is
an overnighter, right Tenma?

317
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,375
Have you packed yet?

318
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,166
Yep, I'm all ready!

319
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,583
Damn! I forgot
about the beach trip!

320
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,375
Interesting.

321
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,625
Crap...! That guy's
probably gonna have

322
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,750
his grubby little
paws all over Tenma!

323
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,458
And how could he not?
I mean, she is the cutest one!

324
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,541
Aw, dammit! Who the
hell is this guy!

325
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,333
I'll hunt him down!

326
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,916
And pound him
'til he can't walk!

327
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,041
No! I'm a changed man now.

328
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,916
I'll try a more
positive approach.

329
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,208
Yes!

330
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,833
What the hell are
you laughing at, punk?

331
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,208
You gotta problem with
me wearing bikini shorts?!

332
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,583
I look good in bikini shorts!

333
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,625
Oh, man. Tennoji is so stupid.

334
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,583
I don't act stupid
like that anymore.

335
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,208
Do I, guys?

336
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,250
What?! You mean all
three of you can't go?

337
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,000
No, we all got our asses
kicked by some crazy dude

338
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,125
with a bald head.

339
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,791
Man... This really sucks.

340
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,625
There's no way I can be
the only guy on the trip...

341
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,291
I guess I'll have to find
a way to let Tenma down easy.

342
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,708
Wait, this is so perfect!

343
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,291
If I'm the only guy, then
there won't be any competition.

344
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,000
It'll just be me and her!

345
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,875
Alright! She's taking
extra classes right now!

346
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,083
So I'll go to school
and see her tomorrow...!

347
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,291
Good morning!

348
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,583
What kinda guys can
I get to go as replacements

349
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,666
to be with the
other three girls?

350
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,166
Imadori is too much of a
ladies man; he can't be trusted.

351
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,000
I can't ask Hanai,
he's way too bossy.

352
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,458
Harima seems to like Tenma,

353
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,166
and he's pretty much a
psycho, so that won't work.

354
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,791
Whatever I do, I can't let
those three know about it.

355
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,500
Hey, good morning, everybody!

356
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,875
Hey, good morning, Nara!

357
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,625
What's up?
Are you here about the trip?

358
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,833
I heard the other
three guys had to cancel.

359
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,166
That's too bad.

360
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,166
I hope you're not planning
on calling it off now.

361
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,208
So, I came up with a great idea!

362
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,416
Why don't we just ask three
other boys to join us instead!

363
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,083
This isn't happening.

364
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,416
Don't tell me.

365
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,583
This is the guy who invited
Tenma to the beach?!

366
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,083
But I'm a delinquent.

367
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,291
I can't go on a trip

368
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,875
with a bunch of guys
without hurting anyone!

369
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,250
No, no, no!

370
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,958
Hold up! I have changed my ways!

371
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,583
Yes... I can be a friendly guy

372
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,500
I'll go to the beach!

373
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,416
All right! That's it! Yes!

374
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,125
I'll go to the...

375
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,541
I'll go to the beach!

376
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,750
Pick me! Pick me! Pick me! Yeah!

377
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,500
Okay! Imadori's in!

378
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,416
Could we discuss this, please?

379
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,750
Damn! I can't be the
friendly type anymore!

380
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,583
He stole my idea!

381
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,458
I think that
I should go with you.

382
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,791
Oh, that's good!

383
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,833
I think that I--

384
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,166
I think that
I should go with you.

385
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,791
Hanai, you're in too!

386
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,458
Now we just need one more.

387
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,750
In that case, we're gonna
have to invite Yakumo.

388
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,875
That's one extra girl,

389
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,166
but unfortunately,
it can't be helped.

390
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,833
Of course it can be helped!

391
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,583
What are you? Stupid?

392
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,625
Yakumo, huh?
I wonder if she would...?

393
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,416
She does tend to be really
shy around crowds, y'know?

394
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,291
Yeah! Summer's here!

395
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,458
I'm absolutely dying
to go swimming!

396
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,416
Harima wants to go bad!

397
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,333
They used to call
me Harima the Merman,

398
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,666
because I'm such a good swimmer.

399
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,583
Well, there's definitely
no one else from our class

400
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,208
that we can possibly invite!

401
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,041
And I'm sure everyone
is extremely busy.

402
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,458
Man... All this spare time!

403
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,875
Okay... Then I'll see
if Yakumo wants to go.

404
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,625
Yes, that would be great.

405
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,833
I love girls.

406
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:32,083
Oh, man...!
I'm totally left out!

407
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,750
That sucks.

408
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:38,625
That was my chance to go
out with the girl of my dreams!

409
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,916
Huh?!

410
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,625
Ten... ma. You came back.

411
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,125
I, uh... forgot something
so I had to come and get it.

412
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,791
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,916
Oh, no. She must have heard me.

414
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,125
Harima. Come to
the beach with us.

415
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,750
Does this mean...
Tenma likes me?

416
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,708
Yes! Tenma...!

417
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,041
You are my goddess!

418
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,000
I will make you the
happiest woman in the world!

419
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,375
Hey! Good luck!

420
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,458
Say what?

421
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,791
I don't know who you like...

422
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,291
but, I'm really rooting for you.

423
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,291
So do your best. Okay, Harima!

424
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,791
Well, I'll see you later!

425
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,458
That sucks...

426
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,083
You totally got the
wrong idea, Tenma.

427
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,000
Wait a minute.
What am I thinking?

428
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,166
This could be the chance
I've been waiting for...

429
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,916
I'm actually gonna go
to the beach with Tenma.

430
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,750
All right!

431
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,333
Kenji Harima ... gets
his chance to kick ass!

432
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,083
A crazy spirit
awakens my wild side!

433
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,416
Just wait, Tenma!

434
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,083
I know you'll fall in
love with me at the beach!

435
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,375
Next time on School Rumble:
"Save Me at the Beach!"

436
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,625
Oops!

437
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:26,041
"Save Me, I'm Naked!
Just Save Me! For Real!"

438
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,000
Why do these
things happen to me?
