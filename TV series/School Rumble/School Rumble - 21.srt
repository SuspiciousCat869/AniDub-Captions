1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,625
Ho, ho, ho...!
School Rumble is coming up!

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,000
Be patient!

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,208
He's gotta be around
here somewhere...

4
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,208
What the...?!

5
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,666
Three thousand five
hundred sixty-nine!

6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,500
Pathetic!

7
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,875
That all you can do?!

8
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,708
Even at my age,
I can do twice as many!

9
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,083
Hanai's always been
serious about training...

10
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,416
but this... It's crazy...

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,583
Even for a guy
as wound up as him.

12
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,166
Wonder what pushed him
over the edge like this?

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,833
Ah, you've noticed it, too.

14
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,375
The boy's strength is like
that of a double edged-sword.

15
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,500
Keen and precise... But!

16
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,750
Even the sharpest
of swords needs

17
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,416
to be sheathed, and this one?

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,666
Well, he's lost the
scabbard of reason.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,416
As a result, the boy's
soul is in turmoil...

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,166
The two sides of his
heart are locked in combat.

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,416
Ho, ho, ho...!

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,666
He's not the first to be

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,166
lost in the forest of
confusion, my child...

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,625
A broken heart is the likely
culprit that led him astray.

25
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:36,166
The only thing that can
save him now is love...

26
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,125
I take it that's why you've
journeyed here, eh, child?

27
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,125
Are you the young vixen
who broke his heart?

28
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,666
Uh, no, no, no!
You've got it all wrong!

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,708
We're just friends, you see?!

30
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,125
Do not be ashamed, child.

31
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,333
It's not always easy

32
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,416
to share the feelings
deep in one's heart.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,750
The boy has the same reluctance.

34
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,083
You and he have much in common.

35
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,875
Mikoto, what are you doing here?

36
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:57,875
We were getting worried.

37
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,416
You've been gone for two days.

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,166
Two days...? That just
can't be right... Wow...

39
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,541
It feels more like I've
been here for two months.

40
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,500
That old man...
Who was he? A sensei?

41
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,333
Him?

42
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,125
No... He's just a stranger.

43
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,291
Grandpa! You can't
wander off like that!

44
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,083
You know, Miss, you look a lot
like my granddaughter, Akiko!

45
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,958
That's 'cause I am Akiko!

46
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,208
You sure?

47
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,166
Did she really...
have to hit me?

48
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,041
Wow... They've really
cleaned up the downtown area.

49
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,916
That guy's so awesome!

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,666
With that jacket and motorcycle?

51
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,083
He's the hottest guy
at our school!

52
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,166
I'll say, and those sunglasses
make him look so sexy!

53
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,708
I wonder who they could
be talking about...

54
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,333
Do you think a kiss
would be good right here?

55
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,375
Uh...

56
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,708
Oh, yes I...
I think that's okay.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,916
Wonder if he's dating
anyone right now?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,125
I hope not! Wouldn't
you just love to be...

59
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,291
His girlfriend!

60
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,583
Ladies!

61
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,541
You must tell me everything
you know about this guy now!

62
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,500
We were cutting through the
alley behind this coffee shop

63
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,625
when these creeps
started messing with us...

64
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,750
And then he came along
and helped us out.

65
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,583
He might still be there.

66
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,791
Thank you!

67
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,000
So that's it...!
That explains everything!

68
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,666
Yakumo gets threatened,

69
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,000
and Harima "conveniently"
saves the day...!

70
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,333
He gains a girlfriend,

71
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,166
and his lowlife buddies
get a nice kickback!

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,708
I won't let you get away
with this, Kenji Harima!

73
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,083
You'll pay!

74
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,583
Wh-What happened?

75
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,208
Help... me...

76
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,666
Hey, you hairy delinquent!

77
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,541
The name is McKenzie.

78
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,041
Say what?

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,708
My name, pal.
It's Harry McKenzie.

80
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,916
Got it...? Harry McKenzie...

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,416
Sounds like you already
heard of me, though, huh?.

82
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,250
That's the funny
thing isn't it...?

83
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,625
I don't know of you at all
but somehow you know of me.

84
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,833
Kinda weird...

85
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:51,916
I'd like to know your name

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,583
unless you're too
scared to give it.

87
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,958
No, not at all!

88
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,083
It's Haruki Hanai...
And I have got a question.

89
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,708
Did you do all this?

90
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,000
I told these guys
I didn't want any trouble,

91
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,750
but I guess they're
hard of hearing.

92
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,416
Well, they're gonna listen a
lot better after today, huh?

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,750
It was self-defense,
I assure you.

94
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,291
Is that so?

95
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,250
I see dislocated shoulders, back
injuries, broken arms, cuts,

96
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,375
and bruises,
and multiple lacerations...

97
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,875
What form of self-defense
were you practicing?

98
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,916
Ohhhh...? Think I was
a little rough, huh?

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,958
You tryin' to say that
I went a little overboard?

100
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,583
That I beat up all of these
losers single-handedly?

101
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,666
Well, I wouldn't go that far...

102
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,791
Come on, you really think

103
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,750
I could take these
guys on alone...?

104
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,125
That's a good one, pal...!
A real good one!

105
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,500
Good reflexes for a geek.

106
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,833
Who is this guy?!

107
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,125
Hey, mind your manners...
We got a lady present.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,791
Hanai? What are you doing here?

109
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,750
Yakumo! I've got a
good reason to be here!

110
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,083
Wait a minute!
What are you doing here?!

111
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,083
Well, I've been working
at the coffee shop for--

112
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,500
Miss, this alley still
has some trash left in it...

113
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,500
But don't worry.
I'll clean it up.

114
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,500
You lousy lowlife!

115
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,166
I'll make you rue
the day you ever dared

116
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,666
to mess with Haruki Hanai.

117
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,708
Sure I will, pal.

118
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,041
Hey, sorry I'm late!

119
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,666
What the?

120
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,583
Harima... and Yakumo...
are on a date?!

121
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,833
No, you got it all wrong, man!

122
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,416
Oh, I do, do I?!

123
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,625
Then do you mind telling me what
brought you to this alley...?!

124
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,833
You answer me now!

125
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,041
Well... actually,
I came here--Wait...!

126
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,458
What are you doin'...?!
You crazy or somethin'?!

127
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,958
You don't want them to know
you're drawin' comics, do you?!

128
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,916
The last person you
wanna tell is this guy!

129
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,625
To... kick your butt, Big Man!

130
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,083
Great! That's
music to my ears...!

131
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,375
I'll show you what
I learned in training!

132
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,000
Excuse me, but you're
gonna have to take a number.

133
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,791
Back of the line, jerk.

134
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,958
No!

135
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,791
Hey, Tenma's sister...

136
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,166
Why don't we let
this creep pick it up!

137
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,208
Nice punch, pal.

138
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,875
But it doesn't mean squat unless
you can connect with the target!

139
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,291
Man...! He's good!

140
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,291
Mind if I cut in?

141
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,791
Well, well, well.

142
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,666
I gotta admit I'm impressed.

143
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,500
You guys fight
like two samurais.

144
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,541
I Guess the cat's out
of the bag now, huh?

145
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,166
Well, go ahead.

146
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,583
I'm ready for all
the dumb nicknames...

147
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,375
Baldy, Chrome Dome, Curly,
Egghead, Sir Balds-A-Lot.

148
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,791
Bring 'em on!

149
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,625
He has a sakayaki haircut!

150
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,916
Just like a real samurai!

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,833
Uh, I found your hat.

152
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,083
If I knew she liked bald guys...

153
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,458
I would've shaved
my head years ago!

154
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,250
Hey, check it out.
It's her again.

155
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,250
Yeah. That Gonzalez
chick from 2-D, huh?

156
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,416
Me likey!

157
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,166
She just moved here from Mexico.

158
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,875
Ichijou!

159
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:12,916
Huh?

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,291
Today I'm...
eating lunch with you!

161
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,750
So you're into wrestling,
too, huh, Lara?

162
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,250
What a coincidence!

163
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,666
You know, Karen here is a
pretty decent wrestler herself!

164
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,791
That's how we met.

165
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,750
She even challenged
me to a match!

166
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,250
You should form a tag team.

167
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,000
The Terrible Two:
Karen and Lara!

168
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,750
Oh! So that's your name.

169
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,625
Lara... Hey, that
looks good. Can I try it?

170
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,208
Ichijou!

171
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,375
Yes?

172
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,250
What is this thing
that stands before me?

173
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,750
This is Imadori.

174
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,083
Hey, sexy!

175
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,625
Dejame tonto!

176
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,166
I don't know what that
means, but it sounded rude.

177
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,666
Yeah, really!

178
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,000
Calculating boobage...

179
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,083
D! Yeah...

180
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,333
I've heard the phrase "Stick
a fork in him, he's done,"

181
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,291
but this is ridiculous!
Calm down!

182
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,625
He can be a perv but
he didn't deserve that!

183
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,041
Should have aimed lower!

184
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,791
Are you gonna be okay?

185
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,000
Who, me? Never been better!

186
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,000
D cup...

187
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,250
Hey? Karen saved me, didn't she?

188
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,791
Cool, but...

189
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,125
I wish she had just
been a little bit quicker...

190
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,166
Oh no, Imadori...!

191
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,666
Uh...

192
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,916
Miko, that girl from
Mexico is picking on me.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,083
Is that so?

194
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,916
Yes, that's so!
You didn't see it?!

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,958
I see... You tolerate that boy

196
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,166
because you like him, eh, Karen?

197
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:47,833
Really?

198
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,000
Is that true, Karen?

199
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,458
Well, yeah, but he
doesn't... know that.

200
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,375
Too scared to tell him,
someone of your strength...?

201
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,708
Tell him, and if he rejects
you... take him by force!

202
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,083
But that's not the
kind of person I am...

203
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,500
Do it...! Then tell
us all about it, kay?

204
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,208
Hey! New girl with
the big bazongas...!

205
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,000
Miko here's way
stronger than you!

206
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,375
She'll mop the floor with you!

207
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,416
Eh?!

208
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,458
Come on, Miko!

209
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,916
I know you can take her out!

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,208
That hyper kick of yours
will shut anyone up!

211
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,500
Say what?

212
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,375
Come on, kick her butt...!
Do it...! Please...!

213
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,916
No, stop it! I don't
want any part of this...!

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,333
You are out of control!

215
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,250
Hmph... Guess you can
find them in every country...

216
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,666
Clueless men in love
with worthless women.

217
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,000
Um, Lara?!

218
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,416
Worthless women, huh?!

219
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
My papá once loved a
bad apple like you...

220
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,208
This is what I do to bad apples!

221
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,500
Want to fight me?

222
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,125
Uh, no! No, I'm cool...

223
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,833
Hey, that's nothing!
Even I can do that! See!

224
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,166
S-sorry! I was just joking!

225
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,250
The Iron Claw! Most impressive.

226
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,416
She's frickin' strong!

227
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,458
Is he okay?
Should we do something?

228
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,541
No way.

229
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,291
Leave this to me, girls!

230
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,416
Psst, hey!

231
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,541
Bring it!

232
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,583
Bring it! Come on!
Don't you remember?

233
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,791
Think about me
with a mask, baby!

234
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,875
Why don't you try fighting
someone your own size?

235
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,958
You're on.

236
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,500
Ladies, that is enough,
the two of you need to--

237
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,041
...to just cut it out.

238
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,375
Harry McKenzie?!

239
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,500
He's a student at Yagami High?

240
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,250
He took the words
right outta my mouth!

241
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,750
Who does he think he is?!

242
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,291
Oh. You again.

243
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,916
He a friend of yours, Harry?

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,333
Yeah... We got
unfinished business.

245
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,583
Looks like we've got a lot
of classroom rivalry today...

246
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,416
Gives me an idea...

247
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,083
If you don't know me, I'm
Masakazu, the Class Rep for 2-D!

248
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,250
Our classes don't have
to fight like thugs!

249
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,416
We can settle things in a safe

250
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,333
and productive way
at the Athletic Meet!

251
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,166
2-C versus 2-D...!
What do you say, people?

252
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,333
He did it, too...!

253
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,041
He said exactly what
I was about to say!

254
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,041
We accept!

255
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,916
You are goin' down 2-D

256
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,666
How do you get your
mouth to open like that?

257
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,875
You could have fought
me today, but you didn't.

258
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,541
You are a cobarde,
a coward... "Mikoto!"

259
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,750
You're brave.

260
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,541
Mikoto's got a
black belt... Watch out.

261
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,125
She couldn't lay a hand
on me if she wanted to.

262
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,416
Yeah?

263
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
What?!

264
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,250
Bruises?!

265
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,750
Very well...

266
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,250
We'll settle the score at
the Athletic Meet... "Mikoto!"

267
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,166
You missed something.

268
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,291
Huh? What's this?!

269
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,041
Banana?!

270
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm so cold... This is the end.

271
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,291
Her size?

272
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,583
D... Just like Mikoto's...

273
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,125
Such fitting last words.

274
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,166
Rest in peace, pal.

275
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,750
Guys! There's a new school nurse
and she's really smokin'...!

276
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,875
And her grapefruits are pretty
ripe too, know what I mean?

277
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,041
We are aware.

278
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,291
This early in the morning?

279
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,083
How...? And why're
you guys banged up?

280
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,416
Hmph... Ever seen a
non-injured student get sent

281
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,916
to the nurse's office?
I didn't think so.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,416
You mean you guys
roughed yourselves up

283
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,625
just to see the nurse?!

284
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,416
'Course we did...

285
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,833
Maybe she'll want to...
"play doctor."

286
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,125
Ho-ho-ho, yeah! Bam!

287
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,416
Man, my bandages
are falling off!

288
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,958
Crap! There's no way
I can go in there...

289
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:44,250
They probably all know about
my bald spot by now! Damn!

290
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,083
Only one thing they
can be yappin' about,

291
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,541
and that's my bald head!

292
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,625
Man, this is wearin' me out!

293
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,166
I'm takin' a nap!

294
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,833
Hey, was that Harima just then?

295
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,166
Wonder why didn't he come in?

296
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,583
Is he sick or something?

297
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,916
Probably, with his head
being exposed and all.

298
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,041
You know, I bet you're right.

299
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,333
He probably caught
a nasty head cold.

300
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,541
Stop it.

301
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,791
You're the one
who went all "psycho"

302
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,708
and then shaved his head
for no frickin' reason.

303
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,916
I already told him I was sorry.

304
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,750
That was for
shaving off his beard.

305
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,916
It doesn't count.

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,583
You've gotta apologize
for his hair, too.

307
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't think so!

308
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,916
Geez, you are so stubborn!

309
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Yeah... Like a mule.

310
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,375
Come on, Eri!

311
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,583
Do it! Tell him you're sorry!

312
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,375
All right, I'll do it!

313
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,583
Just shut up already, gah!

314
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,125
Hey, uh, what's-your-name?

315
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,833
Have you seen Harima around?

316
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,958
Looked like he was heading
to the Nurse's office.

317
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,583
Thanks for the info.

318
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:40,958
Hey!

319
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,083
Please allow us
to escort you, ma'am!

320
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,208
What the--?

321
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,666
Well, is she in there?

322
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,000
Can't tell.

323
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,291
Rock, paper, scissors
determines who goes first.

324
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,083
Do we have to do
this one at a time?

325
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,625
Yeah! Wait your turn, horndog!

326
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,750
Do these guys even
have a reason to be here?

327
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,375
No! Neither do you!

328
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,791
Hey!

329
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,916
Let's see some hall passes...!

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,666
What did I say about making
noise in the hallways?!

331
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,750
It's Mr. Goriyama!
What should we do?!

332
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,333
Run, Buddha!

333
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,041
You can run, but ya can't hide!

334
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,958
Where is everyone? Hey... Guys?

335
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,958
What's she doing?!
Get out of there!

336
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:15,500
Come on!

337
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,708
But... Why me?!

338
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,916
Tenma! No!

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,166
Don't worry, I'll pry her out
of the paws of that gorilla.

340
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,458
If at first you don't succeed...

341
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,666
...try, try again. Let's move!

342
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,541
The school has a new nurse?

343
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,875
Today's her first day, huh?

344
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,125
Wow, I bet her hands

345
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,541
are probably really
full right now...

346
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,583
Let's skip this, 'kay?

347
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,250
It would be rude
to disturb her...

348
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,041
and I'd just die
if I had to apologize

349
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,458
to Harima in front of her.

350
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,125
Quit making excuses
and get in there!

351
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,791
All right, I'm going!

352
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,333
Oh, sweet Tenma...

353
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,833
That'll teach me to leave
the windows up on windy days.

354
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,791
I didn't know
anyone was in here...

355
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,250
He looks...

356
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,666
Hario!

357
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,333
What the...?!

358
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,958
How have you been?!

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,833
You are not gonna believe this.

360
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,166
Then he knocked the nurse down!

361
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,208
He's nuts!

362
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,416
Told ya he's still a delinquent!

363
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,750
Now I really can't go in there!

364
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,916
This is an outrage!

365
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,375
A student assaulting faculty?

366
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,541
Yagami High's going to get
a bad reputation for this.

367
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,291
We've got to expel that thug.

368
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,791
Mr. Katou, wait.

369
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't deny that Harima was
one of our problem students

370
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,916
when he was younger,
but I've seen a real change

371
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,583
come over him this semester...

372
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,916
It's almost as if
he's found something

373
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,583
to dedicate himself to.

374
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,750
Let's give him the
benefit of the doubt

375
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,333
until we speak with the nurse.

376
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,791
Why not? Let's indulge him.

377
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,875
Today's he's
knocking over staff;

378
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,458
tomorrow it'll be liquor stores.

379
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,541
Miss Anegasaki...?

380
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,250
Uh...

381
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,250
Oh... Hi there!

382
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,000
I heard there was an
incident with Harima,

383
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,708
one of my homeroom students.

384
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,500
Huh? Oh!

385
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,458
There's no need to apologize.

386
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,958
It was all my fault.

387
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,333
I just came outta nowhere
and scared him, the poor boy.

388
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,916
Well, I guess that settles it.

389
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,541
Oh...! Don't leave yet!

390
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,583
Since it's my first day, I made
cookies for all the faculty...

391
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,166
It's my way of saying, "Hello!"

392
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,125
Cookies...? Wow!

393
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,250
Tani, wait!

394
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,666
Yuripee, what are
you doing here?

395
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,750
Oh, Tani I-Is it true
you're moving to Tokyo?

396
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,250
There's something I wanna
give you before you leave...

397
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,541
I baked these cookies for you.

398
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,625
For me?

399
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,541
Just enjoy 'em
after English Lit...

400
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,583
And for the rest of his
days, Gon ventured out

401
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,458
into the forest to
gather chestnuts...

402
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,833
Great. Stop.

403
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,750
So, class, what do you think
the author is implying?

404
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,208
Stop it, you
shorn-headed mongoloid!

405
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,583
What?! No way! You stop it,
you four-eyed jerk!

406
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,833
My homeroom students are
acting like savages today.

407
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,250
I'm sorry...

408
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,791
Don't be...! That's
exactly how we want them!

409
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,833
Huh?

410
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,791
What we need is
a real challenge...!

411
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,458
Something we haven't faced
at this school in a long time!

412
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,666
At the Athletic Meet,

413
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,125
we don't want opponents
who are pansy-core!

414
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,916
We want them to be wild,
violent beasts ready to compete!

415
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,416
Ichijou!

416
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,125
Yeah! That's the spirit!

417
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,666
Oh... I see...

418
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,041
Well, that's over...

419
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,583
Those 2-D students
are really riled up...

420
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,875
I could use a break
right about now...

421
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,708
and some of those
delicious looking cookies

422
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,083
that Ms. Anegasaki kindly made.

423
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,333
Huh?

424
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:50,666
Uh... Uh... Uh...

425
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,750
But they were right here?

426
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,583
Ah, Tani.

427
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,458
Have you heard the news...?

428
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,750
Guess who my go-getters in 2-D

429
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,708
are competing against
at the Athletic Meet?

430
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,916
Your problem children
in 2-C. Funny, huh?

431
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,333
Oh, yeah, I already heard.

432
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,583
Well, I think we already know

433
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,375
who's going to come out
on top, now don't we?

434
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,958
My class is a
bit more disciplined

435
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,125
than yours after all.

436
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,583
Oh, but then again...

437
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,375
Maybe they'll add faculty
pushing to the activities...

438
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,166
I'm just kidding, Tani...

439
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,041
I wish your class the best
of luck; they're gonna need it.

440
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,250
Oh, I meant to tell you.

441
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,333
I ate those cookies
that were on your desk.

442
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,083
They just smelled so good.

443
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,125
I didn't think you'd
mind if I had them.

444
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,875
They were delicious...
See ya around.

445
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,625
Guys, I've altered
today's lesson plan...

446
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:56,208
Go get changed...
Time for training.

447
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,208
See, you're going to obliterate
Class 2-D at the Athletic Meet.

448
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:09,083
Hurt 'em... real bad.

449
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,875
This is Tae Anegasaki,
the new school nurse!

450
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,750
Everyone do your best
at the Athletic Meet,

451
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,916
and if you get hurt, I'll be
in the First Aid Tent...!

452
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,666
Next time on School Rumble:

453
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,583
"Time To Start The War!
Now The Cavalry Battle!

454
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:29,583
And The Great Uprising!"
Hario, I've got my eye on you!
