1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,333
Love; war or comedy?
Tragedy or farce?

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,000
Find out next on
School Rumble!

3
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,083
Too eager!

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,375
All right! You go boy!

5
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,875
Kick his butt, Mangoku!
Yeah! Wah!

6
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,916
Ah! What a day for a field trip!

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,416
A class field trip.

8
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,166
It almost makes me feel like
we're back in grade school.

9
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,375
Oh, you make it sound
like we're in kindergarten.

10
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,333
Call it an "educational outing."

11
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,125
It still amounts to the
same thing, doesn't it?

12
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,416
So, where are we headed today?

13
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,833
Who knows?

14
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,708
Look, it's Karasuma!

15
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,000
There's something
different about him today!

16
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,750
No argument here.

17
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,583
For some reason candy tastes
better on days like this.

18
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,416
I wonder what causes that?

19
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,583
Do we have to stay in our
assigned seats after we leave?

20
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,166
Let's hope not.

21
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,000
With everybody so relaxed, the
boys might actually talk to us

22
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,500
without tripping
over their tongues.

23
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,750
I'm not into awkward small talk.

24
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,750
Of course! I should have
thought of this before!

25
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,916
I can sit next to Karasuma!

26
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:13,625
Ah, Tenma! Even with your mouth
full of candy, you're beautiful!

27
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,958
Today, I'm gonna
sit next to you!

28
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,250
You eat just like a chipmunk.
It's so not cute.

29
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,166
I can't help it, I'm nervous.

30
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,166
It's him!

31
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,625
Karasuma!

32
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,083
Okay! I'm going for it!

33
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,583
Crap! Why am I sitting here
playing Old Maid with this guy?

34
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,166
Tenma's sitting right behind me!

35
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,500
Besides, this guy's
impossible to beat!

36
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,750
Talk about a poker face.

37
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,083
I can't even see Karasuma!

38
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,583
He's so close, yet so far!

39
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,125
Oh, I wish that
Harima would move!

40
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,791
This is ridiculous!
I gotta make a move!

41
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,583
Come on! Huh? Old Maid again?

42
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,416
Okay, guys, rest stop!

43
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,666
Be back on the bus in
fifteen minutes sharp!

44
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,875
Yes, Mr. Tani.

45
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,375
Dammit! All I have
to do is sit down!

46
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,291
Okay. I've still got a chance.

47
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,083
I've got a list of topics
ready to make small talk with.

48
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,583
I've read all
the latest magazines.

49
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,458
I've got it all covered.

50
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,916
Okay Harima.
It's go time. Be cool.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,625
Let's go, people!

52
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,625
Go time! Go time!
Go time! Be cool.

53
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,083
Somebody just shoot me.

54
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,250
My what a nice
looking young man.

55
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,833
Watch it.

56
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,125
You're in for trouble if Mrs.
Suru takes a fancy to you, kid.

57
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,458
I can't take it!

58
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,916
Besides, this old guy is
beating me at cards, too!

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,791
I gotta get outta here now!

60
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,916
Hey you, driver!

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,458
You gotta stop this bus!

62
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,416
Hold on! What about our game?

63
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,583
Oh, please stay a little longer,
sonny, there's gonna be yogurt.

64
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,083
I can't stay here! Get off me!

65
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,875
I gotta get back
to Tenma! Stop it!

66
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:39,041
Tenma!

67
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,250
Oh, crap, where am I now?

68
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,333
Ugh! Get your snout outta there!

69
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,083
I gotta get back to the bus!

70
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,291
Somebody stop this thing!

71
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,208
He's alone, he's alone!

72
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,083
That seat's empty!
This is my big chance!

73
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,625
Yes!

74
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,166
But what should I say?

75
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,333
Pardon me for intruding,
but is this seat taken?

76
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,875
Oh, puke!

77
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,375
That's just too cliché!

78
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,416
"Hey, there, are you
having a good time?"

79
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,750
Oh, no, that's even worse!

80
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,833
Now what?

81
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,625
She looks like she's
having a fit over there!

82
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
I see.

83
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,708
Enough! Just do it!

84
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,791
K-K-K-K--

85
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,083
Hey, Karasuma! Can I sit here?

86
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,583
Huh?

87
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,208
Thanks, appreciate it!

88
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,791
Why you stuck up little--

89
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,291
You should never mess
around with a woman in love!

90
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,666
Hope you enjoy your ride!

91
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,625
Think my seat's broken.
That's weird.

92
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,750
Okay, pork chops,
get outta my way,

93
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,500
there's a beautiful
woman waiting.

94
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,541
I gotta get back
to that field trip!

95
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,458
Tenma! Huh? Oh no.

96
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:14,291
Wait for me,
Tenma! I shall return!

97
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,166
Oh, I don't feel good.

98
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,791
Mr. Tani, may
I sit up front please?

99
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,125
Of course.
Aren't you feeling well?

100
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,541
See you later.'Kay, Karasuma?

101
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,458
Yes, I did it!

102
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,916
At last! My big chance
has finally arrived!

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,833
Only now I feel sick, too.

104
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:51,583
It's true! Kharma
is a cruel mistress!

105
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,916
Mr. Tani?

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,791
May I sit up front, too?

107
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,750
You too? I hope
this isn't an epidemic.

108
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,291
Now what's up with those two?

109
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,333
Eh.

110
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,416
I'm not gonna let a
little bad luck stop me!

111
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,416
I will sit next to Tenma,
just wait and see!

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,458
Tenma! Wait for me!

113
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,750
Morning.

114
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,250
Oh! Morning, Sis.

115
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,125
Breakfast is ready, and your
lunch box is on the counter.

116
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,500
Thanks.

117
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,500
I can't wait for you.

118
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,041
I've got to leave early today.

119
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh? That's unusual.

120
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,208
What's this? Three lunch boxes?

121
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,208
Her lunch box,
my lunch box--

122
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,708
Could it be for a boy she likes?

123
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,208
Go, Yakumo! Go, Yakumo!
Go, Yakumo-mo-mo!

124
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,791
See you later.

125
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,958
My precious
baby sister's in love!

126
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,083
There's so much
I'll have to teach her.

127
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,416
Of course, she's so
inexperienced compared to me.

128
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
I hope this guy isn't some creep
who'll take advantage of her.

129
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,250
Now I'm worried.

130
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,291
I'd better follow her and scope
this guy out, just to be safe.

131
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,166
Whoops! Almost forgot
to lock the door.

132
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,250
Hey, Sis.

133
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,916
Oh man! All this just for a cat?

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,541
I thought you had
yourself a boyfriend!

135
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,416
Sorry, it's a cat.

136
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,250
Oh, well, forget it.

137
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,833
So you've been taking
care of a stray cat.

138
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,958
How's it going?

139
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,458
Well, so-so.

140
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,916
He's pretty stand-offish.

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,250
He hasn't even
come close to me yet.

142
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,208
Stubborn little thing.

143
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,958
He's not ready to trust me.

144
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,125
Here's your lunch.

145
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,916
You can eat it
when you're ready.

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, for heaven's sake!

147
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,625
Why are you wasting
your time on this?

148
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,625
I'm just testing
something, that's all.

149
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,833
You need to forget
about that dumb cat

150
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,750
and find a boyfriend
like a normal girl!

151
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,250
Crimanetly!
We're gonna be late! Let's go!

152
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,958
So long. See you later.

153
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,333
Check it out!

154
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,416
Isn't that the new
freshman, Tsukamoto?

155
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,875
What a babe!

156
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,666
Yeah, she's easy on the eyes.

157
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,583
She's the most
popular girl in her class.

158
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,500
No duh!

159
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,541
And not only is she gorgeous,
she rocks at sports, too!

160
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,958
Just the other day,

161
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,958
the coach for the track team was
trying to sign her up!

162
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,791
Yeah, she's smart!

163
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,750
She was eighth in her class
after the midterm exam!

164
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,083
Wow! So the perfect
girl really does exist.

165
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,166
She must have a heck
of a social life.

166
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,833
That's what you'd think,
but she never talks to guys.

167
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,583
Oh, the picky type, huh?

168
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,791
Not at all.

169
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,833
She just doesn't realize
how popular she is!

170
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:20,958
What a waste.

171
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,958
Yeah, it's her
only flaw. Too bad.

172
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:37,791
Morning!

173
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,208
Sara! Morning.

174
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,708
What are you day dreaming about?

175
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,250
I thought--
I thought I saw a cat.

176
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,666
A cat?

177
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,916
Do you think it was the
same cat you've been helping?

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,625
I'm not sure.

179
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,375
And it followed you to
school to repay your kindness?

180
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,916
Come on, that sounds
like a fairy tale!

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,833
I guess you're right.
Those things don't happen.

182
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,875
Not in real life.

183
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:07,500
Okay.

184
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,750
Pay attention.

185
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,291
This stuff will be on the test,

186
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,458
so you might want
to write it down.

187
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,375
Hey, is this yours?

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,791
Holy crap!

189
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,416
I actually spoke to Tsukamoto!

190
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,541
This must be my lucky day!

191
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,583
Oh, thanks a lot.

192
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,291
Yes!

193
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,500
She almost touched me!

194
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,875
Excuse me, Miss Tsukamoto?

195
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,541
It's my understanding

196
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,083
that you're one of our
most gifted students.

197
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,541
Would you care to join the
Student Council this year?

198
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,250
Oh, well--

199
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,375
It's really a great honor.
You will join, right?

200
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,541
I have to get home
right after school.

201
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,083
Well, at least come with me

202
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,375
and take a look at the
student council room, okay?

203
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,458
Come on, come on!

204
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,750
Knock it off! You're
scaring her, you little perv!

205
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,375
I didn't mean anything! Honest!

206
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,583
Hmph!

207
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,958
Hi, I'm Haruki Hanai!

208
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,000
And captain of the aikido team!

209
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,583
I'm acquainted with your sister!

210
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,708
In fact, she and
I happen to be classmates!

211
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,875
Enough chat,
let's get to the point!

212
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,125
Do you want to
join the aikido team?

213
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,958
'Cause I think you'd look pretty
good in aikido pants!

214
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,541
I'm sorry. I'm not really
all that into martial arts.

215
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,958
No!

216
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,250
The martial arts allows a woman

217
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,833
to protect herself
from unwanted attentions!

218
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,666
For example.

219
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,875
If I do this.

220
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,916
How did she do that?

221
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,166
No problem.
I'll grab her left arm.

222
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,833
I don't get it!
What's the matter with me?

223
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,708
Why can't I get a hold of her?

224
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,583
Whoa! Your sister
is the clumsiest klutz

225
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,625
in the entire world, but you--

226
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,875
Oh! I'm sorry about that.

227
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,416
Yakumo! It's burning!

228
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,916
Oh no, I wonder
if I can save it?

229
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:26,125
Forget it! Let's try something
different today, an experiment!

230
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,208
But I was making your
favorite curry, are you sure?

231
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,041
So? We'll just make a
different curry, I don't mind!

232
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,958
All right.

233
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,916
So what should we make?

234
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,875
Here's the deal, I'm making
two lists of ingredients,

235
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,125
then you choose one at random.

236
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,291
There! Now choose!

237
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,666
The left one.

238
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,291
Here you go!

239
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,208
Yes! Banana and bean jam cake!

240
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,666
Hold on, you gave
me the wrong paper.

241
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,166
I said the left.

242
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,125
Right! Banana and bean jam,
banana and bean jam,

243
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,541
banana and bean jam,
banana and bean jam!

244
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,375
Oh we're gonna make a
curry, make it in a hurry,

245
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,750
oh I hope it isn't furry,
really shouldn't worry!

246
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,708
Let's dig in!

247
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,250
Oh, gross!

248
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,166
Oh, come on,
sis, it was your idea.

249
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,958
I think it turned
out pretty good.

250
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,833
Dinner time!

251
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,666
You still here?

252
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,666
Poor little thing.

253
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,791
You got yourself stuck,
didn't you? Come on.

254
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,291
Nice and slow.

255
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,625
Almost there.

256
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,750
Oh, man.

257
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,333
Are you all right?

258
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,291
Huh?

259
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,625
I heard it.

260
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,625
Sometimes, I can read
what's in people's hearts,

261
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,916
so I wondered if I could read
what your heart would say,

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,291
but I guess a cat's
heart always says "meow".

263
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,458
Too bad.

264
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,750
Man, I didn't bring an umbrella!

265
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,875
It's too late now.

266
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,333
Let's make a break for it!

267
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,291
Wow, it was clear til
just a little while ago!

268
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,333
Did you bring an umbrella?

269
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,666
No.

270
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,333
No sweat.

271
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,583
You can share mine.

272
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,583
Thanks!

273
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,000
What about you, Akira?

274
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm good.

275
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,750
Hey guys, do you
think we should hang out

276
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,750
for a little while
and wait for Tenma?

277
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,791
She said she had
something to take care of.

278
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,166
I'll betcha anything you like
she forgot to bring an umbrella.

279
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,750
Name your odds.

280
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,375
No, she's got an umbrella,
all right, you can count on it.

281
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,958
Therefore, we can leave
with a clear conscience.

282
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,625
But how do you know that?

283
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,708
I just know.

284
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,458
Hmmmm.

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,166
At last! They're gone!

286
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,250
You forgot something, Mikoto.

287
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,166
While it's true I always
forget my umbrella.

288
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,583
Ta-da!

289
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,666
My very capable sister
always leaves me a back-up,

290
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,583
just in case!

291
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,083
What a downpour!

292
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,333
I'm sorry everybody.

293
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,583
I didn't really have
something to take care of.

294
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,250
It's just I couldn't
miss a chance like today!

295
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,791
A rainy day, and a guy,

296
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,791
and a girl, under
an umbrella together.

297
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,750
There's no way it can fail!

298
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,875
Karasuma and
I under one umbrella!

299
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,750
En garde, Karasuma!
Your heart is mine!

300
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,291
Whoops.

301
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,916
Oh, no!

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,416
I just realized something!

303
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,875
What if Karasuma already
has his own umbrella!

304
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,916
I've done it again!
I'm such a total idiot!

305
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,916
Idiot, idiot,
idiot, idiot, idiot.

306
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,750
That hurts.

307
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,041
Huh?

308
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:55,750
Oh my gosh!

309
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,041
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

310
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,875
Please. I'm fine.

311
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,541
Uh, it's funny
I should run into you.

312
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,916
I wanted to ask you
if you, uh, have an--

313
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,500
Umbrella?

314
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,708
Uh, no.

315
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,291
Sweet!

316
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,666
Look! Karasuma!

317
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,791
I have an umbrella!
The two of us could share it!

318
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,375
I brought my rain costume.

319
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,583
His rain costume?

320
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,416
Most high school kids
wouldn't be caught dead

321
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,875
in a nerdy rain costume!

322
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,750
But that's why he's special!

323
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,291
My Karasuma can
look stylish in anything,

324
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,166
even a geeky rain slicker!

325
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,916
It's another thing
I love about him!

326
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,041
But wait! This sucks!

327
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,750
There's no point in sharing!

328
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,250
He's already prepared
for the rainy weather!

329
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,541
Oh, so what if you
have your own umbrella?

330
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,750
Let's share anyway!

331
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,333
Huh? But we have two,
we'll just get wet!

332
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,583
How come?

333
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,458
Because it'll be fun, you goof!

334
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,916
And I love doing
coupley stuff like this!

335
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,583
Who cares if
we get a little wet?

336
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,083
Aw.

337
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,250
Oh! Oh!

338
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,250
I hadn't thought of that!

339
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,750
I can use that approach!

340
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,458
Okay, this time I'm not
gonna take no for an answer!

341
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,833
Karasuma! H-hold on a minute!

342
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,125
We--we can still share
my umbrella, just for fun!

343
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,250
You--you'll enjoy it!

344
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,375
I promise! So why don't
we give it a try? 'Kay?

345
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,125
His rain costume is a water imp?

346
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:51,958
I love you, Karasuma.
So very, very much.

347
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,375
Softball? But I reek at sports!

348
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,416
But Karasuma is watching,
so I gotta give it my all!

349
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,583
Next time on School Rumble:
"Burning Hot First Love!

350
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,250
Burning Hot Tea Party!
Burning Hot Softball!"

351
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,458
Can too much tea
make you pass out?
