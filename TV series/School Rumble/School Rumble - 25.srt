1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,958
School Rumble...
is comin' up next!

2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:17,375
Here it comes. Stand fast!

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,208
A wave is coming, port side!

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,250
Hey...! Man overboard!

5
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,833
Help me!!

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,250
Damn! Not good!

7
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,125
Hurry! Ootani can't swim!

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,166
Why the hell does
he work on a boat?

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,166
What do we do?

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,916
Squid bait went overboard!

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,250
Suicide?!

12
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,916
Look! The rope isn't tied down!

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,625
They're gonna die!

14
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:56,625
It's the Captain!

15
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,125
It's impossible...!

16
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,208
Even the captain can't
pull out two men at once!

17
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,625
Damn! The captain
actually did it!

18
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,333
We should probably be helping!

19
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,958
I... can't hold it!

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,791
Sing, you bastards!

21
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:33,583
Yoiyasa! Yoiyasa! Yoiyasa!

22
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,500
Ha...!

23
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:42,583
♪ Eagles flying in the sky ♪

24
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:48,000

30
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,375
You did pretty damn
good for a new guy...

31
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,625
All right, from now on we're
gonna call you the comic kid.

32
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,625
How long do you
plan to lay there?

33
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,291
Meet me in my quarters.

34
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,791
Captain, don't do it!

35
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,708
He's gonna hang comic
kid by his fingernails!

36
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,708
I really wanna thank you
for saving me, Captain.

37
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,083
Those are comics...

38
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,250
I like to draw them,

39
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,291
so I thought I might
bring them with me.

40
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,750
How long have you
been drawing comics?

41
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:20,333
I ... don't know.
Just a little while, really.

42
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,833
So kid, you serious about art?

43
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,625
Hey! What was
that for, Captain??!

44
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,083
What kind of pen are you using?

45
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,208
I, uh, mainly use a G-pen.

46
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,916
Hmm.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,541
And, what's with that dog?

48
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,541
Is there any reason
for it to be there?

49
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,416
It's because ...

50
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,750
I was told that the
chief editor... likes dogs.

51
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,333
and I figured he would
like my comic better

52
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,041
if I added it in there.

53
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,916
What about the girl?

54
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,833
Um, she's...

55
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,833
He's gonna kill me if
I tell him it's the girl I love.

56
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,208
The drawing's horrible.

57
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,958
But the character has potential.

58
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,583
The problem is, you're drawing
comics for the wrong reason.

59
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,500
You don't draw
to escape reality!

60
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,708
Change course.
We're heading back to shore.

61
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,250
Uh? Seriously?

62
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,916
But Captain, why?

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,458
Don't you understand?

64
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,500
You don't belong on this boat!

65
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,750
I'm taking you back to shore!

66
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,666
This is all my fault.
Sorry guys.

67
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,916
Don't worry.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,166
Hey, if it makes
you feel better,

69
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,625
we're gonna miss you,
and your comics!

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,250
You're such a
little girl, Ootani!

71
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,625
What? What's that for?

72
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:26,291
A... fish bone pen?
But I couldn't.

73
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,125
It looks... like it's special.

74
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,250
Take it.

75
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,625
Captain, wait a second.

76
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,916
Don't tell me you were...

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,833
It was a long time ago...

78
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,416
I wrote two volumes
before my pen and I retired.

79
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,583
I know that chief editor who
likes dogs very well in fact.

80
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,416
He's become famous
in the comic business.

81
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,500
He's a strange one, but he seems
to know his stuff pretty well.

82
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,291
Remember, the land can
be as cruel as the sea.

83
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,291
But never stop fighting.

84
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll make you proud.

85
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,041
Thank you, Captain.

86
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:18,416
The Captain's book,
it's so boring...

87
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,708
The 25th time!

88
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,833
Tenma, have you thought about

89
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,750
maybe buying Karasuma a present?

90
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,000
I think that might
be a little bit easier.

91
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,833
That's a good idea!

92
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,916
Now lemme see, I don't
really know what a girl

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,916
would get a guy for a present.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,375
I wonder who could
tell me what to get?

95
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,333
Let's do this!

96
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:55,750
Yello?

97
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,625
Oh. Hey, Harima!

98
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,541
Tenma?! Hi...! Hey!

99
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,875
Sorry to bother you.

100
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,208
I'm calling to ask

101
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,583
if you would mind going
shopping with me tomorrow.

102
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,791
This can't possibly
be happening for real.

103
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,750
Tenma actually asked me out!

104
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,291
Calm down, Harima.
Just calm down!

105
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,208
This is my chance!

106
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,416
Sorry I'm late... I got lost!

107
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,750
There she is! My angel!

108
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,458
Why is she so friggin' cute?!

109
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,791
Hope you didn't
have to wait long?

110
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,541
No, no, I just
got here. It's cool.

111
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,791
So, what are you
shopping for anyway?

112
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,041
Um...

113
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,750
Actually, I wanted to
buy a birthday present

114
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,791
for the guy that I like.

115
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,833
Curse you Karasuma!!!!

116
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,708
I figured you'd be
a good person to ask,

117
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,166
since you're dating Yakumo!

118
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,583
Such agony.

119
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,541
You know, I've been wanting to
tell you this for a while now.

120
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,666
See, your sister
and I aren't really...

121
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,958
I really appreciate you doing
this, but can we get going?

122
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,708
Leave it to me.

123
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,833
I never even thought
about coming to Tokyo!

124
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,166
We'll be able to find a great
present here for sure!

125
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,291
You're awesome, Harima!

126
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,875
Hey, Look! Look!

127
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,416
Those pastries look
so good, don't they?!

128
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,416
Look at us. I bet we look
just like a couple right now.

129
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,750
I'm sure we do!

130
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,958
I need to look as cool as
possible. Chicks dig the cool!

131
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,250
Wow! Look at
that cute dress! Aw.

132
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,916
I wanna wear something like
that, but I don't think I could.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,250
I'll make you feel like you're

134
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,125
the prettiest girl in
this whole place, Tenma.

135
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,291
Hey. Ya know somethin', Tenma.

136
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,416
Dressed just the way you are...

137
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
you are the prettiest girl here.

138
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,750
Hey. What were
you talking about?

139
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,083
Oh, I... I said that the
sky is very pretty today.

140
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,916
What?

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,625
Moron! That came outta nowhere!

142
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,708
Why would I be
talking about the sky?

143
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,791
I meant to say that
she was pretty. Stupid!

144
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,958
So Harima, can you
think of anything

145
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,666
that would make a good present?

146
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,416
Uh, I don't know, have
you thought about clothes?

147
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,333
Clothes might be good. Yeah?

148
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,833
That's a great idea!
He would love that!

149
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,750
Wow!! That's adorable!

150
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,083
You... think so?

151
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,750
I liked the other one too. But,
this might be better. Hmm...

152
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,666
They both look
really nice on him.

153
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,000
It might be a little
too kiddish, though.

154
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,458
I feel... so lucky.

155
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,041
Harima?

156
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,250
Hey, you know what?
We look like we're a couple!

157
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,666
You... You think so too?

158
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,291
Come on, do it!

159
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,041
Now's the time to tell
her how you feel, Harima!

160
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,583
Tenma, now that
you mention it I...

161
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,791
Is he your boyfriend?

162
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,666
No, not at all.

163
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,083
So, he's just a friend?

164
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,625
Actually, he's dating my sister.

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,416
My luck... it's gone.

166
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Come on, there's
nothin' good here.

167
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,708
There isn't? Okay?

168
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,625
I know it. Tenma's
in love with Karasuma.

169
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,333
No matter how hard I try,

170
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,958
she's never gonna look my way.

171
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,083
I thought that shirt
back there was kinda nice.

172
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,958
So, did you come up
with a different idea?

173
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,916
I know I can't change reality
by daydreaming like this,

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,833
but I can't help it!

175
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,000
Tenma, I can't let reality win!

176
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,583
Okay, that's it!

177
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,625
I'm now going to show you the
present that will win his heart!

178
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,041
You're... serious?

179
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,125
Yes.

180
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,708
We found a great gift!
Thank you Harima!

181
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,166
I really hope this cute little
bear will make Karasuma happy.

182
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,958
Forgive me, Tenma.

183
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,458
I don't think anyone
would like that thing.

184
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,791
But my heart belongs
to the devil right now.

185
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm really glad you
came with me, Harima!

186
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,791
Well, I guess
we should get goin'.

187
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,625
Ooh! Wait, Harima!

188
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,791
Thank you for helping me!

189
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,791
It's a T-shirt.

190
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,458
I bought it at that shop!

191
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,583
Wha... Where are
we going, Harima?

192
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,583
I already bought a present!

193
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,708
I've changed my mind.

194
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,583
We're gonna find
somethin' better.

195
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,833
You have to choose for yourself.

196
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,000
It doesn't matter what it is,

197
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,750
as long as it comes
from your heart.

198
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,500
Really? Then would it be
okay if I made him something?

199
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,291
Yeah, guys like that.

200
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,833
And if he acts like he's
not completely happy with it,

201
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,125
even for a second...

202
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,958
I'll make damn sure
that he changes his mind!

203
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,416
Harima, you've really thought
a lot about dating, haven't you.

204
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,916
Uh, no! It's because of you!

205
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,041
What's because of me?

206
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,166
You're... so stupid!

207
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,958
Awkward!

208
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,291
No, that's not what
I meant! I am such a jerk!

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,125
You've really helped me
a lot today, so thank you.

210
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,583
Yakumo's a lucky girl.

211
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,125
Excuse me sir, I'd like
to return this please!

212
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,541
Right.

213
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,500
Why am I doing this again?

214
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,416
The girl I like is
sitting right next to me,

215
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,875
and I'm goin' home without
telling her how I feel.

216
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,291
But wait, I still
have this moment!

217
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,416
Come on, Harima!

218
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,333
Tenma, I wanted to...

219
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,208
♪ Every time
I see you smile ♪

220
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,791
♪ My heart is
slowly breaking. ♪

221
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,291
♪ Because I know
you're dreaming ♪

222
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,791
♪ Of someone else ♪

223
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,583
♪ But I've dreamed
my own reality ♪

224
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,416
♪ Of a space
train into love ♪

225
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:39,750
♪ It's only you and me
Riding forever. ♪

226
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,458
At that moment, the young
man realized that there

227
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,708
might indeed be reason

228
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,291
to hope for love in this
relationship, someday.

229
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,833
But for now the young
girl simply slept on.

230
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,041
What? So you didn't
get him a present?

231
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,500
Harima said he would
like it much better...

232
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,500
if I made him something myself!

233
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,208
Harima said that?

234
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,375
Yeah, so this is my plan...

235
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,291
on the very day of
Karasuma's birthday ...

236
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,916
I'm going to confess
my love for him!

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,250
Yay! It's perfect!

238
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,583
I'm not giving up yet.

239
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:26,208
I will confess my love for Tenma
when this comic is finished!

240
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,375
Oh yeah.

241
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,083
When was the deadline
for that comic contest?

242
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,125
Let's see...

243
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,333
That's tomorrow!
I won't make it!

244
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,000
It's time for the
Cultural Festival.

245
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,625
That's gonna be fun!

246
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:50,125
Tenma's sister, I have to
talk to you about something.

247
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,375
Well, see ya later!

248
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,625
Hey wait! Sara!

249
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,166
Listen... I need your help!

250
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,208
Hey, what's up?

251
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,583
Oh Harima. You're home early.

252
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,250
I have to use the
bedroom for a while.

253
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,916
So, please don't come in.

254
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,791
Today is the deadline.

255
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,125
I'm desperate for your help!

256
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,916
Huh?

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,875
Please! I'm staking
my life on this!

258
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,083
Uh... All right.

259
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,458
Hey, thanks, I knew
I could count on you...

260
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,083
Now, let's draw.

261
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:27,916
Um. Just now. That was
Ms. Itoko, wasn't it?

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,666
Oh her. Well she's um...

263
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,750
Actually, she's my cousin.

264
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,625
Wait, she's your cousin?

265
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,583
Uh-huh.

266
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,333
Oh... really?

267
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,833
What? Is that weird
to you or something?

268
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,708
The fact that she's my teacher,
and also my cousin?

269
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,083
Um, no.

270
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,916
So, does that mean you
also live with Ms. Itoko?

271
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,625
Yeah, I do. If it bothers
you, I'll ask her to leave.

272
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,958
N-No, that's okay.

273
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,000
I have to finish this.
I mean it.

274
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,625
It's one of the
most important things

275
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,416
I've ever tried to
accomplish in my entire life.

276
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,791
I swear on the pen,
the Captain gave me!

277
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,583
The Captain?

278
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,291
Uh, xcuse me!

279
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,541
Oh. Hi Tenma! Welcome.

280
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,625
What's up? Did you come
to watch band practice?

281
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,458
Uh. Sort of.

282
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,583
Who's there?

283
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,291
Oh! Um, I...

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,083
If you came to see
Karasuma, he's over there.

285
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,041
Karasuma. You look
like a rock star!

286
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,041
What is he doing?

287
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,125
He's trying to find
the coolest guitar pose.

288
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,083
Harima, I was wondering
about something.

289
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,333
What's up?

290
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,416
This character. She kind
of looks like my sister.

291
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,250
Aw, no!

292
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,833
And this character,
looks just like you.

293
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,000
I didn't mean anything,
I just had to ask.

294
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,208
See, these characters really
do look like you and Tenma.

295
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,291
Wha? What are you talking about?

296
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,875
Tenma's sister,
lemme tell ya something...

297
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,041
A comic's purpose is not

298
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,041
to reveal the
fantasies of its writer...

299
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,000
Got it?

300
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,583
Now where. Where does it
look like me and Tenma?

301
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,500
I'm sorry, Harima.

302
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,791
It's okay. You don't
need to apologize.

303
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,666
So... I hope everything
turns out well for these two.

304
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,416
How?! How does she
know all these things?

305
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,625
I'll just pretend she's wrong.

306
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,083
Sorry, but you
wouldn't by any chance

307
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,791
have feelings for my sister?

308
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,958
Ha... Harima...

309
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,416
Harima, look.

310
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,458
Are you... Are you okay?

311
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,125
I... I get it now.

312
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,958
And I'm starting to feel...
a little creeped out.

313
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,041
So, um, am I to believe
that you have psychic powers?

314
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,250
Are you able to
read people's minds?

315
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,958
Well, you see that's
not it not exactly.

316
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,166
Then, what?

317
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,000
It's not... It's not
really that simple...

318
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,125
I guess I can, in a way.

319
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,583
Don't try to try to use
your mind tricks on me.

320
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,083
There's no way you
could have gotten

321
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,333
that information from the comic.

322
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,750
I purposely got rid of
anything that would've

323
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,416
made those characters
look like me or Tenma.

324
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,708
So there's only one possible
explanation that makes sense.

325
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,416
You've got some
kind of psychic--

326
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,458
No, stop it!

327
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,625
I can feel you
messin' with my mind!

328
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,208
Please! Get outta my head!

329
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,000
No... I'm not. Honestly.

330
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,458
No! Stop! Don't do this to me!

331
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,041
This sucks!

332
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,291
The more I try not
to think about her,

333
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,416
the more she pops
into my head! Go away!

334
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,083
That's it!

335
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,791
From now on, I will
empty my mind completely!

336
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,458
Why is everyone so late?

337
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,041
I told you, Megumi
has other clubs today!

338
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,333
We're gonna go look for them.

339
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,625
You stay here and watch
Karasuma practice, okay?

340
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,791
Hey, wait! Fuyuki!

341
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:47,291
Um, Harima...?
You have a deadline to meet.

342
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,166
Deadline! Right! I am awake!

343
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,041
Oh, man! I can't
think of anything to say!

344
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,083
Uh, hey! Can I play
with the guitar?

345
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,916
So... am I holding
it the right way?

346
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,250
Ow! That hurt!

347
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,166
I cut myself.

348
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,625
Oh, Miss Tsukamoto,
are you all right?

349
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,375
How's the practicing going?

350
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,958
Tenma! Are you okay?

351
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,250
Ka! Karasuma!

352
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,416
Oh, you're awake.

353
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,166
Did you have a
nice nap, Miss Tsukamoto?

354
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,000
What... happened?

355
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,500
Don't worry. I'll have
you home in just a minute.

356
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,291
Are you going to be all right?

357
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,583
Yes. Thanks.

358
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,500
Sorry you had to carry me.

359
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,791
Hope I wasn't heavy.

360
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,375
That's all right,
it was no trouble at all...

361
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,750
See you.

362
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,916
It's one day early.

363
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,208
But now is the best chance
I have to give him his present!

364
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,291
Wait... I...!

365
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,458
Um, I, uh... See I...

366
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,875
I have something that...

367
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:36,958
I want to give you for--

368
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,583
Please don't.

369
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,666
I don't have any more time left.

370
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,208
Sorry. I have to go now.

371
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,708
Karasuma?!

372
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:51,125
Is it that... you're gonna...
change schools after all?

373
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,333
Hey!

374
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,583
A... space ship?

375
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,791
Karasuma?

376
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:08,916
Miss Tsukamoto... the truth is
I'm not really from this planet.
