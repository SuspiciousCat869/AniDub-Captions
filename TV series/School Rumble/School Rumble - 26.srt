1
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,541
A... space ship...? Karasuma?

2
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:25,916
Miss Tsukamoto... the truth is
I'm not really from this planet.

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,583
Uh...

4
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,291
Can I ask you a
question, Harima?

5
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,583
Mm?

6
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,583
Well, I...

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,416
I was just wondering
what it means to go steady.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,916
Everyone says it like they know,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,958
but what does it really mean...?
To see another person?

10
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,208
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, I'm way
out of line asking you this!

11
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,250
You know...

12
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,750
Uh...?! Yes?!

13
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,250
I'm not really
sure I know myself...

14
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,500
but there are these moments,
like when you're riding

15
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,916
your bike by the
seashore in the morning...

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,041
And suddenly the sun rising up

17
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,291
out of the ocean
looks so beautiful...

18
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,041
Or when you eat
something really delicious...

19
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,458
or you see a
really great movie...

20
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,500
You wanna share those moments...

21
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,083
with someone who
feels the same way...

22
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,041
I think... I think "going
steady" means accumulating

23
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,250
a series of those
moments with someone...

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,416
Uh... But what do
I know about it anyway?

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,375
I'm probably way off base!

26
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,791
Hey, do me a favor...

27
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,250
hand me that French
curve there, will you?

28
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,125
Huh...? Sure...

29
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,625
Oh my goodness...! What's that?

30
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,708
It's heading for
the Yagami Shrine!

31
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,375
Wha... What should we do?

32
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:51,291
You wait here!

33
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,666
But...

34
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,083
No buts! I'll check it out...!
I'll be right back!

35
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,541
Karasuma!

36
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,500
Incredible...

37
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,458
I always thought you were a
little on the strange side...

38
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,250
...but I had no idea you
were really an alien spy!

39
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,250
Talk! Why did you come to
the Earth in the first place?

40
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,750
Survey...

41
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,708
My superiors sent
me here to determine

42
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,416
if this planet should
be allowed to exist.

43
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,541
I'm going after him!

44
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,625
You can't mean it...

45
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,375
You would destroy the Earth?

46
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,250
Rest easy...
My analysis indicates

47
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,333
that this planet should
be left undisturbed.

48
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,541
And so it shall...

49
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,125
Now wait just a second!

50
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,833
It's not that simple!

51
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,958
You can't just waltz out of
here like nothing has happened!

52
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,583
Sis!

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,125
Sis!

54
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,250
Come on...! Snap out of it!

55
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,416
Ya... Yakumo?

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,125
Karasuma...! He's going to...

57
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,791
Calm down! What about Karasuma?

58
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,333
He's going away forever...!
Karasuma...

59
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,375
he's not from earth,
he's from another world!

60
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,583
Why do you stop me... earthling?

61
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,291
I have to... because
Tenma is in love with you,

62
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,791
you alien freak!

63
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,666
And I want her to be happy,

64
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,625
even if it's with
you and not me...

65
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,958
so you're not going anywhere,
ya hear me, space boy?

66
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,416
Alas... I cannot make
Miss Tsukamoto happy.

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't give me that...!

68
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,708
Are you just gonna break Tenma's
heart without a second thought?

69
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,916
I must... I have no choice.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,250
All right... if that's
the way you wanna play it...

71
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,625
I'll just have to make you stay!

72
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,916
Karasuma!

73
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,458
Sis!

74
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,083
Cease your attack... I have
no wish to engage you in battle.

75
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,916
Too bad... now fight,
if you're a man!

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,916
Why...? Why do you do this?

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,583
Because... because...

78
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,250
because I'm in love with
Tenma Tsukamoto, that's why!

79
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,333
Harima, what...?

80
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
Tenma!

81
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,375
Then I must confess as well...

82
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,791
I am also in love the
earth girl Tsukamoto.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,541
That makes it even worse...!
Fight, coward!

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,541
No, don't!!!

85
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,750
Karasuma, no!

86
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,416
Don't worry, I'm fine...

87
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,000
you'd better check
on Harima, though.

88
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,291
That... That scar, it-- 

89
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,916
Tenma... that one time
you thought I saved you...

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,250
it wasn't me.

91
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,625
You... You mean--

92
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,500
It was you who saved me...!

93
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,416
I remember it like
it was yesterday!

94
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,708
I know... I'm sorry
for deceiving you...

95
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,041
I rewrote your memory as part

96
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,500
of my cover story for
my mission on your world.

97
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,541
All this time, the feelings

98
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,583
of love you thought
you had for me...

99
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,583
were actually for Harima the
man who really rescued you.

100
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,416
I love you...

101
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,125
My assignment to this
planet was for a year,

102
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,458
and I was preparing
to return home...

103
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,500
But your letter stopped me...

104
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:33,750
so... I decided to
stay a little longer.

105
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,250
Because...

106
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,083
I had fallen in
love with you too.

107
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,291
If I was cold to you...

108
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,875
it was only because
I knew someday

109
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,708
I would have to return
to my home planet.

110
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,958
You're saying you
want me to follow her?

111
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,416
Go on... there's
something here I must do.

112
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,375
Please don't go,
I'm begging you!

113
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:01,583
It's time... I have to
leave you now, I'm sorry.

114
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,250
Karasuma!

115
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,791
When I've gone...

116
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,041
all your memories of me will
vanish, as if I never existed.

117
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,375
I'm sorry... but you
must forget all about me.

118
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,250
Oh no...! I don't want to!

119
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,083
I will miss you, Miss Tsukamoto.

120
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,500
Karasuma, no!!!

121
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,166
I won't forget...!
You hear me...?!

122
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,458
I'll remember you
for the rest of my life!

123
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,333
What am I doing here?

124
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,791
Tenma!

125
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,625
Are you okay?

126
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,916
Harima!

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,250
What's the matter,
Tenma, what happened?

128
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,666
I had a dream...

129
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,708
I dreamt you went far away
and I forgot about you...

130
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,708
Yeah right...!

131
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,083
Do you think I'd
ever go anywhere

132
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,250
in the entire
universe without you?

133
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,833
Oh, Harima!

134
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:21,416
Oh...! The scar you
got when... I'm sorry.

135
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,625
Eh... It was worth a dozen scars

136
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,875
to meet someone like you ...

137
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,791
I love you... dearest...

138
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,291
I love you...

139
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,375
That's it!

140
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,000
Finished!

141
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,458
Congratulations, Harima...!

142
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,791
Now all you have to do is get
it to the publisher on time!

143
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,916
Karasuma!

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,583
I hope you had a
nice nap, Miss Tsukamoto.

145
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,000
Sorry you had to carry me.

146
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,666
Hope I wasn't too heavy.

147
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,250
That's all right, it was
no trouble at all... See you.

148
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,125
Wait... I...!

149
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,583
Um, I um. See I...

150
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,041
I have some-something that
I want to give you for your--

151
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,791
Sorry.

152
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,708
But I... I have to go now.

153
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,958
Take care of yourself...
Miss Tsukamoto.

154
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,583
I have to go now, he says...?

155
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,583
Take care of
yourself, he... says...?

156
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,125
Does that mean the
time has finally come

157
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,000
for him to change schools?!

158
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh man, I hope I'm on time!

159
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,833
Nakamura... I don't wanna
hear this song anymore.

160
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,416
Oh...? But I thought

161
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,333
this was one of your
favorites... wasn't it?

162
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,541
I'm just getting a
little tired of it, is all.

163
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,083
As you wish.

164
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,041
No! Not now!

165
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,916
I can't waste time
stopping for this guy...!

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,958
If I time it just right I can
slip by him as he goes past!

167
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,791
Huh... that's a long car...

168
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you all right?!

169
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,833
Harima...!
What are you doing here?

170
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,875
Shall I bury him... mistress?

171
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,791
Call an ambulance!!

172
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,208
No...! We've got to deliver
this package quickly...

173
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,083
I'll be all right, just go.

174
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,291
What, are you out of your mind?

175
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,291
You've got to get to
a hospital right a...

176
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,041
I said I'm all right!!!

177
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,708
I've got do this thing...
even if it kills me!

178
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,416
All right then...
Nakamura, get him into the car.

179
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,833
Yes, Mistress.

180
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,958
Oh, an entry for the
New Faces Award...? Of course!

181
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,916
Would you mind telling
me your name, sir?

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,750
Nakamura, the butler,
at your service, miss.

183
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,166
He's bleeding...

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,958
You asleep?

185
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,750
The package has been delivered.

186
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,583
So, Whiskers...

187
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,750
I'm curious,
what was the big deal

188
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,708
with that package
of yours anyway?

189
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,166
I mean... was
it really so important

190
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,250
it was worth risking
your life to deliver it?

191
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,125
Yeah, it was to me.

192
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,416
What's in that package

193
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,791
is the most valuable
thing I have right now...

194
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,625
And I had to deliver it, even
if I got killed in the process.

195
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,875
Sorry for all the
trouble, Rich Girl.

196
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,625
Well, I guess I'll see
you around, Jeeves.

197
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,416
Pardon me.

198
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,250
Huh?

199
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,875
An irrelevant
question, if I may.

200
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,541
Excuse my curiosity...

201
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,791
are you, by any chance, seeing
anyone special at the moment?

202
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,375
If I was, I wouldn't
be goin' through all this!

203
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,083
See ya!

204
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,208
Did you hear that, mistress?

205
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,291
What's that got to do with me?!

206
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:52,208
Oh, Nakamura...? Could you...
play that song again?

207
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,083
Of course... mistress...

208
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,125
Huh?

209
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,541
Sis?

210
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,708
Oh, Yakumo!

211
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,041
Where have you been...?
It's so late!

212
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,291
I've been waiting and waiting!

213
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,791
Well, I was... that is, I...

214
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,541
It's Karasuma! He's leaving!

215
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,000
He's moving away and
I'll never see him again!

216
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,916
And I still haven't told
him how I feel about him...

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,708
It's over... my love is over...

218
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:26,000
This doesn't
sound like you, Sis.

219
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,625
Remember what you said once?

220
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,250
That you'd rather regret
doing something stupid...

221
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,833
than regret doing
absolutely nothing?

222
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,291
You're right...
thank you, Yakumo...

223
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,958
Even if we do have
to say good-bye forever,

224
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,208
I can at least tell him
how I really feel about him.

225
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,125
When you think about it,

226
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,958
it's funny that I've never been
to Karasuma's house before...

227
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:54,458
Let's see... the address is
around here somewhere...

228
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,958
Huh...? Does he
live in a rice paddy?!

229
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,958
Unless this is his
house right here...

230
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,041
even I'm not that dumb!

231
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,541
Or maybe they moved and
took their house with them...?!

232
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,375
Heavens to Betsy!!

233
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,583
Karasuma, where in
the world are you?

234
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,916
Please don't be gone,
I have to tell you!

235
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:20,875
Hello, Karasuma?!
Karasuma are you here?!

236
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,916
No! I won't believe
I'm not going to see him again,

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,291
I won't, I won't,
I won't, I won't!!

238
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,583
Captain... I gave it my all
and I'm so burned out...

239
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,750
I'm just white ash and cinders.

240
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,291
But now I can be the kind of
man who can stick out his chest

241
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,041
with pride and
be worthy of dating Tenma!

242
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,250
Huh...? Whose cat?

243
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,041
Oh, hey, Tenma. What's new?

244
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,208
Wha... Wha-wha-what
are you doing?!

245
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,666
For Pete's sake,
we're in a public park...!

246
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,458
Why are you even here?!

247
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,666
Woah...! Tenma, please...
What's the big idea?

248
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,750
Let's... play... but... that...

249
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,416
can only mean... that you...

250
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,458
...you want to go on a
date with me, is that it?

251
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,500
Let's... go!!!

252
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,416
We're goin' on a date!
We're goin' on a date!

253
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,750
We're goin' on a date!

254
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,333
Wow! Finishing that
comic is paying off already!

255
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,625
I've never seen
Tenma like this before!

256
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,208
She's so aggressive!

257
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,541
Okay, settle down! Stay cool...!

258
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,916
I gotta make sure she has
the best date she's ever had!

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,625
Look out world...! Here we come!

260
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,375
I... I hear the
hot milk steamers here...

261
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:05,083
are really terrific...
try it... go ahead!

262
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,375
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

263
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,083
I can't apologize enough...

264
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,416
If I'd known you
disliked hot food,

265
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,625
we could've gone somewhere else.

266
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:21,083
Uh... listen... there's...
there's something I've...

267
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,083
I've wanted to ask
you for a long time now,

268
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,750
but I just couldn't...

269
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,666
But something's different
about you today,

270
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,875
so I'm gonna take
a chance... because I...

271
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,916
I know I can't
fight it anymore...

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,125
Uh... would you... would you...

273
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,583
would you like to go out
with me again sometime?

274
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,375
Huh?

275
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,666
Meow...? What's that...?
Oh, I know...!

276
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,916
It must be some kind of
slang expression that Tenma

277
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,250
and her chick friends use...!
It's probably something to say

278
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,416
when you feel shy and
awkward around someone...!

279
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,625
She's being demure...!
That is so cute!

280
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,666
So... is that a yes?

281
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,083
Karasuma?!

282
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,833
Karasuma!

283
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,708
Oh, where can he be?!

284
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,583
I've gotta find him!

285
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,583
I've looked everywhere else!

286
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,000
There he is!!

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,375
Karasuma...! Karasuma...

288
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,083
I love you...! I've always loved
you...! Please don't go away...!

289
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,875
I can't bear it...!

290
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,000
Here, I brought you
a birthday present...

291
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,041
What the...?!

292
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,916
Why, thank you,
Miss Tsukamoto...

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,583
how did you find out
this was my favorite?

294
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,125
Huh?

295
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,916
Tasty...

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,541
He liked it...

297
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,625
Listen to me...

298
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,666
I'm not going anywhere...

299
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,708
I'm going to
stay by your side...

300
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,041
Miss Tsukamoto... I love you.

301
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,291
It's... it's like a dream...

302
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,375
And that's that!

303
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,583
Okay, everybody,
class dismissed!

304
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,708
Rats...

305
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,916
Karasuma!

306
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,125
I don't understand, I thought
you changed schools already!

307
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,750
No... how come?

308
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,250
But you... you told me the
other night you had to go!

309
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,416
Right... I had to go
back to band practice,

310
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,083
it wasn't over yet.

311
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,750
Oh yeah... I knew that.

312
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,791
That was close...

313
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,250
Wait a minute...! Then how
much of it was a dream?

314
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,125
Hm?

315
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,458
Meow.

316
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,250
Uh...

317
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,416
"I love you"...
just three little words...

318
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,583
But the moment I say them...

319
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:07,500
the whole world changes...
like magic...

320
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,083
Today I'm going to
say them... to you...

321
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,416
Hey, Tenma...? We're late!

322
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,250
Yakumo...! Wait up!

323
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:22,083
It's Karasuma's birthday
today...! I'm gonna do it!

324
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,041
Good... morning!

325
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,375
Morning!

326
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,375
Wow, Tenma, you seem
really pumped this morning.

327
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,083
Maybe a little bit too pumped.

328
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,083
What's going on?

329
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,166
It's a secret...!

330
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,916
Well, I got something
to do, so see ya later!

331
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,625
Now wait a second...
What's she talkin' about?

332
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,583
Oh, yeah... was that today?

333
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,458
Huh...? Was what today?

334
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,750
There he is.

335
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,791
I have to give
him this present...

336
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,250
and tell him how I really feel.

337
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,458
And that dream
I had yesterday...

338
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,666
Miss Tsukamoto... I love you.

339
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,791
That dream felt so real,

340
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,458
it's just got to be
some kind of omen!

341
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,666
I won't blow it this time!

342
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,375
Right!

343
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,541
Karasuma?

344
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,583
Uh... hi... I've got...

345
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,583
I've got something
that I wanted to give you,

346
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,750
if you don't mind...

347
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,083
Here...! It's a present...
From me.

348
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,416
For your birthday...
Happy Birthday.

349
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,375
Thank you.

350
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,208
May I open it now?

351
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,458
Mhm.

352
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,958
Uh... I made it myself,
you know... 'course...

353
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,916
I only thought of
it yesterday afternoon

354
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,458
and made it last night...

355
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,083
So it's only half-dried.

356
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,083
Why, thank you,
Miss Tsukamoto...

357
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,708
how did you find out
this was my favorite?

358
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,750
It's just like in the dream!

359
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,041
Tasty.

360
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,541
It's all coming true...!
It was an omen...!

361
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,041
That means next...
he's going to say...

362
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,666
Miss Tsukamoto... I love you.

363
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,041
Here it comes!

364
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,291
Miss Tsukamoto... I...

365
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,291
This is it!

366
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,000
It's already over.

367
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,583
Huh?

368
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,708
It's already over... my
birthday, I mean...

369
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,791
two days ago.

370
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,166
I got it wrong again!

371
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,000
Ka-Karasuma?

372
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,250
Oh, you're awake.

373
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,500
I hope you had a
nice nap, Miss Tsukamoto.

374
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,083
Oh, wow... so it...
was all a dream...

375
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,083
You all right?

376
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,500
Uh-huh...

377
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,583
but... do you mind if
I stay here for a bit?

378
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,833
Okay.

379
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,958
Hey, Karasuma?

380
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,416
Yes?

381
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,791
Is this a dream too?

382
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,750
We're all in a dream...

383
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,916
it's a dream
called adolescence...

384
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,375
someday you have to wake up

385
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,916
from that dream,
but even then...

386
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,208
the memories of it shine
forever... like the stars.

387
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,000
Hey... one more thing?

388
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,458
Yes?

389
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,541
There's something...
something...

390
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,583
I've wanted to tell you
for a long time now,

391
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,750
but something
has always come up...

392
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:51,750
I... I lo... I lov... lo...

393
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,250
It's the Culture Festival...!

394
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,083
And our class is
still arguing over putting

395
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,666
up a food stand or doing a show!

396
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,458
Hmph, we'll sort this
out in short order...!

397
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:09,416
And I'm really going to confess
my feelings this time...! Next

398
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,458
time on School Rumble...

399
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,458
Miss Tsukamoto,
there is no next time.
