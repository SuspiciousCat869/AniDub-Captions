1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:09,750
Schoo--

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:11,333
School Rumble will be
coming up in just a moment!

3
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,000
He's here!

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,166
What a bastard...!

5
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,750
I can't believe he had
the nerve to come back!

6
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,541
Get him!

7
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,541
It looks like you've
been dumped...

8
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:39,958
Why did you come here, fool?

9
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,833
There's no place for you
here anymore, outcast!

10
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,791
Time to die!

11
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,375
What's the matter, Harima,
not running away, are you?

12
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,166
You turned into a
coward as well as a loser?

13
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,333
Karasuma.

14
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,500
Very impressive.

15
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,375
I guess some guys
will go to any lengths

16
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,750
to eat a homemade box lunch.

17
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,208
I waded through a sea of blood

18
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,250
and fought my way back
from hell itself to beat you!

19
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,708
You're too late.

20
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,833
Tsukamoto's heart belongs
to me now, for all eternity.

21
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,083
Te... Tenma!

22
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,708
I'm afraid you've
lost... Harima.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Cursed hellspawn!

24
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,666
There can be no mercy
for the likes of you...

25
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,416
a twisted obscenity who plays
with people's hearts like toys!

26
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,250
It's sad, really...

27
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,166
not too long ago you
ruled over this campus,

28
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,375
until I took it
all away from you...

29
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,333
Your precious Tsukamoto
became my plaything,

30
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,625
and I tortured you as
a cat does a mouse...

31
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,208
until I drove you screaming
to the ends of the earth...

32
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,958
it's such a shame...

33
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,041
I pity you from the
bottom of my heart.

34
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,791
Save your pity...!
It's time for the final battle!

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,625
I'm taking back Tenma...

36
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,458
and reclaiming my rightful
place on this campus!

37
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,250
You don't know when
to give up, do you?

38
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,458
Dare you accept my challenge?!

39
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,625
Let's do this!

40
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,083
Take this, fool...! Ha!

41
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,666
You must know you
cannot defeat me.

42
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,333
Are you sure about that, punk?

43
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,833
H... How... How did you
become... so powerful?

44
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,250
Suffering...

45
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,333
My suffering tempered me.

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,791
You have... won... uh...

47
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,083
Tenma!

48
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,958
Speak to me!

49
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,958
Am I dreaming?

50
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,125
No, no... it's really me...

51
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,333
Everything is
gonna be all right.

52
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,375
It can't be...

53
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,791
He said... that you...

54
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,750
Oh, Harima, is it really you...?

55
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,250
It's me... I promise...

56
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,791
Our torment is over...

57
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,708
We have our whole
future to live for now.

58
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,041
Oh, Harima.

59
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,250
I love you.

60
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,625
And I you.

61
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,500
Yum... yummy...

62
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,041
Yum... yummy.

63
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,708
Oh, Karasuma, I hope
you're enjoying the rice balls.

64
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,458
They're not too salty, are they?

65
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,500
That's awesome!

66
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,916
Oh, Karasuma, is the rice ball
rolled the way you like it?

67
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,666
That's awesome!

68
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,083
Oh, Karasuma,
I'm really enjoying this,

69
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,500
but I hope it isn't boring you.

70
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,750
So awesome!

71
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,541
Wow, this is quite
a piece of work...

72
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,750
Well done, it's
superb for a first effort.

73
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,166
Yeah...?

74
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,500
Tell me, what made you
decide to write a comic book?

75
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,750
I... I'd rather...

76
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,166
No, no, no, that's all right.

77
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,666
Forget I asked!

78
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,750
Can you say what made you
decide to bring your work to us?

79
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,750
Well, I'm a really big
fan of the artist, Nijo.

80
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,875
I've been reading his stuff ever

81
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,416
since this company
started running it.

82
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,750
So that's it...!
I thought so...!

83
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,458
There's a definite
influence here,

84
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,583
especially the way
you draw the eyes.

85
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,500
There is...? That's exactly
what I was going for!

86
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,916
Then I should tell you about our
Jou Nijou talent competition

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,875
for new artists
that's coming up.

88
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,958
Mr. Nijou himself is going
to be on the panel of judges.

89
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,333
Take my advice, you
oughta submit your work...

90
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,041
At the very least, I'll bet you
get an honorable mention.

91
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,458
Wow, do you really think so?

92
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,916
With an award like
that under your belt,

93
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,125
the next step would be
to get you a weekly serial.

94
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,041
And you're young, so you don't
have to rush into anything.

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,333
I don't know what to say!

96
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,166
Mr. Nijou's work has been
such an inspiration to me!

97
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,750
Artistically, I was totally
lost until I read his stuff.

98
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,166
And to think he
might read something

99
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,458
of mine is a real honor.

100
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,833
Hey, man, I know how you feel!

101
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,541
Nijou's "Genroku
Defense Force" is one

102
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,583
of the most exciting
things I've ever read!

103
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,125
Yeah, that was my favorite...!

104
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,333
It rocked...!
Did you edit that book?

105
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,833
No wonder you and me are
on the same wavelength!

106
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,208
I loved that part

107
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,166
where the team sneaks
into the enemy's territory.

108
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,833
Yeah, only no one's there,
so they sneak back.

109
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,125
That was great...!

110
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,833
Yeah, that book was
huge, it was a total hit!

111
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,791
Well, speak of the devil, Mr.
Nijou himself just walked in!

112
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,458
Morning, Mr. Nijou...
Thanks for coming by.

113
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,416
Tell you what, I'll
deliver this myself... huh?

114
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,958
No, this was a mistake.

115
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,208
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?!

116
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,500
What's the matter?
Where're you going?

117
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,750
Wow, it's really coming down.

118
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,416
Aw, it's just a shower,
it'll blow over.

119
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,750
Tenma's got that
dopey look on her face.

120
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,083
I wonder why.

121
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,666
Oh, it's nothing.

122
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,500
You're not foolin' anybody.

123
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,166
We already know.

124
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,750
You've been eating lunch with
Karasuma and getting very cozy.

125
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,583
But how...? Who told you...?

126
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,375
How could you
have figured it out?

127
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,958
That's easy, we're geniuses.

128
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,750
And you're obvious.

129
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,291
Of course...

130
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,666
Hey, you...

131
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,583
What are you doing out
in the rain like this?

132
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,250
It was the only
dream that I had left...

133
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,833
The only path that still
remained open to me...

134
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,541
Become an artist...
Get famous...

135
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,750
And then, maybe someday, she'd
be walking along the street...

136
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,416
The girl that I loved...

137
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,916
And she'd step into a little
bookstore on the corner,

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,291
and there would
be one of my comics,

139
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,250
and she'd just
happen to pick it up...

140
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,500
She'd smile and
say, "Interesting,"

141
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,708
and that would be enough.

142
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,083
Just the thought of
that made me so happy...

143
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,500
That wasn't too much
to ask for... was it?

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,333
Oh, wow.

145
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,916
Now that I get a look
at you... you're very young.

146
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,958
And very handsome as well.

147
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,000
You're gonna catch cold...

148
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,083
Why don't you come to
my place and warm up...

149
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,125
Uh, what's your name?

150
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,708
My pen name is Hario Harima...

151
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,625
I wanted something that would
be easy for kids to remember.

152
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,083
I don't now...

153
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,416
I think rice balls every day

154
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,333
might be getting a little
monotonous, don't you?

155
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,875
What?!

156
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,125
I guess that depends on how
much Karasuma likes rice balls.

157
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,916
Maybe he's just too polite
to say anything about it.

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,125
You're right.

159
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,375
He already said his
favorite dish was curry;

160
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,250
that's how all
this got started...

161
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,125
I bet the only reason
he hasn't said anything is

162
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,125
because he's so nice and
doesn't wanna hurt my feelings!

163
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,750
Oh, stupid, stupid, stupid!

164
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,750
How could I not have
noticed this sooner?

165
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,166
Dumb me...

166
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,083
I've been taking advantage of
his kindness this whole time...

167
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,375
I'm such a yutz.

168
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,791
Right.

169
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,125
Tomorrow I'm starting all over
again and having Yakumo

170
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,750
make curry like
I planned in the first place

171
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,958
You mean you make
your sister cook for him?

172
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,375
Huh?!

173
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,750
You know, Tenma, if you
really want to win his heart,

174
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,708
then you have to do the cooking.

175
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,750
But I can't even boil
water without burning it.

176
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,041
As long as the main
ingredient's love, you're good.

177
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,291
You think so?

178
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,666
You're right!

179
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,958
If all it takes is love,
then I can do it, no sweat!

180
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:36,041
Okay...! Karasuma,
next time the curry is on me!

181
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,208
To tell the truth...

182
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,875
When I first saw you...

183
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,083
I felt like we had
some kind of connection...

184
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,125
"He's like me,"
I said to myself...

185
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,791
I've been dumped, too...
Not all that long ago...

186
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,625
These are men's
clothes, all right.

187
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,166
Just make yourself at home.

188
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,500
Can I get you anything to drink?

189
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,208
A beer or something?

190
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,000
Ohhh, I'm out
of the good stuff...

191
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,375
And cash is a little
tight this month...

192
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,208
We'll just have to
make do with this...

193
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,833
Can't be helped...

194
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,291
Here.

195
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,416
Well, I don't think I can...

196
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,750
Oh, gosh...

197
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,666
I bet you don't
even drink yet...

198
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,250
Actually...

199
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,875
I meant, I don't think I can get
drunk on something that weak.

200
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,708
In the end...

201
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,708
I guess I was
just fooling myself...

202
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,208
I thought we'd live
in a cozy little house

203
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,250
in the country somewhere...

204
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,250
have ourselves
a couple of kids...

205
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,500
And on her birthday,

206
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,333
I'd bring her champagne
and flowers every year.

207
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,583
And every year
she'd be surprised...

208
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,916
But it was just a dream...

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,916
just a stupid, fleeting dream!

210
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,333
What's this?

211
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,541
Is it important?

212
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,416
This junk...?!
This garbage...? This trash?!

213
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,958
No! Stop it!

214
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,250
Throw that thing away...!

215
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,416
It belongs in the garbage dump

216
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,833
with the rest of
my broken dreams!

217
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,375
You know, it's possible to fall
in love more than just once.

218
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,916
For example...

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,041
Your next love...
could be right here.

220
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,458
Well?

221
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,208
I can't...

222
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,583
Oh... I didn't mean to...

223
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,000
It's all right,
don't worry about it.

224
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,458
Good night.

225
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,625
I'm so sorry.

226
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,083
Dear Hario Harima...

227
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,041
I read your story...

228
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,666
I may not know much,
but I think it's very good...

229
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,375
You have a lot of talent...

230
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,250
So you shouldn't give up...

231
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,083
I'm leaving some
money on the table.

232
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,541
Buy yourself a hot meal, okay...

233
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,625
I can't take her money...!
I'm already in her debt...

234
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,458
And after she said she
was short on cash... huh?

235
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:27,958
There's more...

236
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,208
Of course, it's not

237
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,166
as good as Nijou's
"Genroku Defense Force"...

238
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,875
I love his work!

239
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,583
Ya... hooo!

240
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,708
Okay, that's all
the ingredients!

241
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,250
Now, sis, are you sure you
wanna do this yourself...?

242
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,750
I'll be glad to help you...

243
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,250
Relax, I'm fine!

244
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,458
It won't mean anything
if I don't do it myself!

245
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,666
You go take it easy.

246
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,708
Watch TV, or take
a bath or something!

247
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,208
Well, okay...

248
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,166
Yeah...! And here we go!

249
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,416
I cut my finger!

250
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,291
I've got the bandages!

251
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,750
Uhhh... so what's next?

252
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,625
Make sure it's not wet
when it goes in the oil...

253
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,458
Yakumo...! Help...! It exploded!

254
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,250
Hey, brother, you've been
around here a lot, lately.

255
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,416
Yeah, well, what can I say.

256
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,458
I really don't have
anything else to do.

257
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,708
I did it!

258
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,500
Beef curry made with love!

259
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay...

260
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,625
Let's see how it tastes.

261
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,750
Well, at least it's different.

262
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,958
Hey there, Iori...! Take a taste
and tell me what you think.

263
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,583
Oh, come on.

264
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,958
At least try.

265
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,125
Iori!

266
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,666
What are we having for
dinner tonight, mommy?

267
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,958
What would you
like to have, honey?

268
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:08,833
Pancakes!

269
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,250
All right, all right!

270
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,416
This is the third
day in a row...

271
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,041
Hario...? I left
some lunch money

272
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,083
for you on the table, okay?

273
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,583
No matter what I tell myself...

274
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,291
I keep going back to
that woman's apartment.

275
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,416
What am I doing, anyway?

276
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,458
Iori...! Where are you...?
Come back, kitty!

277
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,458
Tenma?!

278
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,458
What are the odds...? I run
into her here, of all places.

279
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,041
She seems to be
looking for something.

280
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,583
Could it be me...? But I can't
let her find me like this...

281
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,041
I'm not the Kenji Harima
she used to know...

282
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,958
I've hit rock bottom...

283
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,708
I've even started
going bald from sorrow...

284
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,208
I don't want her to see me...

285
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,750
It's better for us both if
we just pass each other by...

286
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,083
Farewell, Tenma.

287
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,541
Iori!

288
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,833
Iori...!Iori!

289
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,500
It's Tenma's cat...

290
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,833
It's being washed
away by the current...

291
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,208
Crap... I want to help...

292
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,250
but we mustn't have any
more to do with each other...

293
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,166
Oh please, somebody!

294
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,625
Somebody help me!

295
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,083
Please save him...!
Save my kitty!

296
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,291
Please! Help me!

297
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,000
Someone else'll help!

298
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,791
Iori!

299
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,625
Iori!

300
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,458
Iori...

301
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,791
Oh, thank you, thank you!

302
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,458
Go ahead...

303
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,750
Mock the ruin of
a man I've become.

304
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,833
Say, you wouldn't
happen to be...

305
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,583
You're not...

306
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,333
A water imp?!

307
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,375
Uh, water imp, right.

308
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,541
Thank you again, Mr. Water Imp.

309
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,000
Rice balls again?!

310
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,458
She just doesn't get it!

311
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,208
But she keeps ruining the curry!

312
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,125
Then there's only
one thing to do!

313
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,500
And what's that?!

314
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:23,500
Next time on School Rumble,
I have a secret plan!

315
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,541
That's not what
the title card says!

316
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,875
Cause it's a secret!
