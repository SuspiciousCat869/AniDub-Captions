1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,625
School Rumble... coming up next.

2
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,208
Akira has a part-time
job she had to go to.

3
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,750
And Yakumo came back
because Hanai was annoying.

4
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,166
So I can see you three
had good reasons

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,291
to cut the camping trip short...

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,958
But what happened to the others?

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:28,000
They decided to stop at
the Hot Springs for a while.

8
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,750
It's becoming less and less
of a Tea Club event every year.

9
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:32,958
That's true.

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,875
What's happening?

11
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,958
Is it okay to keep
a giraffe at school?

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,083
Why not? It's summer vacation.

13
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,416
Besides, his owner should

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,541
have never left him here
alone in the first place.

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,583
But... wait.

16
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,750
I thought that
he belonged to you.

17
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,583
I wouldn't keep
something like this.

18
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,791
I'm just looking after him

19
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,291
for a little while until
his owner gets back.

20
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,750
Who are these people?

21
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,666
I've never seen them before.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,583
Number 6, it's time to eat.

23
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,458
This lady is very pretty.

24
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,000
But I don't think she
knows what my name is.

25
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,916
I'm Pyotr, but that's
not my real name.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,583
It's a different name
someone gave to me.

27
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,833
I don't remember my real name.

28
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,125
I don't even know
where I was born.

29
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,125
I guess it doesn't matter.

30
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,000
Go ahead.

31
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:22,125
She treats me like
I'm stupid. I don't know why.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,750
Are there any
other animals here?

33
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:30,125
Yes. I left the bigger ones in
the warehouse, for right now.

34
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,333
Ms. Itoko... I think
he's having trouble.

35
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,583
I can't seem to get him to eat.

36
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,958
Mr. Giraffe! Try this.

37
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,458
There you go.

38
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,750
Uh-oh. I can't get up.

39
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,916
Looks like his legs are
too weak to pull him up.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,750
It's true. He needs exercise.

41
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,791
Haven't you been
taking him for walks?

42
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,791
No. Do you want to try it?

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,166
Wouldn't that be a
kind of traffic violation?

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,958
Please, that would be
the least of your worries.

45
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,958
But it's definitely not right

46
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,291
to keep him cooped up
like this all the time.

47
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,625
That's true.

48
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,583
Come on, boy. Come on...
Keep on coming... It's okay.

49
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,416
Be careful,
don't bump your head.

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,625
And stop!

51
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,416
He's kinda scary at night, huh?

52
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,791
Is this okay?
What if people see us?

53
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,916
It's just for a little bit.
He needs exercise.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,416
I brought a volleyball
to play with.

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,583
Do giraffes play volleyball?

56
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,333
Want to play?

57
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,333
This girl seems very kind.
I think I like her.

58
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,791
Wow! He really
likes you, Yakumo!

59
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,791
I appreciate your kindness.

60
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,250
My memory is not very good,

61
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,833
but I'll try my best
not to forget you.

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,208
Oh wait. I think I might
remember something.

63
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,791
That's right!

64
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,000
I had forgotten that there is
someone who loves me very much.

65
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,083
My master.

66
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,916
But where is he?

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,875
Could I have been ...

68
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,125
Mr. Giraffe!

69
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,875
Abandoned?

70
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,458
I miss my master!

71
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,416
Wait! Please! Stop!

72
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,958
Mr. Giraffe!

73
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,958
You've been so kind to me!

74
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,958
I'm sorry! But I need
to find my master!

75
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,958
I'm glad we went camping!

76
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,666
Yeah, it was fun.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,125
I'll be fine the
rest of the way!

78
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:01,958
You sure?

79
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,916
Yes, I'm sure...

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,583
Thanks for walking me this far.

81
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,500
It was my pleasure.

82
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,166
Oh! That's right!

83
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,291
I almost forgot!

84
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,708
You were supposed to tell me
who the girl that you like is!

85
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,208
Come on! Please!

86
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,083
I promise I won't
tell anyone else!

87
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,250
Oh yeah, about that.
It's just...

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,333
Tenma...

89
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,625
I wasn't sure whether
I should tell you this or not,

90
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,041
but I think it's time...

91
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,791
This is it! I can feel it.

92
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:35,250
Actually, the truth is...
I... I love ...

93
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,875
I found you, Master!

94
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,958
Hi, Pyotr. I'm back.

95
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:48,083
That was amazing!
Did you see that, Yakumo?

96
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,500
Wait, Yakumo?
What are you doing here?

97
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,958
Mr. Giraffe, why did
you run off like that?

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,250
Thank you for being so kind.

99
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,458
Well, nice meeting you.

100
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,125
How does it look?

101
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,500
Well, it's still raining.

102
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,625
How am I supposed
to dry this laundry?

103
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,208
I'm gonna have to talk to
the weatherman about this.

104
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,250
Huh?

105
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,750
What is it, Yakumo?

106
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,666
Poor boy, stuck in the rain.

107
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,583
You ran away and you
didn't pack any clothes?

108
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,416
We've just invited
you into our house,

109
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,333
and you have the nerve to
refuse to tell us your name?

110
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,375
How unbelievably rude!

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,916
Hey, look, it's not like I
invited myself into your house.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You should be grateful, bucko!

113
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,875
It's raining pretty
hard out there.

114
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,875
It might be a good idea
if you stayed here tonight.

115
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,625
Yakumo! We don't know him!
He could be dangerous!

116
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,750
He's an innocent boy.

117
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,500
How do you know that?

118
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,625
I just do.

119
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,416
You need to think
about these things!

120
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,958
He may be a kid but
he's still got hormones!

121
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,125
You're way too trusting, Yakumo!

122
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,416
You could at
least taste the food!

123
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,541
You know, Yakumo
made this and most of

124
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,666
the boys in school would
die for her cooking!

125
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,541
So what! Who cares!

126
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,083
At least your
big sister can cook,

127
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,708
which is more than
I can say for you!

128
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,416
I'm the older sister!

129
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,750
What?! You mean no-boobs
here is the older one?!

130
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,625
See! That's what
I'm talking about!

131
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,250
This just proves that
you're a stupid brat

132
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,916
who's never learned any manners.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,916
And, by the way!

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yakumo's may be
bigger than mine,

135
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,041
but that doesn't
mean I don't have any!

136
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:27,666
Um... Tenma...

137
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,083
Little pervert...

138
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,500
You've been staring at
Yakumo's chest this whole time.

139
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,833
What?!

140
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,041
I'm declaring war!
We'll settle this with a game!

141
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,416
Bring it on, stupid!

142
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,791
Old Maid!

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,333
Chess!

144
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,958
Checkmate.

145
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,125
Othello!

146
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,000
You suck. I won
every single game.

147
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,208
What?! Ha! We're
not finished yet!

148
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,708
Secret weapon!
Yakumo, if you please?

149
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,500
"Go" time.

150
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,750
What the heck is that?!

151
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,583
That'll teach you, you pervert!

152
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,583
What's wrong?

153
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,666
I lied. I'm sorry, but I didn't
really run away from home.

154
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,000
It's okay.

155
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,000
Go to sleep.

156
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,250
You owe us big time!
Don't you forget that!

157
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,708
It's not like you did
anything for me, Yakumo did!

158
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,208
I'm gonna strangle
this stupid brat!

159
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,125
I wanted...

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,916
I, um... Ah, just forget it.

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,833
Catch ya later!

162
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,916
I can't say I want
to see her again!

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,958
Wait!

164
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,791
Come and see us again.

165
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,375
He was completely obnoxious...

166
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,500
But it was kind of fun,
wasn't it, Yakumo?

167
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,125
I can't believe summer
vacation is over already.

168
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,916
It's like the end
of a really good book.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,750
Kinda sad in a way, isn't it?

170
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,791
Yeah, it is.

171
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,750
Akira!

172
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,083
I've been waiting for you.

173
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,625
Ms. Itoko is already inside.

174
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,166
What should I do?

175
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,625
I don't have
anywhere to put 'em.

176
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,083
We can try moving
all the animals

177
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,916
to the Yagami Shrine, for now.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
To the shrine?

179
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,375
We can't leave them in the gym
when school's about to start.

180
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,916
People will see them.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,916
It's only a matter of time

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,916
before someone
finds them anyway.

183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,833
Um... Why can't we
send them to the zoo?

184
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,125
No!! There's no way I'll hand
them over to complete strangers!

185
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,750
We have no choice, Harima.

186
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,875
Now put the sheep down.

187
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,750
You really want to? Here?

188
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,083
I promise no one'll see us.

189
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,208
I don't know...

190
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,958
That fake lion
is kind of spooky.

191
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,666
Don't be silly, it's just
a dumb statue. See!

192
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,875
We are reporting live
from above Yagami Shrine.

193
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,125
Where a couple says they
were chased by a wild lion!

194
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,333
Also reported were sightings

195
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,375
of a zebra, tiger,
panda, ostrich, penguin,

196
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,833
an armadillo and
others all in this area.

197
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,375
Other witnesses report
seeing a beautiful young girl

198
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,083
walking a giraffe in
the park late last night.

199
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,750
A beautiful young girl, huh?

200
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,916
...in response to this problem,

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,125
the local hunters'
association is scheduled

202
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,416
to hold a hunting expedition.

203
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,875
This is getting
serious, isn't it?

204
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,041
Any ideas?

205
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,791
They trust me.
I have to help them.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,541
Hey, Yakumo, I came
to visit like you said!

207
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,791
Hey, Shuuji?

208
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,875
Hey, wait... What are
you doing here, Kenji?

209
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,625
Were you looking
for me or something?

210
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,625
I wonder if there
really could be

211
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,916
wild animals in
a place like this?

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,125
I hope so, cause it'd be
quite a scoop. Are you ready?

213
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,833
What the... What's that?

214
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,291
A giraffe?

215
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,500
Get him on tape!!

216
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,541
There's my story!

217
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:44,875
Who are you?!

218
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,541
A giraffe.

219
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,916
That's a costume!

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,125
And what the hell are you doing?

221
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,208
We're not doing anything.

222
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,333
We were just
practicing for our play.

223
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,375
Play?!

224
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,375
No cameras allowed!
Union policy!

225
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,625
What are you...?
Hey! That's my camera!

226
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,458
You can't shoot this play
without my permission!

227
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,000
What's the title of this play?!

228
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,916
"The Tales of a Kitten".

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,708
But, you're a gorilla!

230
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,583
What a waste of time.

231
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,916
And you thought
we'd find wild animals.

232
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,041
Thank goodness, they're leaving.

233
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,125
Close one.

234
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,708
So what did you
guys think of my plan?

235
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,916
Your plan was great!

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,583
Way to go, little brother!

237
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,708
Well, I still needed
to thank Yakumo

238
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,291
for taking care of me the
other night when it rained.

239
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,041
I thought I finally
had my big break.

240
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,500
Oww... Cut it out, you guys!

241
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,125
Watch where the
hell you're going!

242
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,875
Hey. You guys can
come on out now.

243
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,000
We're takin' you
to a safer place.

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,416
Hold it right there, you brats!

245
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,458
Where do you think you're going?

246
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,416
Pyotr!!

247
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,750
What are you doing!

248
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,208
I'm... I'm sorry...

249
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,333
I think you owe
me a full explanation.

250
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,250
And this time, I brought help.

251
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,750
You have no right to do this!

252
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,125
These animals are
completely harmless!

253
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,333
Stay back. We're just
gonna put them to sleep!

254
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,333
Yakumo! Stop!

255
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,750
Get out of the way, kid!

256
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,375
Yakumo! You're gonna
get hurt! It's not worth it!

257
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,750
I understand!

258
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,250
Listen to me! Hurry up! Go!

259
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,625
Come on...! Giddyup!!
Or somethin'!

260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,416
Get out of the way!

261
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,875
All clear!

262
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:31,916
Let go!

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,250
In your dreams!

264
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:33,833
Careful!

265
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,916
Kick his ass!

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Hey!!

267
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,125
Look everyone!

268
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,000
Why are they dancing?

269
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,500
They're showing you how
much you mean to them!

270
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,583
And they don't want to cause
you any more trouble, Harima.

271
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,041
So they're trying
to fix the problem

272
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,166
and show everyone
they're harmless animals.

273
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,708
By dancing like fools.

274
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,250
It's over now.

275
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,708
What do you mean?

276
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,625
I've contacted the zoo and
made arrangements with them.

277
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,208
Oh, we're not gonna get this?
It's a fantastic shot.

278
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,750
Forget it.

279
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,208
A little while after that,

280
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,791
the animals were given
good homes at the local zoo.

281
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,708
Since they were used to people,

282
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,958
and knew how to do tricks,

283
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,625
they were a big hit
with the children there.

284
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,375
Once the animals were taken in,

285
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,041
Harima visited the
zoo pretty regularly.

286
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,333
Harima was known to
hate any type of routine...

287
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,000
but that was one
habit he never broke.

288
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,416
It's time for school again!

289
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,375
The school uniform feels great!

290
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,000
The atmosphere feels right!

291
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,041
Yes! It's a new school year!

292
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,875
But for some reason,
I feel sleepy.

293
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,750
You look like you're still
in summer vacation mode.

294
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,333
You totally don't get it!
Do you, Yakumo?

295
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,208
Nobody would dare
say it out loud!

296
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,916
But, inside
everyone is thrilled!

297
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
People are looking forward to
seeing their sweethearts again!

298
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,416
Yo! Tenma!

299
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,916
Hey! Good morning!

300
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:42,541
Hey!

301
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,833
You got a new hairdo!

302
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,458
It looks fantastic!

303
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,541
Well, it is a new school year!

304
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,250
Can you feel it, Yakumo?

305
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,583
This is the power of a brand
new school year! It's real.

306
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,041
Uh...

307
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,625
Those two are dating?!
Since when?

308
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:04,583
It's all about summer... L-U-V.

309
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,791
Talk about change,
look over there.

310
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,250
Hey! That's Karen!

311
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,041
Wow! She braided her
hair! She looks cute!

312
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,208
That's not all she's changed.

313
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,625
A stylishly shortened skirt,
a touch of eyeliner,

314
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,916
and light pink lip gloss.

315
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,125
She's lived every
schoolgirl's fantasy.

316
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,250
She's had a passionate romance
during the heat of the summer!

317
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,583
You have problems.

318
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,916
Oh, but that's great!

319
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,666
I think everyone should
have a summer love affair!

320
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,916
All I did was meet Karasuma

321
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,666
and go with him to
a wrestling match.

322
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,916
That's not much of a change.
Our relationship really sucks.

323
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,166
I wish I had a
summer romance, too!

324
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,958
Huh? If it's true that people
change when they fall in love,

325
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,666
then that would mean that
if Karasuma has changed...

326
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,416
He might have met some
other girl this summer

327
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,333
and fallen in love
with her! No way!

328
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,375
Nothing like that
would ever happen!

329
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:01,041
Would it?! Come on, Karasuma!
Come to class already!

330
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,750
Good morning.

331
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,083
Karasuma!!

332
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:13,333
He's changed. Karasuma?
What happened this summer?

333
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,291
I don't understand!

334
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,708
Wait! He's still himself,

335
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,625
and no matter what,
I have to accept him.

336
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,875
Whiskers are wonderful!

337
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,750
Whiskers are wonderful!
Whiskers are wonderful!

338
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,875
Whiskers are wonderful!

339
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,708
Whiskers are wonderful.
Whiskers...

340
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,916
Whiskers?! Is she
talking about me?

341
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,416
I knew it! Tenma's
madly in love with me!

342
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:46,458
I guess it's mutual now.
I'll just move a little closer.

343
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,291
Oops. I forgot to take this off.

344
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,583
Miss. The Manhattan you ordered.

345
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,291
Just leave it there.

346
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,916
Of course.

347
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,000
Get her!

348
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,583
Hold it right there.

349
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,875
You've wasted enough
of our time already.

350
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,083
Now where's the brat?!

351
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,458
Tell us where he is, or you die.

352
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,625
All right then. I'll tell you.

353
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,916
Those are the guys who
killed my mom and dad.

354
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,083
I'm sure it was them.

355
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,708
But I... I still don't know why.

356
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,583
Wait...

357
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,958
Akira, why are you helping me?

358
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,958
I have my own reasons.

359
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:22,208
Well, looks like our
little game of tag is over.

360
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,750
Regino, you were
like a father to me.

361
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,125
How could you do this?

362
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,208
A young godfather
should never trust anyone,

363
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,625
that's your first mistake.

364
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,375
Your dress.

365
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,583
Giorno, remember earlier,

366
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,625
when you asked me
why I'm helping you.

367
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:42,041
It's because... you remind me...
of the man that I used to love.

368
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,166
Get down!

369
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,125
Akira, please stay
here a little longer.

370
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,625
Come visit me in Japan,
when you're older...

371
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,750
I'll make you a
delicious cup of tea.

372
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,208
Akira, how was your
summer vacation?

373
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,250
Typical. Just a
little bit of trouble.

374
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,583
Trouble?

375
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,916
Hi! I'm Karen Ichijou.

376
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,458
I don't know if he remembers,
but Imadori and I have a date.

377
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,875
I've never been on a date
before. What should I do?

378
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,416
Next time on School Rumble...

379
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,583
The one who loves you
will always be with you!
