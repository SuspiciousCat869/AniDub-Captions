1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,333
School Rumble's starting...

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,916
...right after this.

3
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,208
Mountain spirits, please
bless us with lakes, pears,

4
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,583
and trees, instead of
snakes, bears, and bees!

5
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,500
Uh, is that a real camping song?

6
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,333
Uh, yeah.

7
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,375
You've never heard it?

8
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,791
She's pulling your leg, Eri.

9
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,208
Uh! You are so obnoxious!

10
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,541
Gotcha!

11
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,333
Hey...! There it is!

12
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,458
The campground!

13
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,750
Wow!

14
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,000
The mountains are so
beautiful this time of year!

15
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, and smell that fresh air!

16
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,458
Echo!

17
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,166
It's too bad Sara's
not here to see this.

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,875
Hey, look...

19
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,083
She already had plans...

20
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,666
and this was a last
minute trip after all.

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,750
Oh...

22
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,875
So what exactly
does camping have to do

23
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,333
with the Tea Club anyway?

24
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,958
Nature calms the mind...

25
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,208
Besides, this really isn't an
official club outing anymore.

26
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,291
Right!

27
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,708
You and Yakumo
are the only members.

28
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,291
If we didn't come, you wouldn't
have had enough people!

29
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,250
I'm really surprised that
Hanai didn't come along.

30
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,458
Shouldn't he be here?

31
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,041
He should...

32
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,041
but since I gave him the wrong
date, I wouldn't count on it.

33
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,250
What...?!
Yakumo went camping...?!

34
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,416
With the Tea Club...?!
This morning?!

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,833
Akira Takano,
damn you and your trickery!

36
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,083
So tell me, Harima, do chicks
dig the ride?

37
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,000
Harima! You gotta help me!

38
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,416
Give me your motorcycle,
on the double!

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,583
You sure got a funny way
of askin' for a favor.

40
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,250
I don't have much
time to explain!

41
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,791
They all went camping!

42
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:15,916
I was supposed to go, but
Akira gave me the wrong date!

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,708
I need to get to the
campground quick,

44
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,750
so I need your motorcycle!

45
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,333
Holy crap!

46
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,750
This is my chance to find out if
what Tenma said was really true!

47
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,291
No time to waste!

48
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,166
Let's roll!

49
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,458
Oh, thanks!

50
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:29,708
All right!

51
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,083
Haul ass, man!

52
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,625
Huh?!

53
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,250
Come back...! You creeps can't
just leave me behind! Stop!

54
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,833
Stop! Dammit!

55
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,208
Madame Chairperson...

56
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,083
what can I do to
help out right now?

57
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,083
Why don't you gather firewood?

58
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,291
Mmmkay.

59
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,708
Oh, Yakumo.

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,083
What a moron!

61
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,625
Hey, look, guys.

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,125
Hey, Miko!

63
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,583
Don't worry!

64
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,958
We men will handle
all the chores!

65
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,083
The cooking and the cleaning...!

66
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,291
You ladies just kick back

67
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,291
and enjoy the beauty
of the great outdoors!

68
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,833
Wow! Really?!

69
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,083
Imadori, unpack the dishes!

70
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,625
Harima, go get firewood!

71
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,666
Whatever.

72
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,208
Aw, man.

73
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,500
It's him.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,875
I wonder if he knows
a lot about animals?

75
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:42,916
Firewood duty...

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,666
It just ain't fair.

77
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,208
Uh... here's one.

78
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,625
Would you like some help?

79
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,041
Hey...

80
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,375
You're Tenma's little sister,
right...? Uh, thank you.

81
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,375
Sure.

82
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,666
Just my luck, ain't it?

83
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,666
Out here with the little
sister instead of Tenma.

84
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,458
Oh, Harima, you...
you're terrible!

85
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,708
I wonder what would make
her say something like that?

86
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:11,750
Hey, maybe if I talk to
her sister I could find out.

87
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,041
I guess he doesn't
remember me. Strange...

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,250
Hey, what are you making?

89
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,583
Come on, Hanai's a great cook.

90
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,416
I'm rubbing out some of
my world famous curry!

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,583
There's a convenience store

92
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,375
down the hill that
sells frozen curry.

93
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,583
We could just buy some.

94
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,833
Bite your tongue...!

95
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,541
Me deny Yakumo a fresh,
home-cooked meal made

96
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,416
from the heart?!

97
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,583
No! Never!

98
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,875
Okay, then.

99
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,500
I'll just leave you churning.

100
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,333
You guys know where Yakumo is?

101
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,833
Oh, she said she really wanted
to help Harima get wood.

102
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,416
Are you okay?

103
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,666
Uh... hey...

104
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,166
Look, I know this is
gonna sound kinda weird...

105
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,083
but has, uh, has your sister
been mad about anything lately?

106
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,333
Huh?

107
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,250
I just heard she was,
uh, angry or somethin'.

108
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,125
I don't know.

109
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,666
Well, now that you mention it,

110
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,791
she did say she discussed
someone with Eri and Mikoto...

111
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,083
Bingo!

112
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,208
You wouldn't happen to know

113
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,250
who they were
talkin' about, would ya?

114
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,750
Not sure... but I believe
it was some guy.

115
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,833
Oh, really? What kinda guy?

116
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:20,208
Uh... Well, he... had a
beard... and sunglasses...

117
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,833
Lotsa guys look like that.

118
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,083
So... what'd she say about
this guy we don't know?

119
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,875
Uh... Well, she...

120
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,208
She was really touched

121
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,125
when this guy shared his
feelings with her, but...

122
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,041
when she felt he wasn't
being honest with himself,

123
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,416
that made her sad.

124
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,375
What?!

125
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:43,083
It... It can't be...! Not being
honest with myself?!

126
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,916
That can only mean one thing!

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,916
When we were "practicing" our
love confessions on the trip,

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,833
Tenma saw through me and
realized it wasn't an act!

129
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,791
She knew that I really
felt that way about her!

130
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,375
So, then...

131
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,708
Oh, Harima, you...
you're terrible!

132
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,250
What she really
meant to say was...

133
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,375
Harima, I've been terrible...

134
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,708
Oh, please forgive me, my love.

135
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,458
Of course! That's what she
wanted to say!

136
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,625
Moron! Where's your head?!

137
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,000
That's what you get for
jumping to conclusions...!

138
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,083
Besides, Tenma's such a
sweetheart she'd never say

139
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,958
anything bad about
the man who loves her!

140
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,958
Um... that really hurts.

141
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,166
Oh... sorry about that!

142
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,291
Sometimes I don't
know my own strength...

143
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,458
I can't understand
this guy at all...

144
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,125
But I can tell...
he has a good heart...

145
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,625
Well, we should be heading back.

146
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,125
Oh, do me a favor

147
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,500
and don't tell your sister
what we talked about.

148
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,833
He doesn't remember, does he...?

149
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,958
I just wanted to
talk about animals...

150
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,666
Oh, well...

151
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,083
Oh, hey, I forgot...

152
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:00,458
Those rice balls you made
were good... Real good.

153
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,083
Uh... You okay...? Ready to go?

154
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,125
Uh...

155
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,916
Sure.

156
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,000
That slimeball's sunk even lower
than I thought he could...!

157
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,541
Hitting on Eri and
Miko wasn't enough?

158
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,916
Now you've got to
hit on Yakumo, too!

159
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,666
You're just a player...! You've
got no sense of decency!

160
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,833
None...! Harima...

161
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,333
You messed with
the wrong big sister!

162
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,208
Hey, we're back.

163
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,541
It's about time, Harima...!
Oh, nice firewood, Yakumo.

164
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,333
Finally... Hey, Beardy!

165
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,041
Buy me some tea, would you?

166
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,875
Right now...? But I just
lugged all this stuff back

167
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,541
from the woods
and I'm really tired.

168
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,000
You heard me, swine!

169
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,125
Yeah, but I wish I didn't,
you stuck-up little brat...!

170
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,958
Still mad at me, huh...?!
But then again...

171
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,250
if I don't do what you want,

172
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,666
you might tell Tenma
about what happened...

173
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,916
Here.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,875
I don't like that kind.

175
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,125
Cut me a little slack
today, will ya...?!

176
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,083
There's only so much
I can take! Just drink it!

177
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,583
What did you say?

178
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,958
Yes, ma'am. I'm on it!

179
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,125
Splash attack!

180
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,083
You're gonna get it next, Akira!

181
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,375
Uh... Hey, there...

182
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,750
Whoa.

183
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,708
Yakumo!

184
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:34,208
Stay away from him...!
That guy is an animal!

185
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,166
But...

186
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,416
I saw him!

187
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,666
It's just like Harima
to get you in the woods

188
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,125
and start hitting on you!

189
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,791
No... he wasn't...

190
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,625
Yes, he was...! I saw that
creepy look in his eyes!

191
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,458
But how?

192
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,916
He was wearing sunglasses...

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He really doesn't seem to
be a bad person at all, Sis.

194
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,750
Poor Yakumo!

195
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,375
You don't
understand guys at all...!

196
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,291
But you've never been on
a date, so how could you?

197
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,625
But neither have you, Tenma.

198
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,458
Don't believe me? Take a peek!

199
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,833
Tenma's totally checking
me out! Awesome!

200
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,125
See!

201
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,541
He's got that big,
creepy smile on his face...!

202
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,250
Trust me on this.

203
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,791
He's totally after you.

204
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,500
But all I wanted to do
was talk to him, so...

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,875
I know a little bit more about
guys than you do, so listen...

206
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:18,958
Harima's a player.

207
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,500
In fact, all guys
are the same, Sis.

208
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,666
They're cheating dogs
who can't be trusted...

209
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,250
So stay away from Harima!

210
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,083
Then you should stay
away from Karasuma, too.

211
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,416
Huh?!

212
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,708
When you talk to Karasuma,
you always seem happy.

213
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,625
But if he's a cheating
dog who can't be trusted,

214
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,583
you have to stop.

215
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,083
No! You don't understand!

216
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,750
Karasuma's not like that!
He's no player!

217
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,500
Really? But how
could that be true?

218
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,166
You just told me that all
guys were the same, Tenma.

219
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,916
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,750
Why do you always
have to be so smart?!

221
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:51,083
It's hopeless...! Yakumo
always beats me with logic!

222
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,250
But, I can't give up now!

223
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,500
It's my job as her big sister

224
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,583
to protect Yakumo
from creeps like Harima!

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,041
Wow. I've never
seen her like this.

226
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,375
She must be worried.

227
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,875
Uh, Tenma...
I'll do what you want, 'kay?

228
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,541
Big Sister Power Activate!

229
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,000
Just do what I say!

230
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,791
No ifs, ands, or buts, you got
it...?! It's for the best!

231
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,291
Oh, Sis, I just wanted to
talk to him about animals...

232
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,125
Still, it is really sweet,
your "Big Sister Power!"

233
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,791
Aw, it's so beautiful!

234
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,291
Harima!

235
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,250
Uh... Hey, what's up?

236
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,833
Come here for a minute.

237
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,458
We've got things to discuss!

238
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,375
Unresolved things!

239
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,875
Be my partner in
the scavenger hunt,

240
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,500
and we can talk
things out as we play.

241
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
Is this Tenma's way
of saying she wants

242
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,916
to be alone with me tonight?

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,750
Well?

244
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,208
Sure...

245
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,375
Together we're team ninja.

246
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,291
Yes! My famous
homemade curry's done!

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,791
Yakumo! Dinner is served!

248
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,750
Fill your belly
with my creation!

249
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,041
Oh, Hanai.

250
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,208
You took too long,
so we started without you.

251
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,583
Wow, this tastes amazing
for frozen curry, Akira.

252
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,750
You really went all out.

253
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,250
I'm pretty much awesome.

254
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,916
Want some, dude?

255
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,791
Hey, guys, we've got
after-dinner coffee!

256
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,708
That's really nice,
Tenma. Thank you.

257
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,916
I helped, too!
I ground all the beans up!

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What, you want a cookie?

259
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,000
Mmm, it's so decadent.

260
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,791
This is the Tea Club.

261
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,541
Here ya go, Imadori.

262
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,541
Hey, thanks!

263
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,250
Some of Tenma's fresh coffee!

264
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,416
Man, am I lucky
to be here or what?!

265
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,375
Here, yours is special.

266
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,833
I get it...

267
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,041
She's trying to send me a
message with these beans...

268
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,583
Coffee beans are strong and
there's a whole lot of 'em,

269
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,708
just like her feelings for me!

270
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,916
All right!

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,250
Let's draw straws and get our
partners for the scavenger hunt!

272
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,541
Okay, everyone,
here are the rules

273
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,458
for the scavenger
hunt, so listen up!

274
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,916
There are a number of shrines
scattered throughout the forest.

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,083
Take a charm from one
and bring it back here.

276
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,916
Why don't we just roast s'mores?

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,958
Because we're not pansies.

278
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,875
Right! First team, get ready!

279
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,875
I'm a little scared, Eri.
How about you?

280
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,250
I'm fine!

281
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,083
Oh, Yakumo!

282
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,708
And go!

283
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,291
Please be careful!
Don't get lost!

284
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,458
Next!

285
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,625
You ready for action, partner?

286
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,125
Hands off, creep...!

287
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,500
Try that again and you won't be
coming out of the woods alive!

288
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,958
And go!

289
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,625
Hey, Miko, stop! Wait for me!

290
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,833
Next!

291
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,333
Don't worry, Yakumo!
I will catch up to you!

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,625
And go!

293
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,583
Well, Harima, this is it.
No turning back...

294
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,250
It's not gonna be
too easy, ya know?

295
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,333
Yeah.

296
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,833
Are you ready for this?

297
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,250
Heh... You have no
idea how ready I am.

298
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,666
All right, we've got a lot
to do and no time to waste.

299
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,541
Go!

300
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,458
So tonight we're gonna settle

301
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,750
"unresolved issues,"
huh, Tenma...?

302
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:35,083
I know what that means!
We're finally gonna be a couple!

303
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,083
I didn't know it
was supposed to rain!

304
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,916
You think everybody
else is okay?!

305
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,083
I'm sure they're fine.
Let's find some shelter.

306
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,333
I just wanted to
get him out here

307
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,416
so I could tell him to
stay away from Yakumo...

308
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,625
but now... Oh, Harima! Look out!

309
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,291
Thanks!

310
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,375
Almost lost my head there!

311
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,250
Well, you are pretty tall!

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,125
Tenma!

313
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,583
I didn't see that
hole back there

314
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,291
or I would have
warned you. Sorry!

315
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,666
It's... not your fault, Harima.

316
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,708
Hang on, okay.

317
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,375
Well, I guess
for the time being,

318
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,291
we'll have to call a truce.

319
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,791
I never knew there was an old,
abandoned school out here.

320
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,458
Here... Warm yourself up.

321
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,333
Tonight turned out to
be a real mess... Sorry.

322
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,125
Don't be. It's not
your fault... Okay?

323
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,750
Harima! Oh, no, snap out of it!

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,416
If this is a dream,
I don't wanna wake up...

325
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,458
Hey, Harima...

326
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,625
Yeah?

327
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,958
Now, listen up...

328
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,500
When you love someone,
there are rules to follow.

329
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,833
If you're in...

330
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,166
love with a girl, she's
the only one you can date.

331
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,041
I don't want anyone's
feelings to get hurt.

332
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,750
I think you're a
really sweet guy...

333
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,416
In fact, I know you are.

334
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,875
I do hope you're listening
to what I'm saying...

335
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,875
A girl wants her true love to
only have eyes for her.

336
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,958
Do you understand now, Harima?

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,625
You can't date more
than one girl at a time...

338
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,208
It just isn't right!

339
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,583
You don't have to tell me...

340
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,291
Don't you worry, Tenma.

341
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,916
You're the only girl in my eyes.

342
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,166
Yes... I understand...
I promise you...

343
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,625
I'll follow the rules.

344
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,208
Glad to hear it...!
We connected tonight, huh?

345
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,708
Is this really happening?
Could this finally be it?!

346
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,208
Crap! Tenma must
be catching a cold!

347
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,625
No wonder! She's
soaked from head to toe.

348
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,041
I gotta get her out
of those wet clothes fast!

349
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,625
But if I suggest it,

350
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,625
then she's gonna think
I'm a total pervert...!

351
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,166
Still, I can't just let
the love of my life get sick.

352
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,958
What kind of guy
does that make me?

353
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,125
But how can I get her

354
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,333
to strip without looking
like Mr. Pervert?!

355
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,416
Come on, think!

356
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,458
Yes.

357
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,750
Huh?

358
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,750
Get your clothes off...
right now.

359
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,458
You can't be serious.

360
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,875
Here, lemme explain...

361
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,083
Is... he joking?

362
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,666
No, he's dead serious!

363
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,000
Harima's nothing but
a filthy-minded,

364
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,416
two-timing
perverted sleaze!

365
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,750
I never told anyone...

366
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,291
but he made a pass at
me back at the beach club

367
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,333
and he wasn't wearing any pants!

368
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,125
That's awful...! I'll stop him!

369
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,041
Wait a sec...

370
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,416
Tenma's smart enough
to see through that creep.

371
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,625
She'll probably punch him

372
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,041
and then give him a
swift kick in the pants!

373
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,291
I've got them off, Harima.

374
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,458
What...?! Is she crazy?!

375
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,291
Okay, you can turn around now.

376
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,458
Uh, right.

377
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,583
Pretty lucky I found
these curtains, huh?

378
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,916
They don't smell great,

379
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,458
but they'll keep us warm
until our clothes dry out.

380
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,083
You know, we look pretty goofy
in these things,

381
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,000
but if they'll keep us
from getting sick...

382
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,916
This doesn't change anything.

383
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,250
He still can't be trusted.

384
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,791
You really think so?

385
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,416
Can I ask you something?

386
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,625
Who's the girl that you like?

387
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,750
Come on, don't be shy.
You can tell me.

388
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,458
Uh, who...?
Oh, the girl, right...

389
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,541
So you really wanna
know, huh? Wow!

390
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,416
Stop laughing
and get to the point!

391
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Yes! Tell me, tell me, tell me!

392
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,375
Well, you see... kinda funny...
you asked, 'cause...

393
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,250
Hey! Speak up and stop
beating around the bush!

394
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,250
Who are you in
love with, silly-head?

395
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,875
They're acting
like nine-year-olds!

396
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,916
I'm... in... love... with...
you... Tenma.

397
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,916
What...? Can't hear you!

398
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,791
Okay, just whisper
it in my ear then!

399
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,958
Well... Who is it, huh?

400
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,666
Wait a minute... She means...

401
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,458
It's simple...

402
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,250
When a girl's in love,
she wants her guy

403
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,208
to be the first one
to say "I love you."...

404
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,458
So you say it first...

405
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,750
Can you do that for me, Harima?

406
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,583
Uh... Is everything okay?

407
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,208
Oh, no! Are you still cold?!

408
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,000
The fire's dying down... Crap!

409
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,083
Don't worry, Tenma!

410
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,250
You'll be good
and comfy in no time!

411
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,916
Just gimme a minute, okay!

412
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,041
Need some firewood fast!

413
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,958
Think that wall's
gonna do just fine!

414
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,458
All right! Somethin'
else to burn!

415
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,708
This'll keep us warm
for a while...! Aw, yeah!

416
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,416
What the...? Somethin's
got the other end of this.

417
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,333
Maybe it's a mouse,
a real heavy one...

418
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,000
If it's not a mouse,
it's gotta be a rat... Big one!

419
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,250
No rat's gonna get between me
and my special night!

420
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,250
What did you find over there?

421
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,416
Uh, nothing! Hey,
the rain's stopped.

422
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,041
I bet our clothes are pretty
dry. Wanna head back?

423
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,333
Sure... I'll get dressed.

424
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,083
You shouldn't have been
eavesdropping like that.

425
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,666
That was karma getting you back.

426
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,916
It's not fair!
You were listening, too!

427
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,916
Agh! This was a mistake!
I'm getting out of here!

428
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,958
Uh, wait for me!

429
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,416
We're back!

430
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,916
I saw Imadori.
What happened to him?

431
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,750
He learned a valuable
lesson... about hands...

432
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,375
You always keep them
to yourself... or else.

433
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,208
Guess you got grabby.
Nighty-night, pal.

434
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,708
Where's Yakumo?
Why isn't she back?!

435
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,583
Has anyone seen her...?
I'm so worried!

436
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,041
Yakumo! I'm coming!

437
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,791
Welcome back.

438
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,333
Uh, look...

439
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,750
We got caught in the rain...
and our clothes got drenched...!

440
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,916
Got any we could borrow?

441
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,708
Sure do.

442
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,125
But how did you...?

443
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,875
I told you I was awesome.

444
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,916
Oh, summer vacation's ending!

445
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,083
It went by so fast and
I still want to play...!

446
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,916
Next time on School Rumble:

447
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,750
"Mid-Summer Giraffe's Night Out!
End of Summer Panic Party!

448
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:28,333
Summer's Over--Back to School!"
What's gonna happen?!
