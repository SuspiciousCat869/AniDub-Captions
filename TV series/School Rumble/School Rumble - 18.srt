1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,583
Don't miss Invincible
Robot Dozibiron

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,458
later on in this program!

3
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,291
Did you just say "whiskers"?

4
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,583
Yeah, what do you
think about whiskers?

5
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,666
Oh, I don't know, I guess
it would depend on the guy,

6
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,541
what kind of whiskers he had...

7
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,750
Say stubbly...

8
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,166
But stubbly how...?
That's kind of vague.

9
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,583
Stubbly like Mangoku...?
He makes it sexy!

10
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,791
Excuse me... Tenma?

11
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,166
Have you... seen Imadori...

12
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,541
around anywhere...? We're
class monitors for Day Duty.

13
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,416
Oh, I saw him out
in the hallway...

14
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,416
He was talking
to Mihara, I think.

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,833
Are you sure...? Thank you!

16
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:26,708
That's a tough break...

17
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,375
getting stuck with Captain Perv.

18
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,041
Not at all...! Bye!

19
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,958
She's nice...

20
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,458
I've never gotten the
chance to talk to her, though.

21
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,958
Nice, yeah, that's
what worries me.

22
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,166
Okay then, how
about this Sunday,

23
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,416
how does that sound to you?

24
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,333
Gosh... I don't...

25
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,791
It's too cool to swim,
but there's nothing

26
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,083
more romantic than
a wind-swept beach...

27
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,833
and there's a
deserted island, too...

28
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,416
That reminds me,
I heard you went there

29
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,250
with Mikoto and her
friends this summer...

30
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,083
Now don't be jealous,
I just couldn't get out of it...

31
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,333
but I saved the last beach
day of the summer for you two.

32
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,958
What should I do...?
Should I call out to him?

33
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,958
Hey...! Imadori!

34
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,041
You called... Mikoto?!

35
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,541
Oh, I get it...! You're
jealous because you saw me

36
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,083
talking to other
girls, is that it?

37
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,916
Back... off! I believe
you two have Day Duty?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,666
Uh, yes, thank you, Mikoto.

39
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,125
Uh... I gotta go!

40
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,416
I, uh... I'm very sorry to
interrupt your conversation,

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,083
but if you checked
the blackboard today...

42
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,958
We... We have Day Duty together.

43
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,791
Here you go.

44
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,166
All yours.

45
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,791
Oh...! Of course...
Thank you for your help, Mikoto.

46
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,458
This sucks.

47
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,958
What a fricking pain...

48
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,083
They should make someone
with no love life do this,

49
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,416
I've got places to go
and people to see.

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,791
Aw, it's not that bad.

51
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,333
You don't really
need me, do you...?

52
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,125
Can't you handle
this by yourself?

53
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,458
We get to bundle up
this lumber and move it!

54
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,708
Wow... sounds fun...

55
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,416
Hey, this stuff
is pretty heavy...

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,666
We're gonna need help...

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,791
What?

58
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,750
Uh... never mind...

59
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,958
Are you positive

60
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,750
you can't handle lifting
these alone, Itchy?

61
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,166
Uh... no, I need your help.

62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,083
Come on, Itchy,
you're the bionic girl...

63
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,000
You're stronger
than any ten guys.

64
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm not...! I really
need your help!

65
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,041
And please stop calling
me "Itchy!" It's "Ichijou!"

66
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,916
Ah... so... you...
went to the beach?

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,916
Yeah, with Mikoto and
the gang... How about you?

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,750
No, not me... but...
it sounds like a lot of fun...

69
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,000
going to the beach...

70
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,916
He hasn't said anything...!

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I wonder if he even remembers
he asked me out on a date?

72
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,833
I wonder if she'd notice
if I let go of this?

73
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,000
So... what did you do
for fun this summer?

74
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,916
Oh, I did all kinds of stuff.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,250
Push-ups, sit-ups,
weightlifting.

76
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,250
I was in training
almost the whole summer.

77
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,000
I was going
twenty-four... seven...

78
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,041
Never mind... Forget it.

79
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,250
A little help here,
if you don't mind...

80
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,125
I'm sorry!

81
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,333
So then... you didn't even go
out on one date the whole time?

82
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,708
Well, I... I'm...
supposed to go,

83
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,500
uh, on a date with...
you, Imadori.

84
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,708
Oh, man, am I hungry!

85
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,833
Oh... I guess he
did forget after all.

86
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,458
Gosh, and I really
wanted to go on a date.

87
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,541
Great, what time?

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,458
What time do you see the
sunshine baby, baby, huh?

89
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,791
Whoa! Deja vu...! This seems
so familiar, but why...?

90
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,291
She's no D-cup,
I'd never ask her out...

91
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:59,083
Something about
this summer... Oh crap!

92
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,291
Woohoo!

93
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,916
This is so great...!
I can ask a girl out!

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,208
I could even ask you
out if I wanted to!

95
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,541
Okay.

96
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,875
Huh?

97
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,875
Um... thank you...
This is my first date... and...

98
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,916
I'm looking forward to it!

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,291
I completely forgot
about that...! Of course...

100
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,833
No wonder she keeps
babbling on about dates...

101
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,250
This whole Day Duty thing was
just a ploy to get me alone...

102
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,958
And that means...

103
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,916
She's gonna eat me alive!

104
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,041
Oh, crap...!

105
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,625
I don't want to date this
muscle-bound alien freak show!

106
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:36,375
I've gotta find some way to shut
this down before... before...

107
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,916
Okay, from here on out, not
another word about dating...!

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,416
I won't let her talk about it...

109
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,458
and I'm sure not gonna bring
it up...! Gotta stay strong!

110
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,791
Hey, Mikoto, you
wanna go out with me?

111
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,500
Drop dead, creep.

112
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,833
Phew...! I guess
she didn't hear me.

113
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:13,208
And I'm being lifted
off the ground. Hmm.

114
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,208
Okay, I give up...

115
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,958
When do you want to go out?

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,166
He remembered after all!

117
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,583
Oh, Karen, you're really
into it today, aren't you?

118
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,791
Yes!

119
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,916
I've got to try and
get in two days worth

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,541
of training today...
'cause tomorrow...

121
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,916
Oh, you know about that, huh...?

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,625
Yeah, they changed up
the intramural schedule

123
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,708
and you've got a match tomorrow!

124
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,958
What...?! Tomorrow?!

125
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,333
Oh, nice!

126
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,541
That one's cute.

127
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,916
Oh! Photos from the campout?

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,250
Take a look at this one!

129
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,166
Wow! What a cute couple!

130
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,500
Ooh, scandalous!

131
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,500
Smooth move, Akira!

132
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,791
Thanks, but that's not my hand.

133
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,625
Hold on, what's going on here?

134
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,958
What happened, you guys?

135
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,333
Now that's an
interesting story...

136
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,750
Shut up.

137
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,750
Wow! What a great shot!

138
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,250
Yakumo looks gorgeous!

139
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,416
Uh-huh!

140
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,416
Wow!

141
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,625
Whoa...! Now
that's a good photo!

142
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,541
Do you think Yakumo
is bigger than a C-cup?

143
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,750
Uh-huh...

144
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,125
You disgust me!

145
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,791
I know.

146
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,041
But I won't tell you!

147
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,166
Aw... who cares...

148
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,041
Mikoto is still the champion...
No one can top the D.

149
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,458
You jackass...

150
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,583
Huh...? I thought you were
bigger than that, Mikoto!

151
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,583
Shut up, Tenma!!

152
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,125
You suck.

153
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,083
I can't believe I missed it...

154
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,875
It slipped right by me...

155
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,083
I guess I still
need more practice.

156
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,458
Imadori... I think you have a
problem and you need help.

157
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,041
Now, now, Tenma.

158
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,416
There's no need for you to feel
left out... Yours will develop.

159
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,916
Bite me!

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,666
Hey! There's Harima!

161
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,916
What's up with him lately?

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,916
He's been letting his
beard grow like crazy!

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,416
Yeah, I noticed that too.

164
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,000
It's weird, even for him.

165
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,583
Speaking of Harima, where is he?

166
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,416
He's probably up on the roof.

167
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,041
What's with the beard?

168
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,916
He kind of looks like
Lincoln... With shades.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,458
He doesn't look
anything like Lincoln.

170
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,583
I'm gonna go get him so
he can see the pictures.

171
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,375
'Kay!

172
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,666
Sorry!

173
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,625
Oh, Carolyn, I didn't
even see you standing there!

174
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,416
Uh, I was just...
looking for Imadori...

175
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,416
Uh, please... don't call me
"Carolyn." It's "Karen," okay?

176
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,750
Imadori...? He's right
inside...! I'll get him!

177
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,625
Imador--

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,750
Sorry... it's...
just that, you see...

179
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,041
I'm supposed to go on a date,

180
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,833
but I found out that
I have a wrestling match.

181
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,750
You're kidding me!

182
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,416
You and Imadori
are going on a d--

183
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,125
Shh! Don't talk so loud!

184
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,333
I... can't... breathe!

185
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,833
Uh... sorry.

186
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,125
Oh, I'm over it.
A real date, huh?

187
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,166
Yes, but...

188
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,583
I just found out I have

189
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,750
a practice match scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon...

190
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,291
so now I can't go,
even though I want to.

191
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,958
Are you nuts?

192
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,583
Reality check, Carrie...

193
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,291
How many wrestling matches
did you have this summer?

194
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,750
Oh... uh... I think it was
twenty-five, maybe -six...

195
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,333
I'll bet... And... dates?

196
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:38,916
Huh?

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,083
Dates, woman!

198
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,791
Well, I, uh, didn't
have any dates.

199
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,375
So do the math...!

200
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,083
You're way ahead on wrestling
and behind on romance...!

201
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,625
You gotta go on that date!

202
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,625
Chill...! I got the
wrestling match covered...

203
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,708
No... sweat!

204
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, but I...

205
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,833
No buts...! You just go
and have a good time...

206
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,958
Leave everything
else to me. Okay?

207
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,166
Oh, thank you!

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,250
I guess he must be
running a little late.

209
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,041
I wonder what I should
say when he gets here...

210
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,916
"Oh, hi, you're not late,
I just got here, too"...

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,791
That's weak...
I better practice.

212
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,166
Hey there, what's up?

213
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,458
Buzz off, loser!

214
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,250
So...

215
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,583
I'll see you later?

216
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,916
Is it hot today
or is it just you?

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,291
Get out of my face, you jerk!

218
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,583
I love it when they
play hard to get.

219
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,291
Are you here to meet someone...?

220
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,208
Forget him,
he doesn't deserve you...

221
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,458
Come have coffee
with me instead.

222
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,166
I... just got there...
Got here...

223
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm... sorry, but I'm
afraid I didn't understand

224
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,041
the joke you made just now.

225
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,875
Oh...! Heh... It was
nothing... No big deal.

226
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,125
Let's go... Man, that
was a close one...

227
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,541
Bring it!

228
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,791
You're on!

229
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,750
Tag me out...! Tag me out!

230
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,583
Sis... this isn't pro wrestling!

231
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,791
So... uh... what
sports do you play?

232
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,250
Nothing in particular.

233
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,791
Oh... um...

234
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,333
Do you like wrestling?

235
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,250
Hate it. Anything involving
effort gives me an angry rash.

236
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,791
Uh... I... see...

237
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,208
This is awful...!
I don't know what to say!

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,458
Hey, if she's bored,
maybe she'll go home.

239
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,375
Wait...! I know!

240
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,291
I can use those things
that Tenma gave me!

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,333
So you say you don't know
what to do on a date...?

242
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,583
Hey, I'm all over it!

243
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,958
Here!

244
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,583
What's all this for?

245
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,250
That sack contains
the secrets of dating...!

246
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,083
If you need any
help on your date...

247
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,625
just open up one of the
three little bags inside.

248
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,583
Oh! How can I ever thank you?!

249
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,541
Be careful to use them wisely...

250
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,541
Those secrets will help
you win your heart's desire.

251
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,041
I wonder what she
could've put in here...?

252
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,625
A self help manual
with dating advice?

253
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,250
What am I supposed
to do with these...?

254
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,500
She didn't include instructions!

255
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,833
Check this.

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,125
Look, I've got big boobs!

257
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,916
I've got a bigger rack
than the bread aisle...!

258
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,375
Well, I don't quite get it...

259
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,250
but Imadori sure is
happy...! Thanks, Tenma!

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,541
I'm bored.

261
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,916
Now what...? We're right
back where we started...!

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,375
I guess I'd better
open bag number two...

263
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,166
Movie tickets...?
For a kids' matinee?

264
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,583
This show is for
eight-year-olds...!

265
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,500
There's no way he's
gonna want to see this!

266
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,416
Ichijou...

267
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,750
Oh... no, this isn't...

268
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,250
You did good.

269
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,625
Huh?

270
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:36,958
Bring it...! Invincible
Robot Dozibiron!

271
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,250
Arise and unite!

272
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,708
You mustn't give up!

273
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,541
You must remember,
no matter what,

274
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,291
the one who loves you
will always be with you!

275
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,541
Doctor!!

276
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,416
Okay! There's no
turning back now!

277
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,958
Right!

278
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,041
Yeah... go...! Go!

279
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,458
This is nice...

280
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,583
It's dark and it's
hard to see his face...

281
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,583
but I still get to
be so close to him...

282
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,291
So this is what
a date is like...

283
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,125
Man, that was the greatest!

284
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,458
Is Dozibiron
incredible or what?!

285
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,750
Man, I love going to the movies!

286
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,583
Hey... did you see
that one move...?

287
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:47,250
Lightning... chop...!
Huh...? Oh...

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,916
Smooth move, punk.

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,416
Either you got a
whole lot of guts

290
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,541
or you're in a hurry to die.

291
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,583
Hey! It was an accident!
Lay off, okay?

292
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,000
No, Imadori!

293
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,750
I've got to save him...! But...

294
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,875
I don't want him to think I'm
some muscle-bound girl jock...!

295
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,166
What should I do...?
Hold on! I almost forgot!

296
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,208
I've still got one bag left!

297
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,125
What...? This is-

298
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,625
Stop!

299
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,875
You release that person at once!

300
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,000
What the hell, is
this some kind of joke?

301
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,166
You think you can just give
me an apple and I'll go away?

302
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,791
Are you crazy?

303
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,208
I'm sorry, miss.

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,666
Okay... What the hell are you?

305
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,916
You must remember,
no matter what,

306
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,916
the one who loves you
will always be with you!

307
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,416
Farewell!

308
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,250
Oh, Imadori, thank
goodness you weren't hurt...!

309
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,750
I went to get help,
but then Dozibiron showed up

310
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,250
out of nowhere to save
you so I came back...

311
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,625
Yeah, that was you!

312
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,583
I can't find the bag
I put your mask in,

313
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,208
and I'm sure I packed it...!

314
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,208
Oh man, I really wanted
us to be a tag team!

315
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,000
Look, Sis... We're
not luchadoras, okay?

316
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,291
Oh, Miko!

317
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,416
Huh?

318
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,583
How 'bout a
one-on-one study session?

319
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,041
Come on, please!

320
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,750
I've got a report
due this afternoon!

321
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,083
And why should I help you...?

322
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,916
Honestly, you're
totally hopeless!

323
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,375
Okay, I'll only do it if you
stop calling me "Miko."

324
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,958
You got that?

325
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,000
I mean it.

326
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,083
Okay, but "Miko"
just sounds so cute.

327
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,708
I don't care. Just stop it.

328
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,416
Hmm, all right...
Ahem... McLovin.

329
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,333
He sure is shameless,
isn't he...?

330
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,916
He doesn't care who's
watching or anything,

331
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,166
he just goes for it.

332
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,291
I don't know why
Mikoto puts up with him.

333
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,500
You know what's funny...?

334
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,958
For all their bickering,

335
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,041
I think they look kind of
natural together, don't you?

336
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,583
Well, I don't know, maybe...

337
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,250
But that guy is so shallow!

338
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,583
Right, 'cause you
always exhibit such depth.

339
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,958
Hey, I don't go around asking
out every guy that I see...

340
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,916
They ask me out, so there's
nothing I can do about it, okay?

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,833
But don't you always say
that a person should go out

342
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,458
with lots of different people?

343
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,125
Well, yeah, but
Imadori is so insincere.

344
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,500
He's such a guy about it!

345
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,041
So it's okay
for a girl to do it,

346
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,375
but if a guy does it,
then he's a jerk...?

347
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,916
Can you say double standard?
I think you can.

348
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,916
That's not what I mean...

349
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,500
Or are you jealous of Mikoto?

350
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,666
What?!

351
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,250
Hey... check it out!

352
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,083
It's like reality TV.

353
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,916
Here comes my favorite part.

354
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,291
Oh, Tenma!

355
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,375
Yes...? Hey...! Kara!

356
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,625
So how did the date go...?
Did you have a good time?

357
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,000
Um, well, it's really just
"Karen," not "Kara," okay?

358
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,875
Anyway, I wanted to
thank you for your help...

359
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,583
Here's your stuff back and some
cookies for all your trouble.

360
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,916
Yay, cookies...!
Thanks, it was my pleasure!

361
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,166
That stuff was
such a big help...!

362
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,833
Oh, and by the way,
I washed it for you.

363
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,166
What the...?

364
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,416
The mask.

365
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,125
Huh...? Wow... I must've...

366
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,291
So...! Everything went well?

367
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,541
It was wonderful.

368
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,541
I think we're actually
a little closer now...

369
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,916
Of course, I don't really
know if Imadori thinks so,

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,458
but one step at a time!

371
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,583
Yay, you did it!

372
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,125
Oh, sorry about the apples,

373
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,416
I was going to carve a love
charm my grandma told me about,

374
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,875
but I never got any further
than making the first few cuts.

375
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,291
My bad.

376
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,583
Sometimes I just space,
but I guess it worked out okay.

377
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,916
Oh... that explains
why it was so easy...

378
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,416
to crush in one hand, I mean.

379
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,583
Uh, right.

380
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,041
Well, I'm glad it went well!
I envy you!

381
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,916
Come on, that's silly...

382
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,583
The important thing is that
now you and Imadori can...

383
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,333
Is there something wrong, Tenma?

384
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:08,541
How could I be so stupid...?
Imadori likes Mikoto!

385
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,708
So good luck with that!

386
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,125
Yeah...! And thanks
again for all your help.

387
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,041
I'll never forget it...! Bye!

388
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, you go, girlfriend...

389
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,000
Now what am I going to do?

390
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,666
Oh, how could
I be so careless...?

391
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,666
First I help
Carolyn with her date,

392
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,833
then I'm all rooting for Mikoto,

393
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,083
then I'm giving Carolyn
the "thumbs up!"...

394
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,250
You stupid thumb,
this is all your fault.

395
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:45,166
Carolyn likes Imadori...
but Imadori likes Mikoto...

396
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,791
Oh, nothing's working out!

397
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,375
I wonder what he's thinking?

398
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,541
Tell me, gorgeous,

399
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,416
you got anything going
on after class today?

400
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,916
You know, I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

401
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,250
So... why don't the
two of us get together?

402
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,750
Olé!

403
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,500
What's the big deal?!

404
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,083
You shut your fat mouth!!

405
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,875
Listen and listen good!

406
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,583
You must remember, no matter
what, that the one who loves...

407
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,875
I'm really sorry, Carolyn...

408
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,083
but you see... the truth is,

409
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,875
Imadori really likes Mikoto,
and I shouldn't have...

410
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,083
I know.

411
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,083
You mean you...?

412
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,375
There were two Ichijous...

413
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,583
She really is a space alien!

414
00:21:55,875 --> 00:22:02,000
Bring it...! Invincible Robot
Dozibiron...! The Movie!

415
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,208
Ten four, good buddy!

416
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,500
Aww...

417
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,416
Arise and unite!

418
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,416
Lightning... chop!

419
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,125
Hiyah!!

420
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,666
My name is Ganji Nishimoto...

421
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,166
Ms. Itoko has agreed to pose
for the art class's new exhibit.

422
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,083
The exhibit's theme...? "Nudes."

423
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,916
Next time on School Rumble...

424
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,500
"Dreams for Art"...
and two other tales.
