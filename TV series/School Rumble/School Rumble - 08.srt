1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,125
School Rumble will
be starting soon,

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:11,666
and you don't wanna miss it!

3
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,458
Ah, hello there...

4
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,166
My name is Sano.
I'm from class 2-A...

5
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,041
Ha--of course you
probably know that...

6
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,750
Word is you're not seeing
anybody special at the moment...

7
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:15,958
So I thought you and I...

8
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:16,666
Hey...

9
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,833
What do you like better

10
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,583
for dinner, meat, and
potatoes or curry?

11
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,000
Huh? Well... Meat and
potatoes, I guess.

12
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,416
Oh really, that's what
I thought you might say.

13
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,833
Wait a minute, do you
mean you're planning

14
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,000
to make dinner for me?!

15
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,166
Don't be silly.

16
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,208
I wouldn't even dream
of such a thing.

17
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,833
What're you looking at?

18
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,083
I was wondering if
you'd go out with me...

19
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,791
Ha, of course not.

20
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,750
I totally called it!

21
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,500
And he gets shot down in flames!

22
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,083
Hey.

23
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,958
You shouldn't be
so hard on a guy

24
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,833
when he's trying to ask you out.

25
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,500
Think what you're doing...

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,625
In times like these,
a guy's willing to do just about

27
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,291
anything to get a
girl to notice him.

28
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,458
That's right.

29
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,291
I have something
I have to take care of,

30
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,291
so I won't need the limo.

31
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,916
Huh...?

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,750
Do guys like curry
or meat and potatoes?

33
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,416
I've always heard
meat and potatoes;

34
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,916
I guess it's some
kinda man thing.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,708
Meat?!

36
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,958
Do you really think so...?

37
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,333
Honestly, I just don't know...

38
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,583
Well...

39
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,916
I haven't made it in a
while, so I'm not sure.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,458
Okay, let me think here,
you're gonna need...

41
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:59,583
yellow onions, white potatoes,
fresh carrots, beef round...

42
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,083
Don't forget the stock...

43
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,875
Hey...! Does this mean
you've got a date?!

44
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,625
Here you go, young lady...

45
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,500
Try one of these,
you'll love it.

46
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,291
You mean I can just
eat it right here?

47
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,791
Oh, great... What do I do now?

48
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,333
She told me to look for red tag
items, but I don't see any.

49
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,541
We're gonna have
Daddy's favorite

50
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,250
for dinner tonight,
aren't we, Mommy?

51
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,458
He'll be surprised!

52
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,125
He sure will, honey,
he's going to love it!

53
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,125
So Eri's fixing
her first meal...

54
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,791
I don't get it, isn't Eri's
family stinking rich...?

55
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,291
Why doesn't she have their
cook make the meat and potatoes?

56
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,916
She's making this meal because
she wants it to be special,

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,458
to express how she feels.

58
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,500
I still don't get it...

59
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,500
How she feels about what?

60
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,000
It sounds like rain.

61
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,416
Yikes...! You're right...!

62
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,291
I've gotta get home and
get the laundry off the line!

63
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,541
Tenma, slow down!

64
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,000
You'll trip!

65
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,875
Huh?

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,583
Uh...? Daddy...!

67
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,958
What are you doing here...?!

68
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,416
The butler told me
I might find you here.

69
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,208
So you came to get me?

70
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,541
Listen... for dinner,
I was going to...

71
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,458
Listen, honey, about dinner...

72
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,416
I've been called out of
the country on business...

73
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,666
It was very sudden...

74
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,208
I'm afraid I can't have
dinner with you tonight.

75
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,125
Oh, that's all right...

76
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,416
Actually, I made a dinner
date with some of my classmates,

77
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,916
I guess it must've
slipped my mind

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,416
I mean, sometimes
I get confused,

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,750
with you jetting in and
out of the country so much,

80
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,416
I get our dates mixed up.

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,958
I know... and
I just got back, too...

82
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,791
I'm sorry...
I won't be gone long ...

83
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,333
Do you want a ride home?

84
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,208
Oh, no, I'll be fine...

85
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,083
You have a nice trip, okay?

86
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,333
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

87
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,416
Goodbye...

88
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,000
If you're not going
too far... I'll walk you.

89
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,000
Just a little ways...

90
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,500
So tell me... which
do you like better:

91
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,041
curry, or meat and potatoes?

92
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,375
Curry...

93
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,666
So I thought we could work
on math together later on...

94
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,333
Is something wrong?

95
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,583
Hey, Sara, good morning,
how are you...!

96
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,208
I thought I saw Yakumo
standing here a moment ago.

97
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,083
Oh, yes, she said she had
to stop at the faculty office.

98
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,125
Faculty office!
Got it! Thanks! Goodbye!

99
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,208
Okay, he's gone.

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,291
So then she says
right back at him...

101
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,625
What do you think about that?

102
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,708
You're kidding!

103
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:18,375
Seriously!

104
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,250
Does everyone know?!

105
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,166
Of course!

106
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,958
Almost everyone.

107
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,125
Where could Karasuma be going?

108
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,041
Man, I hate the
end of the month...

109
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,208
No money and Itoko
won't lend me any...

110
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,625
not even enough
for lunch... huh?

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,666
Well I guess you must've
skipped lunch too, huh?

112
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,583
And all you can do
is drink enough water

113
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,750
to keep your belly full.

114
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,166
Yep, I hear ya, the
end of the month blows.

115
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,666
I like you,
you're easy to talk to...

116
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,958
Tell you what:

117
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,916
Next time I get some cash,
I'll buy you lunch.

118
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,875
Uhhh... can you hear me?

119
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,083
So what do you like...

120
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,875
Are you a meat and potatoes
kinda guy, or a curry fan?

121
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,416
Curry.

122
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,250
Alright! I can tell you and
me are gonna get along great!

123
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,583
Next month the curry's on me!

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,458
Poor Karasuma.

125
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,875
I know... a box lunch...!

126
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,000
I could get closer to him
if I brought him a box lunch

127
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,291
and we could eat it together...!

128
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,750
I should've thought of this
weeks ago, it's brilliant...!

129
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,083
All right!

130
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,625
This is my chance to show
Karasuma what I can do!

131
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,250
Yoo-hoo!

132
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,041
Curry?

133
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,291
For school lunch?

134
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,666
Yeah, curry...!

135
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,583
With white rice on the side,
in separate containers,

136
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,083
and double portions!

137
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,708
I don't... quite... get it...

138
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,916
And not too spicy, okay?

139
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,166
Oh, Karasuma!

140
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,000
Uh... Hey there...

141
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,916
I made way too
much lunch today...

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,083
I was wondering if you'd do
me a favor and help me eat it?

143
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,250
Aw... right!

144
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,583
Guess I'll go drink some water.

145
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,125
Tenma sure seemed
happy when she ran outside.

146
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,208
Did you get a load
of her huge lunch box?

147
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,958
She said it was curry for two.

148
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,916
It's kind of unusual to
make curry for a school lunch.

149
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,916
You know what that means...

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,833
No, what?

151
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,000
Harima...!

152
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,625
Today we're gonna settle
things once and for all!

153
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,041
I'll be waiting for
you behind the gym

154
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,625
after school this afternoon!

155
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,250
You better not be late!

156
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,458
My darling Tenma made my
favorite dish for lunch...

157
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,458
and for two...?

158
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,916
She must have made it for me...!

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,291
This is my lucky day!

160
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,250
I'll give you three guesses
what I made for lunch today!

161
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,416
You'll never guess!

162
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,291
Give up...?

163
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,791
Okay, I'll show you,

164
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,291
and I bet you're gonna be
in for a really big surprise!

165
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,291
Two... boxes... of... rice?

166
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,375
I grabbed the wrong box!

167
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,208
Huh...? Rice balls?!

168
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,250
Yum.

169
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,375
Yum.

170
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,708
Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.

171
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,125
This is nice.

172
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,958
So what's the story
with you and Hanai?

173
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,791
It seems like you
really can't stand him.

174
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,583
I mean... You ducked
behind the lockers!

175
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,958
I've never seen you hide
from any other guy like that!

176
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,875
Uh... I don't...

177
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,666
I don't dislike him in
particular, it isn't that...

178
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,916
but I'm not... I'm not
really all that comfortable

179
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,333
around boys in general... so...

180
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,250
So when he comes
on like he's a bull

181
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,625
and you're the matador,
it completely freaks you out...

182
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,625
Yeah... That makes sense...

183
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,416
Nevertheless...!

184
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,875
Your sister and
Hanai are classmates,

185
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,708
so you've got to face your
fears and go to class 2-C...

186
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,125
You know why?

187
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,458
'Cause we've got
two curries and no rice!

188
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:48,916
Don't worry!

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,208
I'll be right there with you!

190
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,833
Thanks, Sara.

191
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,625
So far so good, now with any
luck, he won't even be here!

192
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,458
Hey, what is it?
What's the matter?

193
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,500
He's in there.
Hanai is in there.

194
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,625
Huh...? How can you know that?

195
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,166
Yes... Here I go...!

196
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,625
Off to see Miss Tsukamoto!

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,833
Oh my gosh! What is it?!

198
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,916
Hey, Hanai!
Can I ask you something?

199
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,291
What is it?

200
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,333
Which gives you this.

201
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,875
Oh, I see.

202
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,125
Okay, do you get it now?
'Cause I gotta get going.

203
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,583
Well excuse me, where are
you going in such a hurry?

204
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,166
To pay a call on
Miss Tsukamoto of Class 1-D!

205
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,750
Miss Tsukamoto...?! I don't
blame you, that chick is so hot!

206
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,208
Maybe I should join you.

207
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,458
Hm?

208
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,750
I'm so there!

209
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,916
I'll come too! Me too!

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,125
I wanna come!
Tsukamoto's little sister!

211
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:55,916
What a dish! She's such
a babe! Count me in!

212
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,333
I'll just go in with you,

213
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,125
and then I can ask her
out when she shoots you down!

214
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,958
Hold it you guys, hold it!

215
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,250
I'll do it fast,
and it'll be okay...

216
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,125
Everything's going to be okay...

217
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,208
Yakumo!!

218
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,375
You okay... What happened?

219
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,875
Hey, sis...

220
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,000
Did those lunch boxes
cause any trouble for you?

221
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,166
What...? Are you kidding?

222
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,416
Come on, Kenji!

223
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,166
Get it in gear,
it's time for school!

224
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,958
Look... I really
don't want to mother you!

225
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,041
Okay, fine...!

226
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,166
I guess skipping school is
what delinquents do, but...

227
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,750
Okay...

228
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,458
So... What about school?

229
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,250
I'm not going.

230
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,791
How can a guy be so
tough on the outside

231
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,000
and yet so weak on the inside?

232
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,583
I'm not going ...

233
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,208
I can't trust guys and I can't
trust girls, so I'm not going.

234
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,916
Fine.

235
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,291
It's Mr. Super's Super
Fun Science Show!

236
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,333
Howdy do...!
Guess what, kids...?

237
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,583
Today on Mr. Super's
Super Fun Science show

238
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,541
we're going to learn
about optical illusions!

239
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,333
Now, look carefully at the
picture in problem one...!

240
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,916
Which of these two
straight lines is longer...?

241
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,583
Number one... or number two?

242
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,541
Number two... It's gotta be.

243
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,083
The answer is...

244
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,166
They're both the same length...!

245
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,291
No way...! Are you sure...?
That's impossible...!

246
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,708
Check again; number two

247
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,125
has got to be just a little bit
longer than number one!

248
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,125
This is what we mean
by an optical illusion...!

249
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,750
Neat, kiddies, huh?

250
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,166
An illusion?

251
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,291
Some fancy trickery.

252
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,541
So then... You're sure
you have to leave us...?

253
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,083
I'm sorry to hear that...

254
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,833
Oh, Mangoku...

255
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,750
Farewell, friends!

256
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,000
May heaven bless you, sir!

257
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,916
Tell me the truth...

258
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,416
You knew that girl
was in love with you,

259
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,750
and you were in love with her.

260
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,166
You only left to spare
her feelings, didn't you?

261
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,916
Not at all... You're way off...

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,625
There was never anything
between the two of us;

263
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,416
we were just good friends.

264
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,541
Oh please! Don't try
to fool me, tough guy.

265
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,583
I can tell your heart is
really breaking on the inside!

266
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,791
You're the man, Mangoku!
You're the man!

267
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,416
I feel your pain, dude.

268
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,416
Just calm down
and listen to me...!

269
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,000
I only found out recently
that you and I are siblings!

270
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,541
Then...

271
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,750
You're saying you're actually
my long... lost... brother?

272
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,208
Huh...? He's her brother?

273
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,541
Of course, that explains it!

274
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,375
That's why we've always
been so close to one another!

275
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,083
You see? It was all
a misunderstanding!

276
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,708
Well, I'll be a blarsnog!

277
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,750
Wait a sec!

278
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:22,083
What if it was all an illusion,
a misunderstanding...?

279
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,541
Tenma and Karasuma are really...

280
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,041
Mm! Isn't it good, Big Brother?!

281
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,916
Yup, it sure is, Little Sister.

282
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,125
They're siblings!

283
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,125
That's the reason
we've always been

284
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,625
so close to one
another, you goof!

285
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,583
Of course...! That must be it!

286
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,708
To tell you the truth...

287
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,666
It's always been you that
I've loved from the start.

288
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,208
Oh, crap...!

289
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,166
Man... Did I screw up
royally this time or what!

290
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,333
Hey, Kenji...
you've got company.

291
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,333
What do you want me to say?

292
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,416
Argh... who is it?

293
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,125
Well, it's someone you know
pretty well, actually... Ten...

294
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,583
I was right! It was
all a misunderstanding!

295
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,458
Ten--

296
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,208
--no... ji...

297
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,083
Of course... It was
too good to be true...

298
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,333
You piece of crap...

299
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,583
You got a lotta nerve standing
me up like that this afternoon!

300
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,458
You owe me a dance, punk.

301
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,541
What's wrong with me?

302
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,666
I'm helpless... Like I forgot...

303
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,291
...how to fight...

304
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,958
Man, I don't get it,
but you're no fun anymore!

305
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,666
Call me tomorrow if
you get your spine back!

306
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,666
Hey, sis...

307
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,958
Are rice balls going to be all
right for school lunch tomorrow?

308
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,666
Absolutely!

309
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:41,375
Harima... Harima...

310
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:46,333
Kenji Harima, are all
your tomorrows gone?

311
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,583
Is this the end...
for your love?

312
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,375
Oh, Karasuma, you mean you'd
prefer curry to rice balls...?

313
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,541
I should've thought of that...!

314
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,250
I'll cook you a
delicious curry this time!

315
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,250
Next time on School Rumble:

316
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,750
"Comic Book Blues!
Older Woman Blues!

317
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,583
Super Bad Water Blues!"

318
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,875
Oh, no...! Iori!
