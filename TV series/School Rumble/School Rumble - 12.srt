1
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,625
School Rumble's coming up next!

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,875
If you know what's good
for ya, you won't miss it!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,458
For your viewing pleasure,
three special shorts!

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,458
Short Number One:
It's Hard On Younger Sister.

5
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,625
Mm! Smells good, huh?!

6
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,958
Our noodle soup uses tofu
made from natural soybeans...

7
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,250
Wow! That soup really looks
yummy, doesn't it, Yakumo?

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,125
I'm home!

9
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,708
Oh, hey there, Sis...
I hope you're hungry.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,375
For dinner tonight, I made
a big bowl of noodle soup.

11
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,583
How weird...! But how'd
you know that's exactly

12
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,583
what I wanted tonight?

13
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,416
Yakumo didn't have the
heart to tell her it was

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,125
because of the
TV commercial they'd seen.

15
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:56,541
Short Number Two: It's
Also Hard On Older Sister.

16
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,250
Uh, Sis? What are
you looking for?

17
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,375
My old water imp.

18
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,250
But I'm not having
any luck finding it.

19
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,041
Wait, did you say... water imp?

20
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,583
Yeah, silly!
What'd you think I said?

21
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,208
I want to give it to
Karasuma as a surprise gift!

22
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,916
Oh, I see...

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,916
Here it is,
in all its dusty glory!

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,333
Wow, it really is old, isn't it?

25
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,041
It says here it's the
mummy of a real water imp.

26
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:24,458
Short Number Three:
Tenma's Hair Secret.

27
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,041
Like all girls her age,
Tenma takes the time

28
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,666
to fix her hair each
and every morning.

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,958
But to keep track
of her daily schedule,

30
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,500
she makes subtle
changes to her hair.

31
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,708
Oh... morning, Tenma-

32
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,333
Morning!

33
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:39,583
Nine... o'clock?

34
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,166
That's right...!

35
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,000
There's a program on tonight at
nine that I don't wanna miss...

36
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,458
This way I won't forget it!

37
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,291
Okay, line up people!

38
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,958
Good!

39
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,791
Alright...! You're all in
for a very special treat today!

40
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,416
I made box lunches for everyone!

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,000
Miss Takano...

42
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:41,916
Thanks, Hanai.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,041
Miss Sawachika...

44
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,333
Thank you!

45
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,250
Miss Tsukamoto...

46
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,625
Cool!

47
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:47,583
Miss Suou...

48
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,208
Oh, thank you.

49
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,208
Imadori, Nara, enjoy!

50
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:51,875
Okay.

51
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,916
Alright! Sweet!

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,333
One more...!

53
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,791
This particular dish was
made with extra special care,

54
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,000
and Yakumo Tsukamoto,
this is... for you! Huh?

55
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,625
This is so good!

56
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,500
Talk about tasty!

57
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,833
I'll say...!

58
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,583
I never knew Hanai was
such a good cook, did you?

59
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,833
Yeah, he is...!

60
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,541
And I'm sure he's gonna
have a great time even

61
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,125
if Yakumo didn't get
to come... Right, Hanai?

62
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,625
I forgot to pack my own lunch...

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,750
Harima, give that back!

64
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,541
No way! I didn't have any
breakfast this morning!

65
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,583
Gimme...! Gimme!

66
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,666
Does he have to be so pathetic?

67
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,291
Hey! Looks good!

68
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,791
The rooms are separated
by sliding doors.

69
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,500
So... there's no locks?

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,083
We're gonna change.

71
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,791
So that door better
stay shut, got it?!

72
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,625
Miko... don't worry.
It'll stay shut, I promise.

73
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,166
Well, men?
What say we change, too?

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,958
No prob! I've got
my trunks on under my jeans.

75
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,958
What are you doing...?
You promised you wouldn't!

76
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,333
There are naked
girls next door...

77
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,125
Can you blame me?

78
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,666
What do you think
you're doing, you pervert?!

79
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,250
Wow, your swimsuit
looks totally hot, Akira!

80
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,208
What about mine?
Pretty daring, huh?

81
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,791
Mikoto's suit makes
her boobs look even bigger!

82
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,416
Your suit's pretty
cute, too, Tenma.

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,916
Thanks! It's a different
color than Yakumo's.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,708
My dearest Yakumo?!

85
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,208
For the sake of Yakumo,

86
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,916
I will not allow any
untoward behavior!

87
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,791
The beach!

88
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,125
There's so many people!

89
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,708
Tenma, she's so cute...

90
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,875
Crap! Missed a
peek at the goods!

91
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,416
Oh, dearest Yakumo!

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,833
Why! Why couldn't
you have come today?!

93
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,083
Tenma, can I use your sunscreen?

94
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,750
Oh, I forgot to
bring any. Sorry.

95
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,166
I've got some
right here...! Hey!

96
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,291
I'll get my own.

97
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,000
Hey, where's Harima?

98
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,291
Guess he's still in the room.

99
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,458
It figures.

100
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,958
That guy's always
been a loner. A rebel.

101
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,000
Could have sworn I took
it out of my beach bag...

102
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,875
The rugged spirit of the ocean
is calling to my wild side...

103
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,750
Just wait for me, Tenma!

104
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,500
Alright... I've done
enough fooling around.

105
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,750
'Bout time I hit the beach...
Now where are those trunks at?

106
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:05,833
Swimming trunks...
oh, swimming trunks?

107
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,625
Could have sworn I put
those things in here... Huh?

108
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,458
No!

109
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,791
Don't scream...!
I didn't do anything wrong!

110
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,666
She's the one who
walked in on me...!

111
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,750
If she screams, everyone's
gonna come running in

112
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,916
and think I'm a pervert!

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,666
Even Tenma! Oh, crap!

114
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,333
What am I gonna do?!

115
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,791
Great...! So now what?!

116
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,083
I didn't mean for things
to turn out like this!

117
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,000
Geez, I'm a real moron!

118
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,750
This chick squirming around
isn't making things any easier!

119
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,041
Better just explain it to her,

120
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,416
let her know this is all
just a big mistake...!

121
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,166
I better quiet her down first...

122
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,333
But how do I do that... Got it!

123
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,125
You keep quiet.

124
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,291
What was I thinking?!

125
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,833
Yeah, I can shut her up by being
as creepy as possible! God!!

126
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,750
Somebody's here!
Now I'm a goner!

127
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,583
Wait, don't tell me.

128
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,666
You took off your clothes

129
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,833
and went to find
your swimming trunks.

130
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,250
You looked all over,
couldn't find them,

131
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,708
and then Eri walked in.

132
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,833
You tried to explain
yourself, she got scared,

133
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,208
and your infinite wisdom
led us to where we are now.

134
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,791
Don't worry, Harima.

135
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,041
I don't think you're a pervert,
but you are a total screw-up.

136
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,583
What's wrong? Did you
ever find your sunscreen?

137
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,166
I never got the chance to look.

138
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,333
Why not? Did something happen?

139
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:29,416
I don't want to
talk about it, okay?

140
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,416
Let's cut the watermelon
open and eat it!

141
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,958
Miko! It's watermelon time!

142
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,625
Miko...! Miko...!
Mikoto's drowning!

143
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,250
Somebody, help...! Hanai!

144
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,833
Do Kenpo or something! Save her!

145
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,125
You thought you could
learn to swim quicker

146
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,750
in deep water...? Gimme a break!

147
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,250
Man, back off.

148
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,875
Hanai... you were just
like a lifeguard out there!

149
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,041
Oh, thanks...

150
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,541
Of course, I'm used
to saving her life.

151
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,250
Oh! Would you
just shut up already?!

152
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,500
That's uncalled for...

153
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,750
Now relax and enjoy your coffee.

154
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,416
Yeah, whatever...

155
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,708
Wow, I wish
I could swim like you...

156
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,208
You're really good...

157
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,583
None of us girls
know how to swim...

158
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,833
Isn't that right, Eri?

159
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,916
Just be quiet.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,958
Gentlewomen!

161
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,250
Today, your fondest
wishes shall be granted...!

162
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,708
I want to see everyone
put their best foot forward...!

163
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,208
Let the swimming lessons begin!

164
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,000
Dammit, Tenma!
Look what you did now!

165
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,583
Come on... It'll be fun.

166
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,291
Let's let him teach us.

167
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,708
I know you'd make a
good teacher, too, Nara.

168
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,375
Me...? A teacher?

169
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,250
Very well, then!

170
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,083
We men shall be the teachers!

171
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,416
Finally, something
to get excited about!

172
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,791
Without Yakumo here,
I was beginning

173
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,166
to feel like this trip
would be a waste of my time!

174
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,458
Hey...! If I teach
her that gives me

175
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,083
an excuse to talk
to her...! And get close!

176
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,541
I've gotta be the one
that teaches Tenma,

177
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,875
so I better straighten
out those other guys!

178
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,166
Yo, Imadori!

179
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,083
I noticed you seem to
like the flashy ladies.

180
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,583
So you should teach
the flashy, rich chick, okay?

181
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,041
Sure!

182
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,541
Listen, Hanai, you seem to
be good friends with Mikoto,

183
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,416
so it would make sense
for you two to partner up.

184
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,916
Uh?

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,250
Yo... uh,um...

186
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:08,916
Nara...

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, whatever.

188
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,416
Anyway, you don't
really stand out,

189
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,291
so you get to teach
that quiet girl, okay?

190
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,625
Huh?

191
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,583
Just draw up a chart.
It'll make it easier.

192
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,625
Who, me?

193
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,625
No, your mother.
Here, I'll do it.

194
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,375
Eri here,
Mikoto there, you here,

195
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,083
Tenma there,
and me... right here...

196
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,750
Hey, guys...! Time to assign
our swimming partners!

197
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,125
Great!

198
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,666
Oh, Tenma!

199
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,958
Right...! Now get with your
partners and begin the lessons!

200
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,458
Well... Let's go, Mikoto

201
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,083
Just don't let me sink, okay?

202
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:47,833
I don't believe it.

203
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,916
Harima's even
dumber than he looks.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,583
Screwed up by one lousy line...

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,750
Wanna swim?

206
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,625
Thanks, I'd rather drown.

207
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,458
Uh... Hey...

208
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,500
Guess it's about time we started
those swimming lessons,

209
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,041
don't ya think...?

210
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,291
Ha, okay...

211
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,958
Awkward...

212
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,250
Okay, just give me your hand...

213
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,625
Huh?

214
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,125
Your hand...

215
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,458
Your hand...? Your... hand...?

216
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,583
Just like that, see?

217
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,291
Take strong and even strokes...

218
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,041
Show me again.

219
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,750
I'm gonna build you the biggest
sand castle on the beach!

220
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,208
We're far enough already...!
Stop...! Imadori!

221
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,458
Aw, come on!

222
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,500
You're not gonna wuss
out on me now, are ya?

223
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,333
I'm ready to learn...!
'Kay, Nara?

224
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,333
I promise I'll do
my best, Tenma.

225
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,458
This is your chance
to get close to her, man!

226
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,583
Don't screw it up!

227
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,250
Well, let's get started then.

228
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,708
Uh... Y-yeah!

229
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,500
Wow, it's so soft and cushiony.

230
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,000
You like the view down there?

231
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,666
Listen... I'm warning you...

232
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,916
Don't get any ideas... 'Kay...?

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,750
You might be
Tenma's teacher today...

234
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,583
but that doesn't make
you her boyfriend,

235
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,083
so don't get your hopes up, and
keep your filthy mitts off her!

236
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,750
Y-Yeah, uh, sure. Gotcha.

237
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,666
But I want to be more
then Tenma's teacher...

238
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,083
Maybe once we get out in
the water, he won't see us...

239
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,958
That's it!

240
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,916
Let her go and she's got nowhere
to swim but into your arms!

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,250
Hey... I'm gonna let go of you
for a little while, okay, Tenma?

242
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,500
Uh... sure... That's alright.

243
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,833
Hey...! What the...
Where are you going?!

244
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,750
Wait! Stop! Come back!
That's far enough!

245
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,333
I did it!

246
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,875
I'm like a freakin' mermaid, and
it's all because of you, Nara!

247
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,500
Ha-ha, yeah...

248
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,333
Hey...! You guys coming?!

249
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,333
I doubt it.
Hanai wore himself out.

250
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,166
Hey, twerp...!

251
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,000
Quit staring, unless you want
me to squash you into fish food.

252
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,791
Right... Sorry

253
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,750
Aw, man...! What am I gonna do?!

254
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,416
Harima's watching
me like a hawk.

255
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,250
He could seriously kick my butt
and do it in front of Tenma.

256
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,583
So much for
getting close to her.

257
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,458
Guess I'll just... watch.

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,125
Somebody please help!
Lost swimsuit!

259
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,500
Wha...?!

260
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,541
It's gonna be okay,
Tenma! Did it come off?

261
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,125
Harima's gonna beat
the crap out of me.

262
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,583
But if I don't do this,
what kind of a man am I?

263
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,083
I love you, Tenma Tsukamoto!

264
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,041
Where's it at?
Tenma's swimsuit... Oh!

265
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:24,333
Hope you realize
I'm doing this for one reason...

266
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,791
It's for you!

267
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,833
Nara...

268
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,625
Here... Take it.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,291
Thank you, Nara...

270
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,791
Huh?

271
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,125
Boy! You're a klutz, Harima...!

272
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,250
Aren't you lucky Nara
was so close to me

273
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,416
and able to find your trunks?!

274
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,958
Isn't he the greatest!

275
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,875
Where are we?

276
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,500
Oh, no! We're marooned!

277
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,875
Geez! I told you
we were going out too far.

278
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,250
But you wouldn't listen.

279
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,250
We're never gonna
get home, are we?!

280
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,791
Quit crying, you pansy!

281
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,833
I'm trying to think!

282
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,750
We can see the shore.
Think anyone can see us?

283
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,250
No! It's further than it looks!

284
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,208
No one can see us
all the way out here!

285
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,250
Besides, we'll starve to
death before anybody finds us!

286
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,666
This is no time to panic.

287
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,375
Then again, if we don't
find a way off this rock,

288
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,541
who knows what might happen...

289
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,958
Oh, please don't say that!

290
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,083
C'mon, I don't
wanna die here, babe!

291
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,500
I don't wanna die,
either, moron...!

292
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,125
Oh, and being stranded
doesn't give you the right

293
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,583
to call me "babe," got it...?!

294
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,750
Wait a second...!
You can swim, right...?!

295
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,666
Then why don't you just swim
to the shore and get help?!

296
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,708
I'm... sorry, I can't!

297
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,416
Why not...? Is the current
too strong or something?

298
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,291
No...

299
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,625
Then...?

300
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,541
Let's just say I'm really
allergic to shark bites.

301
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,958
Oh my god!

302
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,333
Your wuss factor just
shot up, like, twenty points!

303
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,541
Hey, don't be so harsh.

304
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,666
Sharks can be a real threat!

305
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,166
I think someone's been watching

306
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,291
a little too much
animal discovery.

307
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,083
There's no point in arguing...

308
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,333
If we're getting out of here,
we've gotta think

309
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,958
of a way to get the attention
of the people on the shore.

310
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,291
Hey, good idea.

311
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,833
Thinking's what I do best,
so just leave it to me.

312
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,750
That might work...

313
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,625
Yep, that'll do it...
A signal fire.

314
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,958
We don't have any matches...

315
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,833
or anything to burn.

316
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,208
We'll burn our swimsuits!

317
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,416
And whose were you
planning to burn first?

318
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,458
Well, yours does have
one more piece than mine...

319
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,375
Maybe there's something in this
cave that could help us out...

320
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,125
Let's split up and
take a look around.

321
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,666
Okay!

322
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,208
Stranded in the
middle of nowhere...

323
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,916
Just me and "Captain Perv-o." 

324
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Mikoto...! Hey!
Look what I found!

325
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,416
Uh, okay?

326
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,541
It's a jar!

327
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,916
Yeah, I know what it is...

328
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,458
but how does it help us?

329
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,250
You know...! We'll do like
they do in the old movies...!

330
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,750
We'll put a message in it and
send it away for help, you see?!

331
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,291
That'll take years, you idiot!

332
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,625
Speaking of that message,
we don't have a pencil,

333
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,125
so I guess we'll have
to write it in blood.

334
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,041
Forget the stupid
message...! Drop it...!

335
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,541
We don't have time
to keep goofing off!

336
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,625
Let's get serious!

337
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,791
Hey, I am totally being serious!

338
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,750
We... need a plan.

339
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,750
Plan A...! Build a raft...

340
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,458
but, we don't have any rope...

341
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,791
Plan B...! Swim like
mad towards the shore...

342
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,916
but I can't really swim,
so I wouldn't get very far...

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,416
Plan C...! Human SOS...

344
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,541
but we're short one human...

345
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,166
Plan D...! Ride on
the back of that idiot!

346
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,375
Out of all those plans,

347
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,500
D's the only one that
might be feasible...

348
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:54,750
but it would put Imadori in some
danger, and I don't want that...

349
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,791
What else can we do?
I'm all out of ideas.

350
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:05,166
Is Imadori actually thinking
with his mind for a change?!

351
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,833
So, any luck...?

352
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,708
Have you been able to come up
with any good ideas, for us...?

353
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,000
I think I've got four
possibilities that might work:

354
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,791
Plans A, B, C, and D.

355
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:16,458
D.

356
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,750
What...?!

357
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,583
Did he actually think of
the same plans as me,

358
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,500
and come to the
same conclusion?!

359
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,166
Can he read minds
or something...?!

360
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,958
Even if he can't, he did
pick the most dangerous one.

361
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,541
Not so much of
a pansy after all.

362
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,916
Gotta admit... I'm impressed.

363
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,375
It's gotta be D...

364
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,958
I always get boob sizes right.

365
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,458
You're a D-cup for sure...! What
can I say, babe, it's a gift--

366
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,958
Will you be serious for once?!

367
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,416
Man, Mikoto is so hot.

368
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,833
Wonder what the best way
is to let her know I'd swim

369
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,041
for the shore in exchange
for a little smooch?

370
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,416
I wonder if I'm even her type...

371
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,166
Hey? What are you looking at?

372
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,750
Uh, so tell me.

373
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,125
Are there any
guys that you like?

374
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,250
Well, yeah... sort of...

375
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,666
Guess I better
forget the smooch.

376
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,750
Bet she's the faithful type.

377
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,750
So... this guy of yours...
Do I know him?

378
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,583
No, he's... he's a few
years older than me...

379
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,083
When I was a freshman...
he was a junior...

380
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,541
He graduated early

381
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,833
and now he's attending
a university in the city.

382
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,208
He's the brightest guy I know...

383
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,833
I really want to get
into the same college,

384
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,916
but I hear the entrance
exams are pretty tough!

385
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,750
Ah... there's still hope.

386
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,416
Long distance
relationships never last.

387
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,416
Hey!

388
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,916
Why are you asking
me about this?!

389
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,041
Got my reasons...

390
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,666
That reminds me...

391
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,916
If I would have stayed
home and studied,

392
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,250
I wouldn't be in this
stupid mess right now!

393
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,958
Sorry, was just trying to get
your mind off the situation...

394
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,375
Guess we really
should figure out

395
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,583
how we're gonna get ourselves
out of this mess, huh?

396
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,875
S'okay...

397
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,791
Hey, wait...
How could we forget?!

398
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,375
All of our friends
are back on the beach!

399
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,750
They'll notice we're gone

400
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,833
and send out a
search party, for sure!

401
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,625
Hey, guys, before
we go back to the room,

402
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,375
let's get in a picture together!

403
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,958
Oh! A group shot. Splendid idea.

404
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,125
I'll take it.

405
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,166
Come on, everybody, let's go!

406
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,541
Over here!

407
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:20,875
Okay, guys...

408
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,291
So, what do mice like?

409
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,708
Hey, wait!

410
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,916
What's wrong, Tenma?

411
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,375
I don't know,

412
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,291
but I have a weird feeling
we're forgetting something.

413
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,583
Big smiles!

414
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,041
Ready when you are,
Akira...! Yeah!

415
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,625
Cheese!

416
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,458
Search party, huh?

417
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,375
Mikoto!

418
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,083
Where have you and Imadori
been all this time, huh...?

419
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,333
Uh oh, Harima's in
a really bad mood!

420
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:21,375
Could Mikoto be the girl
that Harima's in love with?!

421
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,000
Is she the one...?!

422
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,666
