1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:08,833
Hey, Happy New Year...!

2
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:12,291
School Rumble is
coming up next! Yeah!

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,583
When you watch television...

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,083
keep the lights on...

5
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,791
and don't sit too close!

6
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,458
Iori!

7
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,250
Bad kitty!

8
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,666
Behave yourself!

9
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,291
Iori!

10
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,958
What's gotten
into that cat lately?

11
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,916
Oh, I can't stand
it anymore, it's so hot!

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,333
Yakumo...

13
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,291
when is the air conditioner
gonna be fixed?!

14
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,375
The repairman said
they'd be here around noon,

15
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,541
or a little after.

16
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,666
Aghhhhh...! But everyone's
coming over here

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,583
to do homework today!

18
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,791
I'm afraid it can't be helped.

19
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:39,166
No... fair!...! I'm gonna die
in this heat, I just know it!

20
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
There are lots of people
who are out in this heat,

21
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,541
and they don't die.

22
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,000
They go to work...

23
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,541
They play sports...

24
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,166
All kinds of things...

25
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,916
Awwwww... Yuki...
are you sure you can't go?

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,041
Not even for a little while?

27
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,250
Oh, I see...

28
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, maybe next time...

29
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:03,916
Damn it...

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,875
Okay, who else we got?

31
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,708
Hey there, Kyoko!

32
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,500
What are you doing...?
Eh...? I see...

33
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,333
Well, maybe next time...

34
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,250
I don't get it...

35
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,208
What's everyone's problem today?

36
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,125
Okay, moving on...

37
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,375
Oh my goodness,
I'm so sorry...! I didn't...

38
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,125
Wait, you're
Imadori, aren't you?

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,500
Yeah... and you're...
Karen Ichihuh?

40
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,041
Ichijou.

41
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,750
Oh... I'm really sorry, honest!

42
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,291
S'okay, no problem.

43
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,750
So what's up in there...?
Wrestling practice?

44
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,250
Uh... uh-huh.

45
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,916
Whew... I can't imagine...

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,916
It must be pretty rough
in this kind of weather...

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,250
Let's see, who's next?

48
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,791
Well, we train every
day. We're used to it.

49
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,791
Come on, every day...?
Are you guys crazy...?

50
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,916
Geez, it's summer vacation.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,958
That means it's time to get out

52
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,750
and have fun dating
around, ya know?

53
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,625
You should really think
about getting a boyfriend.

54
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,750
I'm... really...

55
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,666
I'm not... very good
at things like that...

56
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,958
Do you really enjoy wrestling
every single day...?

57
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,833
I mean, isn't there something
else you'd rather be doing?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,833
I'm not very good
at anything else.

59
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,916
In fact, I'm not even
that good at wrestling.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,708
But I do enjoy it.

61
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,958
It's a whole lot of fun for me!

62
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,958
Huh... Wrestling... Weird.

63
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,375
I never thought

64
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,541
that was something you
could be so serious about...

65
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,958
Here you go, Eri! Iced tea!

66
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,333
Thank you.

67
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,750
Mikoto will be here
in just a little bit,

68
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,250
but Akira said she
couldn't make it until later.

69
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,583
Oh, man...

70
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,416
We won't make any
headway until Akira gets here.

71
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,083
You're right...

72
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,250
A couple of dummies like you

73
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,250
and me haven't got
a chance on our own.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,291
A couple of dummies?!

75
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,541
Now wait just a darn minute!

76
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,000
The only class I have
trouble in is language skills,

77
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,541
so don't go lumping me in
the same category with you!

78
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,708
Yeah, that's great.

79
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,166
Do you understand
problem number seven?

80
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,250
Don't you even listen when
people are talking to you?!

81
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,166
Okay, fine, so you
don't understand it...

82
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,083
It's no big deal...
I'll just do it myself.

83
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,208
No...! The point is...

84
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,791
Forget it.

85
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,750
So, uh... Tenma...

86
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,250
What's up?

87
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,333
There's, uh, there's something
that I wanted to ask you.

88
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,291
Oh, yeah, what is it...?
Ask me, ask me!

89
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:50,291
I was wondering if you've
ever seen... a man's body.

90
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,041
Wait a sec...
I didn't mean to say...

91
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,916
Damn it...!
Whenever my mind wanders,

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,083
that image comes
back into my head.

93
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,333
There it is again!

94
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,708
And now I've asked
Tenma a stupid question,

95
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,583
all because I wasn't thinking!

96
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,958
This is all that
pervert Harima's fault...

97
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,166
He had to lose his head and do
something totally ridiculous...

98
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
And to ask Tenma
of all people...!

99
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,875
She's probably the most
naïve girl in our entire...

100
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,666
Of course I have.

101
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,583
What?!

102
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,208
I've seen men's bodies.

103
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,291
You've...

104
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,916
Wait a minute,
you can't mean that...

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,791
You what?!

106
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,916
Sure... Hasn't everyone our age?

107
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,541
What's the big deal?

108
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,833
That... That can't mean...

109
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,041
Tenma has...
gone all the way...?

110
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,083
I haven't even done that yet!

111
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,333
Ahem...!

112
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,416
So... I guess this must
have been with Karasuma?

113
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,166
Oh, gosh...! How did
you know about that...?

114
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,500
Yes, it was just the
other night when we...

115
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,208
Noooooooooooooo!!

116
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,375
It was the greatest
night of my life...!

117
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,791
Karasuma was such a gentleman.

118
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,250
Huh? What on
earth's the matter...?

119
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,750
Oh...! I hadn't thought...

120
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,791
Maybe you haven't seen one?

121
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,916
And I thought she
was into contact sports!

122
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,000
Of course I have.

123
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:09,833
I thought so.

124
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,166
I mean, it's only natural...

125
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,750
So, what are
your favorite moves?

126
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,791
How embarrassing.

127
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,875
Tenma's more
experienced than I am!

128
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,708
Hold on...! I bet she wouldn't
do something like that!

129
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,416
Well, how about taking
one right in the mouth?

130
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,083
Yeah...! That's
great for starters!

131
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,916
What about having
your arms held back?

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,875
Oh, yeah!
That's an amazing move!

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,125
That's it... I give up!!

134
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,208
Yes, sir, the guys

135
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,041
just can't get enough
of that stuff... Whew!

136
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,500
Is that true?!

137
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,458
Then... if Akira hadn't come in

138
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,291
when she did,
he really might've...

139
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,583
What's happening to my body!

140
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,250
Uh, by the way, there's, uh,

141
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,083
something I wanted
to talk to you about.

142
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,583
You mean there's more...?
Well, then spit it out!

143
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,625
Come on...! I can take it!

144
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:06,208
Well, it's... about...
it's about Harima.

145
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,458
Huh?

146
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,291
I'm pretty sure he's got
a major crush on Mikoto.

147
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,333
I'd really like it if
things worked out well

148
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,916
for the two of them.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,333
But let's face it, I'm no
good at this sort of thing.

150
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,458
So I was wondering if
I could count on your help.

151
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,166
I think this could be
a good thing for Mikoto.

152
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,791
I was kind of surprised
Harima liked her...

153
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,833
But then, Mikoto is so pretty...

154
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:38,333
Well... come on...
when you think about it...

155
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,833
Mikoto isn't really
all that pretty.

156
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,916
A.C. Repair!

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,750
Thank goodness, you're here!

158
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,833
If you don't mind, we'll need
to check the compressor first.

159
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,250
Strange. He's so quiet.

160
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,833
Right this way.

161
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,666
Oh. That's gonna be tricky.

162
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,458
Hey... get the ladder.

163
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,875
Right.

164
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,458
Well, I'll let you get to it.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,041
Iori...! Where have
you been...? Come here!

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,750
Oh, my gosh...

167
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,708
What's wrong with your leg?

168
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,791
Are you hurt?

169
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,833
Wait a minute...! Iori!

170
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,250
Oh, man, now what
am I gonna do...?

171
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,375
He's mad at me for
scolding him so much!

172
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,833
Come on, kitty!

173
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,375
Get your mousie...?

174
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,916
No...? How about a fishie?

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,416
You like fish...

176
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on out and I'll even
let you have two, if you want.

177
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,833
No good...

178
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,958
I guess I shouldn't have
been so hard on him...

179
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,625
Allow me.

180
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,625
Come here.

181
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,333
Let's see... Ah, here
we go, he's got a thorn.

182
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,750
Look, it's right here
behind his rear left leg.

183
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,958
There, he'll be okay now.

184
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,958
Oh... I don't know
how to thank you!

185
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,625
Wait...! Do you...?

186
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,916
Huh?

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,750
Do you... like animals?

188
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,916
Well... to be honest,

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,333
I never really used to think
about them all that much...

190
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,250
Then one day, they
suddenly seemed to like me.

191
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,625
Hold on... Huh?

192
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,000
This house...

193
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,750
It seems familiar somehow.

194
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,708
So... Has anyone else
noticed how hot it is...?

195
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,875
Should I open the
window a little wider?

196
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,708
Sure... Whatever.

197
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,041
Oh yeah, I forgot.

198
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,791
The window's already
opened as far as it'll go...

199
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,500
This is awful...

200
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,375
I've got to do something
to break this silence...

201
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,458
I know!

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,916
Hey, Eri. Can you
help me out with this?

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,500
Hmm... You're asking
the wrong girl.

204
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,250
Oh, well, how about you, Mikoto?

205
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,250
Hm...? Oh, the classics...

206
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,083
Sure thing... This is
probably what they're after...

207
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,583
Oh, I see... Thanks a lot!

208
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,875
Nothing to it...
That was an easy one.

209
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,791
Um, Mikoto...
What do you get for this one?

210
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,416
Sorry, I don't know
the answer to that one...

211
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,583
Is that math...? Let me see...

212
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,708
Oh, this is nothing. Here.

213
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,291
Wow, that was great...
You're good!

214
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,458
Nah, it's simple...

215
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,041
But you have to be
able to do this stuff

216
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,291
if you're even
thinking about college!

217
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,375
Oh, what am I gonna do...?!

218
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,958
Even without the A.C.
it's freezing in here!

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,083
Okay, study questions
are a bust...

220
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,375
I need something
fun to break the ice...

221
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,791
But what...?
There must be something!

222
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,583
Hey, sorry I'm late, you guys,

223
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,916
but I picked up the
pictures from our vacation.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,666
Oh, thank you, Akira!

225
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,625
Thank you...! Hey everybody!

226
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,250
Let's all look at
the nice pictures!

227
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,916
Ha ha...! We sure
had a good time!

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,250
Ooh...?! What's this?

229
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,375
Looks like Imadori
really likes you, Mikoto!

230
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,333
Tenma!

231
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,875
Would you shut up?!

232
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,291
You can't tell it from these,
but you must be pretty busy,

233
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,500
since you're secretly
running around

234
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,125
with that hairy
delinquent as well.

235
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,625
Huh?!

236
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,750
That's it! If you've
got something to say,

237
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,083
just spit it out.

238
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,958
I'm sick of playing all
these catty little games!

239
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,333
I don't know what the
hell your problem is,

240
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,750
but you seriously
need to grow up!

241
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,333
Just get over yourself!

242
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,583
Ah, that does it!
It is so on, Mikoto!

243
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,541
Unlike you, I don't
just cozy up to anyone

244
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,708
who can grow whiskers...!

245
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,083
First you're all
nice with Hanai,

246
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
and then you and Imadori
just disappear somewhere,

247
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,500
and now you're after Harima!

248
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,916
Whoa, whoa, whoa...!

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,375
What the hell are you
talking about, ponytails?!

250
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,458
You're the one who had him
on his knees in the middle

251
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,125
of the freaking
sidewalk the other day!

252
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,833
That...?! I couldn't help it,
he just suddenly popped up

253
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,166
out of nowhere, grabbed my hand,

254
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,416
and started confessing
his love to me!

255
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,166
I've had enough of this...!
I'm out of here!

256
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,583
Eri, wait!

257
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,333
S'all right...
See you later, Tenma.

258
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,291
Mikoto, is it really true?

259
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,583
Harima told Eri he loved her?

260
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,958
Yeah, it's true...

261
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,625
At the time I thought I should
just keep my mouth shut

262
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,166
and get out of there
before they could see me.

263
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,333
Then why... I don't get it.

264
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,500
I was helping him practice
how to confess his love to you!

265
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,833
He seemed so
serious about it, too!

266
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,750
And all that time, he was
chasing after both of you!

267
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,625
Oh, Harima, you...
you're terrible!

268
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,041
Oh, Harima, you...
you're terrible!

269
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,583
Come on, kid, just tell
me why you're crying.

270
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,375
No... forget it, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

271
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,500
Look, I can see
it's not nothing.

272
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,541
It's just that I don't know
what's going on anymore!

273
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,750
Oh, is this a case
of teenage heartbreak?

274
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,125
Is that what this is?

275
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm very sorry, sir...

276
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,958
I'll get right back to work,
you don't have to worry.

277
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,291
Would you like a rice ball?

278
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,583
Um... I don't... I don't
really know what's going on...

279
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,708
but I hope you feel better.

280
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,708
Thank you.
I'll just help myself.

281
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:45,625
Oh, yeah, I remember those days.

282
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,416
It was rough.

283
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,125
Wow, that's tasty!

284
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,541
Wait, you want me to
recommend you for a job...?

285
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,083
Okay, so what happened?

286
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,416
Didn't you have a
viable form of employment?

287
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,083
Not anymore, I don't...

288
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,583
I'm through with air
conditioner repair forever...

289
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,333
It's personal.

290
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,833
Right, whatever...

291
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,750
If you really need a job,
I'll see what I can do,

292
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,916
but there's no room for
weaklings at this place!

293
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,041
Thank you, I won't let you down.

294
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,250
Okay, ladies,
it's time to get to work...!

295
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,916
Come on, move it, double time!

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, sir!

297
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,875
So what are you
doing here, beard boy?

298
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,583
I should ask you that.

299
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:32,583
It sucks, but you need money if
you wanna date the ladies.

300
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,375
Oh yeah, you just
figured that out...?

301
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,083
You're dumber than you look.

302
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,166
Hey! Less talk and more walk!

303
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,125
I don't need you
to tell me to work.

304
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,041
Keep it cool...

305
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll just keep it cool and
concentrate on my job.

306
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,958
That's all that's left for
me now...! Time to kick ass!

307
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,958
Hey, new kid...! Attaboy!

308
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,875
Pretty impressive, carrying
that big sucker all by yourself!

309
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,958
Wow... I'm... needed?!

310
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,083
Why, you might even be able
to keep up with Hanai here.

311
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,250
Huh?

312
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,083
No sweat...

313
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,958
It's a light workout for me!

314
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,833
Hey... careful... newb...

315
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,291
When you're not used to it,
you can strain yourself.

316
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,625
Thanks... I'm okay... but
you should watch yourself,

317
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,416
you looked a little
wobbly on those stairs.

318
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,458
Very nice, boys...!
That's the way to hustle!

319
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,333
This...? It's nothing,
boss, easy as pie...

320
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,291
Easy, easy, easy, easy!

321
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,750
You guys sure
are some workers...!

322
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,125
The only other person
I've ever seen

323
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,750
lift a load like
that alone is Ichi!

324
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,708
I... Ichi?

325
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,250
Hey...! Ichi!

326
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,375
Yes, sir?

327
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,375
Oh, hey, guys!

328
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:05,791
Uh... Hey there, I'm Karen...
We go to the same school.

329
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,208
Heh... it's funny...

330
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,583
We're in the same class,
but we've never really talked.

331
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,666
Nooooooooo... Uhh...

332
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,666
It's that chick
from the wrestling team!

333
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,583
Oh, yeah... I remember her now.

334
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,958
She is in our class...

335
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,458
I didn't know she was
working for this company...

336
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,041
So you all know each other...?

337
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,000
In that case,
I'll let Ichi here show you

338
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,083
"tough guys" how
a real man works!

339
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,958
Huh...?! No,
I wasn't trying to...

340
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,791
You're like a freak of nature.
I mean, you're just so strong.

341
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,375
 "A freak of nature?"...

342
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:59,125
But I'm a girl.
An ordinary, everyday girl.

343
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,875
It doesn't take any kind of
special talent to lift things...

344
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,583
It's just applied dynamics.

345
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:09,833
I get tired... just
like everyone else does.

346
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,125
Out of my way!

347
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,125
Wha... Imadori, I...

348
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,041
You shouldn't have to
strain yourself like this...

349
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,250
Why don't you let me
take care of it?

350
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,458
This is no kind
of job for a girl...

351
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,250
You should take it easy.

352
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,750
Oh, wow...!
Thank you so much, Imadori!

353
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,458
No problem.

354
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:38,041
Well, here I go...!
This is better!

355
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,250
Oh yeah!

356
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,166
Am I a genius or what?

357
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,958
Now all I have to do is
carry these lightweight boxes

358
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,375
one at a time, nice and slow!

359
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,916
And to think that girl might've
carried them all in at once...!

360
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,250
This way I get to skip
the heavy stuff and goof off!

361
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,500
Hell yeah!

362
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,500
I wonder if it's okay to
be paid the same as that girl?

363
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,708
Ah, now that was a good workout!

364
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,916
Money! Yeah! I rule!

365
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,416
It's nice, isn't it?

366
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,583
Nice? It's great...! I can
even ask you out if I want to!

367
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,625
I can do anything!
I'm king of the world!

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,291
Okay.

369
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,916
Um, thank you...

370
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,166
This is my first date... and...
I'm looking forward to it!

371
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,625
Oh, no...!

372
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:47,250
I wish I just knew when
to shut up! Dang it!

373
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,208
Yay...! We've got A.C.
and we've got snow cones.

374
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,625
Life is good!

375
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,291
Even so, you can't stay
indoors all the time, you know.

376
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,416
Don't worry about me!

377
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,750
I've got all kinds
of plans to go out!

378
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,958
I'm going to the fireworks
with Mikoto and Eri... Oh...

379
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,375
I forgot... Mikoto and Eri...

380
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,958
We may not be able to go to the
fireworks... or anything else...

381
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,916
Sara here!

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,125
When I told Yakumo I'd never
been to a fireworks display,

383
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,541
she invited me to come along
with her to the summer festival!

384
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,375
Next time on School Rumble:

385
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:24,000
"Summer, Friendship,
And Fireworks!"

386
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,958
I'm going to wear a kimono!
