1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,041
Coming up after this,
it's School Rumble.

2
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,458
Today, we'll be learning how to
sketch each other's portraits.

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,083
Now, I want you to look
at your partner closely

4
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,041
and draw him, or her,
as well as you possibly can.

5
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,166
Damn, now why'd I have
to get stuck with you girls?

6
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,541
Thanks, appreciate that.

7
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,791
I guess we're the left-overs.

8
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,125
Hey, at least there's
no pressure this way.

9
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,833
I suppose, but
wouldn't you rather

10
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,291
be drawing a cute
guy or something?

11
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,458
Wow, this part of your
face is shaped really weird.

12
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,750
Uh. What are you talking about?

13
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,583
Which part?

14
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,875
Ha ha! Just kidding!

15
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,416
There. It's finished.

16
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,375
Hey, how's this for a cute guy?

17
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,458
You're supposed to draw me!

18
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,458
I can't believe this!

19
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,708
I have to sketch Karasuma!

20
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,916
H-Hi! Let's do our best!

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,875
Of course.

22
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,125
Good luck.

23
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,208
What is she doing?

24
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,750
Karasuma's gonna have
a hard time sketching her

25
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,625
if she keeps her face
covered up like that.

26
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,166
I can't!

27
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,750
If I have to keep staring
into his eyes, I'm gonna--

28
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,291
I'm gonna--

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,000
And she freaked.

30
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,541
What's the deal with her?

31
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,458
Heh, Karasuma shouldn't have
any trouble sketching her now!

32
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,541
Karasuma is looking at me.

33
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:25,666
Karasuma is looking at me.
Karasuma is looking at me.

34
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,000
Karasuma is looking at me.

35
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,958
Karasuma is looking at me.
Karasuma is looking at me.

36
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,583
Look! Look at me!

37
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,041
Look at me with all your heart!

38
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,041
Please look until
your heart's content!

39
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,875
I want you to look
at me forever and ever!

40
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,250
I can't believe it!

41
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,541
I woke up late this morning
and forgot to brush my hair!

42
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,708
Uh, Karasuma, please excuse me,

43
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,041
I uh-- I have to
go to the, uhhh--

44
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,458
Sure. Go ahead.

45
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,833
Oh, I knew it!

46
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,666
My head looks
like a tornado hit it!

47
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,541
Yakumo, why didn't
you wake me up!

48
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,041
Uh, I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

49
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,125
Don't worry.

50
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,833
It's bad for you
to try and hold it in.

51
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,000
You've got it all wrong
Karasuma, you dummy!

52
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,416
That's not it at all!

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,333
That's not why I went!
Don't you understand anything?

54
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,541
I did it all for you! I'd do
anything for you! That's why!

55
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,541
No, that's not true.

56
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,875
Really I'm being selfish.

57
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:27,000
It's just-- I wanted you
to think I was beautiful!

58
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,750
That's why.

59
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,750
No, I need to stop
thinking about it!

60
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,125
Just act normal. Focus.

61
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Oh my gosh!

62
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,958
When I tried to
draw him our eyes met!

63
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,083
I'm too nervous!
I can't do this!

64
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,250
I'm a wreck! What am I gonna do?

65
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,208
Oh! I know!

66
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,583
I'll try and look
really innocent,'

67
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,583
so he can't tell
what I'm thinking!

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,875
What's with that face?

69
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,000
It's really creepy.

70
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,791
Yeah. What's she on?

71
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,416
There, I'm finished!

72
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,750
This is terrible!

73
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,666
I just can't do this.
I'm too embarrassed!

74
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,916
You okay, Tenma?

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,125
Oh, Ms. Sasakura.

76
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,333
Don't worry about drawing
Karasama perfectly.

77
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,416
Try to draw him
from inside your heart.

78
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,416
The way you feel him.

79
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:29,125
Draw Karasuma the way
I see him inside my heart?

80
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:34,291
Of course! He's burned
into my memory.

81
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,708
I'll just close my eyes.

82
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:42,458
And draw him from my heart.
I see him perfectly!

83
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,500
Why did she close her eyes?

84
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,208
She's drawing from the heart.

85
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,750
Kay!

86
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
Everyone, it's time to
turn in what you have so far.

87
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,916
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,416
Tenma, how do you think
your drawing turned out?

89
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,916
Um, okay. I think.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,416
Can we see it?

91
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,791
Unbelievable.

92
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,375
Amazing!

93
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,083
Nicely done!

94
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,875
Well, why are you guys
acting so surprised?

95
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,208
'Cause this is unusual for you.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,416
But why does he
look like he's so mad?

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,458
Oh my gosh! No way!

98
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,333
Hey Eri, coming to lunch?

99
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:38,208
Karasuma, I'd love to see
how I look in your eyes!

100
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,916
I-- I wonder if I
look cute in his picture?

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,541
If I do then that
means he really likes me!

102
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,250
Well, that could be
wishful thinking on my part,

103
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,541
but still I can hope!

104
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:07,750
Oh, I want to see.
I have to see! Oh.

105
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,291
Just a quick peek!

106
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,458
I'm ugly!

107
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,291
Now a word from our sponsor.

108
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,416
Would you like to keep
yourself looking younger?

109
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,041
Start early with...

110
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,125
What should I do?

111
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,583
I need to get
Karasuma's attention!

112
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,750
If only I could come up

113
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,458
with a special way
to tell him how I feel!

114
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,125
Sleepy?

115
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,333
Do I look sleepy?

116
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,416
Isn't it ovbious I'm
in unbearable pain here?

117
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
Sorry.

118
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,500
I wanted to tell you that you're
favorite show's about to start.

119
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,458
Huh? It's on already?

120
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,208
What are these guys doing here?

121
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:27,208
I thought I told you.
No talking!

122
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,208
Too eager.

123
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,916
All right! You go boy!

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,291
Kick his butt,
Mangoku! Yeah! Wah!

125
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,291
A letter?

126
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,500
That's it!

127
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:54,500
Uh Tenma? What are
you so excited about?

128
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,208
It's my secret!

129
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,541
You didn't care
about my worries,

130
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,708
so I'm not gonna tell you!

131
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,791
Coming up next on "It's Your
Life", a beautiful reunion!

132
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,333
Listen, Sis?

133
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,250
Not that I really understand
what it is you're trying to do,

134
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,666
but are you sure
that's necessary?

135
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,833
I sense it!

136
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,916
Something is about
to change, I know it!

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,791
It's definite. Today my
love won't go unanswered.

138
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,416
What in the world
are you talking about?

139
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,708
Just wait and see, you'll
think I'm so brilliant!

140
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,750
Well, if you say so.

141
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,166
I'm off!

142
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,458
I'm a little worried.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,250
I need some coffee!

144
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,916
Man like me's gotta
keep on his toes!

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,791
Hey you punks!

146
00:09:52,875 --> 00:10:03,708
Don't forget the party tonight!

147
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,208
I--

148
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,625
I got--I got my coffee.

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,916
Boss!

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,833
Hey! Boss!

151
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,916
The only way to send
a love letter filled

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,125
with true passion is
to shoot it by arrow!

153
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,833
Thank you!

154
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,791
Dekedennn. Deke deke den.

155
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,291
What the--? What the hell?

156
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,166
What the hell was that?

157
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,625
Try again.

158
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,875
My last resort!

159
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,666
Trick shot!

160
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,625
I'll-- I'll get him this time!

161
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,625
Ah! Karasuma went into the bank!

162
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,791
He's stopped moving!
This is my chance!

163
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,250
Karasuma. Get ready!

164
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,041
Now I've got you!

165
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,125
A daring and
courageous young woman

166
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,500
thwarted a bank robbery with no
less than a bow and arrow today.

167
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,875
Incredible.

168
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,958
That's not what was
supposed to happen!

169
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,958
Why is it so hard
to tell him how I feel?

170
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,875
Why is it so hard
to tell her how I feel?

171
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,125
What's up?

172
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,000
You look spaced out.

173
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,791
What if she's talking about me?

174
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,875
That's right.

175
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,208
When you have a problem,
the ones you can

176
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,833
always count on for
advice are your girlfriends!

177
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,125
A slumber party? Sounds fun!

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,541
Hey! That tickles!

179
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,000
Tenma stop it!

180
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,791
Talk about overdoing it.

181
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,958
Now that's what I call a bath!

182
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,083
That felt great! I haven't
laughed so hard in ages!

183
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,333
I'm thirsty.

184
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,750
Surprise, surprise!
Here's some iced tea!

185
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,583
Cheers!

186
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,500
Ah, I needed that!

187
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,583
Wow, this iced
tea is simply delish!

188
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,291
Who says delish?

189
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,708
Excuse me. I've made
you some snacks.

190
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,333
Aww, Yakumo,
you're the greatest!

191
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,125
We're so hungry!

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,708
Thank you!

193
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,416
Oh no. Thank you for taking
such good care of my sister.

194
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,375
Please help yourselves.

195
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,291
Geez, I know I always say this,

196
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,000
but I wish I had a
little sister like her.

197
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,916
Damn, Tenma can eat.

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,541
Let's dig in!

199
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,583
This is nice!
I'm glad it's just us girls!

200
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,333
I agree, it's great to get away

201
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,958
from the guys
every once in a while.

202
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,333
Once in a while?

203
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,166
You spend that much time
around guys? I had no idea.

204
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,666
I know, especially
that fried stuff.

205
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,208
The tofu?

206
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,041
Ya! That was it!

207
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,375
Ya, that tofu, that was--

208
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,583
I should get the
recipe so I can have

209
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,916
my chef make it for me sometime.

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,625
Chef? Oh, that's right,
she's from a rich family.

211
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,916
I'll bet that makes her
really popular with the guys.

212
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,958
Yeah, I wonder what kind of
vinegar she used to pickle them.

213
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:09,333
Maybe I'll just
ask her nonchalantly...

214
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,000
Umm, Eri. Ahem.

215
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,750
She puts her heart and
soul into everything she makes.

216
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,750
Yeah, totally.

217
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,375
Ahem!

218
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,166
Um. By the way.

219
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,750
Um, Mikoto,
is there a boy you like?

220
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,125
What? Where the heck
did that come from?

221
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,916
You are so weird.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,791
Oh, come on.

223
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,041
Huh?

224
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,875
You're not trying very
hard to deny it, Mikoto,

225
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,125
so there must be a
little something to it, huh?

226
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:37,916
Huh? What do you mean?

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,458
Stop being so modest.

228
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,833
Three hopeless boys confessed
their love to you this year

229
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,916
and you turned all
of them down flat.

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,250
What? Who told you about that?

231
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,041
That is absolutely
none of your business!

232
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,125
But that's nothing compared

233
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,708
to the five boys
that want to date me!

234
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,500
Five?

235
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,125
Those two are so gullible.

236
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,041
Well Yakumo has eight!

237
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:01,708
So, if it's ok, I'd like to
ask you a question about that.

238
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,250
Um, if you were in love,

239
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,916
how would you tell
that person how you feel?

240
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,375
No no! It's not for me!
See-- ha ha! No!

241
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,083
It's for my friend's friend! Ha!

242
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,958
See, she's madly
in love with this guy,

243
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,583
and um, she has no
clue how to tell him!

244
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,166
So, I thought I'd ask you girls

245
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,208
and see if you had any
advice I could give her.

246
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,750
See, um, she's
in a real dilemma,

247
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,416
and I just thought
I could help her out.

248
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,041
She's so obvious.

249
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,250
Tell me about it.

250
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,333
I've never been
in that situation,

251
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,583
so I don't know. Sorry.

252
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,833
Neither have I.

253
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,833
Besides, I don't think
I'd ever tell anyone.

254
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:36,791
What? Oh. Really? I see.

255
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,583
Hey! What about you, Akira?

256
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,166
Do you have any good advice?

257
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,041
Well, I don't know if this would
work, but--

258
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,166
I've heard of this weird thing

259
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,583
called the
"Suspension Bridge Effect".

260
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,125
"Suspension Bridge Effect?"

261
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,750
Hey, have you
heard of this thing

262
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,583
called the
"Suspension Bridge Effect"?

263
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,083
It's supposed to really work!

264
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,125
Ya!

265
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,208
It's supposed to
be the ultimate way

266
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,125
to confess your
feelings for someone!

267
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,666
"Suspension Bridge Effect"?

268
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,375
What is it?

269
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,708
And, how does it work?

270
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,375
It's the phenomenon
where a person falls in love

271
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,916
while they're crossing
a suspension bridge.

272
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,333
When a person is
standing on the bridge,

273
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,375
his heart beats fast
because he's afraid of falling.

274
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,166
He then mistakenly thinks
his heart is beating fast

275
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,833
because he's in love with you.

276
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,166
I see, so the person is actually
nervous because of the bridge,

277
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,500
but you take advantage of that

278
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,583
and try to make him
think he's in love with you.

279
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,208
Um, I guess you
could put it that way.

280
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,083
Arr! Be careful, you might fall!

281
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,083
You're gonna fall!
Karasuma, I love you!

282
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,750
Would that really work?

283
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,250
Well, theoretically, yes.
But it's not proven.

284
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,708
C'mon, it's not hard to make
someone fall in love with you.

285
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,708
Really? But how? Tell me?

286
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,250
You just have to be cute.

287
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,541
But that won't work
for clumsy girls like me.

288
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,875
Don't be silly, darling.

289
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,250
That's the very reason
that God created fashion.

290
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,583
Doll yourself up,
even peacocks do it.

291
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,625
You could learn from them!

292
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,916
They also do it for protection.

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,166
And only males.

294
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,250
Look at the
peacocks, they do it.

295
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,416
Peacocks?

296
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,416
Peacocks, huh?

297
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,291
Karasuma, I love you!

298
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,708
Are you sure?

299
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,125
I know that look.

300
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,958
You're imagining weird things
again, aren't you Tenma?

301
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,583
You just don't get it, do you?

302
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,750
What are you talking about?

303
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,375
It's about what's in your heart.

304
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,875
It's what's inside that counts.

305
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,750
All you have to do is just
be yourself and be confident.

306
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,500
Mikoto.

307
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,625
I think you're absolutely right!

308
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,083
Thank you so much!
You're the best!

309
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,583
Huh?

310
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,250
I hate you, Mikoto.

311
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,666
What are you? A D-cup?

312
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,666
That's not fair!
Of course the guys love you!

313
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,708
You cheater!

314
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,125
What? Have you
gone totally psycho?

315
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,750
Great. Now I'm even more
discouraged than I was before.

316
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,291
I'm going to the bathroom.

317
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,916
Oh right, I should write down
some notes before I forget.

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,750
Now, if I can remember all the
advice that the girls gave me.

319
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,250
Somehow none of
this seems right.

320
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,500
This is ridiculous!

321
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,583
No one in their right mind
would any of these things!

322
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,166
It's stupid!

323
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,541
Oh my gosh! I'm really late!

324
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,541
Yakumo's gonna kill me!

325
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,250
That's right, there's a
short cut through the forest.

326
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,083
Maybe I should
take it this time.

327
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,958
What did Yakumo say?

328
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,583
Don't take that shortcut
through the forest, okay?

329
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,666
Why shouldn't I?

330
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,208
There's a pervert in there.

331
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,791
Oh, I thought it was because
of a bear or something.

332
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,375
Tenma, a pervert is
way more dangerous!

333
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,583
Please be careful!

334
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,083
That settles it then.
I'll be careful.

335
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,041
I won't go through the forest!

336
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,541
Oh, that's Karasuma.

337
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,041
Don't be afraid!
I'll protect you!

338
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,833
Karasuma! You're my hero!

339
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,916
That's how it's gonna happen!
That's how we'll fall in love!

340
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,791
Today's my lucky day!

341
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,416
Sweet Tenma.

342
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,791
Thank goodness I followed you.

343
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,250
Finally, my chance!

344
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,250
When Tenma is attacked,
I'll rescue her!

345
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,833
She'll be so grateful,
she'll fall in love with me!

346
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,416
Heh!

347
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,916
Unfortunately, I'm usually the
one people think's the pervert.

348
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,875
Ha ha ha! I know, not
to hard to imagine, right?

349
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,208
But not today! See--

350
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,250
My police officer
disguise is foolproof.

351
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,958
Alright, this is it.
Today's my lucky day.

352
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,750
Karasuma!

353
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,416
Oh no. I've lost sight of him.

354
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,083
What am I gonna do if
someone comes after me?

355
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,750
Look, if it isn't another
stupid high school girl.

356
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,416
Aww, too bad she's all alone.

357
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,250
She looks delicious.

358
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,958
Hurricane Kick!

359
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,416
Molesting high school
girls is a crime!

360
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,916
Are you all right?

361
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes sir. Thank goodness
you came in time.

362
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,375
I'm saved.

363
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,291
Oh my god! It worked!

364
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,333
She thinks I'm her hero and now
she's fallen in love with me!

365
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,583
Thank you, Mr. Police Officer!

366
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, crap! I can't
believe she's that stupid.

367
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,916
Yes, I look like a
police officer right now.

368
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,208
But surely, if I take my
hat off, she'll recognize me!

369
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,291
Excuse me.

370
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,791
I know I'm a perfect stranger,
but you saved me anyway!

371
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,333
I'll always be
grateful for that!

372
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,375
You're very noble.

373
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,375
Just doing my duty.

374
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,583
I must be on my way now.

375
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,500
Please be more careful in
the future, Miss Tsukamoto.

376
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,541
I will.

377
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,208
Thank you very
much Mr. Policeman.

378
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:10,375
I wonder how he knew
my name? Oh well!

379
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,250
Imagine a thug like me
going on a school field trip.

380
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,750
All for the sake of love!

381
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,958
But why am I playing
cards with this guy?

382
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,500
Next time on School Rumble:
"Pigs Go Oink!

383
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,416
Cats Go Meow! Frogs and
Water Imps Go Ribbit!"

384
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,208
And no one knows
what they're thinking!
