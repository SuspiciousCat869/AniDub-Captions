1
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,041
I've been pretending to be a
member of Harima's gang,

2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:26,000
waiting for just the right
opening, and now I've found it!

3
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,791
For some weird reason,
this year he suddenly got soft!

4
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:38,166
Now's my chance to defeat
him so I can rule this school!

5
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,500
Uh oh ...

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,750
Whiskers, got lead?

7
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:43,625
Hmm?

8
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,625
Sorry to bother you again!

9
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,833
This is point 5.

10
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,750
Don't you have any point 7?

11
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,583
You're so useless!

12
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,166
Here.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,583
Thanks Harima!

14
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,208
Yeah. You're welcome.

15
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,041
Hey, do you have a problem?

16
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,125
Nope.

17
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,375
Come on, out with it.

18
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,333
Act like a man and speak up.

19
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,250
Really, there's no problem.

20
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,250
The nerve.

21
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,708
He's even getting friendly
with Eri, the girl that I like.

22
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,041
Damn it.

23
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,250
But the bastard definitely
has his guard down.

24
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,041
Let's go!

25
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:26,791
I'll disrespect his ass

26
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,083
by calling him a dog
in front of everyone.

27
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,958
That'll show him who's boss!

28
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:36,666
You... You...

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,166
You, Yo, What up, dog?

30
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,750
How's the search
for the new bike going?

31
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,875
Good.

32
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,416
This one's pretty cool.

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,541
What the--?

34
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,833
All right!

35
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,041
I'm finally in good with Harima!

36
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:51,333
I've made the first crucial
step in my rise to the top!

37
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,625
And I've done it
in front of Eri too.

38
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,958
I am so totally cool!

39
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,208
Let's go see Akira.

40
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,916
Okay.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,041
Did you have the Banana
Rice Cake today at lunch?

42
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,375
No. Was it good?

43
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,416
Hey, dog, what do
you say you and me

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,291
have a little man to
man talk, huh, Harima?

45
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,541
Yo, Tenma baby,
I'm borrowing your seat.

46
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,125
Call her baby again,
and you'll end up dead!

47
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:22,625
Uh-oh! I forgot something!

48
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,791
Nice chattin' with ya.

49
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,458
Am I ever gonna get to the top?

50
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,875
Welcome to Was Burger!

51
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,666
Okay, that's one Was Meal.

52
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,041
Coming right up!

53
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,583
Order in! One WAS meal, please!

54
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,083
How come there's such
a big line at that register

55
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,125
and the other one's
completely empty.

56
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,083
That's very weird.

57
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,416
Well, I guess it's my lucky day.

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,958
Let me see.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,416
Whoa. Scary.

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,250
What's she so mad about?

61
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,375
What do you want?

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,625
How 'bout a smile?

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,291
A smile is free, right?

64
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,291
Come on, just gimme
a smile, pretty please?

65
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,291
She's gonna kill'im!

66
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,750
Lara! What are you doing!

67
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,458
I'm so sorry!
Just a moment, please.

68
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,833
Lara, stop! He's a customer!

69
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,250
Karen, now would be
a good time to help.

70
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,791
Please! Break it up!

71
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,416
My bones are breaking!

72
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,583
Look at her.

73
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,208
I've never seen
her so worked up.

74
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,916
I'm sure she's still
upset over losing

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,291
to Karen at the Athletic Meet.

76
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,291
Your fries are
getting cold, partner.

77
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,541
Don't call me that.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,458
You think she might
move back to Mexico?

79
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,250
Lara? Here's your usual.

80
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,166
Left over hamburgers.

81
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,458
Hey, why don't you try
to smile a little bit tomorrow.

82
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,583
Don't let Karen out do you, now!

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,708
Um, please cheer up Lara.

84
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,333
You can't be good
at everything you try.

85
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,375
I think it might be good if
you smiled a little bit, though.

86
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,958
Give it a try.

87
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,666
Karen!

88
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,583
Kosuke! What's up?

89
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,750
Ah, I just came
to walk you home!

90
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,291
Oh! That was sweet.

91
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,666
But we gotta hurry it up
or we're gona miss Dozibiron.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,416
Hey! I know you!

93
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,250
You're the evil empress
from Dozibiron, aren't you!

94
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,583
Kosuke!

95
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,375
You're goin' down!

96
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,833
Hey! Put me down!

97
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,208
Lara! I'm sorry!

98
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,041
See ya 'round!

99
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,958
A... Adios...

100
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,500
...familia.

101
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,875
What do you want?

102
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,666
You want this?

103
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,666
Is it good?

104
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,916
Then, eat up!

105
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,208
You must be alone, too.

106
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,833
Ay perrito! That tickles!

107
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,000
Welcome to WAS Burger!

108
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,458
Smile!

109
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,208
You're back. What do you want?

110
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,750
I want to see you
smile like yesterday.

111
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,125
Karen, please save me!

112
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,416
Please! Not again, Lara!

113
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,625
Imadori! Are you okay?!

114
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,083
She seems happier now.

115
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,750
Her punches are
livelier than yesterday.

116
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,250
Looks like our job here is done.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,458
Break it up!

118
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,208
The time is ten
thousand years ago,

119
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,250
in the primitive ages of man.

120
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,916
It is uncertain whether or not
this is an accurate depiction

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,750
of early civilization, but we
do know that our species owes

122
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,791
its development to
the events of this era.

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,375
You roll the rope around like
this, and you get a pattern.

124
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,041
How pretty! You're so talented!

125
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,291
These will be really popular!

126
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,375
Hey, What are you doing?

127
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,791
I'm drawing pictures
on these leaves.

128
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,250
Oh awesome!

129
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,916
I invented it. I call it Anime.

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,708
That is amazing!

131
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,833
How cool!

132
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:06,541
Aww!

133
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,041
I'm so freakin' hungry!

134
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,083
Don't say that.
You're making me hungry!

135
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,541
That's just the way it is.

136
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,833
It's too bad, but our food
sources were low this year.

137
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,250
We can't take much more of this.

138
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,291
At this rate,
we'll starve to death.

139
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,416
Big Trouble! It's Hanai!

140
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,958
This is terrible.

141
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,750
He was loud and bossy,
but this isn't right.

142
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,958
Umm gotta huc. Honey but umga.

143
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,583
Fire!

144
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,875
Fire!

145
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:58,541
It's hot!

146
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,125
Is he alive?! Holy crap!

147
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,125
Who pronounced him
dead in the first place?

148
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,791
Ooh! Hot! Eeee! Ow! Hot! So hot!

149
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,291
Oh. He's alive after all.

150
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,833
Someone get some water!

151
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,416
What the hell happened
out there, Hanai?

152
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,125
What happened?

153
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,083
I went to the forest
in search of food.

154
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,958
I found some fruit and
climbed a tree to pick it.

155
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,208
It was the most
gigantic mammoth.

156
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,375
Gigantic mammoth?

157
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,000
Devil Tusk.

158
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,250
A creature of ancient times,

159
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,916
feared by the people
of Yagami Village.

160
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,791
Looks like we have a crisis.

161
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,291
Devil Tusk, huh?

162
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,750
Someone has seen this monster?

163
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,625
Yes.

164
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,791
There's no mistake, my queen.

165
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,541
Well, then there's no choice.

166
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,333
Our village is almost
on the brink of starvation.

167
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,583
My people, listen to me!

168
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,000
We will defeat this monster!

169
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,625
Yeah!

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,916
Awesome. I'm drawing well today.

171
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,916
This black stone I
found in the mountains

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,916
is really good and hard.

173
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,166
The tone here should be...

174
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,250
Wait, what's a tone?

175
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,500
Oh Tenma.

176
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,583
I really love you, baby.

177
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,916
People of Yagami!

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,458
Our number one problem
is the mammoth's hide.

179
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,083
It's so tough that our
stone weapons can't pierce it.

180
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,416
Our only option is
to abandon this land.

181
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,375
Ladies and gentlemen, follow me!

182
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,750
I will lead you!

183
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,583
I'll pass.

184
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,041
I'm not leaving my home.

185
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,291
I love these rivers
and mountains.

186
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,333
Bastard.

187
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,791
What if we just used harder
stones for our weapons.

188
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,916
We don't have any stones that
could possibly be hard enough.

189
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,875
My stomach's eating itself!

190
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,916
Hungry.

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,083
Tenma!

192
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,250
She's so weak from
hunger, she can't move!

193
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,916
My darling!

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Feed me, Harima! Feed me!

195
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,625
I'm on it baby!

196
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,833
Um, excuse me.

197
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,125
Huh?

198
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,458
Oh, Harima!

199
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,833
What the heck are you
doing back in our village?

200
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:28,916
You were banished.

201
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,375
Don't you remember?

202
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,833
You were so violent
and stupid and all,

203
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,875
that the queen ordered
you banished forever!

204
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,000
This is it!

205
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Everyone! Listen up!

206
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,625
Harima!

207
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,916
This new black stone
I found is harder

208
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,666
than anystone we've
ever seen or used before.

209
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,791
If we make our weapons
from this stone,

210
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,250
we'll finally be able
to defeat Devil Tusk!

211
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
What's this guy talking about?

212
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,291
What are we supposed
to do with this stone?

213
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,250
If we could kill
Devil Tusk by stoning him,

214
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,750
we wouldn't be in this mess!

215
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,083
Hey, guys, you wanna
roast some sweet potatoes?

216
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,791
You know, Harima
may have a good idea.

217
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,666
Ah! The Wise Women!

218
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,958
We will use that black stone
to make our weapons stronger.

219
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,208
I think it just might work.

220
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,875
Yes! Let's do it!

221
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,791
Yeah!!

222
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,250
Great idea Harima!

223
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,666
Aw, come on,
it's really no big deal.

224
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,958
I'm Awesome!!

225
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,958
Let's go!

226
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,666
All right!

227
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,125
I'm going to kill that beast
and win Tenma's love!

228
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,375
Harima, bring us back
something good for dinner, 'kay?

229
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,125
I will!

230
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:06,958
Leave it to me.

231
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,541
Make us proud, Papa!

232
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,625
Now make us proud!

233
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,958
I promise.

234
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,500
I'll do it for you!

235
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,083
Future children!

236
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,166
To think that so many young men

237
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,666
are willing to risk
their lives for this village!

238
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,708
It must be because
I'm awesomely beautiful!

239
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,708
There is nothing
to fear, my good men!

240
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,000
Just follow me, Haruki Hanai,
and I will lead you safely!

241
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,666
So, um, did you
finish that anime yet?

242
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,416
For my family.

243
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,125
Bring it.

244
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,875
He's coming now!

245
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,916
Men! Charge!

246
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,625
Now fight with the
weapons I gave you!

247
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,375
Yeah!

248
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,583
Damn these weapons!

249
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,541
I told them to follow me,
but they were like, "No, Hanai!"

250
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,416
Don't you dare give up yet!

251
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,291
Amazing!

252
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,833
He actually pierced
Devil Tusks thick hide!

253
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,833
Way to go! Harima!

254
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,166
I did it!

255
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,333
Now Tenma's heart will be mine!

256
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,083
Ichijou, it's time!

257
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,166
Okay!

258
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,750
Wow! Karen and Lara
brought down Devil Tusk!

259
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,833
Now men!

260
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,750
Let's finish this
once and for all!

261
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,291
Yeah!

262
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,250
Boy, this meat sure is good!

263
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,166
Mm-hmm

264
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,083
Man, thank goodness.

265
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,250
That sure ended well.

266
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,166
Now we can last
through the winter!

267
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,708
And we owe it all to two
brave women--Karen and Lara!

268
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,916
Hey!

269
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,250
Let's thank the brave
women who saved us!

270
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,416
Yay for Karen and Lara!!

271
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,625
Hey, I helped too.

272
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,166
Aww.

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,583
Too bad, I guess
I'm just a thug, after all.

274
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,250
Oh well, at least Tenma
has a full belly now!

275
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,666
Knock knock.

276
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,250
Oh! Hey Tenma!

277
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,458
Harima, you were amazing!

278
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,125
Here!

279
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,625
This is just for you!

280
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,333
I don't know what to say.

281
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,916
Come and join us!

282
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,583
There's lots more left!

283
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,208
Oh, right!

284
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,416
I must record this!

285
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,833
A masterpiece.

286
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,375
When we work together,
there's nothing we can't do.

287
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,000
Because we're such good friends!

288
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,750
I have a feeling that in
our next life somewhere,

289
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,166
we'll all be classmates.

290
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,583
What's a classmate?

291
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,750
Heck if I know.

292
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:11,000
This ancient cave drawing dates
back to the prehistoric period.

293
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,000
It's called the
"Smile of Venus."

294
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,333
I think it kind of
looks like you, Tenma.

295
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,625
What? No way!

296
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,500
Captain!

297
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,250
I'm gonna do this.

298
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,625
You'll see.

299
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,583
Did you say something?

300
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,125
Uh, no. I'm sorry.

301
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,083
Would you hand me that
French Curve other there?

302
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,625
Oh. Of course.

303
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,333
Here you are.

304
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,750
Thanks, Yakumo.

305
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,708
I-I'm sorry.
The thunder scared me.

306
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,291
No, don't apologize.
I'll get it.

307
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,166
Uh, thank you again.

308
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,625
Oh it's--it's okay I don't mind.

309
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,041
Man! Great time
for a blackout, huh?

310
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,750
Candles, I need candles.

311
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,625
This is a really bad storm.

312
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,041
Damn!

313
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,291
Even touching a girl's hand
by accident makes me nervous.

314
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,458
Heh. If I touched
Tenma's hand right now,

315
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,625
I'd probably die
of a heart attack.

316
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,583
It's so quiet.

317
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,458
Should I turn on the radio?

318
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,083
Is this big bad storm
scaring anybody?

319
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,416
D.J. Yoshimo here,
and I'm diggin' it!

320
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,250
Come on guys!

321
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,416
Make the best of it!

322
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,083
It's a perfect time
to find a cute girl

323
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,375
and cuddle up with her!

324
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,583
You just listen to me now,

325
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,541
and I'll tell you how
to put the moves on!

326
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,500
I think I work better
when it's quiet.

327
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,208
Oh. I'm sorry!

328
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,583
Did you want to listen to it?

329
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,500
N-no!

330
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,791
Hey, I want you to know
that I appreciate you

331
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,250
helping me like this.

332
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,541
I mean it's so late.

333
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,500
No I-I like helping you,

334
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,833
and I'm anxious to see your
work as soon as it's finished.

335
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,083
Woah. Wait a minute!

336
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:21,750
What?

337
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,416
Stay right there.

338
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,833
Just like that.

339
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,416
I see!

340
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,916
It's the lighting!

341
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,333
I get it now.

342
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,583
This is how it's
supposed to look.

343
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,000
You see there's a really
important scene in the comic

344
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,041
where the hero and the heroine

345
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,125
are making a
campfire in this cave.

346
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,541
And for some reason
I couldn't picture it right.

347
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,083
That is, until I saw the
way that light hit your face.

348
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,416
I can't thank you enough.

349
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,250
I know! While
I'm thinking about it,

350
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,416
would you mind reading
some lines from this scene?

351
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,458
I think it'll help
me see it better!

352
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,958
Sure.

353
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,125
Finally, we're totally alone
on this deserted island.

354
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,166
That's it!

355
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,625
That's the feeling!

356
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:02,583
Yeah, yeah!

357
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,875
This is really helping me.

358
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,208
You're a good
little actress, there...

359
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,750
I-I am?

360
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,875
Do you think you could
read some more for me?

361
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,083
Uh. Oh, Sure.

362
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,083
I'm really glad that
it's just the two of us.

363
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,375
Uh huh! Uh huh!

364
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,708
That's really good.

365
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,125
Read the next line.

366
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,958
But, how are we
going to survive here?

367
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,166
Don't worry!

368
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,208
You're safe with me!

369
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,875
I will always protect you!

370
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,583
Ha-Harima?!

371
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,500
Uh, should I keep
on reading this?

372
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,416
I mean, the next line is...

373
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,416
I... love you.

374
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,125
All right! And, I love you too!

375
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,791
I promise you.
I will make you very happy!

376
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,250
Harima I- I think-

377
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,791
We will start the
perfect family together.

378
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,125
He's not even...

379
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,666
Harima.

380
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,458
Tenma.

381
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,708
He's so quiet all of a sudden.

382
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,875
Did I do something wrong?

383
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,125
Oh! I see!

384
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,583
Uh, hey, What's wrong?

385
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,791
Uh, nothing.

386
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,458
Sorry, I got a little
carried away there.

387
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,500
Come on, let's keep working.

388
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,416
Was I imagining things?

389
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,416
Do you really hate men?

390
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,125
Or, do you like them?

391
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,250
It's the Culture Festival!

392
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,708
And our class is
still arguing over

393
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,958
putting up a food stand
or doing a show!

394
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:29,625
Hey, wait a minute.

395
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:30,958
I already read this!

396
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,541
Tenma, this time it's for real.

397
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,041
School Rumble -
Second Semester is coming soon!
