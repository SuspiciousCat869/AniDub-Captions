1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,708
Sit tight!

2
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,166
That dizzy romantic
comedy "School Rumble"

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,708
is about to start!

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:42,166
So, Harima, now we'll
settle this once and for all.

5
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,958
Let's get him!

6
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,083
Even in the worst situations.

7
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,208
When a man's in love.

8
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,166
He can't afford
to lose his pride.

9
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,208
You bastard!

10
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,416
Bring it on, losers.

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,583
You can't beat me
because I'm in love.

12
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,750
And it's all for you, Tenma

13
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,416
Harima comes to school
every day now, doesn't he?

14
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,666
Maybe he's planning
some sort of bomb threat.

15
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,000
Tenma!

16
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,875
You took off without your lunch.

17
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,708
Oh! Silly me. Thanks, Sis!

18
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:00,541
Listen.

19
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,708
Hm?

20
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,833
Are you okay sitting there?
Is it safe?

21
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,041
Say what?

22
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,166
He's got kind of a weird vibe.

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,541
Huh?

24
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,750
Harima!

25
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,541
Look! Your desk
is crushing your bag!

26
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,625
You poor helpless little bag!

27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,208
Everything I do is for you.

28
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,166
I never gave a
damn about school.

29
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,333
I came and went as I pleased.

30
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,541
But you turned it into a
paradise I can't live without!

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,791
Pretty hysterical.

32
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,083
The toughest punk in town,
and I show up on time,

33
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:45,125
every day, stay all day and
then stick around for clean up!

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,916
What a joke! On me! You get it?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,333
Okay, that's just weird.

36
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,000
Yep. No doubt about it.

37
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,875
He's planning something evil.

38
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:43,666
Right, time to check out the old
language skills with a pop quiz!

39
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,625
Just fill in the blanks, people!

40
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,291
Okay. And start!

41
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,208
Too many letters. Brain hurting.

42
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,125
School is hard.

43
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh, well. It's worth
it to be near Tenma.

44
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,750
I should just enjoy
this moment of bliss.

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,458
But wait! Her name!
She forgot to write in her name!

46
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,833
Is she crazy?

47
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,250
If she forgets to
write her name in,

48
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,666
she'll get an automatic zero!

49
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,708
If she gets an
automatic zero she'll fail!

50
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,416
Oh my god!

51
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,708
She's gonna fail!
Tenma's gonna fail!

52
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,666
Ten--!

53
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,666
I can't warn her out loud!

54
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,333
We're in the middle of a test!

55
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,666
What should I do?

56
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,208
Think Harima think.

57
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,916
Time to be a hero
and save the girl.

58
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,250
I've got it! I'll try
mouthing the words!

59
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,291
Aw crap! That didn't work!

60
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,166
This is tougher than
I thought. Okay then.

61
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,416
Dammit.

62
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,583
So far I'm dead in the water.

63
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,708
Come on, Harima, you gotta
come up with a better idea!

64
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,833
There's gotta be
another way to warn her!

65
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,000
Heroes always have a plan B.

66
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,416
Oh, well. I hate
to be so obvious,

67
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,791
but I guess I'll have
to take the direct route.

68
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,125
Holy crap!

69
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,333
I completely forgot
to write my name!

70
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,291
Even if I'd managed
to get every answer correct,

71
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,958
I would've failed!

72
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,458
Better be more careful, Harima!

73
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,000
Everyone's laughing at me.

74
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,708
Still, anything for Tenma!

75
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,041
She's laughing at me, too?

76
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,458
But I was talking about her!

77
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,791
Hasn't she ever
heard of learning

78
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,250
from other people's mistakes?

79
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,666
And why does she
have to be so cute?

80
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,583
Oh dear!

81
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,250
Screw you.

82
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,083
Sorry.

83
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,041
I can't give up yet.

84
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,750
There! It's perfect!

85
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,666
Wow, I got the answer to
number seven, the last question.

86
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,583
Man, this test is so easy,
I can't believe it!

87
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,625
Here we go!

88
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,833
Did she get it?

89
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,750
No, no, no!

90
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,750
How does this happen?

91
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,791
This girl is just too stupid!

92
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,583
And I know stupid!

93
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,875
Dammit!

94
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,708
What haven't I tried?

95
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,583
Amazing.

96
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,333
Harima really seems to be
concentrating on this test!

97
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,625
It's like he's actually
trying or something!

98
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,833
Hold on!

99
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,500
What if I wrote Tenma's
name on my paper,

100
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,583
so that her no-name paper
would be mistaken for mine?

101
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,541
Yes.

102
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,750
What's this?

103
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,958
Sir, this paper
has my name on it

104
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,541
but this isn't my handwriting!

105
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,750
What?

106
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,416
Strange.

107
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Huh?

108
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,208
Harima turned in
a paper with no name.

109
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,541
Did Harima do
this to protect me?

110
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,500
What a sweetie!

111
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,541
It was you, wasn't it?

112
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,416
I just can't turn my back
on someone who needs help.

113
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,208
Oh, Harima.

114
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,958
I love you!

115
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,625
Ditto.

116
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,291
What's up with him?

117
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,916
It'll work!

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,125
Tenma, I'm doing this for the
sake of our future happiness!

119
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,375
Here are your test
papers from yesterday.

120
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,541
Tenma, I'm afraid
you got a zero.

121
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,125
What the--?

122
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,458
I'm sorry, Tenma!

123
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,416
I'm so sorry! Please forgive me.

124
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,416
I'm just so stupid!

125
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,708
What do you think?

126
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,291
Shall we hit the
coffee shop, or the mall?

127
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,875
I don't care.

128
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,541
Uh! I can't.

129
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,833
There's a sale at
the supermarket today

130
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:23,791
and I have to go.

131
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,916
I gotta do the dinner shopping.

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,583
Let's see,
what sounds good tonight?

133
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,166
Whoa!

134
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,916
Are trying to tell me that you
do the cooking at your house?

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Come on!

136
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,416
Huh? Yeah, well that is I--

137
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,958
I thought Yakumo
did all the cooking.

138
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,208
You're right, she does.

139
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,583
I knew it!

140
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,916
I always thought Tenma
looked like the spoiled one.

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,666
What? Really?

142
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,625
Karasuma!

143
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,583
Wait, why did I hide
from him just now?

144
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:01,083
I guess I was embarrassed
to let the boy I love

145
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,041
see me coming out
of the girls' bathroom!

146
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,291
Oh, great!

147
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,750
Now that I've thought
of it, I can't go out!

148
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,083
I'm such a moron!

149
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,625
It's just the girls'
bathroom but I pee in here!

150
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,125
What'll I do?

151
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,541
Okay, I really
need to get out now.

152
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,958
Still there.

153
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,625
Come on!

154
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,041
Why is he being such an idiot?

155
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,875
Why would anyone
stand around talking for

156
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,833
so long in front of
the girls' bathroom?

157
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,875
But that's why I love the guy!

158
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,541
Ah! No!

159
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,833
This is no time to
be blinded by love!

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,916
Still at it.

161
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,583
Okay, now it's a
matter of endurance!

162
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,375
I'll show him what a
woman's will power can do!

163
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,291
Love isn't for wimps!

164
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,250
I'm being tested!

165
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,875
No problem! I can handle it!

166
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,541
Besides, he can't talk longer
than ten minutes! Heh, heh!

167
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,500
It oughta be safe by now.

168
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,375
Oh, man, is it ever good
to see daylight again!

169
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,333
I don't believe it,
he's reading a novel?

170
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,375
Plan number two!

171
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,916
Where the heck did she go?

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,250
Hey, Tenma? You still in here?

173
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,375
Okay, it doesn't matter, just as
long as he doesn't recognize me.

174
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,291
What are you doing now?

175
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,083
Ha! You're just in time!

176
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,208
Quick, who am I?

177
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,083
Uh.

178
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,208
Yeah, Tenma?
I'll be going home now.

179
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,958
Huh? Hang on!

180
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,625
How'd you know it was me?

181
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,833
Wow, little too much for me.

182
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,666
Plan number three!

183
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,083
I'll use this to
distract Karasuma

184
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,208
and then make my escape!

185
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,750
One. Two.

186
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,541
Go!

187
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,916
Okay, who's the wise guy?

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,375
Huh? You gotta lotta nerve,
sneaking up on me!

189
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,250
Who did it? Was it you?
Was it? Spit it out!

190
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,250
Come on, if I have to,
I can destroy all of you!

191
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,791
Sorry about that, Harima!

192
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll apologize to him later.

193
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,958
There's nothing left I can
use and I'm all out of plans!

194
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,208
I'm gonna spend the rest of
my life in the girls' bathroom!

195
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,708
Huh? It's stuck!

196
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,791
Wait a sec.

197
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,250
Ready on the left!

198
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,375
Ready on the right!

199
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,958
All systems go!

200
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,208
30 meters, slow descent, begin!

201
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,250
I'm not giving up!

202
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,250
There's no way.

203
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,583
I'm gonna let Karasuma see me
leaving the girls' bathroom!

204
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,416
It's a matter of pride!

205
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,958
I finally made it at last!

206
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,041
You okay?

207
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,708
Yeah, fine. Huh?

208
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,166
Well, just be careful.

209
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,958
You're lucky
you didn't get hurt.

210
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,416
Come on, Sis.

211
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,750
I told you before, I'm not mad
at you for missing the sale

212
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,041
at the supermarket today, okay?

213
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,083
No! No!

214
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,333
That's not the problem!

215
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,208
Oh, please. I beg you!

216
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,791
I hope you'll be kind.

217
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,083
I haven't done this
for a long time.

218
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,416
Sis?

219
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,333
Is there somebody
in there with you?

220
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,666
No, no, no, it's nothing.

221
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,750
I mean nobody.

222
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,916
I was just talking to--

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,625
To what?

224
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,291
You mean you were
talking to the scale?

225
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,833
Oh right.

226
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,250
The school physical's tomorrow!

227
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,125
How can you be so calm?

228
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,416
You're lucky you're so skinny!

229
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,333
Life is hard for us
full-figured girls!

230
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,291
Now get out! I wanna be alone!

231
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,958
You fiend!

232
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,125
Do your worst!

233
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,708
You shall never beat me!

234
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,083
I don't wanna be unsympathetic,

235
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,708
but I don't think
you can blame the scale.

236
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,875
Okay, girl, do it!

237
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,958
I hope we can be friends.

238
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,750
It's a nightmare.

239
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,875
I've got to wake up, that's all.

240
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,458
Get off the floor
before you catch cold.

241
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,708
I skipped breakfast today!

242
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,083
I haven't eaten for three days!

243
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,416
I think I dropped a dress size!

244
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,583
You're gonna collapse!

245
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,583
After the weigh-in,
I'll stuff myself!

246
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,208
All that for only
one dress size!

247
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,625
It just isn't fair!

248
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,083
Okay, let me guess!

249
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,500
The look on your face
says you've gained weight.

250
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,958
Am I right?

251
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,333
Score one!

252
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,625
Oh, just ignore her.

253
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,708
You weigh about the
same as me, don't you?

254
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,416
So don't even worry about it!

255
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,541
Thank you!

256
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,625
On the other hand,

257
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,916
she's got a much
bigger bust than you do.

258
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,541
Let's see.

259
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,958
A. No, no, B, definitely.

260
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,375
And this one. A, I think.

261
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,916
Imadori!

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Hey.

263
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,500
Are you trying to
guess blood types?

264
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,250
Bra sizes my friend!

265
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,250
Yeah, I can tell at a glance.

266
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,125
It's a gift.

267
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't even need to measure,

268
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,708
though I could if I wanted to.

269
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,000
Smile for me!

270
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,416
That's it, baby,
give me more of that!

271
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,750
Ah, that's the ticket!

272
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,041
Work it, girl, work it!

273
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,250
The camera loves you!

274
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,125
Okay, I know I probably
shouldn't ask this,

275
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,458
but what are you doing?

276
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,250
I'm taking early graduation
pictures, of course,

277
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,583
what does it look like?

278
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,666
And I guess you don't think
that's asking for trouble?

279
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,875
Fuyuki!

280
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,791
I'd like to order a
complete set, please!

281
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,416
Are you guys nuts?

282
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,916
You're just begging for it!

283
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,541
Hey!

284
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,375
Gimme that!

285
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,416
Give it back, Hanai!

286
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
That's my dad's camera!

287
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,000
Sorry, but as
class rep, it's my duty

288
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,625
to confiscate camera equipment
used for immoral purposes!

289
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,916
You cannot deny
the awesome power

290
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,208
of their chocolate brownie!

291
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,458
I'm not arguing.

292
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,916
I'm just saying I like
their truffles better.

293
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,916
Word, yo.

294
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,958
Which makes it
two to one. I win.

295
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,625
Karasuma's gonna have his height
and weight measured today, too.

296
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,125
I wonder.

297
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,791
He must be about
a hundred seventy one.

298
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,333
No! A hundred
seventy two centimeters.

299
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:42,125
Weight. He looks light.
Limber, too. Hmph!

300
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,291
I'm no good at
guessing a boy's weight!

301
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,916
Oh no! Now I've done it!

302
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,708
I can't stand it!

303
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,041
It's gonna drive me crazy!

304
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,833
I gotta know! I gotta
know everything about him!

305
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,583
I gotta know his height,
weight, shoe size,

306
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,916
collar, sleeve length,

307
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,625
waist, hips, inseam,
glove size, hat size, chest!

308
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,083
His chest.

309
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,250
It's probably bigger than mine.

310
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,583
Hey, is it just me or
has anybody else noticed

311
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,083
that the boys are a little
more out of control than usual?

312
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,750
Oh, they're just getting
all hot and bothered

313
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,250
thinking about
today's physical exam!

314
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,125
I'm sorry!

315
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,333
Please forgive me!

316
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,000
Sure thing, what are
we forgiving you for?

317
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,250
You know, Tenma,
no one else has a knack

318
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,666
for killing a conversation
quite like you do.

319
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,416
Come on, Eri, you gotta
be used to it by now.

320
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Enjoy the drama.

321
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,125
Yeah, so back to the boys.

322
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,125
Isn't it pathetic the
way they're wrapped up

323
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,166
in their lewd little fantasies?

324
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,541
I mean, if they're
that desperate

325
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,208
to satisfy their curiosity,

326
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,833
then they should
just become doctors!

327
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,791
Wow, so much for being PC!

328
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,833
That's right. Boys can
be doctors or nurses.

329
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,916
Oh, come on, you two,
it was just a "for instance",

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,125
I wasn't making
a political statement!

331
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,458
Become a doctor or a nurse?

332
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,458
Yes! I'll become a nurse!

333
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,250
Maybe I'm overreacting,

334
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,666
but doesn't that strike you as
an abrupt career decision?

335
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,500
Yeah, well, consider the source.

336
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,875
Oh, gosh, I think she's
really serious this time.

337
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,250
No, no, I'm not talking
about my future job!

338
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:00,916
Huh?

339
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,708
You sure about that?

340
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,791
I'll see you all later,
girls. So long!

341
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,458
Oh, man, I thought
she was serious.

342
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,750
Don't relax, I sense
a zany plan coming on.

343
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,125
There's just no
telling with her.

344
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,833
There! Talk about
the perfect disguise!

345
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,083
That idiot! Her hair
is a dead giveaway!

346
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,500
At least she didn't put
on a nose and glasses!

347
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,416
I don't get it.

348
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,458
What can she possibly be after?

349
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,000
This is kinda fun.

350
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,166
I don't think I've had to wear a
name tag since grade school!

351
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,125
You have to give her credit,

352
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,125
she can have fun doing anything.

353
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,625
I'll bet you ten to
one she's filling out

354
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,250
that card with her own name!

355
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,083
Gosh, what do you
think we should do?

356
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,166
Nothing, of course!

357
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,583
Huh?

358
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,750
Come on, don't you wanna
watch and see what happens next?

359
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,083
I agree, it's probably better

360
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,250
if we don't
interfere at this point.

361
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,833
So far, so good.

362
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,125
Soon, Oji Karasuma's
vital statistics--

363
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,833
--will be all mine!

364
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,208
Sorry if I kept you waiting!

365
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,791
I'm looking forward to
working with you, doctor!

366
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,666
No problem, I was
running late myself.

367
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,041
I'm subbing for
the regular doctor.

368
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,625
Let me introduce myself.

369
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,375
I'm young Doctor Harima.

370
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,750
Nice to meet you.

371
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,000
Attention please, students.

372
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,375
The physical
examinations scheduled

373
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,916
for today have been cancelled.

374
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,208
Once again.

375
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,375
The physical examinations
scheduled for today

376
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,750
have been cancelled.

377
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,125
They will be re-scheduled
at a later time.

378
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,166
Oh, it's so hard
to say I love you!

379
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,166
It's easier to bend
spoons with your mind! I know!

380
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,416
I'll have a sleepover
and invite my friends

381
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,375
to share stories about
their love troubles!

382
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,541
Next time on School Rumble:
"See and Sketch!

383
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,125
Letter on an Arrow!
Pajama Party Confessions!"

384
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,458
Mikoto, your breasts are so big!
