1
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,250
Growing up in my hometown,

2
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,875
I was always the kid
that got picked on.

3
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,458
We used to take turns
whispering to each other

4
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,416
about the girls we liked,
but when it came to me...

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,083
Hey, listen up!

6
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,250
Yoshidayama...

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,541
Has a huge crush on Aikawa!

8
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,250
Yoshidayama!

9
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,125
You're getting detention!

10
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,041
What the heck does
he think he's doing?

11
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,250
Poor guy.

12
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,541
Loser!!

13
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,750
We'd all planned to
skip class that day,

14
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,750
but for some reason, everyone
went back without telling me.

15
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,333
There's no way I could
have taken another year

16
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,083
in that hell of a middle school.

17
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:06,375
So I studied hard, and got
accepted to this high school.

18
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:10,958
Watch it, punk!

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,750
Oh, excuse me.

20
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:13,916
Yeah!

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,125
Here, I can be the big dog!

22
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,750
That's what I thought anyway.

23
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,833
But just my luck--

24
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,875
The devil goes to this school!

25
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,166
I mean, dammit!

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,416
If it wasn't for Harima,

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,458
I could totally be
ruling this place by now.

28
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,875
But no!

29
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,416
Instead, all my plans

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,583
for building a Juvenile
Delinquent Army,

31
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,750
all my plans for
Classroom Conquest,

32
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,916
and eventual School
Domination--all ruined!

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,250
Thanks to him!

34
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,708
But I'm not ready
to roll over yet...

35
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,708
I'll just join Harima's gang,
and wait for the right opening!

36
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,291
Hey, Harima, buddy.

37
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,458
I saw your name on the D list.

38
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,250
Sorry I bothered you.

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,916
I'll get there one day.

40
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,916
Hey there, poor little thing.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,583
Are you all by yourself?

42
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,833
Come on, you can trust me.

43
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,333
I just moved here myself, so I
don't really know anyone either.

44
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,125
See!

45
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,958
So we're in the same boat!

46
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,083
Or, maybe not.

47
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,250
Aww. I must have scared her.

48
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,416
How cute!

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,958
Oh, and she's got a kitty!

50
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,000
She looks so peaceful,
like a spring goddess!

51
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,750
Is that Yakumo from 1-D?

52
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,791
She looks so sweet and innocent!

53
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,541
If I was sleeping like that,
I'd just look dumb!

54
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,583
In fact, I'd probably snore!

55
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,375
Yeah! You would!

56
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,958
Oh no. It's already closed.

57
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,041
I'm too late.

58
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,250
You fell asleep again?!

59
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,375
You're always
falling asleep, Yakumo!

60
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,625
I know.

61
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,541
I'm sorry I missed the
sale at the supermarket.

62
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,916
Huh?

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,250
Ha! Ha! Ha!

64
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,125
Hey!

65
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,416
Do I know my sister, or what?

66
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,125
I already went
shopping, just in case!

67
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,375
Thanks sis.

68
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,791
No Problem!

69
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,541
So, anyway, about your
habit of falling asleep

70
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,916
at the drop of a hat--I'm
getting a little worried.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,458
It's becoming a big problem.

72
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,833
Shouldn't you do
something about it?

73
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,708
Don't you have a friend
who could wake you up?

74
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,000
Iori was supposed to wake me.

75
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,958
You're impossible.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,833
So, you coming to
Karaoke tonight?

77
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,958
Yeah, the girls were nagging
us to ask you about it.

78
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,375
What do you say? It'll be fun!

79
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,916
I don't think Yakumo
has a boyfriend right now.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,333
Maybe I'll get lucky.

81
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,875
Maybe I have a chance with her.

82
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:04,708
Um, I have to meet my
friend in the courtyard,

83
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,291
so maybe another time.

84
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:18,250
It's starting again, and
it's getting more powerful.

85
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,416
I have to be strong.

86
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,041
Because I'm all alone.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,791
Hey, look!

88
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,833
Is that kitten gonna be okay?

89
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,291
That stray dog looks vicious!

90
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,458
It's a living thing,
you shouldn't do that!

91
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,833
Yeah right!

92
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:40,833
Somebody do something.

93
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,541
Oh no!

94
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,833
Iori!

95
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,250
I'm afraid of dogs.

96
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,375
Somebody!

97
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,041
Wow! Yakumo's brave!

98
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,541
How cool!

99
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,666
She'll kick that
dog's butt for sure!

100
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,541
She can do anything!

101
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,000
What a woman!

102
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,625
All right!

103
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,291
Did that girl just bark?

104
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,750
That was awesome!

105
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,916
Who is she?

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,250
I've never seen her before.

107
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,458
Isn't she a freshman?

108
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,416
She's cute!

109
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,625
Thank you! Thank you so much!

110
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,791
Wow! That was scary!

111
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,250
Are you okay?

112
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,916
Uh, yes. Thank you!

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,250
Good.

114
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,083
Um, who are you?

115
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,250
Me? Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,083
My name is Sarah Adiemus.

117
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,833
I just moved here.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,458
Dream?

119
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,625
Oh! You finally woke up!

120
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,250
I think it's time
to go home now.

121
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,166
You ready?

122
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm sorry!

123
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,083
You were sleeping so peacefully,
I didn't want to wake you.

124
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,083
Were you having a nice dream?

125
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,625
Yeah.

126
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,625
I'm sorry, Tenma.

127
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,916
I'm gonna be late again.

128
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,916
After classes were assigned,

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,416
Tenma found that she and

130
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,083
Karasuma were in
the same class after all.

131
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,250
However, Tenma quickly realized

132
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,916
that her battle
was far from over.

133
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,916
So for tomorrow, your seat
assignments will be changing.

134
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,791
All right! I'm gonna sit next
to Karasuma no matter what!

135
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,833
 I don't know how to do this!

136
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,208
Aren't seats assigned
by drawing lots?

137
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,291
Worrying about it
isn't gonna help any.

138
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,958
Why don't you just take
a bath and go to bed?

139
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,083
Try to have a little compassion!

140
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,291
I'm in love!

141
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,750
Man! She treats
me like I'm a child.

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,291
I'm not. I'm a full grown woman!

143
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,916
That's why I have to
do everything possible

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,166
to make this right.

145
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,833
Abra Kadabra. Make it a star!

146
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,541
An X?!

147
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:23,208
It didn't work at all?!
I don't understand!

148
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,041
Bending a spoon
is so easy for me.

149
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,875
Karasuma.

150
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,958
This isn't going to help!

151
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,541
I don't have any
time to be depressed.

152
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,083
I have to get that
seat with will power!

153
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,333
Okay, let's assign seats.

154
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,416
Possible seats are
behind, on the side,

155
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,875
diagonal back, to the
front, front diagonal!

156
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,875
There's a lot of choices,
so I should be good.

157
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,833
Let's see, where
is Karasuma's seat?

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,875
The last window seat!

159
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,250
Now I don't have
as many choices!

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,666
Now the only seat left is
the one right in front of him!

161
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,458
Lot number 6!

162
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay, Tenma.
Time for you to pick.

163
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,291
Please, let me pick
number 6! Please!

164
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,416
Was that number 6?

165
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,208
But, that would be cheating.

166
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,750
No it wouldn't!

167
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,500
This is--it's gotta be...

168
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,500
Fate!

169
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,166
All right!

170
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,291
I got the seat in
front of Karasuma!

171
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,000
Ka-ra-su-ma rules!

172
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,833
What the-

173
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,916
Is this your seat?

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,916
Mmm, yeah.

175
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,916
I thought I picked number 6!

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
Ahh. Let me see.

177
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,125
Oh, did you see this?

178
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,958
See this little dot right here?

179
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,250
You had it upside down.

180
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,833
This sucks!

181
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,000
Where the heck is nine!

182
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,875
You're lucky,
this seat's special.

183
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,250
The front seat?

184
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:26,916
Why is this happening to me!

185
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,291
Not good.

186
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:32,666
Tenma's in the front row,
and I'm stuck back here!

187
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,375
Damn it!

188
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,583
This is awesome!

189
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,416
I get to sit next to Tenma!!

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,083
Hey!

191
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,916
How would you like
to switch seats with me?

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,416
You see, I have bad eyesight

193
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,416
and I can't see
very well from the back.

194
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,875
Understand?

195
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,708
Mr. Tani?

196
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,416
What is it?

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,750
I don't see very well.

198
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,958
Is it okay if
I sit in the front row?

199
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:57,166
Sure. Go ahead and ask someone
to switch with you, then.

200
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,958
Please! Let me switch with him.

201
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,541
I beg you, please.

202
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,500
Sure, please be my guest.

203
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,250
Oh thank you!
Thank you so much!

204
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,125
You've made me so happy!

205
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,250
Okay. You're welcome.

206
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,291
You have bad
eyesight too Harima?

207
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,958
Oh wait! I forgot.

208
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,666
I'm still wearing my sunglasses!

209
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,125
That expains it! Oh my gosh!
How silly of me!

210
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,916
No wonder I couldn't see!

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,375
My bad.

212
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm actually farsighted.

213
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,416
The truth is
I can't see the board

214
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,416
unless I'm sittin' in the back.

215
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,333
By definition that is
the theory of relativity.

216
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:42,875
I can feel his eyes on me!

217
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,666
All right!

218
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,916
So then, I guess you could say

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,291
that men and women
are the same way.

220
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,583
So close, yet so far.
So far, but so close.

221
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,666
The best seat in the house.

222
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,416
I'm sorry for staying
so late after class.

223
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,583
That's okay. Don't worry.

224
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,083
Although I'm surprised
that someone

225
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,500
like you would sleep
through my lecture.

226
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,583
I'm really sorry.

227
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,958
Ms. Sasakura?

228
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,208
Do you think my facial
expression's a little stiff?

229
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,083
A little.

230
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,791
Good eyes though.

231
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, I have
some errands to run,

232
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,625
but stay as long as you like.

233
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,916
Thank you, Ms. Sasakura.

234
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,291
I can't seem to get this right.

235
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,000
Shall I tell you why?

236
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,416
You're scared.

237
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,041
I understand. It's okay.

238
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,708
Everyone is always
scared in this situation.

239
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,500
Are you lost?

240
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,500
Where are you from?

241
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,166
I'm not from anywhere.

242
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,583
After all, I'm not
even a human being.

243
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,583
You don't believe me, do you?

244
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,625
That can't be helped I suppose.

245
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:36,083
See, despite my appearance,
I'm much older than you think.

246
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,000
Actually, I've been
wandering around the world

247
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,041
in this form for an eternity.

248
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,291
A Ghost.

249
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,125
Still don't believe me, do you?

250
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,083
Do you believe me now?

251
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,791
I told you, I'm not human.

252
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,875
It's useless. You can't escape.

253
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,041
I'm here, because I wanted
to ask you something.

254
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,958
Tell me...

255
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:26,041
Do you really hate men?

256
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,875
Or do you like them?

257
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,916
No matter how long
I exist in this world,

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,875
I can't decide.

259
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,416
Maybe you have to be an
adult to figure that out.

260
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,125
How is it for you?

261
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,083
Is this question hard
for you to answer?

262
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:48,208
Or is it easy?

263
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,791
I don't hate them.

264
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:57,083
There's just not a specific
guy that I like right now.

265
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,125
Even after all you see?

266
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,416
I know your secret.

267
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,208
You can read the thoughts of
those who have feelings for you.

268
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,208
Occasionally, in this world,

269
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,375
there are people who are
born with heavy burdens.

270
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,666
You are one of them.

271
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,500
Sometimes you can even see
their darkest thoughts,

272
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:22,208
and yet you still
don't hate them. Why?

273
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,875
It's because I understand them.

274
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,666
Everyone has heavy burdens,

275
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,625
but still they try to
be the best that they can.

276
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,541
I don't know if
I like them all, but I...

277
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,875
I see.

278
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,500
Goodbye, Yakumo.

279
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,333
Hey.

280
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,125
How's it coming, Yakumo?

281
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,833
Uh, Ms. Sasakura?

282
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,166
Did you happen
to see a little girl

283
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,333
with long black hair
when you came in?

284
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,583
Sorry,, I'm afraid
I didn't see anyone.

285
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,583
Oh...

286
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,750
Look at that!

287
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,541
There's a pleasant
expression. Well done!

288
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,083
I'm home.

289
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,625
Huh? You wanna
know if I like boys?

290
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,625
I love 'em!!!!

291
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,500
Tenma?

292
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:51,583
We've come to have lots
of fun, at the hot springs!

293
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,333
I'm so excited we
came to the hot springs!

294
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,500
Well this is the first
time I've been to one.

295
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,541
Are they really that great?

296
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,750
You have no idea what
you've been missing.

297
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,041
Do you think
what we did is okay?

298
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,250
I mean lying to Hanai
about leaving like that?

299
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,708
Are you telling me you
wanted to stay with him?

300
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,916
Uh, no!

301
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,708
Yes!

302
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,208
This is the greatest
trip of all time!

303
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,708
I am at the hot
springs with Yakumo!

304
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,458
Oh Tenma, that scavenger
hunt was so romantic...

305
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,041
Harima?

306
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,500
Who's the girl that you like?

307
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,125
Please tell me!

308
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,750
Tenma is dying to hear my
confession of love for her.

309
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,416
I have to tell her soon!

310
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,666
Wow! This place is huge!

311
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,666
Kow- wa- bunga!

312
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,125
The view is amazing!

313
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,791
Tenma! No jumping!

314
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,875
The water's perfect.

315
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,125
It feels so good.

316
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,708
Nothing beats soaking
yourself in the hot springs.

317
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,166
Yeah, but aren't you embarrassed
to be completely naked?

318
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,333
Some places do allow swim suits.

319
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,416
Swimsuits are totally lame...

320
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,791
Hot springs always equal naked!

321
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:11,791
D!

322
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,458
Hey!

323
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,041
What are you doing!

324
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,750
Come on, there has to be a hole
in this wall I can look though!

325
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,208
You perv! Cut it out!

326
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,416
Hey! C'mon! Stop!

327
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,416
Heh! They're so pathetic.

328
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,291
What childish idiots.

329
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,291
Eri! What's wrong,
are you getting sick?

330
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,916
I think I may have caught a
cold during the scavenger hunt.

331
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,458
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,708
I was the one who said we should
play it in the first place.

333
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,500
It was all so that I could tell
Harima something in private.

334
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,958
Tell me something?

335
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,166
Hey!

336
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,708
Boobies!

337
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,666
What did you say to him?

338
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,750
Yeah, tell us.

339
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,333
The thing is...

340
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,125
What did Tenma need to tell me?

341
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,291
No way!

342
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,000
Is it possible that
she was finally going

343
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,541
to confess her love for me?

344
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,625
Oh no!

345
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,916
I spoiled it by
getting so tongue tied.

346
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Harima was totally
trying to hit on Yakumo?

347
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,583
You're kidding!

348
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,708
Yeah right!

349
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,375
Like he'd even have
a chance with her!

350
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,541
He's so not good enough!

351
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,125
I know

352
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,083
Is Tenma mad at me?

353
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,791
Just because I'm too
scared to tell her how I feel?

354
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,666
This is agony!

355
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,250
D! D!

356
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,083
Stop acting like a child!

357
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,250
Damn!

358
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,166
How did he get to
be so strong anyway?!

359
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,083
So I told him girls need to
be shown that they're special!

360
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,333
Every girl needs to be treated

361
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,250
like she's the only
one that matters!

362
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,791
Yeah, and then?

363
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,625
I think he finally got it!

364
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:43,541
I'm sorry Tenma! I let you down!

365
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,166
I promise that I'll find
a way to make it up to you!

366
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,541
I think you're
wasting your time!

367
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,041
He's too much like a
monkey in mating season!

368
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,375
You think so?

369
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,708
Seriously!

370
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,708
He should be locked up
in a cage, or euthanized!

371
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:59,416
If you want,
I'll tell Nakamura to...

372
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,208
I'm gonna set her straight!

373
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,791
And who the hell is
Nakamura, anyways!

374
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,958
D! D! D!

375
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,250
D cup!

376
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,291
This stops right now!

377
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,208
You're funny, Mikoto!

378
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,250
Oh! I know!!

379
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,375
What?

380
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,208
Let's sing the Hot Springs song!

381
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,166
What song is that?

382
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,208
I just sang it!

383
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,041
You did?

384
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,500
C'mon! One! Two!

385
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:41,958
♪ We've come to have lots
of fun at the hot springs. ♪

386
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:46,083
♪ We've come to have lots
of fun at the hot springs. ♪

387
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,041
Good!

388
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,708
Hey! Why'd you stop?!

389
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,375
I don't know it!

390
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,791
Sing it by yourself!

391
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,750
♪ We've come to have lots
of fun at the hot springs ♪

392
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:54,875
What's wrong Eri?

393
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,833
Uh. It's nothing!

394
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,125
I could've sworn
I just saw a monkey.

395
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,416
Oh, yeah.
This is the mountains!

396
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,958
So seeing a monkey
wouldn't be that unusual!

397
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,875
♪ At the hot springs! ♪

398
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,625
Enough with the singing!

399
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,791
Here.

400
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:17,500
Meanwhile, Akira was ordered
to Italy on an important job.

401
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,958
Comprendo.

402
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,791
Comprendo?

403
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:24,250
Oh, Mr. Turtle.

404
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,250
Miss Turtle.

405
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,458
Do you like me?

406
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,125
I like...

407
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,333
I like curry.

408
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,416
No! Not again!

409
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,875
A girl can hope.
