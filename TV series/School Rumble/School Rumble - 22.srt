1
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,583
School Rumble...

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,625
It's not pansy-core.

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,250
My name is Tenma Tsukamoto.

4
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,250
Today I'm gonna confess my
feelings to the one I love...!

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,458
Well, that was the plan anyway.

6
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,416
But not only have I not
confessed my love,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
Karasuma's hardly been
in any recent episodes!

8
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,083
Meanwhile, we've accepted a
challenge from Class D

9
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,291
and we're gonna throw down
at the athletic meet!

10
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,583
But don't forget,

11
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,625
this is still supposed
to be a romantic comedy!

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,625
...so remember, ladies
and gentlemen, a student

13
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,583
has a responsibility to his
physical heath as well as

14
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,541
to his mental excellence.

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,583
Don't carelessly injure
yourselves like, say,

16
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,583
the students in...

17
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,791
2-C... oops,
I beg your pardon...

18
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,625
I mean a hypothetically
careless class...

19
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:54,875
that's like 2-C...
but isn't them.

20
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,791
You suck, Katou!

21
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,083
Next, may I present
Ms. Tae Anegasaki,

22
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,666
the new school nurse...

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,000
If anyone gets hurt, please be
sure to have her check you out!

24
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,958
Hey there...! I'll be waiting!

25
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,458
I hope I break something!

26
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,833
Wow... everyone is
really worked up this year!

27
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,083
Yeah, but you gotta wonder

28
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,916
if they're "worked up"
for the right reason.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,333
Huh... face it,
men are all idiots.

30
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,916
Well, we better get
this show started.

31
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,791
You mean you're
not participating

32
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,791
in any of the events?!

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,583
I can't, I've got to stay at
this station the whole meet.

34
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,166
I guess it can't be helped,

35
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,208
but it won't be the
same without you.

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,625
Oh, Miss Tsukamoto?

37
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,750
Huh?

38
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,833
Do your best, kay?

39
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,583
I will.

40
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,333
And the games are
off to a fierce start,

41
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:30,791
with 2-C and 2-D going
head to head and toe to toe!

42
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,458
Harry...! You're looking
good there, m'man!

43
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,750
Hey, what can I say,

44
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,708
if they can't hit ya,
they can't hurt ya!

45
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,083
Hey, guys... remember...

46
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,625
the goal is to get
the balls in the--

47
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,958
2-C We rock your world!

48
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,166
2-C We got hot girls!
Go 2-C! Yeah!

49
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,958
I wish I was in 2-C!

50
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,208
Uh... she doesn't seem
to be enjoying this.

51
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,625
She looks actively pissed.

52
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,958
I heard she didn't
want to do it ...

53
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,125
but I think it's like

54
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,791
a requirement for
chicks, or something.

55
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,458
If it really bugs
you that much...

56
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,666
you don't have to do it.

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,916
Really?!

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,666
Man, I can't stand
these athletic meets!

59
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,583
So what I'd like to
know is, what are you doing,

60
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,083
hanging out in the infirmary...?

61
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,750
Aren't you usually
up on the roof?

62
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,958
Uh... too many pigeons today...

63
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,916
Get lost, you idiot!
I've got rewrites to do!

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,541
You can level with me,
you're working

65
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,458
on that hot new
nurse, aren't ya?

66
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,625
Hey, Harima...!

67
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,208
Come on, hurry,
we need you on the field!

68
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,416
Scram, Tsukamoto...!

69
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
My man here doesn't have time

70
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,916
to waste on your
stupid athletic meet!

71
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,916
I got lots of time to waste.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,916
It's 2-C!

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,625
2-C again!

74
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,416
Class 2-C is dominating
the competition so far!

75
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,583
Yeah, we're mopping up the floor

76
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,916
with those clowns
from 2-D...! Right...!

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,833
Now it's my turn
to take 'em down!

78
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,416
Look... let's get
one thing straight here...

79
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,666
I don't like you either,

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,791
but right now let's
focus on the event.

81
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,083
Huh?

82
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,958
Nice form.

83
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,875
Now it's the tug of war event

84
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,666
between second year
classes C and D...

85
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,541
and neither side
is giving an inch!

86
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,916
Man, are we taking those
guys to school or what?

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,666
Hey... what happened to Lara?

88
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,041
Uh...

89
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,250
She said it wasn't right
to eat lunch with the enemy.

90
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,291
Well, well, you're startin'
to enjoy it, aren't you?

91
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,125
We're one ahead.

92
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,250
Only the cavalry battle
and the relay left...

93
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,791
that'll decide it.

94
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,250
I sense... Evil!

95
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,208
Masakazu!

96
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,666
I, Haruki Hanai,
hereby swear that...

97
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,125
I will destroy you in battle!

98
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,750
I wanted to say that!

99
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,583
Two events remain to determine
this year's winner...!

100
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,500
Next up, a tradition at our
school, the cavalry battle...!

101
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,000
Three boys and one
girl form one horse team!

102
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,250
What are you going to do?

103
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,458
Are you gonna to drop out?

104
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,583
Well, it's just that
Harima's on your team,

105
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,833
and I thought it might be
awkward for you two...

106
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,291
Oh, not that you'd let it affect

107
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,583
your performance or anything
like that I'm just sayin'.

108
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,458
First of all,
I'm fine with it, okay...?!

109
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,625
And second of all,

110
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,958
why should I care
what that loser thinks,

111
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,416
that's his problem!

112
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,750
As long as you're not upset...

113
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,750
All right, each class,
mount your horses!

114
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,000
Ready for me to mount you?

115
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,750
Sure.

116
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,375
Oh, I'm ready!

117
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,416
I'm counting on you, gentlemen!

118
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,958
There's nothing to worry about!

119
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,625
Hey, would you
mind bending over?

120
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,666
In your dreams, Blondie.

121
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,041
Good luck, Harima!

122
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,250
Eri! I know you'll go
out there and do your best!

123
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,666
Whoa, easy!

124
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,458
Cork it, toots,
and quit draggin' your feet!

125
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,916
What set you on fire?

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,625
Let's play to win!

127
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,208
Yeah, playing
to lose'd be stupid.

128
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,125
Hi yo, cavalry, away!

129
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,666
Yay!

130
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,958
Take no prisoners.

131
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,375
Yeah, fine, whatever
you say, Your Highness.

132
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,458
Ichijou...

133
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,250
Hmph...! Hmph!

134
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,625
Now let's see what
you've really got.

135
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,916
Let's... dance.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,583
No more fooling around,
we need to get serious...

137
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,625
Let's go for the win...!
You got me?

138
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:27,958
Second year class...
are you ready to begin?

139
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,958
Ready...

140
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,666
Whoa!

141
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,375
And it's a furious battle
right out of the gate!

142
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,541
A regular clash of titans!

143
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,250
No quarter given or asked!

144
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,041
Whatever the heck that means.

145
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,750
I've got it!

146
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,291
Who was that?!

147
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,750
The team everyone is watching
this event, Harry and Lara,

148
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,208
have made their move...!
And what a move...

149
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,500
They seem to be everywhere...

150
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,416
striking like lightning...
missing no opening!

151
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,416
Okay, I think we should
go after her first.

152
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,791
What do you think?

153
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,958
Not yet...! Let's thin
out the competition first...

154
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,750
Her turn'll come, don't worry!

155
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:18,916
Good thinking!

156
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,250
Huh?

157
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,000
Whoa, nelly!

158
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,625
Ichijou just collected her
seventh headband of the game!

159
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,458
Come on, you spineless
wimp, get in the game!

160
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,541
I'm not feelin' it

161
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,625
And so the cavalry
battle comes down

162
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,250
to just three teams competing
for the most headbands!

163
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,083
Between 2-D and 2-C, the rest of
us don't have a chance in hell!

164
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,541
Let's face it, our class sucks,

165
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,750
we might as well just
give up right now and go home.

166
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,541
No...! Sure, we may suck
but we still have our pride...!

167
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,416
I say we go down sucking!

168
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,666
Yeah!

169
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,791
Thank you!

170
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,791
Now what?

171
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,666
Are my eyes deceiving me?

172
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,125
Oh! Class A has
joined its horses!

173
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,500
They've formed a pyramid
with the riders all at the top!

174
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,416
They're virtually unassailable!

175
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,208
Hold on...!
That's gotta be cheating!

176
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,041
Heh...! the rules say
the riders' feet can't

177
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,833
touch the ground,
otherwise it's anything goes!

178
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,500
Let's see what the steering
committee chairman has to say!

179
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,333
Move allowed.

180
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,750
And it's a go...!

181
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,500
A very generous interpretation
by this year's chairman!

182
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,000
Too generous!

183
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,416
Tough luck, baby cakes!

184
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,083
The headband is at the top of
the pyramid, get it if you can!

185
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,666
Sweet mother of pearl!

186
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,208
One of the girls is climbing the
pyramid like a monkey up a tree!

187
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,666
And once again...
it's Karen Ichijou!

188
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,250
That's it, Carolyn, you rock!

189
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,875
Don't give up now,
you fools! Counterattack!

190
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,916
You ass!

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,958
Why did you step out
of the pyramid?

192
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,416
Oh, the humanity!

193
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,375
Way to go... Ichijou!

194
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,083
Thanks...! Look at all
of the headbands we've got!

195
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,833
She's the one
we have to get! Ichijou!

196
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,000
Uh... you're scaring me.

197
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,083
You won't topple us so easily!

198
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,833
It's class B's
three fat brothers

199
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,583
whose names no one can remember!

200
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,125
I can barely see the rider!

201
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,916
They look like a wedding cake
with only the bride on top!

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,750
Holy Crap! They're fat!

203
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,416
Let's go get 'em!

204
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,708
Oh, my Aunt Fanny's girdle!

205
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,500
Suou is facing them head on!

206
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,916
Whoa... That's nails!

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,416
Check it, bro...!
Enemy rider at eight o'clock!

208
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,625
Eight o'what?

209
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,708
Brace yourself!

210
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,125
Too bad...!

211
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,041
We put on another 90 pounds
apiece just for today's contest!

212
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,416
I'm getting seasick.

213
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,375
I know...! Go for their legs!

214
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,333
You mean like this?!

215
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,250
Come about ninety degrees and
then hit 'em from the right!

216
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,166
Ramming speed!!

217
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,625
And the brothers are down!

218
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,333
Suou and her team's
deft series of moves

219
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,083
have toppled this wobbling
wall of human flesh!

220
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,541
You 'n' me, baby!

221
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,083
Hey... gimme a break, will ya?

222
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,166
Hey, jerk, if you don't want it,

223
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,250
why not share it
with the rest of us?

224
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,416
Harima, come on, don't
just wander around the edge,

225
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,833
we gotta get in there
and fight! Let's move it!

226
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,166
Screw that! You wanna fight?
Do it yourself!

227
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,250
Oh, for Pete's sake,
are you still holding a grudge?

228
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,125
What are you talking about?

229
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,458
I'm talking about
your little bald...

230
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,041
You suck!

231
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,166
How can you be so petty?!

232
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,041
And over something
so insignificant!

233
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,583
How could you call
this insignificant,

234
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,750
you little blonde twit?

235
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,708
Do you remember
what you did to me?

236
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,750
Why, you...

237
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,125
What am I doing?

238
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,916
That'll just make things worse!

239
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,291
Chrome Dome here
is a complete jerk

240
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,333
and pushes every
button I've got...

241
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,958
but, it's up to me
to be the adult here.

242
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,166
Okay, here goes.

243
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,083
You know, Harima...

244
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,291
Yoo-hoo!

245
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,375
Hm?

246
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,125
Do your best, Hario...!
I'm watching!

247
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,875
Uh... yeah, sure...

248
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,875
Wow... she's so warm
for your form I'm sweatin'!

249
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,083
Shut up and go get
your hair harvested.

250
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,750
Okay, careful with that,
it could slip off, ya know...

251
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,125
Face front!

252
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,833
That means... now.

253
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,666
Okay, okay, you're
the boss, I get it!

254
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,875
Right turn, please.

255
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,625
Look, you've made your point...

256
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,666
And left...

257
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,416
Bet you think
this is funny, huh?

258
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,083
Come on, enough's enough!

259
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,250
Oh! I think your cap
might be slipping!

260
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,583
You'll pay for this!!

261
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,416
This is our best chance... Now!

262
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,833
Time for the Pincer attack!

263
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,000
Right!

264
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,625
Get lost! We're busy!

265
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,458
Giddy up, horsie!

266
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,666
Shove it, Princess!

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,166
What's that?

268
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,083
Oh, man... What happened here?

269
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,541
Akira! You okay?

270
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, just dying.

271
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,750
Ha...! Looks like
that's it for 2-C.

272
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,166
Yeah, frickin' pansies.

273
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,291
Look... behind you...

274
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,666
It's class D's ultimate
weapon... Tennoji!!

275
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,583
Ugh. It's over...
We haven't got a prayer...

276
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,041
Don't panic! If anyone can
do this, we can...! Attack!

277
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,916
Damn... three teams at once!

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,041
You've gotta be kidding.

279
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,500
This is incredible!

280
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,708
With Tennoji in the game,

281
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,458
every other class is
being annihilated!

282
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,250
Only a miracle can keep 2-D
from winning this one!

283
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,208
Come on, you guys...
we haven't fought at all yet!

284
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,666
If I hide behind a strong team

285
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,750
and can just last
to the end, maybe...

286
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,125
Babies, babies, there's
enough Nara to go around!

287
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,833
No. Tenma's in big
trouble...! Let's go!

288
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,208
Right!

289
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,125
Oh, no... I don't think so.

290
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,041
I was gettin' tired of
fighting all those small fries.

291
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,916
Now I'm after the big fish.

292
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,916
Damn.

293
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,458
Come and get it.

294
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,250
Mikoto! I'll take
care of Tennoji!

295
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,375
Be careful!

296
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,583
We're coming... Tenma...

297
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,625
Uh... oh...

298
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,708
Sweep attack!

299
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:44,125
Everyone... forgive... me...

300
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,750
Tenma!

301
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,916
Tenma!

302
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,958
Oh! Sorry! Are you all right?!

303
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,166
Okie-dokie...

304
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,458
Bastard...!
How dare you hurt Tenma!

305
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,375
Crap...! Your Hurricane Kick
had no effect!

306
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,375
Ooh, Sawachika's team
is in deep doo-doo now!

307
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,500
The last attack did no damage-o!

308
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,208
You can do it...!
Go, Eri...! Go, Harima!

309
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,541
Damn it, I can't use
all my strength

310
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,000
when I'm stuck to the
team like this...! Argh!!

311
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay, listen up, Rich Girl!

312
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,291
You gotta do just
what I tell you!

313
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,375
What's this?

314
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,583
Rider Sawachika
is going around wide!

315
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,583
That's your plan?!

316
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,375
Are you crazy?!

317
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,708
You really wanna try that?

318
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,041
Try what you like, it won't
make any difference!

319
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,208
Quit whining!
Can you do it or not?!

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,166
All right, let's do this!

321
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,916
Twin Hurricane Kick!

322
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,125
If I'm goin' down,

323
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,625
I ain't goin' down alone,
you're comin' with me!

324
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,833
Huh...?! No, wait...!
If he takes my cap...

325
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,583
I'll be humiliated in
front of the whole school...!

326
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,541
And in front of Tenma!

327
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:04,541
They're over; my happy
schooldays filled with romance.

328
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:14,000
Gone!

329
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,333
No, Sawachika!

330
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,916
Ouch! Rider Sawachika
has fallen off her mount!

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,958
It looks like
they collided somehow!

332
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,166
What could've happened?

333
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,625
Hey...! Rich Girl... you okay?

334
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,416
It's your fault we're out of
the game... you bald workhorse!

335
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,916
And just listen to that crowd
roar for Miss Eri Sawachika!

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,583
Thanks everyone.
You're very welcome.

337
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,583
Uh-oh! At the other end of the
field, Rider Suou is in a pinch!

338
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,125
She's surrounded by
two of Class D's best!

339
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,125
She's wide open
from this side...! Hah!

340
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,458
Oh, son of a...

341
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,791
Huh...? Banana boy
took the hit?!

342
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,750
Go... get 'em... Mikoto...

343
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,541
Imadori!

344
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,750
All I ask... is that you
remember me at this moment...

345
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,291
a man who fought
for your sake...

346
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,541
and fell in battle...
at your side...

347
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,333
Spare us the melodrama!

348
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,958
Hit 'em hard!

349
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,625
We're gonna kick your
collective ass, 2-D!

350
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:26,583
She did it!...!
Rider Suou crushed her opponent!

351
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,541
Thank you... Imadori.

352
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:34,291
Look out! Get out
of the way! Imadori...

353
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,166
Gotcha.

354
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,541
Unbelievable!...! After tripping
on their own classmate,

355
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,916
Team Suou is out of the game!

356
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,708
At this rate,
we're doomed for sure!

357
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,791
No... not yet.

358
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,500
What do you mean?

359
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,541
We've still got one shot.

360
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,750
Okay, folks, it looks like
we're the only ones left!

361
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,666
Let's give it
everything we've got!

362
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,791
Roger!

363
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,250
I've been waiting
for you... Ichijou!

364
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,125
Go!!

365
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,666
What an onslaught!

366
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,375
Ichijou and Gonzalez
are at it tooth and nail!

367
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,750
Lara's gonna make paste out of
that kid from 2-C!

368
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,875
Look again...
she's just flailing away...

369
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,750
Karen's blocked every
punch Lara's thrown at her.

370
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,166
Doin' okay up there Lara?

371
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,250
Don't you worry about me!

372
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,875
There is no way in hell I am
going to lose to that girl...!

373
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:55,291
She's going down and that's
all there is to it...! Attack!

374
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,375
Take this, Ichijou!

375
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,916
Karen Ichijou has
been unhorsed...!

376
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,125
Class... D... gets... the win!

377
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,291
No!...! Not yet!!

378
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,958
She hasn't fallen yet...! Rider
Ichijou is still in the game!!!

379
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:18,458
What? I don't believe it!
It didn't work?!

380
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,791
No.

381
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,458
Hanai tossed her up into
the air at the last minute

382
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,541
and then caught her!

383
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,916
Your kick barely
connected with her,

384
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,291
I don't even think she's
bruised, let alone hurt.

385
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,791
Nice move, Hanai!

386
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,583
This is gonna be rough.

387
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,125
Huh?

388
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,291
There's no way Hanai can fight
back carrying her like that.

389
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,791
Finally, victory will be ours.

390
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,958
Oh, mama!...! A direct hit!!

391
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,208
What the hell...?

392
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,416
So now what?

393
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,083
Paint my ass blue
and call me a baboon,

394
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,208
Hanai repelled the attack...!
Talk about abs of steel!

395
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,916
Damn... what is with this guy?

396
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,166
Ah, at last the tree

397
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,833
of training bears the
sweet fruit of victory!

398
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,125
Hey! You're the old man
from the mountaintop!

399
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,250
Oh! I haven't seen you
for a long time...

400
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,250
you're the girl with
the D cup, right?

401
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,458
Cut that out!

402
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,750
You mean you know this guy?

403
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,250
If you wanna score,
now's the time!

404
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,041
Shut up!!

405
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,416
Gonzalez is riding toward
Ichijou with tremendous speed,

406
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,583
ready to uncork
her signature move!

407
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,791
The whole reason I came to
this country... was to fight!

408
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,125
This is it...! Thor's Hammer!

409
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,750
She... She vanished?!

410
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,000
Not quite.

411
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,708
I haven't seen this in years!

412
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,833
A flawless execution of "Nymph's
Dancer!" What a performance!

413
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,000
Lara?

414
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,125
Are you all right?
Oh, dear, I did it again!

415
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,875
Dios mio, Ichijou,
that was a pro wrestling move!

416
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,750
You know what...? You should
come to my dojo some time...

417
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,708
I think you'd make
an interesting opponent!

418
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,916
Um, I think I'll pass on that.

419
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,625
Ichijou's the type
who reacts without

420
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,250
even thinking when she's up
against a tough opponent...!

421
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,708
I never thought I'd meet such
a natural when I came here.

422
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,958
The score now stands...
220 to 218...

423
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,916
and Class C is back in the lead!

424
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,416
Eh... just shake it off.

425
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,125
No, I can't do that.

426
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,000
I was just playing
around up until now,

427
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,125
but from here on
out it's personal...

428
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,125
I'm going to beat them.

429
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,750
You were so cool
out there, Carolyn!

430
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah, 2-C remains victorious!

431
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,083
Eh... none of this
really matters anyway.

432
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:48,416
Well... I gotta
go feed Napoleon...

433
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,666
So long... classmates.

434
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,666
Go out for the relay...?
Hmph...! No way...!

435
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,541
It's no skin off my nose
if this class wins or loses!

436
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,000
Next time on School Rumble:
"Women's Battle!

437
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,750
Men's Battle!
After the Battle!"

438
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,916
Rich Girl...

439
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,875
What happened to us
on that battlefield?
