1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,750
School Rumble...
will begin in a moment.

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,500
When you watch television...

3
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,916
Make sure to keep the lights
on... and don't sit too close!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, ma'am!

5
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,500
What's wrong. Mikoto...

6
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,916
Are you asleep...? You've
been up too late studying!

7
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:18,666
See what I mean?

8
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,041
You've got no concentration!

9
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,833
A total lack of commitment!

10
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,250
You're wasting my time...!

11
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,666
If you're not gonna give a
hundred and ten per cent,

12
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,500
I've got better things to do!

13
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,375
Wow, I guess it wasn't
as bad as I thought.

14
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,916
Apparently not...

15
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,250
Hanai was right,
my heart really wasn't in it...

16
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,083
And now my hand hurts
even worse than before...

17
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,875
The pain just keeps getting
more and more intense...

18
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,000
What if I can't hold a pencil
to take the exam tomorrow?

19
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,000
I know I don't usually
do this sort of thing,

20
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,541
but I need help... Please.

21
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,791
The thing is...

22
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,416
I want to... I want to go to
the same university he does!

23
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,208
But, I'm not what you'd
call an over-achiever

24
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,541
when it comes to schoolwork.

25
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,916
So I've got to be able
to take that exam tomorrow

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,625
and at least get
a passing grade!

27
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,083
It's not that I'm asking
for a good score or anything!

28
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,916
All I want is to be able

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,666
to hold a pencil until
the end of the test.

30
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,250
Yeah, right!

31
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,541
I can't believe I'm doing this.

32
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,125
What the heck was I thinking?

33
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,833
I mean, it's not like anything's
really gonna happen...

34
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,875
Hello, is anybody there?

35
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,958
You can't be... you're not...

36
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,666
Approach, my child...

37
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,958
show me your hand and a pencil.

38
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,500
There you are...

39
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,083
This sacred cloth shall aid you
in your writing endeavors.

40
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,583
Now put your mind at ease and
go on to school without fear.

41
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:30,375
Uh... Thanks a lot...
but first...

42
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,500
What are you doing here, Harima?

43
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,833
I know not this Harima...

44
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,166
I am the guardian spirit
of this holy shrine...

45
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,166
Your pleas touched my heart,
so I manifested myself to...

46
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,958
Yeah, you're Harima.

47
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,125
Thank you,
oh spirit of the shrine.

48
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,791
And come back to
school already, okay?

49
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,500
Back to school...

50
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,125
Hey, did you hear about
that new fortune teller

51
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,250
everyone's been seeing?

52
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,583
Fortune teller?

53
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,750
You mean the guy they call
Black Eyes or something...?

54
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,416
Has a stand in
front of the station?

55
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,750
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

56
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,041
Have you ever seen him?

57
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,458
No, I haven't.

58
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,875
But I've heard he's so
accurate, it's almost creepy.

59
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,625
Yeah, that's what I hear too...

60
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,333
I'd love to go check it out,
but I don't know...

61
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,958
Oh, wow, fortune tellers
are so cool...!

62
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,666
Except when they tell
me something bad,

63
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,208
that freaks me out.

64
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,666
Relax, you only have to
listen to the good stuff...

65
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,416
That's an actual rule...

66
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,791
Really...? Good!

67
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,125
Hey, Akira... do you
wanna check it out?

68
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,125
No thanks, not my
kind of thing...

69
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,625
by the way, don't you
have to get going?

70
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,458
It's lunch time, you know.

71
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,833
Wait for me, Karasuma!

72
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,500
Yummy... yum.

73
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,500
Again with the rice balls.

74
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,083
Every day the same thing.

75
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,291
You'd think
they'd be sick of it.

76
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,458
What else can she do?

77
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,125
She keeps ruining the curry.

78
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,083
I'm afraid we don't
really have a choice.

79
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,208
We have to step in.

80
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,083
Step into what?

81
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,416
And we can certainly count
on your help,... right, Fuyuki?

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,416
Of course!

83
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,166
Wow, Fuyuki, this is such
an incredible coincidence!

84
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,916
We were just talking
about going out for curry

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,333
and then you and
Karasuma come by

86
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,125
on your way to
a curry restaurant!

87
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,083
Yes, it is a coincidence.

88
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll say...! It almost
feels like it might be fate!

89
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,833
Fuyuki, what is it?
What's wrong?

90
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,500
My stomach feels
a little funky...

91
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,833
I think I better pass today.

92
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,083
Oh my gosh, I forgot!

93
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,208
My poodle's getting
her weave today.

94
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,708
Holy smoke, I completely
forgot I was on a diet!

95
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,000
Gosh darn, I swore to my
great grandma on her deathbed

96
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,166
I'd never eat curry
on odd Thursdays!

97
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,666
Huh?

98
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,416
Enjoy your curry...

99
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,875
We'll see you later!

100
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,250
It looks like it's
just the two of us.

101
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,583
Let's go.

102
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,250
It looks like they fell for it.

103
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,625
We pulled it off!

104
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,958
I hope they'll
appreciate all the trouble

105
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,458
we're going through for them!

106
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,250
Hey, since we've got nothing to
do now, you wanna grab a snack?

107
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,291
Great idea, if you're paying.

108
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,708
I'm in!

109
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,750
Actually, I really do have
someplace I have to go...

110
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,416
I'll have to take a rain check!

111
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,083
Huh?

112
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,583
Okay, where should
the rest of us go then?

113
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,291
Hey, look at that...
a fortune teller!

114
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,750
Oh, yeah.

115
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,458
I can't thank you enough...

116
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,041
You've saved my
company from bankruptcy.

117
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,250
It wasn't me.
It was the animals.

118
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,791
I am merely their medium.

119
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,583
They are your true saviors.

120
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,250
Isn't that so?

121
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,541
Whoever did it, thank you.

122
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,083
Excuse me...

123
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,208
I'd like you to tell
my fortune, if you can.

124
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,208
Oh, wow... You look awfully
familiar.

125
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,583
Yes... I get that all the time.

126
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,500
I have the kind of face
everyone thinks they know.

127
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,666
I guess that might be it,

128
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,833
but I don't think
there could be two faces

129
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,625
in the world
that look like that.

130
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,791
Look! The world
is a big place...

131
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,083
Now let's get to the point,

132
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,583
what is it you want to
ask my animals about?

133
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,125
I suppose it would fall under
the heading of family affairs...

134
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,458
I guess that would cover it...

135
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,916
There is no
question in existence

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,375
that we cannot answer...

137
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,125
I overcame great suffering
and sorrow, walked the path

138
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,000
of nine perfections, crossed
the boulevard of broken dreams,

139
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,083
and attained supreme
enlightenment...

140
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,250
And the animals
always speak the truth.

141
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,041
Now ask your question
and receive your answer!

142
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,750
Uh... okay... it's like this...

143
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,791
I was wondering about

144
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,166
my father's favorite
food, because...

145
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,083
It's curry!

146
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,291
What? Curry?!

147
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,916
Daddy doesn't eat curry!
Your mom eats curry!

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,500
And you eat curry!
I can smell it!

149
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,666
Okay, fine...
Thanks for your help.

150
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,416
And by the way, Harima,

151
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,708
when you're done
fooling around here,

152
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,458
come back to school, okay?

153
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,250
Come back to school...?

154
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,208
I can't even imagine what
that would be like now...

155
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,583
I feel like I've
left the concerns

156
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,291
of the regular
world far behind me.

157
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,000
My animals are the only
friends who matter now...

158
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,625
Tenma could walk right up to me
and beg me to go out with her'

159
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,416
and I wouldn't even
look at her twice.

160
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,291
Truly... I have been reborn.

161
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,750
Oh, Karasuma, look over there...

162
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,208
I betcha that's
that fortune teller!

163
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,375
Whoa there... everybody
just take it easy!

164
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,916
This must be the guy Eri and the
other girls were talking about.

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,208
The one whose predictions
always come true!

166
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,416
How exciting...!

167
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,625
Will you please tell my fortune?

168
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,250
Do... do you wanna know

169
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,375
the future for you
and your boyfriend?

170
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,333
He's not my boyfriend.

171
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,083
I mean, not
officially or anything.

172
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,791
I wasn't really thinking
about a love fortune...

173
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,083
So... They're not
actually dating yet.

174
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,666
Of course...

175
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,083
If you don't mind giving me

176
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,208
a love reading
while you're at it...

177
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,625
Oh... My... Gosh!

178
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,916
Uh... Very well, then, miss...

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,666
I'll read your fortune for you.

180
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,750
Thank you...! This is so cool!

181
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,291
Now what should I do...?

182
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,375
Maybe I should tell her that
they've got nothing in common...

183
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,750
What am I saying...? I've
given up on the material world!

184
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,750
We can go and have curry right
after this, okay, Karasuma?

185
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,166
I know how much
you love curry...!

186
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,375
Oh, I'm really looking
forward to it, too...!

187
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,208
I'm in a hurry
to have some curry!

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,083
So... Do you prefer meat
and potatoes, or curry?

189
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,833
Curry.

190
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:10,000
And... do you...
that is... which... do...

191
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,291
Which do you like
better, curry or me?

192
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,791
Curry.

193
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,791
Uh... okay...

194
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,625
May... maybe I didn't
put that the right way...

195
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,750
Which do you like better,

196
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,416
pre-packaged store
bought curry or me?

197
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,208
Wait!

198
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,458
He hesitated!

199
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,250
He hesitated when he
had to choose between me

200
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,041
and pre-packaged,
store-bought curry!

201
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:40,583
Uh...

202
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,250
Just a minute!

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,583
There's no way I'm gonna let you
get away with that, Nijou...!

204
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,958
I mean... Karasuma!

205
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,333
Maybe it's none of my business,
but that doesn't matter...

206
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,583
If I see a man
make a woman cry...

207
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,625
He answers to me!

208
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,416
Lightning Fury Foot Strike! Ha!

209
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,041
Quickly, go after her.

210
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,625
Wait a minute, you're saying
you want me to follow her?

211
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,166
What are you up to... Karasuma?

212
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,916
Go on... There's
something here I must do.

213
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,791
I understand.

214
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,208
Whoa...! Did you see that?!

215
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,958
Yeah, is he okay?

216
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,916
Wow, he's like
a freakin' zombie!

217
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,375
All this time...

218
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,875
All this time...

219
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,958
I've... I've...

220
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,125
...worshiped you...

221
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,083
No good... I can't
go any further...

222
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,541
Is this how it's
all going to end?

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,125
Tenma?!

224
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,291
Am I dreaming...?
Is this possible?

225
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,875
Listen to me...!
I love you; I adore you.

226
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,916
I've worshipped you
from afar for months!

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,708
It's done...
It's done; I said it!

228
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,125
I finally said it!

229
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,083
I wonder how Tenma's big curry
date with Karasuma's going?

230
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,583
I hope you didn't
mind getting dragged

231
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,125
into our little conspiracy.

232
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,333
No, no, that's okay.

233
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,083
I gotta admit, I liked the way
you guys set the whole thing up.

234
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,125
Make sure you let me know
if you need my help too, Mikoto.

235
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,416
Yeah, thanks.

236
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,750
Hey...! I don't know
what you're talking about!

237
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,916
What...?! Does our little
Mikoto have a boyfriend?

238
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,333
Do you know who it is, Akira?

239
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,666
Of course I do.

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,583
What do you think you're doing?!

241
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,333
Now wait a minute.

242
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,916
You're not really going
to say anything, are you?

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,833
I was just kidding.

244
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,250
Well, twitch an eyebrow or
something, will ya?

245
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,416
Cause I can't tell!

246
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,916
But you know...

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,708
you need to express to him what
your true feelings are...

248
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,083
You're going to regret it later

249
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,291
if you don't tell him
you love him now.

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,458
Now that I think of it,

251
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,250
I've never heard Eri's name
mentioned with anyone else's.

252
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,625
Huh?!

253
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,166
C'mon, she's always got
some guy hanging around her!

254
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,458
Yeah, sure, I know there

255
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,333
are lots of guys
chasing after her...

256
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,208
But I've never heard about her
going steady with any of them.

257
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,125
Well, I guess that's true. Huh.

258
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,541
That seems kind
of unusual to me.

259
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,125
I'm beginning to wonder if she's
ever even fallen for a guy.

260
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,083
I love you...

261
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,125
Sorry, did I say
something funny?

262
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,583
Not exactly, but it is kind
of hard to visualize...

263
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,208
Yeah... like when pigs fly!

264
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,041
I can't even imagine
what kind of guy

265
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,208
could seriously
get Eri's attention!

266
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,750
Uh... What do you say
we go a different way?

267
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,666
I'm good with that.

268
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,083
Uh... Gosh, I...

269
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,125
This is... very sudden...

270
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,916
I'm not sure what
to say, I mean, I...

271
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,333
Hario...

272
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,083
Aww... Where have you been?

273
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,916
I'm making my special meat
and potatoes for dinner tonight.

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,583
You know you love it!

275
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,208
Now say goodbye
to your little friend!

276
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,041
Come on, it's time to go home!

277
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,750
Hold on.

278
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,500
Harima!

279
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,125
You said you
liked curry... You pig.

280
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,166
I don't even know
what's going on anymore.

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,125
It's really huge!

282
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,958
What was that
girl so upset about?

283
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,791
I'll be damned if I know...

284
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,750
But she's from a really rich,
hoity-toity family,

285
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,416
so she probably doesn't
like guys like me much.

286
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,208
But thanks to her...
I've snapped out of it!

287
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Tomorrow... Without fail...

288
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,208
I'll confess my
feelings to my beloved!

289
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,750
And then... if she turns me
down I'm through with school...

290
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,666
If it's over, then so be it...

291
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,958
I'll have settled
things once and for all.

292
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,291
But Hario...

293
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,750
A love letter, and my
withdrawal from school...

294
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,166
You're quitting school...?

295
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,791
Are you sure you want to
jeapordize your whole future?

296
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,375
It's all right...

297
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,791
I only went back to school this
year so I could be close to her.

298
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,541
So it doesn't matter now.

299
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,083
Then I suppose... you won't
be staying here much longer...

300
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,625
Unless you want to,

301
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,458
you're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

302
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,583
Thank you. For taking
care of me 'til now.

303
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,916
Don't mention it...

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,625
It was nice having someone
here when I came home...

305
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:01,458
So thank you... And, keep
working on your drawing, okay?

306
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,166
After school today,
up on the roof...

307
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,500
I'll finally know
where I stand...

308
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,291
I did what needed to be done...

309
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,958
I guess that's about it...

310
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,083
This waiting is murder...

311
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,125
What should
I do 'til school's out?

312
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,583
She loves me...

313
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,958
She loves me not...
She loves me...

314
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:54,250
She loves me not... She loves
me... She loves me not...

315
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,750
She loves me...

316
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,416
She loves me not... She loves
me... She loves me not...

317
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,458
She loves me...

318
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,625
She loves me not...
She loves me...

319
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,916
She...

320
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,333
Harima...

321
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,125
I read your letter.

322
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,791
Finally... Finally, she knows...

323
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,958
And now that she does...

324
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,625
What will happen to me?

325
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,583
♪ The first time... ♪

326
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,250
♪ You looked in
my direction... ♪

327
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,666
♪ You took away my senses ♪

328
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,125
♪ and you captured all
the love in my heart... ♪

329
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,583
♪ My eyes have never strayed
from this miracle of art. ♪

330
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:21,333
♪ So believe in me, baby, when I
tell you that I am for real! ♪

331
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:27,791
♪ I made some mistakes,
but no mistake in how I feel! ♪

332
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:32,333
♪ Please just trust me, and
ride with me up on the wind ♪

333
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,500
♪ and give my
love a chance! ♪

334
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,916
♪ And if ever we part,
then go back to the start, ♪

335
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,625

336
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:46,083
♪ The wind will
carry me to you! ♪

337
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,583
Now that you know
how I really feel...

338
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,291
what will you do?

339
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,208
Uh... Look, Harima, I...

340
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,791
I'm sorry... I didn't...

341
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,916
Listen... I didn't mean to
read your resignation letter,

342
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,250
but somehow it was in my locker!

343
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,958
I did it again!

344
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,208
I put the letters in
the wrong envelopes!

345
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,750
Harima...! What is it...?
What's the matter?!

346
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,458
My last chance
at love... Ruined!

347
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,875
Hey... Harima...?
I wish you wouldn't...

348
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,375
I wish you'd come back...
Okay, Harima?

349
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,291
Okay.

350
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,875
Mr. Tani!

351
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,125
Huh?

352
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,833
I found this lying outside.

353
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:41,875
A letter from Harima...?
I wonder what...

354
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,500
So... I decided to come back...

355
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,541
Here I am...

356
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,125
I see, and... You are...?

357
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,291
I'm Kentarou Nara.

358
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,041
I went to the pool
with some buddies,

359
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,375
and we ran into
Tenma and her friends!

360
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,875
Are we lucky or what?

361
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:24,750
Next time on School Rumble:
"Nara! Karasuma! Harima!"

362
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,333
To tell the truth...
I've always liked Tenma...
