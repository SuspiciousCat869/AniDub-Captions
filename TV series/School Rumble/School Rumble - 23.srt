1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,208
School Rumble...

2
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,166
rocks your world!

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,625
Stay tuned to see hot girls!

4
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,916
Shigeo Umezu, Class 2-C,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,583
track and field team,
seventeen years old.

6
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:18,666
His girlfriend...

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,583
Madoka Kido... also on the team.

8
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,083
They haven't been dating long...

9
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,791
They began going out
over the summer...

10
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,208
and things have been
going pretty well...

11
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,833
there's just one small problem.

12
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,458
I can't kiss her!

13
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,166
What's wrong with me...?

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,375
I've had dozens of chances

15
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,125
and I blew every
single one of them...!

16
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,291
I'm such a loser!

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,625
Well, no more!

18
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,083
Today at the athletic meet
I'll show off what I can do.

19
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,916
That's when I'll make my move!

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,416
Just wait, Madoka,

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
when I win this race I'll
take you in my arms and...

22
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,250
Oh baby!!

23
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,625
It's a pig! There's a pig
running wild on the track!

24
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,500
Umezu's been hit by a pig!

25
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,666
Is everything okay... Shigeo?

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,875
Madoka!

27
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,583
Sorry.

28
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,875
It's not your fault.
Blame the pig!

29
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,250
Oh, man...

30
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,708
I can't tell her
I wanted to impress her

31
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,333
so I could get a kiss.

32
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,666
Try not to be too
disappointed, okay...?

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,416
I'll make up for it in my race!

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,625
Girls are tough, too, y'know!

35
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,083
They will be with you there!

36
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,958
So... I have
something to ask you.

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,291
Huh?

38
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,583
If I come in first in my event,

39
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,875
will you give me
a kiss as a reward?

40
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,291
Did you swallow the wrong way?

41
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,916
I've been worrying
about it all this time,

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,791
and she just throws
it out there...?!

43
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,583
So, what do you say?

44
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:42,958
Well, think about it.

45
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,750
You're a shoo-in to come
in first, anyway, Madoka...

46
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,208
I mean, it's not a
reward if it's a sure thing.

47
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,541
What am I doing?!

48
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,916
She's handing it
to me on a platter

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,583
and I'm talking her out of it!

50
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,458
Hey... it was supposed
to be a reward.

51
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,708
Well then... I guess I have
to win the race, don't I?

52
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,458
Gotta go! I'm up next!

53
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,416
Oh...! Okay!

54
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:13,458
How do I say it?
Women are... Women are...

55
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,958
Yahoo!

56
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,791
Huh...?! Napoleon...!
What're you doin' here?!

57
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,916
Oh, thank you!
Thank you for seeing me!

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,250
Try to be more careful!

59
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:15,750
Oh, man, I am absolutely beat.

60
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:16,916
Think that kid was
the last injury

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,458
left from the cavalry battle.

62
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,291
I can finally
take a breather.

63
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,583
Huh?

64
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,375
Whoops... looks like
I spoke too soon.

65
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,333
Come in!

66
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,916
Did you get hurt?
In the cavalry battle?

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,333
Huh...? Uh... no...

68
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,750
Hm...? Then what seems
to be the problem?

69
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,291
Oh, um... well I...

70
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,833
I did get hurt, but...
it's not a big deal really...

71
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,166
So I thought I'd just slip
in here and get a compress...

72
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,875
I didn't want to bother
you with something so minor.

73
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,416
Well don't worry about that,

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,166
it's what I'm here
for, y'know...!

75
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,583
You can come in no matter
what the problem is.

76
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,666
All right then...

77
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,541
Let's have a look at
your injury, shall we?

78
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,791
You're supposed to run in the
relay next, isn't that right?

79
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,125
Oh... yes...

80
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,125
Then let's take care of this so
you'll be able to.

81
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,375
I have to say, you
seem different somehow

82
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,125
from the first time we met.

83
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,666
Huh...? Wait, have you
and I met before?

84
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,583
She doesn't remember... that...?

85
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,041
Not at all...?
She didn't even see me?

86
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,375
Oh, I bet I know!

87
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,958
You were there when
I was hugging Hario

88
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,166
in the infirmary the
other day, weren't you?

89
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,083
Hario?

90
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,916
I guess that didn't look too
good for either of us, did it?

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,541
But really, it was nothing.

92
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,041
It's just that I hadn't
seen him in a very long time

93
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,000
and I'm afraid
I got carried away.

94
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,625
Why do you call him "Hario?"

95
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,916
Huh...? Oh, right,
it's Harima.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,250
Sorry, it's an old habit,

97
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,583
you might say it's
sort of a nickname.

98
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,625
Oh... so...

99
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,625
You and Harima
know each other...

100
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,291
you're, like,
old friends... right?

101
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,916
Well...

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,875
Now what would be the
best way to explain it...

103
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,583
our relationship, I mean.

104
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,666
I guess I was his landlady...

105
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,416
And he was my tenant, at least
in a manner of speaking.

106
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,083
Huh?

107
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,416
So you see...

108
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,000
You don't have to worry.

109
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,541
Worry about what?

110
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,916
Well, I thought...

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,125
I just thought you might
be jealous... was I wrong?

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,333
Heh...! Whatever gave you
that idea...? Me, jealous?

113
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,541
Don't be silly! I was
just curious, that's all!

114
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,375
I mean, if there's something
going on between the school's

115
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,250
most notorious delinquent and
the gorgeous young school nurse,

116
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,125
who wouldn't wanna know?

117
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,375
The gorgeous young
school nurse...?

118
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,708
I like that, it makes me
sound like a romance heroine.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,833
I have to get back,
it's almost time.

120
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,750
But wait... what
about your injury?

121
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,875
I'll just go ahead and
take this with me... Thanks.

122
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,125
Are you sure you're okay?

123
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,250
You're really worried
about me, aren't you?

124
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,458
That's very kind...

125
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,625
But you don't
have to be concerned,

126
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,875
I think I'm gonna
be just fine now.

127
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,625
Okay...

128
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,625
Coming up next is
the girls' relay race,

129
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,250
second year division!

130
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,916
Class C still leads
with 220 points,

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,875
but Class D is breathing
down their necks with 218!

132
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,833
Runners on your marks!

133
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,500
It all comes down to these final
events, the relay races...!

134
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,958
They hold the key
to the championship!

135
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,416
Get set!

136
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,208
And there they go!!

137
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,250
Yay, Mikoto, go get 'em,
you can do it,

138
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,041
burn rubber on the double!

139
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,791
Class C has taken the lead...!
And the gap is growing wider!

140
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,833
Mihara!

141
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,958
And the second
runner is on her way!

142
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,458
Attaway, Mihara, go, go!

143
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,125
2-C's Kozue Mihara is
really putting on the steam!

144
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,208
Class D is falling way behind!

145
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,708
Oh, come on, Harima!

146
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,958
The only reason I got hurt was

147
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,875
because your stupid pig
ran out into the middle

148
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,666
of the hundred meter
race and tripped me!

149
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,791
Don't you think you owe it to me

150
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,083
to take my place
in the men's relay?

151
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,750
Did this jerk
hurt you, Napoleon...?

152
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,000
Show me the boo-boo!

153
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,416
I'm talking to you, pig boy!

154
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,416
I'm begging you...

155
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,125
No way... no how.

156
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,250
Come on, you've gotta do it...!

157
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,791
And why the hell are you
keeping that dumb pig

158
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,208
in school in the
first place...?!

159
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,750
I'll turn you in to
the health department!

160
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,583
Hey, shut up...!
It's none of your business

161
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,791
where I keep my pig or
my giraffe or my elephant,

162
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:42,958
so just butt out...!

163
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,250
Now get outta my face!

164
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,750
Oh, there you are!

165
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,166
Huh?

166
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,416
Class C's Megumi Sagano
is still in the lead...!

167
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,000
The fourth runner
is Eri Sawachika...!

168
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,916
It's Class C's to win or lose!

169
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,125
No one is gonna beat me,
no matter what!

170
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,416
Bring it!

171
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,541
And Sawachika is off
like a streak of light...!

172
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,416
And talk about great form...!

173
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,291
She's as beautiful
as she is fast!

174
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,958
Look at her go, she's amazing!

175
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,708
Something's wrong.

176
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,958
Huh?

177
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,083
Eri can usually run
a lot faster than this.

178
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,666
She hurt her leg?

179
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,083
Well... yes... do you
know if she twisted her leg

180
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,208
in any way during
the cavalry battle?

181
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,666
Hario... I mean,
Harima, you were

182
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,875
on the same team, weren't you?

183
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,625
Uh... I guess...

184
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,250
She came into the
infirmary earlier.

185
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,083
She told me it was
nothing really serious...

186
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,625
But it's been
bothering me ever since.

187
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,125
Could it have been...
when she...

188
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,416
Ugh...! This isn't
any of my concern...!

189
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,625
She's the one who
shaved off my whiskers...!

190
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,458
It serves her right!

191
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,958
Come... Napoleon... lunch.

192
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,583
You're going?

193
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,166
I have a pig to feed.

194
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,250
My ankle is killing me...!

195
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,958
I can't stand it...! Come on,
just a little farther...

196
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,750
I don't know how
much more I can take...

197
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,541
my legs feel like lead...
but... I will not lose!!

198
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,500
The baton...! Where's
the baton...?! Come on...

199
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,125
There you go.

200
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,916
It's only a minor sprain.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,583
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

202
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,291
Just doing my job!

203
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,250
Wow, Eri, you really
had me worried...!

204
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,625
Does it feel all right?

205
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,791
Yeah...

206
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,416
Hey, the boys' relay
is about to start...

207
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,750
you wanna go watch it?

208
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,500
No, I don't think so...

209
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,500
I think I'll just
rest here for a while...

210
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll be fine...
but thanks anyway, okay?

211
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,583
Well, okay, see you later!

212
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,916
Rich Girl...
This next race... is for you.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,541
But after that
we're even... got it?!

214
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,958
At last, the final
event of the meet!

215
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,291
The boys' relay...!
In the second year division,

216
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,375
Class D is on top, with
Class C five points behind!

217
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,916
This is it, we gotta take
first place if we wanna win!

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,083
We can do it...
we've just got to!

219
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,458
Will we have to play a
penalty game if we lose?

220
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:26,166
And here come our heroic
gladiators onto the field!

221
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,583
Hey, Imadori!

222
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,208
Oh, Miko!

223
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,875
Hey, what up?

224
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,250
Try not to screw
this up the way you did

225
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,833
the cavalry battle, 'kay?

226
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,541
Aw, give me a break, will ya?

227
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,958
I didn't do it on purpose...

228
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,583
Please don't hold it against me.

229
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,791
Listen... also...

230
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,916
Thanks for blocking
Harry's kick for me,

231
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,291
that was a really
sweet thing to do.

232
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,125
Oh, Mikoto, will
you give me a kiss

233
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,875
if we win the
relay race, please?!

234
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,750
Had to spoil it, didn't you?!

235
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,625
Yoo-hoo! Asou!

236
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,916
Over here!

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,625
I'm rooting for you...!
Give it your best shot, okay?

238
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,958
Sara!

239
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,250
You sneaky S.O.B...!

240
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,541
And when did you hook up
with this one, Don Juan?

241
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,958
It's not like that!

242
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,166
Oh, sure it's not...!
Come on, what's your secret...?

243
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,375
You gotta give the
rest of us a chance!

244
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,791
Yakumo's watching!

245
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,750
You go get 'em, Harima!

246
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:24,625
Come on!

247
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,333
Do your best! Go Shadow Warrior!

248
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,291
Tenma's watching!
Don't screw up!

249
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,625
Yakumo!

250
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,250
Tenma!

251
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,041
What the heck?

252
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,250
What happened to those guys?

253
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,291
They look like they've
been hit in the side

254
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,375
of the head with a two-by-four!

255
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,416
Hey...! Are you guys all right?

256
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,333
Get in the game,
you drool monkeys!

257
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,833
Well, this is about par
for the course.

258
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,208
What's this?

259
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,333
There's some kind of
disturbance on the Class C team!

260
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,875
Oh. Looks like they need
to work on their focus!

261
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,291
That's so pathetic.

262
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,375
They're just suckers for women.

263
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,083
I thought they were gonna be a
real challenge, but I guess not.

264
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,500
úWhen it comes right down to it,

265
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,458
they're just a bunch of
weak-minded, lovesick pansies.

266
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,958
Okay men...! You have
to understand the relay

267
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,583
is different from individual
short distance races!

268
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,166
What I'm about to tell you
could mean the difference

269
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,083
between victory and defeat,
so listen up and listen good!

270
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,875
In a relay it's all about
how you handle the baton!

271
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,958
The timing of the handoff

272
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,916
is absolutely critical
to the outcome!

273
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,541
Now wait just a minute,
that's what I was going to say!

274
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,083
You seem to know a
lot about this, Imadori...

275
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,166
I'm surprised.

276
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,416
This race will make up

277
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,166
for our screw-ups
during the cavalry battle!

278
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,750
Aw, come on,
I was gonna say that too!

279
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,666
Hey... I can be serious
about things now

280
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,083
and then when I have to.

281
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,708
Think about it, if we pull
this off, we'll be heroes!

282
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,208
Harima... you take
the anchor position.

283
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,375
Who do you think
you're givin' orders to...?

284
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,958
Just take it easy, Mr. Big Shot.

285
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,041
Runners on your marks!

286
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,083
Get set!

287
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,833
And they're off!

288
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,666
Geez, he's fast...!

289
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,083
But that's what
I'd expect from 2-D...!

290
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,083
I've never even
seen this guy before!

291
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,500
Class D takes the lead!

292
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,583
Crap!

293
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,916
And now Class C
has passed the baton!

294
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,708
That guy's fast!

295
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,875
Will ya look at that?!

296
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,875
Runner Asou is
giving it his all!

297
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,750
He's overtaken the top
runner in scant seconds!

298
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,958
Imadori!

299
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,250
Leave it to me!

300
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,083
What's that idiot doing?!

301
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,083
What's this?

302
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,583
Imadori is in a
crouching start?!

303
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,333
That's is unheard of!

304
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:48,166
I should've known...!
Once a moron, always a moron!

305
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,041
Here!

306
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,541
What are you doing, ya pinhead?!

307
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,583
Move it!!

308
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,875
Game time!

309
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,708
Mm-kay, he's started tumbling...

310
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,833
in an impressive display
but the wrong event...!

311
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,166
He's now running!

312
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,166
This some kind of
strategic maneuver?

313
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,708
Heh, heh, heh...!
Did you see that...?

314
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,750
I started tumbling so
I could build up speed...!

315
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,416
I call it the Imadori Special!

316
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,458
Whatever it was, it sucked!

317
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,500
Class 2-D has taken the lead!

318
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,083
Whoopsie.

319
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,625
Hey! Come back!

320
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,125
Don't let the crowd
fool you, it's over.

321
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,333
With me and Harry left
against you... it's a shoo-in.

322
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,625
You know what...?

323
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,416
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

324
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Oh...? You think so...?

325
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,500
Has your class delinquent
suddenly straightened up?

326
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,333
Hmph!

327
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,625
Remember, I'm not a patient man!

328
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,458
Hmph!

329
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,291
And here comes
Imadori... finally!

330
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,958
Don't worry, Imadori, I'll do
the best I can to make up!

331
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,583
Imadori special!

332
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,791
No! Don't!

333
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,291
And listen to Hanai roar!
What energy!

334
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,291
He's running like a demon!

335
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,750
It's like the god of speed
has entered this race!

336
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,583
It can't be...!
It's impossible...!

337
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,375
Hanai's gaining on me!

338
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,250
Ugh... and what's
with that yell...

339
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,041
it's driving me crazy.

340
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,083
Can't... concentrate...

341
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:09,416
It's okay...! We can still win
this...! Stay focused, got it?!

342
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,250
Come on...

343
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,750
So hurry up and go already.

344
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,791
What?!

345
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,958
Oh, didn't you know...?

346
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,583
When I win it'll be
much more impressive

347
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:21,333
if I come from behind, so
please, take your head start.

348
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,458
Come and get me...
samurai haircut.

349
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,750
You can count on it...

350
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,625
and you can leave
my hair outta this.

351
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,166
Hair...

352
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,125
Oh, crap...! What if my hat
falls off while I'm running?!

353
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,083
Ahh! Here he comes!

354
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,416
Harima! Take the baton!

355
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,416
The men of 2-C
are counting on you!

356
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,666
Man... you don't
care who gets hurt

357
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,750
in your relentless pursuit
of victory, do you?

358
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,291
I have no choice!

359
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,125
Let's do this!

360
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, wow, I don't believe it!

361
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,416
He actually gives a crap!

362
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,708
Harima!

363
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,791
What's gotten into him?

364
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,166
Oh, wow, look at him go!

365
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,416
It's incredible!

366
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,375
I don't believe it...
he's really doing it!

367
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,250
Way to go, Harima!

368
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,875
Whoa! Harima is even drawing
the cheers of the other classes!

369
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,208
Every second counts!

370
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,083
I've gotta reach the goal
before my hat falls off!

371
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,083
Ahh! The faster I run,
the more it slips!

372
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,458
Dear, Lord...

373
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,125
I know this is the first time
I've ever prayed... but please.

374
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,375
Give me... a miracle!!

375
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,958
Impossible!

376
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,541
Goal!!...!
Kenji Harima is first...!

377
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,583
Class C wins the championship!

378
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,416
Now that the competition's over,

379
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,250
I gotta say you're
a beautiful dancer.

380
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,250
Argh!! I hate when there aren't
enough girls for partners!

381
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,833
And why does the
committee chairman have

382
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,333
to get stuck with this job?

383
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,666
I had no idea you were
so delicate and graceful.

384
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,875
Me...? Do you really think so?

385
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,125
Hello.

386
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,333
Where... is... he?

387
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,125
Looks like Karasuma's
DJing tonight too.

388
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,791
Everyone's acting like
they haven't noticed...

389
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,666
they're just dancing away
like everything's normal...

390
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,291
Oh, well... at least now I won't
have to hide my head anymore.

391
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,208
And it looks like I'm back
to being all alone again...

392
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,833
I suppose... that's best
for a delinquent like me.

393
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,750
Dance with me.

394
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,166
What, are you kidding
me, Rich Girl...?

395
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,750
You with that bum leg...

396
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,750
...and me with
my bald... head...

397
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,916
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

398
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,958
If you're dancing with me,

399
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,833
you gotta hold your head up
high, you got it...? Okay...

400
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,458
Rich Girl... you okay?

401
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,583
Don't worry about it...

402
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,750
I'm fine... You know what...?

403
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,791
Today was a good day.

404
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,291
Oh, man... check it out!

405
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,458
Hey, is that Eri?!

406
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,958
Y'know something, Whiskers?

407
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,750
What?

408
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,083
You're... a really lousy dancer.

409
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:16,041
Is a person's fate controlled
by money, or by chance...?

410
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,791
This is the perpetual mystery

411
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,583
that drifts over
the sea of time.

412
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,000
Next time on School Rumble:

413
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,833
"Irritation. Indecision.
Wandering."

414
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,666
Stormy weather is coming.
