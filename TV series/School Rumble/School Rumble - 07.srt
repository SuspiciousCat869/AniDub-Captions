1
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,500
Do you ever
remember it, my love...

2
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,208
that day on the white bench?

3
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,083
What an incredible
glorious day...!

4
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,916
Spring has finally come!

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,833
And she must be...

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,958
the goddess of
Spring... Primavera!

7
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,916
But who is she?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,750
Hey, isn't that Yakumo
Tsukamoto from Class 1-D?

9
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,083
Wow, I guess she's
always beautiful,

10
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,958
even when she's asleep.

11
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,375
Man, Some girls
have all the luck

12
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,958
Yeah.

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,416
"T" is for tea on a summers
day "Ska" is for dancing

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,250
"Mo" is for most wondrous "To"
is for toe-tappingly terrific!

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,250
"Tsukamoto" dy Haruki Hanai...

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,875
in the spring of his
sophomore year...

17
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,375
Ah Pool cleaning!

18
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,416
Why are we doing this again?

19
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,583
'Cause Hanai
volunteered our services.

20
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,625
That's our class rep for ya.

21
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,125
...and so today it's
your homeroom's turn

22
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,708
to clean the pool, okay?

23
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,625
Sir! My class will
clean the pool! Sir!

25
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,500
Huh?

26
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,875
Thanks...

27
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,875
but Class 1-D's already
been assigned to clean it...

28
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,416
We'll do it...!

29
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,875
Cleaning a pool is the dream
of all upstanding young people!

30
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,625
It is our passion, our
raison detre, our destiny!

31
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,083
I, Haruki Hanai,
have a favorite saying:

32
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:49,375
"To ignore a dirty pool shows a
lack of courage and initiative!"

33
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,583
Well, if you feel
that strongly...

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,250
He's always been a workaholic.

35
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,666
Even when he was a little kid.

36
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,333
You were childhood pals, right?

37
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,958
That's right, Haruki Hanai...

38
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:07,125
Top martial artist...
Top student... Top everything!

39
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,875
You and him,
childhood pals, huh?

40
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,083
Our class dictator and I grew up

41
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,458
studying martial arts
in the same temple

42
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,041
Oh, Yakumo...

43
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,250
To keep your immaculate hands
from being sullied by this task,

44
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:20,916
I have to put up with
everyone in class harassing me!

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
How romantic.

46
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,833
Hanai's having a one-sided love
affair with little Tsukamoto.

47
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,166
Did she just say Tsumakoto?!

48
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,750
Then... that explains...

49
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,166
Hanai is pretty
amazing, isn't he?

50
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,291
Tenma did seem pretty
impressed with the guy.

51
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,458
This can't be ignored.

52
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,291
Uh! Karasuma!

53
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,791
Smells mossy...

54
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,541
I wonder if this is his most
favorite scent in the world...

55
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,833
Could it be?

56
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,208
You've got to be kidding me.

57
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,333
I'm doing this all
for you, dear Yakumo...

58
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,750
Please let my scrubbing
not be in vain!

59
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,375
You know...

60
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,916
I'll always remember the two
of us under the blue sky...

61
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:20,333
A swallow! How lovely!
And speaking of...

62
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,000
It's Yakumo!

63
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,708
Yakumo, please you've
got to wake up...!

64
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,916
It's not safe to sleep out here!

65
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,875
She's still sound asleep.

66
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,375
What should I do...? Uh... Uh...

67
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,666
I know.

68
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,916
One sweet kiss!

69
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,041
Exercise!

70
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,791
That's how I need to think
of all this, as exercise...!

71
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,291
Building my muscles up for
my beautiful beloved Yakumo!

72
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,625
Whoa, didja see that?!

73
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,916
Harima totally
missed Hanai's slapshot!

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,250
He can be a real jerk at times,

75
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,375
but Hanai's an amazing athlete!

76
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,916
It appears that
you lost something,

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,375
so I was just trying to return
it to you as a courtesy...

78
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,375
Too fast for you, eh?

79
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,083
Whatever, big man...

80
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,333
But hey, if that's the way you
wanna play it, then fine by me.

81
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,750
Whoa! Check it out!

82
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,208
They're locked in a dead heat!

83
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,791
Yeah, it's anybody's game...!

84
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,833
Wait... but maybe not...

85
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,458
Would you look at that?

86
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,000
For all his bad-boy posturing,

87
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,458
Harima turned out to be a
real wuss, don't you think?

88
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,250
Actually, he's doing
better than I expected,

89
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,416
especially for a guy
who's not into sports.

90
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,708
And don't forget:

91
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,250
he's holding his own
against a Shorinji student

92
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,541
who has a black belt in Kenpo.

93
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,000
A master of martial arts
can't lose to a common thug...!

94
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,916
This ends now!

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,708
Hey, Sis.

96
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,208
Yakumo!

97
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,750
In your face, jerk!

98
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,583
Oh, dammit!

99
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,166
Hey, it's Yakumo, the new
girl everyone's drooling over.

100
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,666
Wow, she really is pretty!

101
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,000
My teacher sent me out

102
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,625
to see how the cleaning
was coming along.

103
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,625
What do they think we've
been doing out here today?

104
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,541
Goofing off?

105
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,583
Never fear, Miss Tsukamoto!

106
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,000
We're working hard...!

107
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,791
We took a short break to
test out our hockey skills...

108
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,125
and nothing more!

109
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,458
Oh, hey, what's up Hanai...?

110
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,375
I didn't know that
you knew Yakumo.

111
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,916
Hey, why don't we
take this competition

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,666
beyond mere child's play...?!

113
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,666
Let's engage in a
real battle instead...!

114
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,791
As you know...

115
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,208
The School Festival
is approaching...

116
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,375
And if you want a say in
what the class does this year,

117
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,291
get down here and join
me on the playing field!

118
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,708
Have you gone insane?!

119
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,583
I haven't been able to
decide which would be better:

120
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,166
putting on a play or setting up

121
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,458
a booth that
sells refreshments...

122
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,166
A friendly game will
help with our decision...

123
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,333
unless somebody objects!

124
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,291
You know, he wants to
impress Yakumo so much

125
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,125
that it's actually
kind of scary.

126
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,541
Guys always fall to
pieces when they're in love.

127
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,958
I'll play!
This sounds really fun!

128
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,750
Uh, wait, count me in, too!

129
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,833
Great! Who else?!

130
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,583
They're actually going to play?

131
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,125
We need some more players!

132
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,000
You gonna do it?

133
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,583
I'll do it if you do it, man!

134
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,250
Well, I think I'll watch a round
first and see how it turns out.

135
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,416
You can count me in, too,

136
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,791
but I'm on the school
play team, 'kay?

137
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,875
You're playing?

138
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,750
Sure. Why not?
I mean, it'll be fun.

139
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,208
You're going to play,
too, right, Mikoto?

140
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,291
Yeah, but I'll be
playing for the booth.

141
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,750
Does it even matter?

142
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,375
Super awesome booth team unite!

143
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,708
Super class play team unite!

144
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,541
You're goin' down, Akira!

145
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,958
We'll see about that.

146
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,541
Princess Aurora is here.

147
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,666
She pricked her finger
on an enchanted spindle

148
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,041
and fell into a slumber that
lasted for one hundred years.

149
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,958
But now... she will
finally be awakened

150
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,125
by a kiss from the Prince.

151
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,583
I know that story.

152
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,916
It's "Sleeping Beauty"...
Right?

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,375
Right! I'll play the Prince!

154
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,750
And Yakumo will make the
perfect Princess Aurora!

155
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,875
We are gonna put on...
the best play... ever!

156
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,875
You are so sad

157
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,750
Hey, Asou, you want in?

158
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,833
Take your pick, but it looks
like everone's betting on Hanai.

159
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,583
Then put me down for Harima.

160
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,541
Way to go! That's the spirit!

161
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,000
Akira and her friends are so
stylish, so sophisticated...

162
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,333
And don't forget beautiful!

163
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,333
They're considered the
prettiest girls in school.

164
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,791
Honestly, I do get
a little jealous over

165
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,541
all the attention they get.

166
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,958
Okay, you guys!
All together now!

167
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,916
Go!

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,375
Alright! Go, booth, go!

169
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:07,916
Again!

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,208
Go, booth, go!

171
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:09,750
What's that?!

172
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,583
Go, booth, go!

173
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,875
Say it loud!

174
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,583
Well, I guess I'll
just tell my teacher

175
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,416
that everything is
going along as usual.

176
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,625
Yayyyy, okay, take five!

177
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,250
Yakumo... for you... I...

178
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,958
He's really gone nuts.

179
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,791
The match will now begin.
It's game time, folks.

180
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,500
Wow!

181
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,708
It's like a real game,

182
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,125
with a referee,
a stopwatch and everything!

183
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,416
Karasuma's the referee...?!

184
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,916
I've gotta make him
notice me somehow!

185
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,333
Ms. Tsukamoto... We...

186
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:54,375
We? We--what...? We...? We?

187
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,958
We're now at war?!

188
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,625
We'd like to start the game
now, so I hope you're ready.

189
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,791
Tenma my love...

190
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,500
Karasuma my love...

191
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,041
Yakumo my love...

192
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,083
This is all...

193
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,875
...for love!

194
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,708
Yes!

195
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,875
All is fair in love and war!

196
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,333
Let's start the game.

197
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,958
Well, you can taste the
excitement in the air today

198
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,708
as Class 2-C squares off
for the School Festival!

199
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,625
There's an opening!

200
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,791
Down the middle...!
Too easy! I'm going for it!

201
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,208
Harima, no, don't!

202
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,125
That's a... curve ball-!

203
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,166
What the hell?!

204
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,541
Great work, Eri!

205
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,750
A stunning move on the
part of Eri Sawachika,

206
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,375
not to mention a great
pass to her winger, Hanai!

207
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,166
Crap.

208
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,750
He's attempting to score!

209
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,291
Goalie Mikoto Suou
had better watch out!

210
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,291
Sh-She stopped it!

211
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,375
Oww!

212
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,458
Hey! Take it easy!

213
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,333
With the play
at stake? No way...

214
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:17,041
Besides, I've seen you take way
harder hits than that, Mikoto.

215
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,583
And just where
did he see that...?

216
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,583
I wanna go!

217
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,583
Probably at the
Shorinji Temple...

218
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,000
They studied Kenpo together.

219
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,083
I hear they're pretty good.

220
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,875
Huh...

221
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,125
Take this!

222
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,125
What did your grandma
teach you that?

223
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,791
Man, Mikoto's really on fire!

224
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,083
Look'it that!

225
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,333
It would be nice

226
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,916
if you kept your minds
on the game, you pervs!

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,708
Back off...!

228
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,500
You've got the wrong idea!

229
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,708
Hey, don't be so harsh.

230
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,875
We're just admiring
her athletic prowess.

231
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,416
Her prowess, huh?

232
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,291
Kick his butt Mikoto!

233
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,000
Keep it up!

234
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,083
We're rooting for you!

235
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,541
You're great, Miko!

236
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,750
Go for it!

237
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,083
Thanks, but this is
kind of embarrassing!

238
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,250
And I'm only one woman.

239
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,750
I can't do this on my own.

240
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,833
Harima! Tenma!

241
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,416
I'm counting on you!

242
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,500
Here you go, Karasuma.

243
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,875
Please enjoy!

244
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:08,625
Thank you.

245
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,333
You look lovely today.

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,416
Here you go, Harima.
Please enjoy it!

247
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,625
Thank you. You're pretty.

248
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:18,500
Don't you worry!

249
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,666
This game's in the bag, baby!

250
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,291
They're completely hopeless...

251
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,458
Here it comes!

252
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,708
You can defend all you want,

253
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,166
but that's not going to
score you any points...

254
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,291
What's that?

255
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,416
I guess I'm gonna
have to step in.

256
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,666
Huh?!

257
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,958
If Harima loses, we have
to put on a dumb play.

258
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,750
Looks like another
player's joined the game!

259
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,166
Harima, cover the center!

260
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,750
Who the hell are you?

261
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,083
Just do it!

262
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,958
Cover your own center!

263
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,250
Tenma's about to pass to you!

264
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,625
Huh?! Wha-?!

265
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,583
Center, right?! I'm so on it!

266
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,666
Tenma!

267
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,416
Yeah! I've got it!

268
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,708
It's coming your way! Block it!

269
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,250
Huh?!

270
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,875
Aw, Dammit!

271
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,833
It's yours, Harima!
Take the shot!

272
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,250
Her heart and soul gliding
across a pool of chaos.

273
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,416
This is more than just a puck!

274
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,958
So I have to pour every ounce
of energy I have into this...

275
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:30,125
Lightning flash... of love!

276
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,958
Kenji Harima...

277
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,458
That was his name before
that day, but after that shot,

278
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,000
he became known as
the Phantom Striker.

279
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,083
That's offsides... No goal.

280
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,416
What kind of a
stupid rule is that?!!

281
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,291
Stop it!

282
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,166
You can't argue with a referee!

283
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
So much for the
Phantom Striker...

284
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,083
Where's Yakumo...?
Gone, huh...? Oh, well.

285
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,791
Even if you're not here,
I promise you...

286
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,791
...a resounding victory
for your dear love!

287
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:14,708
Please, Harima,
you've got to stop this!

288
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,541
Uh... I think the game's over

289
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,416
With more players
duking it out on the field,

290
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,291
this game has
reached a fever pitch!

291
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,625
Team against team!

292
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,708
Friend against friend!

293
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,708
Oh, man...! What a fiasco!

294
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,083
They're really making fools
out of themselves out there!

295
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,750
Sure is fun to watch, though!

296
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,250
Hey, Fuyuki, why are
you goofing off over here

297
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,791
with that digital camera, huh?

298
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,125
Because...!

299
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,958
I'm capturing our golden
years in high school plus

300
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,791
a few other tasty shots!

301
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,000
Huh?

302
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,125
Like this super low angle!

303
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,291
Oww!

304
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,875
What are you doing, Fuyuki?

305
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,375
Uh... nothing!

306
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,125
Crap...! Missed her!

307
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,666
Just suck it up...
Can't get discouraged.

308
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,291
After all, I'm lucky to
be a great photographer

309
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,208
and to be in a class filled
with so many red hot babes!

310
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,916
He... seems to be
really dedicated, huh?

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,750
Yeah. Too bad it's not
to photography, though.

312
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,958
Stop it!

313
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:28,916
I'm sorry what?

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,250
You little pervert!

315
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,458
You're taking smutty
pictures again, aren't you?!

316
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,583
Smutty?! How dare you?!

317
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,083
I take offense to that...!

318
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,416
What you so foolishly call
smut, I prefer to call art.

319
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, you know exactly
what it is, sleazeball...

320
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,708
and my fist is gonna show you!

321
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,500
Oh, crap...! Uh... Hey, wait...!

322
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,750
Uh... I just printed up some
really great shots of Yakumo...

323
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,791
Can I interest you
in buying a set of ten?

324
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,166
You vile brute...!

325
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,916
You would even
dare to sell them...?!

326
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,583
How much are they?!

327
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,416
One hundred.

328
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,375
That's Too much!

329
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,541
I beg to differ.

330
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,250
They're a bargain
at twice the price...

331
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,083
She's in her summer uniform...

332
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,916
So, Mina... You think
Hanai will give in?

333
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,458
Maybe... sure looks like it.

334
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,083
Do you see how your Dojo-mate's
embarrassing himself?

335
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,750
I don't know him!

336
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,916
They're too expensive!

337
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,125
You've won this round... Fuyuki!

338
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,541
If I'm not taking photos,
I'm losing money...!

339
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,250
And with all the hot
babes in action out here,

340
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,458
I could make a real
bundle selling the pictures!

341
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,833
Yeah...! Work it!

342
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,750
Well, at least you
have good taste...

343
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,750
But do you have the talent
to capture a girl's essence

344
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,750
and her style in a perfect shot?

345
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,083
I just got the perfect shot
of you, Ms. Tsukamoto!

346
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,916
Me?! Are you sure?!

347
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,750
But... I'm not what you'd
call a very photogenic person!

348
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,583
A camera doesn't lie and it
sees things that others can't...

349
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:02,125
So be honest...
You're in love, aren't you?

350
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,083
That's just the look I want...!

351
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,541
You're a natural,
you know that?!

352
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,916
You're perfect...!

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,750
If you don't mind me
saying, you're just as

354
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,333
pretty as Mikoto and Akira!

355
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,291
That slimy creep
didn't even notice me!

356
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,541
Huh?

357
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,083
Nice of you to join us.

358
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,541
The booth team's full you
must be on the play team.

359
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,166
Hey, I'm flattered you
think so, but, uh, you see,

360
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,041
I'm really not
much of an athlete.

361
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,375
Don't worry about it
sweety I'll help you out.

362
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,166
I'll get your blood pumpin'!

363
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,583
Think it's clean enough?

364
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,791
Yeah, looks like
the game's over,

365
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,625
so why don't we
go fill the pool?

366
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,666
Sure!

367
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,583
Asou... let me try.

368
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,958
Huh...? Okay,
take your best shot.

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,250
Dead end, dirtbag!

370
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,041
Aw... Crap...!

371
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,250
Well, if I'm gonna die,
it might as well be worth it!

372
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,250
Mikoto!

373
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,375
Cushion my fall
with your big boobs!

374
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,375
You are so dead,
ya little twerp!

375
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,416
Get away freak!

376
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,333
Such wondrous booooooobs!

377
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,875
You're so dead!

378
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,458
No, this wasn't our fault...!

379
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,375
It was out of our control!

380
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,541
They're beautiful...

381
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,458
No! I was just trying
to stop him! Wait!

382
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,625
Watch the shades, okay?

383
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,750
We weren't able to reach a
decision today... but Yakumo...

384
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,541
I swear to you that
for the School Festival...

385
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,250
...we will put on
"Sleeping Beauty!"

386
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,625
Hey, remember how
Yakumo's a freshman...? Yeah.

387
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,541
That means that she
can't be in any play put on

388
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,958
by the sophomore class.

389
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,666
Didn't think about
that one, did ya'?

390
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,708
Hey, hey!

391
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,250
There's no reason
to shove, okay!

392
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,375
Get 'em while they're hot, boys!

393
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,458
Photos of the
gorgeous babes from 2-C!

394
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,083
Got any more shots of Mikoto?

395
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,916
Nope. All sold out! Sorry!

396
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,708
How about Eri Sawachika?
Got any of her?

397
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,750
I never had any
to begin with, dude.

398
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,416
G'day, chap! I'm
not from around here...

399
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,125
But how much for this
picture of Tenma Tsukamoto?

400
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,458
Three sets of the Yakumo
Tsukamoto pictures, please!

401
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,083
Yes, sir!

402
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,916
Thanks for the
business, big guy!

403
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,666
Hey, kid, you
don't have anything

404
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,916
to eat for lunch, either?

405
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,750
Don't worry about it,
I'll treat you!

406
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,750
So what do you like better:
curry or meat and potatoes...?

407
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,750
Next time on School Rumble:
"The First Shopping Trip!

408
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,791
The First Packed Lunch!
The First Heartbreak! Huh?!"

409
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,333
Me?!
