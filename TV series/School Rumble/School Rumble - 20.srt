1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,791
School Rumble. Coming up Next!

2
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,750
All right! We're finished!

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,083
Yeah! We can cheer
at the athletic meet.

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,333
Woo! 2-C

5
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,791
Yay...! Let's start practicing!

6
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,500
Hurray! Hurray!

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,916
You rock it... Class C!
You're a winner!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,916
Aw yeah kick it...! Go C!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,708
Eri! Watcha doin?

10
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,458
Wow! Akira, you look hot!!

11
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,416
Where did you learn to do that?!

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,208
I don't know.

13
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,083
I'm just that brilliant.

14
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,291
Woops.

15
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,750
His Whiskers!

16
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,791
Shhhhhh!

17
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,333
Stop screaming
so loud, will you?

18
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,500
Close one!

19
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,750
Oh, man, Harima
is going be so mad!

20
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,250
I can't believe you did that!

21
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,000
What the heck is
wrong with you?!

22
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,666
It was an accident!

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,041
Okay, we have a serious problem.

24
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,125
Harima seemed like he was
really attached to that beard.

25
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,125
He was just telling me
about how much he strokes it.

26
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,125
I think he looks
really cute like this!

27
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,375
He looks kind of creepy to me.

28
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:49,083
I'm not sure if "cute" is
quite the right look for him.

29
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,708
Should I take it off?

30
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,958
No! He's awaking up!

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,583
How cute!!

32
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,291
...moon hair...

33
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,250
He's looking for his whiskers!

34
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,666
Okay, I'm on it!

35
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,125
Safe!

36
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,208
Hey! What the hell was that?!

37
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,083
You got us into
this mess you know.

38
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,583
How would you like it if someone
cut off your hair like that?

39
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,458
You really need to apologize!

40
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,291
I think that beard was
really important to him.

41
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,750
I know, but how do
I make this up to him?

42
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,458
Why don't you pretend
you didn't do it?

43
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,708
I know he's scary, but I'm sure
he won't kill you or anything!

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,041
He's waking up again!

45
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,625
No, I'm not ready!
What am I gonna do?

46
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,458
We're dead! He's gonna kill us!

47
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,458
What the?

48
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,375
Huh?

49
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,250
Weird dream.

50
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,625
Safe!!

51
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,708
But now we're screwed.

52
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,166
You pretty much
ruined his life...

53
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,000
So you might want
to make it up to him.

54
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,041
I... guess I have to.

55
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,708
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

56
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,458
Hey there, Whiskers.

57
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,083
Whiskers ... What a joke.

58
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,750
What are you talking about?

59
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,833
You still have a
magnificent beard.

60
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,458
Not anymore.

61
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,875
What do you want, anyway?

62
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,083
Uh, I came to...

63
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,375
Get lost!

64
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,416
I don't want to look
at your ugly face.

65
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Get out of here!

66
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,750
What's your problem!

67
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,458
You don't have to be so mean!

68
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,583
At least give me a chance
talk to you a little bit!

69
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,416
I'm not interested in
what you have to say!

70
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,916
Leave me alone!
Get out of here now!

71
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,291
Okay, fine then! Big baby!

72
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,083
I can't believe
I was about to apologize

73
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,500
to someone as immature
as you! Stupid jerk!

74
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,541
I just thought you were

75
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,000
just gonna make fun
of me or something!

76
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,708
Turns out, the princess
just came to apologize.

77
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,750
Do you know what a serious crime

78
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,583
you've committed,
little rich girl? Do you?

79
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't call me
"little rich girl".

80
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,958
I said I'm sorry, and if
I can make it up to you, I will.

81
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,875
You serious about that?

82
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,250
All right then, from now on...

83
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,000
You will do whatever I say.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,625
It's very simple.

85
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,083
From now on, you're
going to be my henchman.

86
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,958
What the hell does that mean?

87
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,416
My henchman, my henchman!

88
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,583
That's what they call
it on the streets, yo!

89
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,250
Okay, so what exactly do I do?

90
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,833
Well, let's see, for starters...

91
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,833
Go buy me some tea.

92
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,625
Well, what do you know...

93
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,708
The Princess has now
become the servant.

94
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,125
Here!

95
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,375
What the hell is that?

96
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,625
When I said "tea"
I meant Uji Green Tea!

97
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,708
Now go to Kyoto and buy it.

98
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,250
What...?! Go to Kyoto?
Are you crazy?

99
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,291
You know I can't
possibly do that!

100
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:15,250
My chin feels so bare.
I wonder why?

101
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,583
Do you like apples?

102
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,083
Well how do you
like them apples?

103
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,666
This'll teach her a lesson.

104
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,375
You know, I think this is just

105
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,666
what that stuck up
little rich girl needs.

106
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,041
Okay, fine.

107
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,291
This is not going to
be easy, so be patient.

108
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,583
I'll have it delivered.

109
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,750
Oh, uh, nevermind.

110
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,625
Damn it!

111
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,458
I forgot... you should never
underestimate rich people!

112
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,791
That was too easy for her,

113
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,916
I've got to think of
something else... Eureka!

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,375
Hey you, ... rich girl...

115
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,875
What now?

116
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,250
I have this really awesome hat

117
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,666
and I think it would
look fantastic on you.

118
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,291
Could I get you to try
it on for me? Maybe? Hm?

119
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,666
Uh, okay.

120
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,583
Damn that looks good!

121
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,083
You look awesome! Ha...

122
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,833
Tenma ...

123
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,000
She's going to
be so disappointed

124
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,625
when she finds out
my whiskers are gone.

125
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:15,833
How am I gonna face her?

126
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,708
I really suck at apologizing.

127
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,916
Harima.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,291
Do you need any help getting up?

129
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,708
No.

130
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,416
I really meant it went
when I said I was sorry...

131
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
Please forgive me.

132
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,541
It doesn't matter now.
My beard's gone anyway.

133
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,791
Seriously... you are
way too stubborn.

134
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:43,125
Why is having a beard
so important to you anyway?

135
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,333
I happen to think you
look better without it.

136
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,541
I don't give a
damn what you think.

137
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,333
I'm gonna grow my beard out.

138
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,791
No matter what.

139
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,875
Hey! Eri!!

140
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,416
How are things going?

141
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,875
It doesn't look like
it's going all that well.

142
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,625
Yeah, I know.

143
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,541
Actually, you're
here just in time.

144
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,458
I have a question for you.

145
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,541
Do you think high school guys

146
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,916
look more handsome with...
or without whiskers?

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,125
Without, duh.

148
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,208
There, you see!
Are you even listening?

149
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,375
Oh yeah! I'm listening!

150
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,958
Wow! You look pretty
handsome without a beard.

151
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,791
I could even fall for ya!

152
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,333
I'm alive again!

153
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,916
You're absolutely right!

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,583
Clean-shaven is the
best look for a man!

155
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,166
So you wanna be clean shaven?

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,875
Consider it... Done

157
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,166
Hmmm...

158
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,416
Oh, I was going to
erase the beard later.

159
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,666
The story is pretty interesting,

160
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,375
but it does seem like
it's lacking something...

161
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,625
I don't know, I think there're
some changes you need to make.

162
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,208
Like... What?

163
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,750
I think you should have
a friend take a look at it.

164
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,416
A friend?
You serious about that?

165
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,583
Yeah. Someone who could
help you polish it up.

166
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,000
For God's sake!

167
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,708
A delinquent like me
doesn't have friends!

168
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,458
Not any that can read anyway!

169
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,875
Crap...!

170
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,958
That's what I get
for being such a loner.

171
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,458
A Friend? This is
gonna be a problem.

172
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,083
Itoko? Naw, that's no good.

173
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,625
Too embarrassing.

174
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,208
I could ask Pyotr.

175
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,041
No, I'm not sure if he
can understand the beauty

176
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,000
of a love story like this one.

177
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,416
My classmates...

178
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,291
They'll never understand my art!

179
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,125
Aw, man...

180
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,416
What? That's Mangoku!!

181
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,583
I can't believe it!

182
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,208
That's Koji Yakushamaru,
the actor

183
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,041
who plays Mangoku in
"Three for the Kill"!

184
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,250
Mangoku! I love you!!

185
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,125
Did someone forget this?

186
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,916
I can't believe it!

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,083
I actually got
Mangoku's autograph!

188
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,750
This is so awesome!

189
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,791
I wonder who it could be...

190
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,625
Hi.

191
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,416
Did you see it?

192
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,041
Oh... Harima... I didn't know...

193
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,666
Tenma's sister,
if I'd known you worked here,

194
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,041
I wouldn't have come...
Promise me!

195
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,583
Please Don't tell
anyone you saw this, kay?

196
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:48,166
Um, O... kay, I won't.

197
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,041
Thanks. See you later then.

198
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,250
Um... I uh...

199
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,250
So... what did you think?

200
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,250
Huh?

201
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,666
I mean... about my Comic.

202
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,666
That's the part!
Come on, laugh!!

203
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,958
No reaction? What's going on?!

204
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,125
Um ... Are you...?

205
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,750
Oh, I'm sorry, Tenma's sister!

206
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,958
Ignore me!
I'll turn around, okay?

207
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,333
She's coming to the
best part of the story.

208
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,000
All right! A reaction!

209
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,791
Oh. Page 6 and Page 9
are switched around.

210
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,875
What the hell?!

211
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,791
So, what did you think?

212
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,583
Well, I thought...
it was promising.

213
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,750
That was a lie. I can tell.

214
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,250
No one can fool me that easily.

215
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,666
But, I'm not;
that sure about the boy

216
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,208
who's the main character...

217
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,791
Here it comes... the truth.

218
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,416
I think he's too
dangerous and... selfish.

219
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,125
I knew it. It's no good.
I'm just a stupid delinquent!

220
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,416
And, who ever thought

221
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,291
I could write a comic
in the first place?

222
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,291
Heh. Oh well. I'll just
have to give this up.

223
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,083
Minimum wage, here I come!

224
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,875
But I... I think he has a
good heart underneath it all.

225
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,125
I kind of like him,
and I think others will too.

226
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,083
And, I think...

227
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,041
it would help a lot
if this boy had someone

228
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,708
he could confide in and
share his secrets with.

229
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,583
I'm sorry! I shouldn't
have said so much.

230
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,791
I don't know anything
about writing comics!

231
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,291
You're right!

232
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,416
I can't waste any more time.

233
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,166
I have to go home
and rewrite it!

234
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,875
Thanks for the critique,
Tenma's sister.

235
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,208
When it's all done,
I'll bring it back to you.

236
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,541
What?

237
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,291
I'd really like it if
you'd read it again. Okay?

238
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,416
Uh... Of course.

239
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,541
I wish that I could thank you
for all that you've done,

240
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,291
but this is all I have...

241
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,541
Oh, wow.

242
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,375
Take it...
It's the least I can do.

243
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,833
Mangoku's autograph!!
Where did you get this?

244
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,291
It's a secret...

245
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,333
We have a final
list of competitors

246
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,875
for the Athletic Meet,

247
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,250
and we have a killer lineup,
if I do say so myself, and I do.

248
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,416
But we still need ten
people for the class relay.

249
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,208
Five girls and five boys.

250
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,833
That should be pretty easy.

251
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,458
So! Any fast runners?

252
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,416
If by fast runner you
mean a double digit mile,

253
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,125
then I'm your man. Heh-heh.

254
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,541
Well, Ume's good.

255
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,625
Yeah, there's also
Hanai, Asou, Suga...

256
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,250
Akira, come on,
don't you wanna sign up?

257
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,416
I'll do it, but only
on one condition.

258
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,250
Ugh, forget it!

259
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,625
Hey Imadori! You should sign up.

260
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,791
You're a pretty
fast runner, aren't you?

261
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,416
Imadori! Pay attention!

262
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,750
Hm?

263
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,916
Hey, Mikoto, I bet if
you enter the competition,

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,583
Imadori will too!

265
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,750
I'll kill you!

266
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,666
Hey, Hanai! I'll do it!

267
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,250
Oops, I'm sorry Mikoto.
I think he heard me!

268
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,625
Thanks a lot!

269
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,083
By the way...
What about Harima... anyone?

270
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,416
Uh, He's not here today.

271
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,333
Imadori! Please give
Harima a call for us.

272
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,916
Man! Stop ordering me around!

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,416
And, what makes
you think I would have

274
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,708
his cell phone number
in the first place?

275
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,583
What? You mean don't have it?

276
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,875
He probably doesn't even
have a cell phone, anyway.

277
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,708
He has one.

278
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,916
How would you know that?

279
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,541
Because I have his number.

280
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,416
Huh?

281
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,666
What? Do you want it?

282
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,083
As if!

283
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,916
Just Give it to Hanai will you,
so he'll leave us alone.

284
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,791
Y'know I'd love to do that,

285
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,416
but Hanai kind of
gets on my nerves,

286
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,333
so I don't really
want to help him.

287
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,666
I mean, just look at him.
He's not... right.

288
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,125
Just who in the hell
does that guy think he is?

289
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,375
All right!

290
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,416
I'm gonna go give that
guy a piece of my mind!

291
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,750
For the love everything Holy!

292
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,791
Who does he think he is,
goofing off during our meeting?

293
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,833
That stupid jerk!

294
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,291
Hey, uh...

295
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,375
I'm sorry... for dragging
you out here like... this.

296
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,958
It's okay, my classes
were over for today anyway.

297
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,375
Thanks for meeting me here.

298
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,416
Were you surprised
when you got my message?

299
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,916
Yeah, I was kind of surprised.

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,083
I know it's weird,

301
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,291
but I really want
to hear what you think.

302
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,416
So, look it over.

303
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,833
And, don't be
afraid to be honest.

304
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,791
Oh, sure.

305
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,791
The problem is with this scene.

306
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,250
See here, where I--I mean,

307
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,500
the main character
calls out to the heroine?

308
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,958
Oh, right.

309
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,250
I knew Harima would be out here!

310
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,833
Oh! He's with someone?

311
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,125
Is that ...?

312
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,333
Do you think a kiss
would be good right here?

313
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,375
Uh, oh, yes I...

314
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,875
I think that's okay.

315
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,041
I said shut up!!!

316
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,125
What's wrong?

317
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,166
It's just. I thought that
somebody was watching us.

318
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,500
People might get the wrong idea

319
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,291
if they see you and me
out here alone like this.

320
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,583
I should have thought of
that before, sorry about that.

321
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,750
Oh...

322
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,208
No, that's not what
I'm worried about...

323
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:45,041
I, um... I can't explain this,
but a minute ago,

324
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,250
I felt feelings.

325
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,041
You felt feelings?

326
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,875
It's nothing. Never mind.

327
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,416
Hanai never came back to class
after he left to find Harima.

328
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,583
I hope he didn't get
into a fight with him!

329
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,500
Mice?

330
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,791
Are you going... crazy?

331
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,875
Fear not.

332
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,791
I am going away to prepare
for the Athletic Meet.

333
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,291
Come, children!

334
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,958
My name is Lara.

335
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:59,166
When I was a child, I lived
in Mexico, my homeland.

336
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,875
I was raised by my father,
who was a luchador.

337
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,458
What's wrong, Papa?

338
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,583
Please stop drinking!

339
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,458
We don't have any
more money, Papa!

340
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,583
Karen...

341
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,000
Whenever he was drunk,
my father would call out

342
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,416
my mother's name;
even though she'd left us.

343
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,875
He still loved her.

344
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,708
There was only one thing
my father ever did for me.

345
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,916
He taught me everything
there is to know about lucha.

346
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,083
Look Lara!

347
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,458
Beyond that sun,
lies a land called Japan.

348
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,208
They say the
people there are rich

349
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,916
and they have
everything they want.

350
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,833
Let's work hard and
save all our money.

351
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,083
Then let's move there together!

352
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,333
Maybe if we get rich,

353
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,625
your mother will come
back to live with us!

354
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:49,583
So, to fulfill my father's
wish, I came to Japan.

355
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,916
Where I will become
a champion Luchadora.

356
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,916
Lara!

357
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,416
Hey! Stop your daydreaming!

358
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,750
It's time for your match!

359
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,875
Are you gonna to let
Ichijou take all the glory?

360
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,083
Come on Coach!

361
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,208
You really think I plan to lose?

362
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,958
Sorry, I...

363
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,833
On my father's honor...
I'll never lose!

364
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,750
Bring it!

365
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,500
What? A Luchadora?

366
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,583
She's trying to insult me. Fine.

367
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,291
You asked for it.
My "One Second Kill"!

368
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,500
Infierno que pasó?

369
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,208
That Ichijou girl,
she was a rookie.

370
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,916
Stop!

371
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,125
What's going on?

372
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,916
That mask! It's Ichijou!

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,125
What's she doing here?

374
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,916
What the hell?

375
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,291
Wait!!

376
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,750
Where is she...?

377
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,958
Ichijou!!

378
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,666
How dare you!

379
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,041
Why did you throw
that fight today!

380
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,666
Answer me!

381
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,875
If you're so strong why did you
not take that match seriously!

382
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,166
I can explain.

383
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,458
Explain this!!

384
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,625
She's gone!

385
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,833
Imposible!

386
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,291
She's going to...

387
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:42,833
I'm so sorry!
My reflexes just took over!

388
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,125
How did you learn
to fight like that?

389
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,916
Through training, I guess...

390
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,125
My name's Karen Ichijou.

391
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,708
Karen!

392
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,250
Was fate trying
to get my attention?

393
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,750
To hear my Mother's name
again in this strange country...

394
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:05,750
It was then I decided to
transfer to Karen's school.

395
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,708
Ichijou!
It's time for lunch now!

396
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,125
Okay...

397
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,750
Harima deserves to be punished!

398
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:17,250
That no good scoundrel had the
nerve to try to deceive Yakumo,

399
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,083
and that's not
the worst he's done!

400
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,666
Next time on School Rumble:

401
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,333
"Hanai fights back!
Karen Sparkles!

402
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,916
Reunion With Big Sister!"

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,708
And who is that?
Feel the fists of Hell, Harima!
