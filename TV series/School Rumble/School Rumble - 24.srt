1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,333
Hey, you! Don't run away!

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,833
"School Rumble"
is hot on my heels!

3
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,666
Pardon me...

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,000
...but I couldn't help
but notice the time.

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,625
Shouldn't you be dressed
for school, Mistress?

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:24,416
I should... but I'm not
going to school today.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,333
I... I don't feel like it.

8
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,750
Nakamura... um?

9
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,125
Hm?

10
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,625
Oh, never mind.

11
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,083
What to do...?

12
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,125
If I show my face at school,
I'll die of embarrassment...

13
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,541
Look, I'm tellin' you guys!
They're a couple!

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,958
What? Are you serious?

15
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,125
Well, it would
explain a few things!

16
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,750
Yeah! Like why those two
looked so cozy at the dance.

17
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,666
What two?

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,375
What do you know? It's Harima!

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,500
What are you lookin' at?

20
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,333
What the hell is this?!

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,750
No, no, it wasn't us!

22
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,333
You've gotta believe us,
dude! Please!

23
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,250
She's absent because
of her sprained ankle?!

24
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,875
Come on, she danced on it!

25
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,666
Sounds like a lame excuse...

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,583
You ask me? Depression.

27
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,083
I know...!

28
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,083
We should all go visit her
after school and cheer her up!

29
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,291
All right.

30
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,833
Heh!

31
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,791
We should take up a collection
and buy her a Get Well cake!

32
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,208
Poor little Eri!

33
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,541
Poor...?! She lives in a
mansion, for cryin' out loud!

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,416
Who the hell threw this?!

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,375
All right, who did it, huh?!

36
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,875
You better spit it out now!

37
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,791
If you don't tell me, I'm gonna
have to bleed it outta ya!

38
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:48,208
We already told you we
don't know who did it!

39
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,166
Don't say I didn't warn ya!

40
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,333
Harima...! Stop it!

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,916
Hey, why does
she look so sad...?

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,625
I didn't yell at her or nothin'.

43
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,416
Wait a minute.
If she saw that drawing...

44
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,458
Then she thinks I'm
dating that rich girl!

45
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,125
Did I break Tenma's heart!

46
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,166
Okay, well that was weird.

47
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,708
It was pretty awkward.

48
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,416
Aw, how sweet. Look,
they're sharing an umbrella.

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,583
Those two?

50
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,791
Well, duh! If
something's written down,

51
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,291
it's got to be true...

52
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,916
No, not necessarily.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,291
Wish someone would
share an umbrella with me.

54
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,125
Crap! It was that stupid
dance, wasn't it...?!

55
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,500
That's why those jerks
think we're a couple!

56
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,708
Ugh... I was just tryin'
to be nice to that rich girl!

57
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,583
It didn't mean anything!

58
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,208
So why did some jackass
have to do that drawing,

59
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,958
and why did Tenma
have to see it!

60
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:40,041
I'm so stupid...!
On the camping trip...

61
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,958
Oh, Harima... Don't be a playa.

62
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,666
Ugh! I should've listened
to her, but I didn't.

63
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,041
There's no way I can face her!

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,125
Harima!

65
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,041
What do you want?

66
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,333
A fight? Let's get
it over with then.

67
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,083
Harima...

68
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,916
The only reason I came here
was to say, "Congratulations!"

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,208
Uhhhh...

70
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,583
Well...

71
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,458
that and apologize for
the misunderstanding we had

72
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,916
in the alley the other day...!

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,041
I thought you were
in love with Yakumo

74
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,125
when it was really
Eri all this time!

75
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,333
What did you say?!

76
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,541
You did come to pick
a fight! Didn't you?!

77
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,750
N-no...! I just wanted
to let you know

78
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,166
I'm really happy
for you and Eri!

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,083
Shut up!

80
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,250
Isn't love a wonderful thing?

81
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,291
Hey, Harima!

82
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,958
Tenma...! Crap.

83
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,875
Uh, hey there...
So how's it goin'?

84
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,041
Great! Nothin' like
being put on the spot!

85
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,958
What am I s'posed
to say to her?!

86
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,750
Hey, don't get stressed out.
I know what you want to say.

87
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,791
Huh?!

88
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,291
You're having trouble getting
the words out, aren't ya?

89
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,125
So she's knows
what I'm thinkin'!

90
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,458
Tenma's incredible! This
is like fate or somethin'...

91
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,916
If I'm dreamin',
I don't wanna wake up...

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,916
Listen... you just gotta
spit it out at some point.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,666
Yeah... I know that, but...

94
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:11,708
Oh, Harima... It's okay.
Say how you feel...

95
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,833
Okay! I'm gonna do it!

96
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,250
What?! Great!
Get it off your chest!

97
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,416
Uh, sorry this
has taken so long...

98
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,833
but you wanna know how I feel?

99
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,750
Well, here goes...

100
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,833
Finally... finally I can tell
her she's the love of my life!

101
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,375
She'll be so thrilled!

102
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,833
Yep, she sure is
one lucky girl, huh?

103
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,916
Who's "she?"

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,625
Oh... you tease! Eri!

105
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,541
She must be so happy right now!

106
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,958
Eri, huh...?

107
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,083
Why would the rich girl
be happy right now?

108
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,500
Oh, come on, now!

109
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,250
Don't play dumb with me,
Harima! You and Eri!

110
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:49,416
You've been shot through the
heart by love...! Sha-Kaboom!

111
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,958
Bullseye... Partner.

112
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,791
Tenma, she...

113
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,250
really thinks I've
got somethin' goin'...

114
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,125
on with that rich girl.
Oh, man...

115
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,750
She... wasn't upset...
or nothin'.

116
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,500
She actually... seemed happy...

117
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,208
If she thinks I'm with another
girl and she isn't sad...

118
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,083
Then that can only
mean one thing.

119
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,708
Tenma was never
in love with me...

120
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,583
See ya around!

121
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,208
Let me know what happens
when you tell Eri...!

122
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,208
I want all the juicy details!

123
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,875
Uh...

124
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,458
Harima, is everything okay?

125
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,750
What was I thinking?

126
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,250
Dancing with him
in front of everybody?

127
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,125
Still though... It was sweet.

128
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,958
I need to thank him.

129
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,833
And... I think I know how.

130
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,208
Ow!

131
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:48,541
Harima...? Uh, what are
you doing in here alone?

132
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,208
My life's over here...

133
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,000
Got no reason to stay anymore...

134
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,416
Tenma's sister...

135
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,583
Yes?

136
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,583
I've... I've gotta
fix it... The name.

137
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,125
Name?

138
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,000
In the classroom...

139
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,458
On my desk...
It's all wrong. It--

140
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,041
I-I'll get it! Be right back!

141
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,916
I gotta write...

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,458
Put my feelings down on paper...

143
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:26,416
The tale of the girl I loved...
and how she broke my heart.

144
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,125
Yep. Empty.

145
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,375
I knew PE would be the perfect
period to slip in unseen...

146
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,708
Genius plan if I say so myself.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,583
And, this saves me from having

148
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,250
to thank him in front
of everyone else, too.

149
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:45,125
They'll be wrapping up
out there any minute.

150
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:00,958
'Kay, let's see...
He sits next to Sis, so...

151
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,916
This must be it...

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,375
Huh? Wonder what he was
talking about back there?

153
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,708
The thing about
fixing the name...

154
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,916
The name tag?

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,583
This stitching
job's not the best.

156
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,083
That could be it... maybe?

157
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,333
Uh, Harima?

158
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,625
He's gone...

159
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,708
I'll fix this myself...

160
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,875
I just hope he doesn't
get too angry...

161
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:47,291
Akira? You here?

162
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,625
What have you got there?

163
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,416
Uh... Oh! This thing?

164
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,083
Well, it's... Harima's
jacket. I'm fixing it.

165
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,583
The stitching was loose
around the name tag...

166
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,250
Just a simple fix so--

167
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,250
Uh... Eri?

168
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,708
So, why are you
fixing his jacket?!

169
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,375
Uh, did Tenma ask you?

170
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,375
Well, no. You see...

171
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,083
I was just trying
to help him out.

172
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,083
Harima asked me
to go get this and...

173
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:23,875
Wait. Harima asked you?

174
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,250
I never knew you two
were so well acquainted.

175
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,500
Yes, uh, Harima, he drops
by every now and then...

176
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,416
Oh, really...? Why?

177
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,083
Why...

178
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,416
Promise me! Don't tell
anyone you saw this, Please!

179
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,375
So... You see a
nametag that needs

180
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,916
a better sewing job and
you fix it just like that.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,833
Wow. That's really
terrific of you... And sweet.

182
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,333
Um, I like helping people...

183
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,958
It says a lot
about you, you know?

184
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,250
That you're kind, considerate,
and want to take care of people.

185
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,583
You know, you'd make a great
girlfriend for some lucky guy.

186
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,958
Thank you...

187
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,833
Hey, can I see that?

188
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,416
Uh, of course.

189
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,000
Wow...! This looks great.

190
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,208
Here...

191
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:33,166
Nice work... I sure wish
I could sew like that... See ya.

192
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,041
Wow, Eri's really running late.

193
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,083
Don't worry about it.
She'll be here. Come on.

194
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,708
It was her idea for us to meet.

195
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,333
I doubt she'd bail on us.

196
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,750
Yeah, you're right.

197
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,625
Besides, I get to watch
Yakumo work. That's always fun!

198
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,125
Hey... Why are you
dressed like that?

199
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,791
Someone asked me to...

200
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,500
Who?

201
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,666
Hey guys.

202
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,375
Oh, hello again.

203
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,166
Hey, we were about
to send out a search party!

204
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,500
We were starting to get worried.

205
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,541
Glad you could finally make it!

206
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,875
Hey, wait! What gives?

207
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,666
Why are you
wearing your uniform?

208
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,625
Yeah. Did you have to go
to school for something?

209
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,458
Well, sort of...

210
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,250
Can I... just order, please?

211
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,458
Uh, sure... Well,
what can I get you?

212
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,250
A Bloody Mary.

213
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,916
Uh... but we don't...

214
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,166
What? No Bloody
Mary's here? A pity.

215
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,416
Uh... no...
I'm sorry about that.

216
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,916
I could use one... Oh, well.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,583
Just bring me a triple Espresso.

218
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,708
Hey, I heard the good news!

219
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,208
About you and Harima!
Did he do it?!

220
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,416
Did he tell you he loves you?!

221
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,083
Tenma... she's the one he loves.

222
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,458
Whhaaatttt?!

223
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,666
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

224
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,166
Wait a minute!
What's this all about, Sis?!

225
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,791
Oh, Yakumo, didn't you tell
your big sister about this?

226
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:01,708
For shame.

227
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,333
No, look, it's not what you...

228
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,166
I can't... I can't
believe it. This is crazy.

229
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,083
I thought Harima
was in love with Eri.

230
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,000
Yakumo...! Please, you've
got to tell me the truth...!

231
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,583
Have you and Harima
been seeing each other?!

232
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:20,041
Well... in a way... yes...

233
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,333
So it's true...?!

234
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,083
Why didn't you ever tell
me about this, huh...?!

235
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,125
I'm really shocked...!

236
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,916
My little sister getting a
boyfriend is big news...!

237
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,291
And... my life's over.

238
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,458
Cooking for
someone you love...

239
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,583
It's done!

240
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,750
Hope this tastes half
as good as it smells!

241
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,791
Hey, maybe I should
bring some to Karasuma!

242
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,250
Hey, Sis... What are you doing?

243
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,708
Feast your eyes
on my tuna curry!

244
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,250
Ta-da!

245
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,625
Tuna curry?

246
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,583
Yeah...! Smells yummy, huh?

247
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,250
Uh... yeah...
But what's the occasion?

248
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,291
It looks like you went through

249
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,833
a lot of trouble
just to make dinner.

250
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,833
Hey, it was worth it,
and don't worry about a thing.

251
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,708
I'll clean up this mess.
Let's celebrate!

252
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,166
My little sister just
got her first boyfriend!

253
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,833
Uh, Tenma...
About that Harima thing...

254
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,458
Finally ready to dish some dirt?

255
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:20,041
No, it's... it's just...
it's not what you think.

256
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,583
This relationship between me
and Harima's complicated...

257
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,208
So you're a little nervous!

258
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,500
Don't worry about it...!

259
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,833
Every relationship is
like that at the start!

260
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,791
No... Sis!

261
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,291
Don't worry
you'll work it out...!

262
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,375
You make a cute couple...!
Yakumo and Harima!

263
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,916
It's... not like that...

264
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,416
I'm so glad you found somebody!

265
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,666
I wanna fall in
love just like you!

266
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,458
All the excitement today has
really made me hungry!

267
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,250
Let's eat...! I hope
you've got an appetite, Sis!

268
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,750
Oh, Tenma...

269
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,583
After all that time,
she never loved me...

270
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:08,458
Gotta leave it all
behind. Her, school...

271
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,500
And... find a
new life out there...

272
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,250
Sagittarius,
you'll be lucky in love!

273
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,208
Maybe... Maybe
Karasuma's horoscope

274
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,875
will predict some romance,
too...! Let's see here.

275
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,125
He was born October 28th,
that makes him a Scorpio...

276
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,125
Hey, wait! It's almost the 28th!

277
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,708
I cannot forget
Karasuma's birthday!

278
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,958
There's no time to waste!

279
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,000
Sis, can I give you a hand?

280
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,250
No thanks!

281
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,416
If I don't do it myself

282
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,125
that means it didn't
come from the heart!

283
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,750
Ta-da!

284
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,500
Well... you did try...

285
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,708
Yeah, but not hard enough!

286
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,291
I can't give him that cake!

287
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,250
I've got to learn how to make a
better cake before his birthday!

288
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,416
Karasuma, he deserves
nothing but the very best!

289
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,708
I've gotta get it right!

290
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,708
Just do your best, Tenma.

291
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,125
Oh, Tenma...

292
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,541
You comfy, squid bait?

293
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,000
Can I get you another
pillow or an extra blankie?

294
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,250
This ain't no summer
camp, ya know!

295
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,958
Look! He's scared!

296
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,500
Tell us this, wussy boy.

297
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,416
Do ya even know the
name of this ship?

298
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,416
Uh, no...

299
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,583
Of 'course not.

300
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,625
Well, allow me to
do the honors, kid...

301
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,250
Don't wet yourself,
but you're aboard...

302
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,416
the fiercest ship on the seas,
The Cry of the Demon!

303
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,416
Ya see, this ship
plies the stormy waters

304
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,833
where other ships fear
to sail! Welcome to Hell!

305
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,708
No room for lazy
panty-waists out here...!

306
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,250
We gotta chain a'command,

307
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,625
and you're at the bottom
of it, so listen up!

308
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,291
The deck's covered in fish
guts...! Go clean it up! Now!

309
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,541
You sure 'bout this, Ootani?

310
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,291
You-know-who's up
there right now.

311
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,000
'Course. Why else do ya
think I sent that kid?

312
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,333
Oh, you're pretty
cold, you know that?

313
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,541
Last time I used one of these...

314
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,708
...was when we
played pool hockey.

315
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,291
Ugh... Can't get
hung up on the past...

316
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,541
Just forget it...

317
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,833
Uh... What the hell?!

318
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,291
Whoa...! What
happened to this guy?!

319
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,791
Hey, kid...

320
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,958
Since yer swabbin',
clean that trash, too.

321
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,916
Oh... and if ya know
what's good for ya,

322
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,750
you'll never question
my orders like him.

323
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,041
Out here, the
cap'n's word is law!

324
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,708
You'll live longer
if ya learn that now!

325
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,875
Dear Tenma: Hope you're well...

326
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,833
Look, I don't know if we'll ever
see each other again, but...

327
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,000
I've been drawin'
this comic and, well,

328
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,916
it's about you and me,
and how I feel and stuff...

329
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,291
I may never return...
so I wanted to let you know...

330
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,875
Hope you get this...

331
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,125
Right... Back to work...

332
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,500
Told ya he was soft!
Look at this crap...!

333
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,333
It's a comic book,
a girlie romance one...!

334
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,625
Look, he even draws like a girl!

335
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,166
You lousy-!

336
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,250
Give that back, you bastard!

337
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,750
Forgot to say "please"...

338
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,500
This is a man's ship, punk...!

339
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,208
We ain't got no room
for this kiddie crap!

340
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:39,750
Comics are good...
for one thing.

341
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,791
You bastard!

342
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,708
This just isn't your day,
now is it, sweetheart?!

343
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,083
Now I'm 'onna
teach ya some manners.

344
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,458
Like for starters,
how to respect your elders.

345
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,875
Kiss that drawin'
hand goodbye, punk...

346
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,583
Uh... Captain?!!

347
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,916
I should keel-haul ya,
but I need all hands on deck.

348
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,041
A storm is brewin'!

349
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,541
I left my old life behind
for a new one on a tuna boat...

350
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,250
And its captain is the toughest
guy I've ever met in my life!

351
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,333
For real...! Next time
on School Rumble...

352
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,208
Uh, those aren't words!
