1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,708
Sit tight!


2
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,250
That dizzy romantic
comedy "School Rumble"


3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,083
is about to start!


4
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:13,250
"I love you."
Just three little words.

5
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,083
But the moment
I say them,

6
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:19,166
the whole world
changes like magic.

7
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,625
Today, I'm going
to say them to you.

8
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,916
Hey, Sis? We're late!

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,041
Yakumo! I'm sorry!

10
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,833
Alright! School starts today!

11
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,708
I can't wait! Ha!

12
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:35,750
Thanks for waiting for me!

13
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:36,916
Being late's no way to start!

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,750
I know.

15
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,375
My name is Tenma Tsukamoto.

16
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,500
I guess I'm just your average
high school sophomore,

17
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,416
like a zillion other
girls in the world.

18
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,500
And like any young girl,
I've fallen in love!

19
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,958
Maybe the food will
be better this year!

20
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,916
Hey! Karasuma!

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,916
It's him! Karasuma!

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,166
Ohmigosh!

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,583
I can't believe I just
said his name out loud!

24
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,041
Just think, wouldn't it be cool

25
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,916
if you guys ended up
in the same class?

26
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,250
Mhm!

27
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,625
We are gonna end up in
the same class together!

28
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,541
I've prayed for it
every night for six months!

29
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,458
My horoscope said
I was lucky in love!

30
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,208
My tea leaves foretold success!

31
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,541
I found a four leaf clover!

32
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,791
I tripped and
fell down the stairs!

33
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,125
What was that last one?

34
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,083
I'm gonna go check
the class assignments!

35
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,708
Okay, I'll cross
my fingers for you.

36
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,500
Did you see the
ball game last night?

37
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:40,916
"I love you."
Just three little words.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,125
But the moment I say them, the
whole world changes like magic.

39
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,541
Today, I'm going
to say them to you.

40
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,458
I-I'll get you for this, Harima.

41
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,500
Yeah! Time for the
badass to get the girl.

42
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,291
Let's go to school!

43
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,375
My name's Kenji Harima,
and everyone knows

44
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,416
I'm the baddest
badass in the school.

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,750
At least I was until someone
came along and changed my life!

46
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,375
I'm too nervous to look.

47
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,541
Oh, please let
Karasuma be in my class!

48
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,791
Tenma! Hey!

49
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,833
Hey, girls, what's going on?

50
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,541
It's her. Holy crap.

51
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,916
Now hold on, young man!

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,750
Button that shirt
up at once or--

53
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,166
I've gotta be in her class!

54
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,166
Huh?

55
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,416
Did you hear the good news?

56
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,916
We're all in class 2-C!

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,416
Including you.

58
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,416
Really?

59
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Hurray!

60
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,166
My three best
friends all together!

61
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,250
It's wonderful!

62
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,125
I knew today was
gonna be my lucky day!

63
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,250
But--

64
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,250
Is there something wrong?

65
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,250
Oh, uh, definitely not!

66
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,750
No problem here!

67
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,583
So Tenma is in 2-C, eh?

68
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,416
I know!

69
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,125
I'll use psychic power
to make sure I'm in 2-C!

70
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,708
Just gotta concentrate
for ten seconds.

71
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:15,625
Ten. 2-C. Nine. 2-C. Eight. 2-C.
Seven. 2-C. Six. 2-C. Five. 2-C.

72
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,583
Four. 2-C. Three. 2-C.
Two. 2-C. One!

73
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,583
D! Just face it, Harima.

74
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,583
I saw you on the D list.

75
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,416
Ugh. What was that for?

76
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,750
That was just a love tap.

77
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,125
That's what happens
when people distract me.

78
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,333
2-D? It can't be!

79
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,833
My psychic power had to work!

80
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,750
Kenji Harimashi?

81
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,333
That's not my name.

82
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,875
You upset my
vibrations for nothing!

83
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,750
You vibe-killer!

84
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,791
Sorry!

85
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,416
I didn't know
you were vibrating!

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,333
Well, try to be a little
more sensitive from now on.

87
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,750
You know, like me!

88
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,916
Okay.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,083
Hmph! What's he know!

90
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,583
My name's gotta be there!

91
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:59,458
Huh?

92
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,333
Dammit!

93
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,333
I can't find my name anywhere!

94
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,375
C'mon!

95
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,291
I gotta be in
one of these rooms!

96
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,666
What the--?

97
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,583
Man, it's like
I don't even exist!

98
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,250
Harima!

99
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,458
Hm?

100
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,333
Why are you checking
the level 2 list?

101
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,791
You were held back,
don't you remember?

102
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,750
Aw, crap.

103
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,791
How'd it go?
Is he in your class?

104
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,250
Can't look.

105
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,416
Would it be easier
if I looked for you?

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,625
No!I've got to see this
with my very own eyes!

107
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:45,208
Oji Karasuma.

108
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,041
We're in the same class! Yes!

109
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,458
Good for you.

110
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,166
Soon we'll be
together, Karasuma!

111
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,416
And our love will kindled!

112
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,458
So you're in 2-C?

113
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:58,208
But it doesn't matter 'cause I'm
transferring out in two days.

114
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,916
And we were gonna
be in the same class!

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,625
Oh, well, life goes on.

116
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,083
The hell it does!

117
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,333
I gotta think.

118
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,916
Maybe cleaning the
house will help me think.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,875
Maybe doing all the
laundry will help me think.

120
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,208
Maybe dishes will help me think?

121
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,458
I couldn't think of anything.

122
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,166
Maybe a good
night's sleep will help.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,750
There's no way I can sleep now!

124
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,333
I can't let him go
without at least trying

125
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,958
to tell him how I feel!

126
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,250
Better to risk doing something
dumb than do nothing

127
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,916
and kick myself
the rest of my life!

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,583
Okay! Let's do this!

129
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,291
I'll just write "I love you."
I mean, that should be easy!

130
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, I love y-y-y-y-y--

131
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,750
--your skiing, I hear you're
awesome at the giant slalom.

132
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:56,625
Agh! What's the matter
with me? What am I saying?

133
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:02,250
Once more. I love y-y-y-y--

134
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,916
--your skipping.

135
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,833
Okay, Tenma, stay cool,
you can do this.

136
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:12,291
I love yogurt!
No, no, I love yoga!

137
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:16,000
I love yurts! I love Yorkies?

138
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,791
I love--

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,041
Rats. I can't say it.

140
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,500
Now what am I supposed to do?

141
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,750
Okay, shake it off.

142
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,166
I'll just write down how
I feel, nice and simple.

143
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,291
It turned out to be
kind of a long letter.

144
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,458
Oh, wow.

145
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,750
I did it.

146
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,166
I poured out my heart to him.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,333
He--he's reading it!

148
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,000
And, he's still reading it!

149
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,666
Ah! I think he's
finally finished!

150
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,916
Wait a minute.

151
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,666
Oh my gosh, he's reacting!

152
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,708
I hope this is a good thing.

153
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,916
That's funny, there's no name.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,708
Oh, no!

155
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,833
It's all over. My first love.

156
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,333
It's--it's Karasuma!

157
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,583
But I thought he transferred
to another school!

158
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,500
No, for some reason he decided
to postpone the transfer.

159
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,833
He managed to talk his parents

160
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,958
into letting him finish
out the school year here.

161
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:53,916
Why would he?

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
How come?

163
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,041
No one knows for sure but the
rumor is someone asked him to.

164
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,041
Our heroine Tenma Tsukamoto
is hopelessly in love

165
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,583
with Oji Karasuma!

166
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,166
But her hopes are
dashed when she learns

167
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,125
he's about to transfer
to another school!

168
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,791
Desperate to make her feelings
known, she pours out her heart

169
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,666
to him in very long
love letter to no avail!

170
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,125
But in a dramatic
turn of events,

171
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,791
Karasuma
postpones his transfer,

172
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:22,083
restoring hope to
Tenma's storm-tossed soul!

173
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,916
And now she begins
the real battle,

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,083
a battle for true
love in a cruel world!

175
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,416
Great first page!

176
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,625
I hope the whole
book is this good.

177
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,416
Okay, no more stupid mistakes.

178
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,125
I'm gonna find out what the
experts say you should do.

179
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,875
Karasuma, you're so cool.

180
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

181
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,750
Do you love the
guy or not? Focus!

182
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
But reading makes my head hurt.

183
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,125
Wait! "Know yourself
as well as your enemy

184
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,375
and a hundred victories
will be yours." Who wrote this?

185
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,500
Sun Tzu? Huh.

186
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,541
I guess it must be some kind
of a secret kung fu love manual.

187
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,791
Know yourself.

188
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,916
What kind of a girl am I?

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Tenma Tsukamoto.

190
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,000
Age: 16.
Height: 154 centimeters.

191
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,416
Weight: 43 kilograms.

192
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,083
Looks and figure: average.

193
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,916
Social status: nobody.

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,583
Sports poor!

195
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,125
Academics poor!

196
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,916
Cooking sucks!

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,958
Good qualities-- zilch.

198
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,000
Get a grip.

199
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,458
Let's see what
else he's got, huh?

200
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,833
Rabbit taking off.

201
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:36,500
Taking off what?

202
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,541
Can you undo me in the back?

203
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,833
Put it back on!

204
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,583
That can't be the right reading!

205
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,333
Excuse me, what does
this expression mean?

206
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,041
Oh, that--that means
"rabbit running away."

207
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,250
Oh, of course.
Thanks so much for your help.

208
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,041
Sure.

209
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,416
He's right here!

210
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,458
How'd he get there!

211
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,791
That's right.
Rabbit running away.

212
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,583
Great, now he thinks
I'm an illiterate lunatic!

213
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,833
But on the other hand,

214
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,583
he actually talked to me
for the very first time!

215
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,541
Now I know what
to have him read next!

216
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,083
Man, am I an evil
genius or what? Heh, heh.

217
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,958
Ow! My contact!

218
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,958
Uh, could your read
this phrase for me?

219
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,000
Sure thing.

220
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,250
Let me see,
it says "I love you."

221
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,166
Hey are you in high school?

222
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,125
You're really cute.

223
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,500
Maybe if I show him a cane
field, he'll call me sugar!

224
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,625
Karasuma!

225
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,708
What do you get from this?

226
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,083
Let's see.

227
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,958
Come on, come on.

228
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,875
Says it's a thresher.

229
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:41,083
I showed him the wrong picture!

230
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,666
Well, I guess it's
about time I get going.

231
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,125
See you, Miss Tsukamoto.

232
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:50,291
Yeah, sure, later, Karasuma!

233
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,875
He knows my name.

234
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,208
It wasn't that long ago
I was a total smart ass

235
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,333
and a hopeless moron.

236
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,958
And I was a god.

237
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,833
Nothing and nobody
could tie me down.

238
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,291
I belonged to no one.

239
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,625
But now I'm tied
by the bonds of love.

240
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,375
I'm in love with
Tenma Tsukamoto.

241
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,458
Hey, what the heck
is Harima doing here?

242
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,250
Oh, man.

243
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,500
He's sitting in my chair.

244
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,375
Do you think he broke
into the faculty room

245
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,916
and forced them to pass him?

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,083
Oh please oh please
oh please oh please

247
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,166
oh please oh please oh please!

248
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,708
So far, so good.

249
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,666
I made it into Tenma's class.

250
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,416
Now I gotta figure out a way to
tell her how I feel about her.

251
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,291
What?

252
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,416
"I challenge you to a fight"?

253
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,416
Come on!

254
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,833
Nobody does this
by letter anymore!

255
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,250
Wait! A letter!

256
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,458
I bet chicks like letters!

257
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,791
Ha ha!

258
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,250
Read this!

259
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,416
The greatest love letter
in the history of the world!

260
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:09,041
I asked her to meet me
behind the gym at 4 o'clock.

261
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,250
Oh, Tenma.
Did you read my letter?

262
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,416
I love you, darling.

263
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
You're the only man
in the world for me.

264
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,166
Almost four o'clock!

265
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,083
It's her! She came!

266
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,250
What the hell?

267
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh crap! I forgot the challenge!

268
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,416
Set for same time and place,
what are the chances?

269
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,750
I can't believe this!

270
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,250
I can't go out there now

271
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,458
and let Tenma see
me fighting that gorilla!

272
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,625
Come on. Where is that creep?

273
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,041
I'm gonna miss my four-thirty.

274
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,500
I beg your pardon, miss.

275
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,708
Huh?

276
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,625
Sorry, but what's a
nice girl like you doing

277
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,083
in a place like this?

278
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,125
Uh, meeting someone.

279
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,416
That slimeball!

280
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,375
He's talking to her!
I'll kill him!

281
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,791
Ah! A letter?

282
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,791
Well, yes, it--

283
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:06,875
Do you mind if I--?

284
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,541
Hey! Gimme that!

285
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,416
Bastard!

286
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,791
Well, well, it's a love poem.

287
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:11,916
Isn't that special?

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,916
Wait a minute!

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,125
"Oh, Thank You.

290
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,208
An Epic Poem of Gratitude."
Oh how sweet.

291
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:22,083
Oh, thank you to the heavens
for sending you to earth.

292
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:28,041
Oh, thank you to your parents,
twas they who gave you birth.

293
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,875
Damn, girl,
that's just pathetic!

294
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,750
I swear Tennoji,
I'll end you for this!

295
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,208
Is this a joke?
Too bad he didn't sign it!

296
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:36,916
I think you're wrong.

297
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,708
Huh?

298
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,250
I know I'm not very smart,

299
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,416
but I think whoever
wrote this was very brave

300
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,250
to say what he
felt in his heart.

301
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,625
It's a beautiful,
sensitive, wonderful letter.

302
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,500
And I just adore it!

303
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,625
I'm the luckiest
guy in the world

304
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,458
to have fallen in love
with a girl like Tenma!

305
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,708
That's great, 'cause
I wrote the letter!

306
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,666
I love you!

307
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,833
What? And he called me pathetic?

308
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,041
Thank you, that's very sweet,

309
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,750
but I'm in love
with somebody else.

310
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,000
There, there.

311
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,500
These things happen to everyone.

312
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,083
Except me!

313
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,291
That's for laughing
at my masterpiece!

314
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,125
If there's one thing
I hate, it's criticism!

315
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,291
I've got to think of some way

316
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,583
I can spend more
time with Karasuma.

317
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,791
There must be something I can do

318
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,416
to get his attention
outside of school,

319
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,041
I just gotta concentrate.
Oh pretty!

320
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,583
If I could just find a
way to spend more time

321
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,208
with her, she would notice me.

322
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:09,208
I've gotta find more time.

323
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,333
Ah! Of course!

324
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,916
Riding a bicycle!

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,416
Why, good morning, Karasuma!

326
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,750
Good morning, Miss Tsukamoto!

327
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,083
Another splendid day, isn't it?

328
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,416
Indeed!

329
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,791
We could bike to
school together every day!

330
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,083
Ah, Tenma!

331
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,375
Good morning, Harima!

332
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,541
Lovely weather
we're having, isn't it?

333
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,250
Almost as lovely as you.

334
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,041
We could bike to
school together every day!

335
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,250
Sheer genius!

336
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,583
Tenma sure has been
acting weird lately.

337
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,833
I wonder what's up.

338
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,916
It's because they wound
up in class together.

339
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,666
Huh?

340
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,541
Don't worry about it.

341
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,666
You'll figure it out.

342
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,833
Morning, girls.

343
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,041
Hey! Morning, Yakumo!

344
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,291
So where's Tenma?

345
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:56,166
She's uh-- she's biking
to school from now on.

346
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,875
Here we go.

347
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,666
Uh, with what?

348
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,083
This is gonna be great!
So where is he?

349
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,875
Yes! Now for a casual
yet friendly greeting.

350
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,416
Good morning!

351
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,750
What a coin--

352
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,250
Whoa!

353
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,041
Has he got a freakin' jet
engine on that thing or what?

354
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,833
Hey, Karasuma! Wait up!

355
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,458
Soon I'll be riding with Tenma.

356
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,791
Whoa! Here she comes!

357
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,416
Tenma, what a coincidence!

358
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,125
Hey, lovely weather
we're having, isn't it?

359
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,083
Huh? Wait up!

360
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,250
What's the deal?

361
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,416
Is she training for
the Tour de France?

362
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,375
She's going way too fast!
Hey, come back!

363
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,541
Tenma!

364
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,791
Hey, slow down, will ya?

365
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,333
Wait for me, Tenma!

366
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,875
Look at him, even
on a bike he's so cool

367
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,500
and composed,
he's just adorable.

368
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,541
Huh? How does he do that?

369
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,416
Well, he's not gonna get
rid of me that easily! Charge!

370
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,250
Whoa. She's fast,
but if I can outrun the cops,

371
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,583
I can catch up to her.

372
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,583
They don't call me
"legs of steel" for nothing!

373
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,708
Let's kick it into overdrive!

374
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,916
Wait up, Karasuma!

375
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,666
Tenma! Wait up!

376
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,666
There's nothing like
having a good hair day

377
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,041
to make a girl feel beautiful.

378
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,083
Good morning.

379
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,208
Morning! Huh?

380
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,083
Amazing! He went up that
hill like it wasn't even there!

381
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,791
Huh?

382
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,625
Tenma?

383
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,291
My--my hair. It's ruined!

384
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,708
What is going on?

385
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,708
Whoa, Eri! Bad hair day?

386
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,041
Oh, yeah, you could say that!

387
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,583
You'll never guess
what happened!

388
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,166
Karasuma came by
on a bike and Tenma

389
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,708
was following right after him.

390
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,500
What does that mean?

391
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,125
Gee, whaddaya think?

392
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,208
Now I get it!

393
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,250
Huh? Get what? Get what?

394
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,583
But wait, I'm pretty
sure I saw a third person

395
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,416
chasing right after them.

396
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,916
Hey!

397
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,250
You don't think Tenma has
a thing for Karasuma, do you?

398
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,541
When you're as dumb as they are,

399
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,125
the last thing you need is
to fall asleep during class.

400
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,083
Miss Tsukamoto,
here's your eraser.

401
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,666
Thank you.

402
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,541
Gosh. That's too bad.

403
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,791
She just missed out on
a really good chance there.

404
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,708
This doesn't bode well for the
rest of the school year, huh?

405
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,041
I love you, Karasuma.

406
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,291
Oh, man!

407
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,458
Tomorrow's our school physical!

408
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:15,666
I don't wanna get weighed!

409
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,583
But I do wanna
know Karasuma's stats!

410
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,041
I just have to find out!

411
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,583
Next time on School Rumble:

412
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,416
"Tough Test!
Trapped in the Bathroom!

413
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,916
The School Physical!"

414
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,875
Uh, do I look fat to you?
