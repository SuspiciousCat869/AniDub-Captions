1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,291
Don't you dare
touch that remote...!

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,666
School Rumble will
begin any second now!

3
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,375
Finally we're free!

4
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,125
So who's up for a little
pastry on the way home?

5
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,416
Ooh, that sounds great.

6
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
You talked me into it!

7
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,333
We've got room
cleaning starting today.

8
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,375
Oh, yeah, that's right...

9
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,500
I forgot about that.

10
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,916
Ugh. That settles that.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,125
'Fraid so.

12
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,291
O... kay...! End of the line!

13
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,416
Come back...!

14
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,958
No... running... away...

15
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,583
Why am I such a big klutz?

16
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,250
Is everyone gone?

17
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,916
Yeah, let's lock up.

18
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,041
Waaiitt!

19
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:48,958
There's somebody still in here!

20
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,250
Open the door! Let me out!

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,125
Help! Is anybody out there?

22
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,041
Everybody's gone...

23
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,458
I know!

24
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,083
Whoa... too high...

25
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,458
No good...

26
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,041
I'm stuck in here...
Ohhh, man...

27
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,375
why does stuff like
this always happen to me?

28
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,250
Wait...! No problem...!

29
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,250
When club activities start,
someone's sure to come by!

30
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,458
I just have to stay calm.

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,416
It's actually kind of...
peaceful here...

32
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,458
Wow, it's so relaxing...

33
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,125
I think I'm starting
to get... sleepy...

34
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,291
What did you say?!

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,666
Who...! What...! When...!
Where...! How...! Who...! Hey!

36
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,791
It's... It's evening!

37
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,708
I just remembered!

38
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,250
All the clubs are off today!

39
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,625
Great... now I'm gonna miss
"Three for the Kill"

40
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,375
and they're re-running
my favorite episode, too,

41
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,000
the one with the ten thousand
fake bales of rice...

42
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,458
maybe Yakumo will
videotape it for me...

43
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,000
And I won't be able to get
my homework done either...!

44
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,791
What am I gonna say tomorrow?

45
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,625
"I'm sorry, but I was locked up
in the equipment room?"

46
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,958
I sure hope Yakumo doesn't
find that chocolate pudding cup

47
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,125
I hid behind the ketchup
in the refrigerator...

48
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,375
Huh?!

49
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,916
No, no, no...!
I mustn't give in to despair!

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,125
There's gotta be a way

51
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,041
to turn this into a
positive experience...

52
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,958
Now... let me see...

53
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,583
I could pretend I'm stranded
on a desert island...!

54
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,041
Like Robinson Crusoe,
with nothing to depend on

55
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,958
but my own wits
and native cunning...!

56
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,083
This is the perfect chance

57
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,041
to put my survival
skills to the test!

58
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,708
When you think about it
this way, it's so exciting!

59
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,291
Okay, so what's the first
thing you're supposed to do

60
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,958
when you're stranded
on an island...?

61
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:56,916
Do you try to start a fire...?

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,291
Do you build a grass hut?

63
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,416
No, the first thing has
to be to look for food!

64
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,750
All right!

65
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,250
I'll hunt for coconuts or
bananas or something...!

66
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,875
Exploring, exploring...
What's this?

67
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,916
Pastry...? Well, how about that!

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,791
And I was just
playing make believe!

69
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,916
Funny, why is there a
pastry in the storage room...?

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,583
Hey, look at the
expiration date...!

71
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,083
This baby is still fresh!

72
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,375
Now that I think about it,
I am kinda hungry...

73
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,541
I wonder if it's
okay to eat this?

74
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,208
No, no, what am I saying...?

75
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,208
Date or no date, somebody
threw this thing away,

76
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,791
it might not be safe to eat...

77
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,916
I have absolutely
no will power...

78
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,250
That's hoooooottttt!!

79
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,708
Ex... Extra spicy curry paste?!

80
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,291
Aw, jeez, I can't stand
spicy food! I'm dying!

81
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,208
Water! I've gotta have water!

82
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,583
But there's no plumbing in here!

83
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,791
What am I supposed to do?

84
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,375
This is like a real
survival test! Aghhhhh!

85
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,708
Oh sweet heaven...! I need rain!

86
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,625
The sprinkler...

87
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,958
Turn, you rotten little...
come on!

88
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,000
How are you supposed
to work this dumb thing?

89
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,291
There's no switch...!
Oh, my mouth is still on fire!

90
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,791
Okay, that does it,
now I'm really mad!

91
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,416
Come on!

92
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,541
Wa... ter!!

93
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,083
Water, water, yeah!

94
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,083
Take that, you
stubborn sprinkler!

95
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,541
Who's your daddy now?!

96
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,791
Oh, man, that feels so good!

97
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,916
This castaway business
is working out even better

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,875
than I thought it would...! Yay!

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,958
I guess I should have thought
this through a little further...

100
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,500
Now my clothes are soaked,
and I'm freezing...

101
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,208
and I haven't
even got a towel...

102
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,708
I know I'm just being silly...

103
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,250
but... what if I never
get out of here...?

104
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,541
It's so lonely...

105
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,166
I was sort of
having fun at first,

106
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,208
but now all
I feel is really sad...

107
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,083
I wonder if Yakumo
is worried about me?

108
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,083
Even more...

109
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,125
I wonder what Karasuma
is doing right now

110
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,916
These mats... are hard.

111
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,166
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know
someone was sleeping in here,

112
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,416
I hope I wasn't
making too much noise...

113
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,916
Oh, Karasuma...! Have you
come here to rescue me?!

114
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,666
Wait... huh?

115
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,625
Oh, noooooooooooooo!

116
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,333
Whoa. That was
a pretty cool jump.

117
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,666
Cleaning duty...

118
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,416
I had completely blocked
it out of my mind...

119
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,583
If we hurry, we might still
be able to grab some coffee

120
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,458
and cake on the way home,
what do you say?

121
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,500
Sure.

122
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,125
Great, the four of us can...

123
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,791
hold on, just a second...

124
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,583
Where's Tenma?

125
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,291
Wha?

126
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,333
You think she skipped?

127
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,916
Nah...

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,791
She may be the world's biggest
flake but she's no slacker...

129
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,083
More likely she forgot
and went straight home.

130
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,583
Huh?

131
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,416
Yeah... she said something
about there being some rerun

132
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,083
of "Three for the Kill" on
tonight that she just had to see

133
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,958
and that's all it would
take to distract her.

134
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,500
Man... that girl is
absolutely hopeless!

135
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,791
Crap...! Tenma's
already gone home...

136
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,416
The only reason I stuck
around this dump was

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,791
so I could get a chance
to clean with her!

138
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,458
What?

139
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,000
It's kind of funny,

140
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,625
I never would've thought of
Harima as the domestic type...

141
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,375
Oh, well, whatever doesn't
kill you makes you stronger

142
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,458
and I've got nothing
to do til this evening.

143
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,208
Man, why did he have
to wait so late to do this?

144
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,458
Doesn't he know how
valuable my time is?

145
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,041
Another letter of
challenge, eh...?

146
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,166
You don't know when
to quit, do you, Tennoji?

147
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:52,166
I won't quit til I've broken you
into a thousand bloody pieces.

148
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,500
Now eat fist, jerkwad!

149
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,958
Nice shouting, tubby...

150
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,250
too bad for you you can't
fight as good as you yell...

151
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,333
The breeze is nice, though!

152
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,541
Sorry, baldy, but as long as
you're in love with Tenma,

153
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,458
I'm showing no mercy...!
See you around...

154
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,458
Hold on...

155
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,916
You gotta be
freakin' kiddin' me.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,583
You're in love with Tenma?

157
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,083
Tenma?

158
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,375
That's Miss Tsukamoto to you!

159
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,291
You're ... wasting your time.

160
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,208
Get real!

161
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,458
How often do I have to beat you?

162
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,916
I'm not talking about
the fighting, Romeo...!

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,625
Tenma, I mean Miss Tsukamoto,
told me she loves someone else!

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,416
What did you say?!

165
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,041
Who...! What...! When...!
Where...! How...! Who!

166
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,500
If you're lying to me...

167
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,833
I'm telling you
the truth, lover boy!

168
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,291
Thank you...
that's very sweet...

169
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,083
but I'm in love
with somebody else.

170
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,500
No... it can't be...

171
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,083
I never thought of
something like this!

172
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,291
Tenma... she likes
someone else!!

173
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,416
Yeah...! Then it got dark...!

174
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,750
I'm telling you, girls,

175
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,625
I've never been so
frightened in my entire life!

176
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,083
I can't believe you
spent the whole night

177
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,458
in the equipment room.

178
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,916
Crap...! Tenma likes
someone else...?

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,458
But she's never shown
the slightest sign of it!

180
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,708
Who is this jerk
that Tenma likes...?!

181
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,375
I swear I'm gonna find out,
and when I do... he's...

182
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,791
Dead!

183
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,375
Now this next problem is a
little bit tricky, but... Hanai?

184
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,958
Right!

185
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,333
The relation of energy, area,
and speed at the orbital peak,

186
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,875
where r,
the rate of variability,

187
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,416
is equivalent to zero...

188
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,333
Who can it be...? Who?

189
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,666
And that gives us the answer.

190
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,583
And a very precise
answer, Hanai...

191
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,833
excellent job!

192
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,291
Hanai's pretty
amazing, isn't he?

193
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,500
Yeah, he's like an
encyclopedia disguised

194
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,791
as a high school student,
only more boring.

195
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,375
Is it possible?

196
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,541
Could Tenma go for Hanai?

197
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,375
The serious type?

198
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,916
No, it can't be.

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,291
Call it a hunch, but that's
not the look of love... so who?

200
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:30,000
Him...?! No, no, impossible.

201
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,208
That guy?

202
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,916
Naaah...

203
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,208
Who the hell can it be...?

204
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,250
I can't go on like
this much longer...

205
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,375
It's killing me!

206
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,458
Huh?

207
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,916
Isn't that what's his name...

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,458
Karma sutra...
or something like that...

209
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,583
Stares out the
window all day long...

210
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,125
What a weirdo...

211
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,458
Well...

212
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,291
I guess I don't have
to worry about him...

213
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,416
There's no way that
vacant-eyed daydreamer

214
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,083
could ever capture
my Tenma's heart...

215
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,791
No, you're okay...
uh... Kara Mia...

216
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,083
or whatever you're called...

217
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,833
Ohhhhh, Tenma,
if only I could...

218
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,833
Huh?

219
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,333
She's looking my way!

220
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,791
And the way she's
looking my way...

221
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,750
Could it be?!

222
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,583
The guy she likes...

223
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:29,125
Could it possibly be... me?!

224
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,541
It's me...

225
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,375
It's me...

226
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,416
It's me!

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,208
It's gotta be...!
That passionate gaze...

228
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:00,916
I mean, I suspected it all
along... but now I know...

229
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,708
Tenma Tsukamoto...

230
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,250
is in love with
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!

231
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,458
I've gotta tell her how I feel!

232
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,500
Forgive me, Tenma...

233
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,708
I was an idiot to wait!

234
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,458
I should've told you long ago!

235
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,791
There she is!

236
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,541
That delicate body,
burning with passion,

237
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,041
waiting for my embrace...

238
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,583
I bet it's been
rough for her...!

239
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,958
I bet it's been agonizing...!

240
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,625
But now her torture
will finally be over!

241
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,125
You don't have to
say anything, my love!

242
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,875
Just listen to me...!

243
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,458
Let me tell you the words
you've been waiting to hear!

244
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,458
Wondrous beauty!

245
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,916
Hey, Harima!

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,583
Look out for that...

247
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,458
Well, it looks like
you'll be out in ten days.

248
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,416
What's weird is I feel

249
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,750
like something really
great happened today,

250
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,583
but I can't remember what it is.

251
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,208
I've gotta say,
you have the worst luck

252
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,416
of any person
I've ever met in my life.

253
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,458
Oh, my head...

254
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,083
my memory is full of holes...

255
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,166
Though, when you think about it,
full recovery in ten days

256
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,041
after being hit by a truck
going forty miles an hour

257
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,083
is a kind of good luck.

258
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,291
Who's there?

259
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,833
Hey, Harima...

260
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,416
I hope you're feeling better!

261
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,291
Ohhh, baby...! I'm... lucky!

262
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,916
Hey, Harima...
I hope you're feeling better!

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,541
Ohhh, baby...! I'm... lucky!

264
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,166
Hello there,
Ms. Itoko, how are you...!

265
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,208
So did you come
to visit Harima too?

266
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,250
Well, I'm fond of dumb animals.

267
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,250
Are you getting along
all right, Harima?

268
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,000
Fine! I'm fine!

269
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,375
I'm not fine...!
I'm in a hospital...!

270
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,875
I'm wearing striped pajamas...!

271
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,333
The girl of my dreams
is bringing me flowers...!

272
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,708
I can't breathe...!
My heart is pounding!

273
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,166
He is so obvious.

274
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,750
Excuse me, Tenma?

275
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,666
Those flowers you
brought are so beautiful...

276
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,958
why don't you put them in
some water before they spoil?

277
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,458
Oh...! Sure!

278
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,250
Good, you're breathing again,
I thought you'd forgotten how.

279
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,083
What can I say, I'm pathetic.

280
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,750
Well then, I'm off!

281
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,583
Two's company, three's
a crowd, you know...!

282
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,291
I'll see you later, Kenji!

283
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,583
No... wait... don't!

284
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,333
Please stay, Itoko...!
I beg you...!

285
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,250
I just can't handle this alone!

286
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,500
Hey...! Be a man!

287
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,750
Itoko!

288
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,083
Now then...

289
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,958
what's the proper way
to address your guardian?

290
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,208
Ah! Ms. Itoko!

291
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,083
Ms. Itoko! Please don't go!

292
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,750
That wasn't so hard, was it...?

293
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,708
Don't worry, I'll help you...
Here, take these.

294
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,041
Huh? What's this?

295
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,916
A remote intercom.
I made it myself.

296
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,625
Intercom?

297
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,166
Go ahead, put it on...

298
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,333
I'll tell you what to say to
Tenma, and all you have to do

299
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,916
is repeat after me, there's
nothing to worry about...

300
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,333
It's a good thing they allow
cell phones in this hospital...

301
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,666
I guess you really
are lucky, after all.

302
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,875
I'm not so sure, I've got
a bad feeling about this.

303
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,083
Okay, you're on your own.

304
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,750
Awright, give me
the damn things!

305
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,791
As you wish, o spineless one...

306
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,875
put that one in the
lapel of your pajamas...

307
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,458
and that one in your ear.

308
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,250
It's like you're a spy.
Pretty cool, huh?

309
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,583
Does she make these as a hobby?

310
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,125
Give it your best shot...! Bye!

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,750
I wonder if this is
really gonna work.

312
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,916
Okay, Tenma's on her
way back to the room...

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,625
Are you ready?

314
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,375
Uh... yeah...

315
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,875
Come in.

316
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,041
Come in.

317
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:33,625
Hi.

318
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,875
Ha... hi!

319
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,750
I'll just put these over
here on the table, okay?

320
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,208
I'm glad you're doing better.
I was really worried.

321
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:40,750
Uh...

322
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,625
Thank you.

323
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,166
Oh! Uh, thank you.

324
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,416
Ohhh, by the way...

325
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,583
I brought along some tea,

326
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,083
would you like me
to make some for you?

327
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,041
Uhhhhh...

328
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,083
Thank you!

329
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,791
Thank you.

330
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,791
You're very welcome.

331
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,916
Don't worry, these are actually
pretty good for tea bags...

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,750
I usually like the
loose packed stuff better,

333
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,458
but beggars can't be choosers!

334
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,458
That's okay... I love black tea.

335
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,625
That's okay... I love black tea.

336
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,875
You do...? So do I!

337
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,666
You're built to have babies.

338
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,958
You're built to have babies.

339
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,958
Are you out of your mind...?!
What are you doing?!

340
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,583
I've never heard that one
before, but thanks, I guess.

341
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,666
My heart's still pounding...

342
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,208
It's just the two of us...
she came here just to see me...!

343
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,500
Wow, Tenma's even prettier
without her uniform.

344
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,166
Do you like the flowers?

345
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,041
I was worried...

346
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,333
I mean, everybody
says you're supposed

347
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,916
to be such a tough guy
and everything...

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,625
I wasn't sure if flowers would
be an okay thing to bring you...

349
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,250
Of course they
were okay to bring...!

350
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,750
Even tough guys need something
beautiful in their lives!

351
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,041
Oh... uh... really?

352
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,750
For instance,
a beautiful girl like you...

353
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,458
...is exactly the sort of thing
you should say to her now.

354
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,750
How the hell are you doing that!

355
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,500
Cut it out,
will you...!

356
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,833
'sides... I just can't say
something that mushy

357
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,083
and embarrassing to her,
it isn't my style!

358
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,125
What's wrong with you...?
She came to see you...!

359
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,916
Say something sensitive!

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,041
But I...

361
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,250
You've got to tell
her how you feel...!

362
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,041
It's a basic rule of romance!

363
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,000
Aw man, you're right...

364
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,833
Okay... here goes...

365
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,833
A... darling beauty like... you!

366
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,041
Yes! I said it!

367
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,083
So you know about economics...?!

368
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,416
This barley duty...
it's a new tax?

369
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,791
Uh... oh, yeah... it's a new tax
on imported grain products...

370
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,333
It's making it very difficult
for farmers to turn a profit,

371
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,708
because of, you know,
economic factors and stuff...

372
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,833
Alas!

373
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,416
Her fortress of cuteness
is impenetrable

374
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,166
to my arrows of love!

375
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,916
Okay, I guess she can't
follow a conversation

376
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,833
if there's more than a
ten second gap between words.

377
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,416
So when you think about it,
she's really a good match for...

378
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,833
Huh...? What's that?

379
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,666
Oh... it's nothing.

380
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,208
Talk about two people who were
made for each other... heh.

381
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,083
Hey, I'm dying here! What now?

382
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,708
Just take it slow...

383
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,125
This girl is incredibly dim

384
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,666
when it comes to
realizing guys like her...

385
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,083
there are probably
lots of boys in class

386
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,750
who are interested
and she hasn't got a clue.

387
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,541
There are...? Make sure you
tell me their names later, okay?

388
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,125
Oh, calm down.

389
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:40,416
You'll be fine, you've got a big
advantage over those other guys.

390
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,583
Really?

391
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,083
Unlike most guys,
you don't seem to have

392
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,083
any problem embarrassing
yourself repeatedly...

393
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,166
Huh?

394
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,541
Yeah, no matter
what the humiliation,

395
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,750
you do it again
and again and again...

396
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,083
Itoko... level with me.

397
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:52,916
Huh?

398
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,958
Are you here to help me...?

399
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,500
Or are you just
yanking my chain...?

400
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,541
Come on, tell the
truth, will you?

401
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,083
Oops! Psshhtt!
I'm getting interference!

402
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,125
Psshhtt! I have
to sign off! Pshhtt!

403
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,333
What...? What's happening!

404
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,750
Ta for now... Kenji boy!

405
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,458
Itoko...! Wait a minute!

406
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,208
Oh man, I'm totally screwed...!
I'm all on my own now!

407
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,875
Huh...?! What? What is it?

408
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:16,833
What's happening now?

409
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,125
Rats... I went too far.

410
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,250
What? Is that all?

411
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,791
Don't worry about it...!

412
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,750
I ate an entire bag of apples
earlier, it's no problem...!

413
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,375
That core should
just about do me.

414
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,583
What?

415
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,666
You already had some
apples...? Then maybe...

416
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,875
It's fine!

417
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,250
Yummy, yummy, yummy,
apple core in my tummy!

418
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,750
Yummy, yummy, yummy

419
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,333
I don't even know
what I'm saying anymore!

420
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,958
She must think
I'm insane...! Aw crap!

421
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:46,041
She's laughing at me...!
Oh, no, what have I done?

422
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,083
It's nice.

423
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,166
I mean, we sit right next
to each other in class

424
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,375
but we've never really

425
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,416
had a chance to talk
to each other before...

426
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,458
we got to talk about all
kinds of stuff today...

427
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,750
I think that's nice.

428
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,708
She's right...! I never
thought of it that way...

429
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,666
I just didn't have
enough faith in myself...

430
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,333
It was dumb to
ask Itoko for help...

431
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,416
I just had to be myself...

432
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,916
Maybe it's not too late...!
I can still tell her how I feel.

433
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,333
Just be myself...

434
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,541
I'll take her in my arms...
and tell her!

435
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,125
I love you!

436
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,916
I'm afraid the party
you were trying to reach

437
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,208
left the room while
you were still thinking...

438
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,458
She said... take care.

439
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,291
Look...

440
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,916
I'm Tenma Tsukamoto...!
Are you in love with me?

441
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,458
Just shut up!

442
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,916
The teacher sent Yakumo
to check up on our class!

443
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,875
Doesn't he trust us
to behave ourselves?

444
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,750
Next time on School Rumble:
"Cleaning the Pool!

445
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,916
Running Around The Pool!
Pool Wars!"

446
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,625
Come on, guys, we're supposed
to clean the pool! Get serious!
