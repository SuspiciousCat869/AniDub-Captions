you'd return to help!

00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,363
Alice: I have just returned
from the eastern gate.

16
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,499
There is not much time
before it crumbles away

17
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,568
and the army of the dark
marches through.

18
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,703
Eldrie: They have 50,000.

19
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,239
We have but 3,000.

20
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,442
As far as training them,
we are doing all we can.

21
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,578
Alice: And where
are the other integrity knights?

22
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,313
Are they all out on patrol?

23
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,783
As I made my approach,
I could only see seven.

24
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,253
Eldrie: They are
all we have here.

25
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,322
Alice: What? That is impossible!
Counting the two of us,

26
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,391
there should be
31 knights in the order!

27
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,727
Technically, there are, milady.

28
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,462
But you know as well as I,

29
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,665
when a knight
showed signs of distress,

30
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,734
chudelkin would use the arts
to recalibrate them.

31
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,135
At the last count,

32
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,471
ten knights have yet
to be awakened from that.

33
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,672
( Alice gasps )

34
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,275
Eldrie: Currently,
21 knights are active.

35
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,277
There are four
stationed at the cathedral

36
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,678
to guard the capitol,

37
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,082
and four are on patrol
over the end mountains.

38
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,151
Alice: That only
leaves 13 then.

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,486
Eldrie: Needless to say,

40
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,421
we are stretched far too thin.

41
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,823
And with all that we face...

42
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,559
( Sighs ) You brought him.

43
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,195
Do you intend to protect him
while you fight?

44
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,831
Alice: Yes, of course.

45
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,967
I've sworn to protect him.

46
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,502
Eldrie: But how can you?!

47
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,571
He is nothing but dead weight!

48
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,239
If you burden yourself with him,

49
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,641
not only will it affect
your ability to fight,

50
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,977
it'll place you
in certain danger!

51
00:02:59,113 --> 00:02:59,945
( Grunts )

52
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,115
Bercouli: That's enough, Eldrie.

53
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,649
Relax.

54
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,184
Hey, little girl!

55
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,187
You look like you been
taking care of yourself.

56
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,323
Even your cheeks filled in.

57
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,558
Alice: Hello, uncle.

58
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,261
It has been too long.

63
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,942
( Thinking )
Is he going to kill Kirito?

64
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,346
Bercouli: No need for that, kid.

65
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,247
( Alice gasps )

66
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,252

- ( Metal rings )

68
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,690
Alice: U-uncle.

69
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,226
Bercouli: All right,
tell me what you saw.

70
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,629
Alice: I think I saw...

71
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,697
A flash of swords just now.

72
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,634
Bercouli: Mm-hmm. I tossed
an incarnate sword at him.

73
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,236
Well, actually it was
more like a dagger.

74
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,372
It only would have
scratched his cheek a bit,

75
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,706
if it hit him, that is.

76
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,041
Alice: "If it hit"?

77
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,310
Then that means he--

78
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,444
Bercouli: That's right.

79
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,646
He stopped it.

80
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:10,182
He did it with his willpower.

81
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,950
( Alice gasps )

82
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,056
Bercouli: It might not look
like his mind's all there,

83
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:21,126
but the kid ain't dead. No way.

84
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,463
And he wasn't protecting himself
when he blocked my strike.

85
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,531
- He was protecting you.
- ( Alice gasps )

86
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,001
Bercouli: He'll snap
out of it one day.

87
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,068
That's what I think.

88
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,204
I can't tell you when,

89
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,540
but I bet it'll be
when you need him the most.

Bercouli: Don't get hung up
on the small stuff, Eldrie.

93
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,921
We can look after
this kid, easy.

Alice: Right.

97
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,200
I shall get them.

Alice: Kirito.

100
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,517
Even though the battle
with administrator

101
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,519
cost you your heart,

102
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,654
still, you had the will

103
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,190
to protect me
from uncle's sword technique.

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,062
Tell me,
what do you think of me?

105
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,597
And to that end,

106
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,667
what do I think of you?

107
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,401
Ridiculous.

108
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,136
I am unnatural,

109
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,205
a puppet created to fight

110
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,408
using Alice zuberg's body
as a vessel.

111
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,344
I am not allowed
the luxury of emotions,

112
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,147
only the will to do battle.

113
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,549
Although, what if...

114
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,486
That is why I cannot
break through to you,

115
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,388
because I hold myself back?

116
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:06,398
Would you respond if I unleashed
all of my will right now?

I appreciate it.

Ronie: Oh, and here is
your bread and drink.

Alice: There is nothing
to be afraid of.

125
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,455
I see by your uniforms

126
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,057
you are
from the swordcraft academy.

127

Tiese: Yes, my lady, we are.

128
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,195
I'm primary trainee

Ronie: And I'm primary trainee
Ronie Arabel, ma'am!

131
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,604
Alice: You do not have
to be so formal with me.

132
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,341
I am a warrior, here to protect
the land, same as you,

133
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,276
so please call me Alice.

134

00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,212
What is wrong?

136
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,214
Tiese: Huh? No, nothing!

137
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,151
It's just that when we first
met you at the academy,

138
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,953
you seemed different
than you are now.

139
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,488
Alice: Oh. Was I?

140
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,091
Anyway, is there
something I can do for you?

141
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,226
Tiese: Yes, I think.

Tiese: Um, sorry to pry, Mila--

144
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,366
I mean, Alice,
but the word around the camp

145
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,035
is that you came here
with a black-haired boy.

146
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,237
Ronie: We knew someone
at the academy like that,

147
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,640
and we thought
we'd come see if it was him,

148
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,641
if you don't mind.

149
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:25,177
Alice: No,
of course I do not mind.

150
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,711
Now that I recall,

151
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,981
you were friends of Kirito's
at the academy.

152
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,649
Ronie: I knew it! It is Kirito!

153
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:34,186
Tiese: Then Eugeo
must be here, too! Yeah!

154
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,454
- Alice: I am sorry.
- Both: Huh?

155
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,723
Alice: There is
no easy way to say this.

156
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,993
I do not wish to upset you.

157
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,997
However, since Eugeo and Kirito
were your mentors,

158
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,565
you have the right to know.

00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,782
It was Eugeo.

166
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,185
He said not to cry

167
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,455
and he'll be here, always.

168
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,458
( Crying )

169
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,894
ｶ

170
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,664
Alice: I am sorry.

171
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,266
You must love them dearly.

172
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,201
Ronie: Don't say that!

173
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,336
We--we could never...

174
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,606
Tiese: Lady Alice, when you
arrested Kirito and Eugeo,

175
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,076
did you know what they did?

176
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,345
Alice: Yes. They violated
one of the taboos.

177
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,148
They were involved
in the death of another.

178
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,419
Tiese: And do you know what led
up to them breaking that taboo?

179
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,355
Alice: No, not entirely.

180
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:20,292
Tiese: They raised their swords
to save us,

181
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,694
because we weren't strong enough
to save ourselves.

182
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,429
( Alice gasps )

183
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,365
Tiese: If only we'd handled
our troubles ourselves,

184
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,302
they wouldn't have rebelled
against the laws of the church,

185
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,304
and no one would have died.

186
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:37,309
Ultimately, we are the ones
to blame for what happened.

187
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,245
That's why...

188
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,015
No matter how we
truly feel about them...

189
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,251
We can't say we love them!

190
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,528
Alice: It is not your fault.

191
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,597
You've done nothing wrong.

192
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,999
Ronie: But we have!

193
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:04,669
You're a noble integrity knight,
so you can't understand!

194
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,471
We're sinners!

195
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,674
We caused bloodshed
by letting ourselves be defiled!

196
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,210
Alice: The body
is nothing more than a vessel.

197
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:16,548
Your heart, your soul
is who you really are,

198
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,551
and you determine
the nature of your soul,

199
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,453
you, and you alone.

200
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,023
( Thinking ) Show them...

201
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,925
ｶ

202
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,933
Just like Kirito showed you.

203
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,606
( Both gasp )

204
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,213
ｶ

205
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,985
Alice: You see?
The person you really are

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,320
is but the reflection
of your heart,

207
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,455
and that cannot be defiled.

208
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,458
I was born in a tiny village.

209
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,728
I should have grown up
to become who you see now,

210
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,399
but when I was just a child,
I was arrested for a crime.

211
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,733
My memories were erased,

212
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,203
and I was turned into
an integrity knight.

213
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,138
There were times
I cursed my fate.

214
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,476
However, Kirito taught me
to overcome it,

215
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,011
that I had the power to.

216
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,412
I just had to will it,

217
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,481
and I won't doubt myself again.

218
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:26,151
I've chosen to accept who I am
and move on.

219
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,224
I am sure, given time,

220
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,695
the two of you will also
find your way and find peace.

221
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,431
( Both crying )

222
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:49,441
Birds chirping )

223
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:53,378
Bercouli: Hey.

224
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,114
Alice: Uncle.

225
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,716
- Good morning.
- ( Bercouli grunts )

226
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,185
I was thinking
about your friend just now

227
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,587
and what to do with him
when the fighting starts.

228
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,523
Alice: I have already
made arrangements.

229
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,658
Last night, I was paid a visit

230
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,927
by his former pages
from the academy.

231
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,530
I trust them, so I asked them
to look after Kirito.

232
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,532
Bercouli: Good.
Glad that's settled.

233
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,267
By the way,
how'd the kid take it?

234
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,203
Did seeing
these folks from his past

235
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,139
snap him out of his fog any?

236
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,140
Alice: Mm-mmm.

237
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,608
Bercouli: Oh, well. Chin up.

238
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,545
Something tells me he'll
come around and, when he does,

239
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,280
he'll be the one
who sets the course of this war.

240
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,483
- Alice: Hmm?
- Bercouli: Even if he got help

241
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,353
from you and his partner,
killing the prime senator

242
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,822
and the pontifex
was anything but easy.

243
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,690
If I took him on,

244
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,426
I doubt I'd last
against his incarnate ability.

245
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,562
( Alice gasps )
You exaggerate.

246
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,097
Bercouli: Yesterday,
when our wills clashed,

247
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,834
I definitely felt it.
That kid's got equal

248
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:53,238
or, hell, even more experience
in real combat than me.

249
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,306
Alice: But how is that possible?

250
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,108
You are much older.

251
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,243
Bercouli: Not in experience.

252
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,112
- He's got way more.
- ( Alice gasps )

253
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,582
Bercouli: The taboo index
forbids battles to the death,

254
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,518
but he's got
tons of experience with that.

255
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,253
Question is, how?

256
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,455
Alice: Uncle, he is not from--

257
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,990
Fanatio: Commander.

258
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,725
It is time for the council.

259
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,561
Alice: Lady Fanatio.

260
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,466
( Gasps )

261
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,202
ｶ

262
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,738
( thinking )
Sh-she is wearing makeup?

263
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
Fanatio: It has
been ages, Alice.

264
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,341
You've been well, I take it?

265
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,743
Alice: So feminine!

266
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,213
Y-Yes, and you?

267
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,747
Fanatio: As well as can be.

268
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,550
Say, is it true you brought
that black-haired boy here?

269
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,285
- Alice: I have.
- Fanatio: Good.

270
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,288
After our meeting, I would
like to see him for a moment.

271
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,757
Alice: For what reason?

272
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,292
Fanatio: I wish to thank him.

273
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,293
It won't take long.

274
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,294
Alice: Thank him?

275
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,295
Fanatio: Indeed.

276
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:51,697
Even though he defeated me,

277
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,433
he fought honorably.
Truth be told,

278
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:57,703
that boy is the only male
who fought me with all he had.

279
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,171
It did not matter to him
in the slightest

280
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,640
that I happened to be a woman.

281
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,642
Alice: Why would that matter?

282
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:07,178
Fanatio: When I first became
a knight and fought with men,

283
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,514
I could tell they held back,

284
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,250
so I donned this helmet

285
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,452
and mastered the art
of continuous attacks

286
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,588
to prevent my opponents
from getting too close.

287
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,258
Ultimately the real issue

288
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,526
was that I was self-conscious
about my gender.

289
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,595
He saw right through me, though,

290
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:26,598
and fought with all his might,
regardless.

291
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,134
I unleashed all
of my sword techniques and arts,

292
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,069
and he still bested me.

293
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,471
Then after I healed,

294
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:36,007
my petty obsession
had disappeared entirely.

295
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:40,479
There! Now do you understand
why I am so eager to thank him?

296
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,348
I am also a tad vexed,
to be honest.

297
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,817
My femininity did not register
with him at all

298
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,486
once he saw my face.

299
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,088
I thought if I saw him,
I could...

300
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,358
Try a few things that
might stimulate his recovery.

301
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,359
( Alice gasps )

302
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,361
I am grateful for your concern,

303
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,297
but he is resting
at the moment.

304
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,499
I will make sure
to give him your regards

305
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,901
- when I check on him later.
- Fanatio: Oh.

306
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,037
It seems you've installed
yourself as his guardian.

307
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,239
Well, whenever
the commander was on duty

308
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,908
and you wished
to speak with him,

309
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,044
I never refused you,
not even once.

310
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,114
Alice: I do not
need your permission.

311
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,382
I can see him any time I choose.

312
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,184
And another thing,

313
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,987
if you truly wished to be
beaten senseless by a male,

314
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:24,456
surely uncle here
could have obliged you.

315
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,325
Fanatio: I would
not expect him to.

316
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,660
He is the strongest swordsman
in the land.

317
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,595
He would not spar
with his knights full-bore.

318
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:33,132
- ( Bercouli groans )
- Alice: Oh, you don't say?

319
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,134
Well, whenever I
trained with him,

320
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,337
he was always drenched in sweat
from the exertion.

321
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,071
( Fanatio laughs )

322
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,472
- Is what she says true...
- Alice: Uncle...

323
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,541
- Fanatio: Command--
- Alice: Set this woman strai--

324
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,075
Bercouli: Come on!

325
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,411
It's time
we got this meeting started.

326
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,680
( Both gasp )

327
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:50,349
( Both sigh )

328
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,084
Fanatio: We have considered
many different strategies

329
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,554
over the past four months
and have concluded that,

330
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,088
at our current strength,

331
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,691
it would be difficult
to repel an all-out attack.

332
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:02,427
On our side
of the end mountains,

333
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,164
there is nothing
but grassland and rocks

334
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,432
for ten kilors
in all directions.

335
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,368
If the enemy
advances this far,

336
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:12,037
we will be surrounded
and slaughtered.

337
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,375
Our only option is to engage
them in this narrow ravine,

338
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,179
which is one hundred mels wide
and one thousand mels long.

339
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,247
We will set up
a defensive position here,

340
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,383
absorb their charge,
and grind them down.

341
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:27,318
This will be the basic thrust
of our strategy.

342
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,288
Does anyone have
any thoughts so far?

343
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,058
Eldrie: I have a concern.

344
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,060
The enemy
has ogres and longbows

345
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:38,530
and, even more dangerous,
dark mages of untold numbers.

346
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,200
How can we counteract
their long-range attacks?

347
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,735
Fanatio: I have an idea on that.

348
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:46,205
( Alice gasps )

349
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,473
Fanatio: There is
no sunlight in that ravine,

350
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:49,674
even during the day.

351
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,476
Not even the grass grows.

352
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:54,279
Sacred power
is sparse there, at best.

353
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:56,681
But in theory,
if we absorb the power

354
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,417
from the battlefield first,

355
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,152
their mages won't be able
to use it to attack us.

356
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:02,754
( Officers gasp )

357
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,290
Fanatio: The same is true
for our side as well.

358
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:09,360
At the present, we only have
100 who can wield the arts.

359
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,898
If we allow the battle to come
down to our wielders and theirs,

360
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,234
theirs will use far more power.

361
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,437
Deusolbert: The arts are not
just used for combat, though.

362
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,240
If all the sacred power
is exhausted,

363
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,242
healing the lives
of our critically wounded

364
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,576
will be next to impossible.

365
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,112
Fanatio: I admit
it is a risky gamble,

366
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:29,180
which is why we brought
all the reagents

367
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,916
and healing potions
from the capital.

368
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,118
If we use our sacred arts
only for healing

369
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:34,653
and the potions for support,

370
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,022
the reagents should last
for at least three days.

371
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,391
Alice: There is one more issue.

372
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,394
If I may...

373
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,530
While solus and terraria's
blessings are sparse there,

374
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,333
during the battle,
with each warrior who falls,

375
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:51,402
more sacred power
will be released and accumulate.

376
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,940
I do not see how we can absorb
all those extra resources

377
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,476
if there are not
enough of us to do so.

378
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:01,280
Fanatio: We can.
Well, actually, one of us can.

379
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,614
Alice: Who?

380
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,883
Fanatio: Why, you,
Alice synthesis thirty.

381
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,351
( Alice gasps )

382
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,419
Fanatio: Perhaps you
haven't realized it yet,

383
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,355
but your power
has surpassed that

384
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,557
of all the integrity knights
in the land,

385
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,294
and you are ready to use it now,

386
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,630
a godlike power
that can split heaven and earth.

387
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,631
( Alice grunts )

388
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,167
Would you please
look after Kirito

389
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,435
and keep him safe?

390
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,570
Tiese: Yes. You can count on us.

391
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,306
Ronie: Lady Alice,
don't you worry.

392
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,574
We promise we will
protect him with our lives.

393
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,876
( Alice chuckles )

394
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,246
Kirito, I must leave,

395
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,249
and I do not know
if I shall return.

396
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,121
You saved my life,
and I will use all of it,

397
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,389
to the last drop if I have to.

398
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,925
And so, should I fall in battle

399
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,260
and call you
with the last of my breath,

400
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,797
would you stand
and draw your sword for me?

401
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,732
With you awake,
it would not matter

402
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,201
how many thousands
the enemy has.

403
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:59,738
You will perform another miracle
and protect everyone,

404
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,273
as before.

405
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:13,018
After all, you were the one
who defeated administrator.

406
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,954
You are
the greatest swordsman ever.

407
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,357
( Footsteps approach )

408
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,892
Eldrie: Lady Alice.

409
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,462
Are you ready to go?

410
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,098
Alice: Eldrie?

411
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,201
Eldrie: Yes? Milady?

412
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,304
Alice: Thank you.
You have served me well.

413
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,439
( Eldrie gasps )

414
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,042
Alice: I was blessed
to have you by my side,

415
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:39,310
even though
it was not for long.

416
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,447
You chose an amateur like me
to be your mentor

417
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:45,384
instead of a male veteran
like sir deusolbert.

418
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,519
Was that out of sympathy for me?

419
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,054
Eldrie: No, not at all!

420
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,256
I would never be
so disrespectful!

421
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:53,658
I chose you
because I was so in awe

422
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,661
of your sword technique
and skills as a warrior!

423
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,731
Alice: And it is due
to your unwavering support

424
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:02,201
that I was able to survive
to see this day.

425
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,135
I thank you.

427
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,008
Eldrie: Lady Alice,

428
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,076
you speak with such finality.

429
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:13,078
It is as if you think
your journey,

430
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,081
instead of going on,
is about to end.

431
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:20,552
It cannot! I still have
not learned all I can from you!

432
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:24,223
My technique, my arts,
I am nowhere near ready!

433
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,492
I still need you
to continue my training and--

434
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:29,294
and guide me
to be a better knight!

435
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,431
Alice: Integrity knight
Eldrie synthesis thirty-one!

436
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,433
( Eldrie gasps ) Yes, milady.

437
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,769
Alice: As your mentor,
here are my final orders.

438
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,304
You will survive,

439
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,573
survive to witness
peace in the land,

440
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,109
and after, you will
seek out your true life

441
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,578
and take it back
and the one you love.
