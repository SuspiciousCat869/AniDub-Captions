something most crucial.

Renly: The unit
I was assigned to command

I am sure some have died.

We haven't
introduced ourselves yet.

My name is Ronie Arabel.

This is Tiese Schtrinen.

And the one behind her...

76
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,519
That's elite disciple Kirito.

77
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,655
Renly: Kirito?

78
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,924
He is the one
who killed the pontifex?

79
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,262
Ronie: Sir knight, forgive me
if I'm being impertinent,

80
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,666
but since you're here,
could you please help us?

81
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,869
We hate to ask, but you see,

82
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,807
we gave our word we'd keep
Kirito safe, no matter what.

We can't defend ourselves
against things like Goblins yet.

Even so, we accepted
this responsibility.

just a whole lot
of this weird-looking smoke.

98

( Kosogi chuckles )

172
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,774
Renly: Are you their commander?

173
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,042
Kosogi: Yeah. I be Kosogi,

174
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:40,712
chief of the mountain Goblins.

175
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,247
What a shame.

176
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,917
You done killed
some of my best warriors.

177
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,385
Surprised to find ye here...

178
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,054
Ye bein' an integrity knight
and all.

179
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,257
Why ain't you be
where the action is,

180
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,325
with the other knights?

181
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,860
Renly: That is
none of your concern.

182
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:56,762
Now perish!

183
00:09:59,065 --> 00:09:59,932

Kosogi: Thought I was just
another Goblin, did ye, boy?

187
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:15,047
Well, I ain't so impressed
with ye, either, to be honest.

188
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,217
You said before
you were an integrity knight.

189
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:23,087
I was told one of you
could take on a thousand.

190
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,891
But that ain't the case
for ye, now, is it? ( Chuckles )

191
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:30,829
That's why ye be hidin'
all the way back here.

192
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,765
Ain't that right?

193
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,168
Administrator: It seems
that you are broken, child.

194
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,103
Renly: Perhaps she was right.

195
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,172
I am a failure.

196
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,073
Maybe I am.

197

198
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,178
( chuckles ) You are correct.

199
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,513
I am not much of a knight.

200
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,383
Even so, let us be clear.

201
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,852
Though I might be defective,

202
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,820
these are not!

( Kosogi growls )

207
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,480
I can do this all day, boy!

208
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,015
Renly: Release...

209
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,017
Recollection!

210
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,194
Beautiful.

211
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:46,205

Fizel: Well, well, well.

218
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,207
Someone's gotten
a bit more knightly.

219
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,943
We were hoping
to get credit for saving you.

220
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,945
Too bad you had to spoil that.

221
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,681
( Linel sighs )
No one's gonna care

222
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,883
that we chopped off
way more heads than you did.

223

( Fizel groans )

224
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,556

we humbly request your orders.

( Clears throat )

227
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,561
Very well, then.

228
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,829
Keep Kirito and the girls safe.

229
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,031
Fizel: You don't
have to worry about that.

230
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,501
We handed them all off
to the supply corps just now.

231
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,570
( Renly sighs )

232
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,305
We should secure the area, then.

233
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,907
Linel: We killed
all the Goblins here.

234

( Renly gasps )

235
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,442
I-If  that is the case,

236
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,445
then I suppose
we'd best return to our units.

237
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,313
Fizel: Yes, sir.

238
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,715
Linel: As you command.

239
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,758
Renly: Thank you.

240
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:26,771
Mage: Lord Sigurosig,
Lord Shibori, and Lord Kosogi

241
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,173
have all been killed.

242
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,242
Dee: Useless wretches.

243
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,911
Demi-Humans can't be
counted on for anything.

244
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,581
Have you located
all the integrity knights yet?

245
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,183
Mage: Currently
we have the three

246
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,052
on the front lines
in our sights.

247
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,855
We found two more
among their rear units,

248
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,257
but we do not
have a fix on them yet.

249
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,860
Dee: There are
only five knights here?

250
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:51,129
Impossible, unless that is
all they ever had.

251
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,998
Regardless of how many
there are here,

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,268
we must slaughter them all.

253
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,336
Go on. Wake the minions.

254
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,338
Have them fly for 700 mels,

255
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,675
then descend
upon the battlefield...

256
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,810
And kill everything.

257
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,279
Mage: Forgive the question,

258
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,948
but won't our Demi-human units
get caught in that?

259
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,349
- Dee: Too bad.
- Mage: Right.

260
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,286
How many minions do you wish?

261
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,354
We have 800 available.

262
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,356
They are all
hatched and ready to go.

263
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,992
Dee: Hmm.

264
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:22,928
( Slurps )

265
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:26,131
Send every last one of them.

( Minion roars )

267
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,508
Bercouli: Here they come.

269
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,072
Time-splitting sword!

( Chorus vocalizing )

271
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,075

Dee: You imbecile!

278
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
How did we not know

279
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,656
they had
such a large unit of mages?

280
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,992
- Mage: Th-they don't.
- ( Dee sputtering )

281
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,927
Mage: I-I don't know
what happened.

282
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,798
( Dee breathes deeply )

283
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,333
Have they deployed
their flying dragons yet?

284
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,601
Mage: No.

285
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,136
The skies above the battlefield
are clear.

286
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,539
Not one dragon has been spotted.

287
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,276
Dee: Then there can be
only one explanation for it.

288
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:22,014
That must be
perfect weapon control,

289
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,149
their knight's special skill.

290
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,484
Damn them.

291
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,220
( Scoffs ) They are
stronger than I thought.

292
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:32,090
Using a weapon that way
is risky, though.

293
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,693
It would drain massive amounts
of the knight's life.

294
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,029
How could they unleash
such a barrage?

295
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,430
Mage: I just got word, milady.

296
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,233
Our spotters located
the two knights in the rear.

297
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,567
We've targeted them.

298
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,004
We now have all five of them
in our sights.

299
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,406
Dee: Good.

300
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,710
I have waited for this.

301
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,914
It is my chance for glory,
and I shall seize it.

303
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:00,652
Ogre archers and dark mages,

304
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,587
advance into the ravine!

305
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,122
Once you are in position,

306
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:09,127
ready the bows, and begin
the incineration incantation!

307
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,596
¶

308
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:27,145
Arch Mage: Mage unit...

309
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,883
Prepare for wide-range
incineration projectiles!

310
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:34,286
Spotters, begin the incantation
to guide the projectiles

311
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,921
to the integrity knight's
position!

312
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,324
Ogres, prepare to fire!

Alice: Why is it...

318
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:01,045
That the souls
of the fallen below,

319
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:03,315
whether human or Demi-human,

320
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,919
generate sacred power
that is so warm and pure?

321
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,522
The people of the human empire

322
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,324
and the monsters
of the dark territory

323
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:15,527
have essentially the same souls.

324
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,131
The only difference
is whether they were born

325
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,434
on one side of the end mountains
or the other.

326
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,271
If so, then why are they--

327
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
why are we fighting?

328
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:33,979
Kirito, if you were here...

329
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,684
No. I raised my sword
against the pontifex

330
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:42,154
and defied the axiom church.

331
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,157
It is my duty
to see this through now.

¶

334
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,294
Alice: They're here.

335
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:52,364
As far as maintaining elements,

336
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:56,301
I am no match for what thousands
of dark mages are capable of,

337
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,704
and converting sacred power
into fire or ice elements

338
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,573
would not be
a potent enough art

339
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:05,310
to sap all the spatial resources
rising from the ravine.

340
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,846
However...

341
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,382
Sealing luminous elements
inside a mirror

342
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,284
would reflect them infinitely,

343
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,658
Mages: System call!

344
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,660
Generate thermal element!

345
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:31,470
( Mages gasping )

346
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,305
( Arch Mage gasping )

347
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:38,544
System call!
Generate thermal element!

348
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,413
( Gasps )

349
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:44,082
Mage: It's not working.
What's going on?

350
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,418
Mage 2: What'll we do? We can't
activate the projectiles

351
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:48,286
without thermal elements!

352
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,223
Arch Mage: Damn! Why isn't
the incantation working?

353
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,891
Mage 3: Arch Mage, if I may,

354
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,228
I think all the spatial
resources have been depleted.

355
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,096
Arch Mage: What?!
Are you insane?!

356
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,765
That's impossible!
What about all the screaming?

357
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,768
Scores of both Humans and
Demi-Humans have died already!

358
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,339
If those resources aren't here,
then where did they all go?!

359
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,644
Alice: The burden
of taking countless lives

360
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:16,315
for the sake of one
shall be mine to bear.

361
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:21,119
Bloom, flowers!

362
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:23,055
( Chorus vocalizing )

363
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,805
( Inhales )

364
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,374
Burst element.

365
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,298
( Lava bubbling )

366
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:12,905
( Singing in Japanese )

367
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,873
