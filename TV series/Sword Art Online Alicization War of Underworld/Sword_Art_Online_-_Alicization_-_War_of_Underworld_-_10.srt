Aki: Are you ready for this?

4
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,751
Asuna: Yeah.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,419
Ready as I'll ever be.

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,554
Higa: Okay, Asuna,

7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,689
a couple reminders
before I log you in.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,426
You're using
superuser account zero-one,

9
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,494
Stacia, the Goddess of creation.

10
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,229
You'll have admin privileges

11
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,898
that include unlimited
manipulation of the landscape,

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,433
but be careful with it.

13
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,835
When you change the terrain,

14
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,571
the flow of the mnemonic data
between your S.T.L.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,907
And the underworld's main
visualizer is gonna be massive.

16
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,443
I'm talking "overloading
your fluctlight" massive.

17
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,713
You should be fine if you change
the terrain up a few times.

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,382
Just try not to overdo it.

19
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,717
You'll know you are
if your head starts hurting.

20
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,187
If it does, stop. Got it?

21
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,521
Asuna: Got it.

22
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,589
Aki: All right.

23
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,658
It's up to you now.
Go get him.

24
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,393
( Asuna chuckles )
See you in a bit.

I guess I overdid it
on the first try.

34
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,867
Whatever. Now that I'm here,
I have to find Kirito.

35
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,839
Tiese: Lady Stacia?

36
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:26,611
Are you her,
the Goddess, Stacia?

37
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,614
( Asuna sighs ) No, I'm sorry.

38
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,416
I'm definitely not a Goddess.

39
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:35,754
Ronie: But you--i mean,
you just performed a miracle!

40
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,822
Everyone owes you their lives!

41
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:40,959
You saved the guards
and the priests and me

42
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,428
- and my mentor Kirito, too.
- ( Asuna gasps )

43

Actually, Kirito's
the reason I'm here.

44
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,368
I need to see him now,

45
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,037
so please take me to him!

46
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,373
I know he's not well,

47
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,042
but I think I can help,
so let me see him.

Thank you both for keeping him
safe and letting me see him.

65

Ronie: Um, if you're
not lady Stacia,

66
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,310
then who are you,
and where are you from?

67
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,981
Asuna: My name is Asuna.
I'm human, just like you,

68
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,851
and I come
from the same place as Kirito,

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,788
not from this world,
another one.

70
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,856
Both: You're not from here,

71
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,524
and neither is he?

72
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,125
Ronie: But what world?

73
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,995
The only other one is heaven.

74
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,797
Is that where you're from,

75
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,399
the home of the three
goddesses of creation,

76
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,134
the gods who control
the elements, and the angels?

77
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,603
Asuna: Whoa, hold on!

78
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,739
He and I aren't from heaven
or any place like it.

79
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:38,410
I'm sorry. It's kind of
complicated to explain.

80
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,879
Maybe the best thing
would be for me to talk

81
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,682
to whoever's in charge here.
Can you take me to them?

82
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,150
Ronie: Yes, of course!

83
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,320
Please follow us.
We'll take you right to him.

84
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,093
Asuna: Don't worry, 'kay?

85
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,830
I'll be right back. Promise.

86
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,732

Begone from here!

100
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,471
Now, that is a heck of a sight.

101

Alice: Why do you
stop me, uncle?

107
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:58,090
Do not trust her.
She is a spy for the enemy!

108
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,158
Bercouli:
Would you relax, kiddo?

109
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,027
She's definitely
not working for the bad guys.

110
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,898
Didn't you see
what happened out there?

111
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,100
She saved everyone's lives...

118
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,855
This rainbow appeared,

119
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,190
and when it hit the ground,

120
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,259
it cracked it open
for a hundred mels.

121
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,194
It made a gap so wide,

122
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,064
those pugilists
couldn't even jump it.

123
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,266
We were this close
to being wiped out,

124
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,001
and she stopped it.

125
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,803
There's no denying that.

126
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,939
We owe this lady our thanks.

127
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,074
Alice: What are you implying?

128
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,075
She is either an enemy spy

129
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,146
or some filthy heretic
posing as a divine entity,

130
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,149
but there is no way
she is the Goddess Stacia!

131
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,283
( Asuna grunts )

132
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,352
Bercouli: Didn't say she was.

133
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,555
Think about it. If this
little lady was a real Goddess,

134
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,958
she'd be scarier
than the pontifex.

135
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,560
She'd break you in half
for bein' rude to her.

136
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,163
Then she'd chuck your ass
into that pit she conjured.

137
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,164
( Alice groans )

138

( Alice sighs )

140
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,508
Asuna: True. I may look it,
but I'm not a Goddess.

141
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,178
I'm a human being,
just like you.

142
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,313
That said,
I am from another world,

143
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,650
and I know things
about your situation you don't.

144
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,319
Bercouli: Hmm.
We should hear her out.

145
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,054
In fact, the other knights

146
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,657
and the unit captains
should be part of this.

147
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,859
We can discuss it
over some tea.

148
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,260
Alice: Right. As you wish.

149
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,997
Bercouli: Great.
Now that that's settled,

150
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,599
- I need your help, ladies.
- Girls: Huh?

151
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,334
Bercouli: Get some tea
and some booze for me,

152
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,803
and bring back it to my tent.

153
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:54,138
You might as well stay
for the meeting, too.

154
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,641
Girls: Yes, sir!

155
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,549
Alice: Let me be clear.

156
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,819
If you would like to see Kirito,

157
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,087
you must ask
my permission first.

158
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,025
His safety is my responsibility,
regardless of who you are.

159
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,959
( Asuna grunts ) That does it.

160
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,295
I don't need
your permission to see him.

161
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,630
He's not yours!

162
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,032
Alice: Perhaps he
should decide that.

163
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,233
( Asuna gasps )

164
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,035
Yes, perhaps he should.

165
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,003
Both: Hmph.

166
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,241
( Girls sigh )

167
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,110
Tiese: Wow. That's all
we needed, more tension.

168
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,180
Oh, well! Time to go
and boil some water.

169
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,649
You start that,
and I'll get the liquor jug.

170
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,485
- Okay? Okay!
- Ronie: Uh...

171
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:47,059
But Kirito's my mentor.

172
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,596
ｶ

173
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,131
Asuna: It's nice
to meet you all.

174
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,067
My name is Asuna,

175
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,002
and I come
from a world outside yours,

176
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:02,607
a human world, but you
can't physically get to it.

177
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:07,011
My home, the real world,
and yours, the underworld,

178
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,748
are two totally separate
planes of existence.

179
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:10,683
( Scattered gasping )

180
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,150
Asuna: As we speak,

181
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,686
there's a battle going on
in the real world.

182
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,221
It's between two groups,

183
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,291
and they're both fighting
for control of the underworld.

184
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,695
I'm here on behalf of one of
the groups. They're called rath.

185
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,763
Golgorosso:
Is that why you're here then,

186
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,299
to take over our world
and rule over it?

187
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,901
Asuna: No, not at all.

188
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,237
My group and I, we want
to protect the underworld.

189
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,038
The people
we're fighting against

190
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,774
don't care about this place.

191
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,042
They just want
one of your people,

192
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,978
and when they find them,
they'll capture them

193
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,315
and bring them into our world,
then destroy yours.

194
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,849
Golgorosso:
That's monstrous.

195
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,251
Captain: I don't believe this.

196
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,387
Captain 2: How do we know
she speaks the truth?

197
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,855
Bercouli: 'Cause it's possible.

198
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,926
The dark territory
surrounds the human empire.

199
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,728
It's basically a whole
'nother world from ours,

200
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,132
a place with folks who just
wanna invade and destroy us.

201
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,735
Few of us have ever seen it
or been to it,

202
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,203
but it's as real
as our side of the mountains.

203
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,340
And now we find out
there's another world out there.

204
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,743
I say sure, why not?

205
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,278
You said
these folks you're fighting

206
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,347
are looking
for someone specific.

207
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,049
You got any idea
who that could be?

208
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:20,084
( Asuna grunts )

209
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,486
( Alice gasps )

210
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,355
Uh, I am the one?!

211
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,824
- ( Captains murmuring )
- Bercouli: So that's what

212
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,826
this "priestess of light"
stuff's about.

213
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,030
Look, there isn't
much time left.

214
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,432
There's only one way
to keep the underworld safe,

215
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,034
and that's for Alice to return

216
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,903
to the real world with me
as quickly as possible.

217
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,173
Once the enemy
finds out she's not here,

218
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,375
they'll give up
and leave your world alone.

219
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:45,910
Alice: Y-you must be joking!

220
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:49,181
You want me to run away
to your so-called "real world,"

221
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,250
to abandon my people
when they need me the most?

222
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,253
I would never!
I am an integrity knight!

223
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,923
My one and only duty
is to protect the human empire!

224
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,325
Asuna: And you'd be doing that.

225
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,796
I'm sorry.
I wish there were another way,

226
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,264
but if the enemy
from the real world finds you,

227
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,467
they'll take you,
and then everything here,

228
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,735
the people, the land, the sky,

229
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:13,071
everything,
they will erase it all!

230
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,341
We have to go right now,
before they find you!

231
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,743
Bercouli: Hold on there!
It seems your information's

232
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,879
a bit out of date, little lady.

233
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,881
The enemy from your world,

234
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,749
yeah, they already found her.

235
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:25,651
( Asuna gasps )

236
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,020
( Bercouli sighs )

237
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,555
Everything makes
a lot more sense now.

238
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,026
It all fits. The priestess
of light and the dark god vecta.

239
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,895
That's why he suddenly
showed up to lead his army,

240
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,563
but he's not a dark god.

241
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,033
He came from the real world,
just like you.

242
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,968
Asuna: Dark god vecta?

243
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,906
Then the dark territory
has superuser accounts,

244
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,508
and they're not locked.

245
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:53,245
Renly: Um,
m-may I ask something?

246
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,313
Regarding
this priestess of light,

247
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,981
I have never heard
of her before.

248
00:11:57,051 --> 00:12:00,585
So why do these invaders
from the real world

249
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,455
want Alice,
of all people, so badly?

250
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:06,191
Sheyta: She broke the seal
in her right eye.

251
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,793
Alice: Y-you know
of what happened?

252
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,863
And the seal? But how?

253
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,065
Sheyta: The central cathedral
is indestructible,

254
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,000
made of
the hardest material here.

255
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,403
I think how fun it would be
to slice through it.

256
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,804
Then, all of a sudden,

257
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:22,006
I feel a horrible pain
in my right eye.

258
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,208
( Captains stammer )

259
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,544
( Bercouli chuckles ) I wonder,

260
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,547
how many of us here experienced
the same thing as her?

261
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:32,484
I'm sure at some point you all
had doubts about the pontifex

262
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:35,019
or some of the church's laws.

263
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,956
You saw flashes of red light
in your right eye,

264
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,092
and then you felt the pain.

265
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
It hurt so bad,
it made you forget

266
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,962
what you were thinkin' about,
didn't it?

267
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,430
You know what happens

268
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,632
if you keep thinking
those blasphemous thoughts?

269
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:51,636
The pain gets worse and worse
until it's searing your brain.

270
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,105
And then...

271
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,639
Alice: Your vision turns red,

272
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,374
and your right eye explodes.

273
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,442
( All gasping )

274
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,977
Renly: Then did your eye...

275
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,179
Alice: Mm-hmm.

276
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,782
To put a stop
to administrator's rule,

277
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,119
I knew I would be confronting
chudelkin as well as her.

278
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:12,056
To muster the resolve to do so,
I had to lose my eye. ( Gasps )

279
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,592
Come to think of it,

280
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,461
I recall administrator
saying something,

281
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,330
something about
the seal of the eye.

282
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:22,000
I believe she said, "code...

283
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,336
That's it! Code 8-7-1!

284
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,204
She looked right at me,

285
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,007
and that is what she called
the seal of the right eye.

286
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,876
I believe she also said
it was installed.

287
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:34,146
I did not know
what she meant at the time,

288
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:38,483
but could this code 8-7-1 seal
be a product of the real world?

289
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,420
Asuna: A seal, 8-7-1.

290
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,221
It must be an inhibitor.

291
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,223
But why would rath
install that in them?

292
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,493
In the end,
it would just get in the way.

293
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,699
Rath's ultimate goal was to make
an a.I. With true intelligence.

294
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,435
The underworld was created
for that purpose,

295
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,037
and that's why kikuoka and Higa

296
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,640
let it evolve
for centuries internally.

297
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,908
If the whole point
of this simulation,

298
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:05,177
was to give the a.I.S

299
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,512
the opportunity
to demonstrate free will,

300
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,115
forcing them into obedience
with an inhibitor

301
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,250
defeats the purpose.

302
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,385
Unless...

303
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,588
The seal is a kind of sabotage.

304
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,658
Are the people in the ocean
turtle's main con behind this?

305
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,661
No, the saboteur
must be someone with rath.

306
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,397
They could be with us in subcon.

307
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,667
I have to tell kikuoka,
but there's no terminal here.

308
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,936
I could suicide out,
but I need Alice to save Kirito!

309
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:33,105
What do I do?

310
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,142
Kirito: You know...

311
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,144
What to do.

312
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,946
( Asuna gasps )

313
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,147
( Sighs )

314
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,749
Alice:
Is something wrong with you?

315
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,351
Asuna: No. I'm fine.

316
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,553
Alice is right.

317
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,756
That code 8-7-1 seal
was put there by someone,

318
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,225
someone from my world,

319
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,759
and they're
on the enemy's side.

320
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,028
Bercouli: Hmm.

321
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,096
How do we get rid of the seal?

322
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,699
Is there a way to do it without
blowing out someone's eyeball?

323
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,301
Asuna: I'm sorry,
but I don't know of another way

324
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,504
to disable it
from inside the underworld.

325
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,639
( Bercouli sighs ) All right.

326
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,774
Based on what we know
about this enemy,

327
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,110
they only want someone
who's got the willpower

328
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,313
to break the seal
of the right eye. Why one of us?

329
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,983
Do all the folks in your world
have a seal like we do?

330
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:22,187
Asuna: No. That's something
we've never had to suffer.

331
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,989
In fact, I believe
the only point of difference

332
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,592
between the underworlders
and the real-worlders

333
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:31,129
is how you're being forced
to obey your laws and orders.

334
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,199
Whoever's responsible
for the seal in your eye

335
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,401
doesn't want you
having free will.

336
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,670
They're afraid
of this priestess of light,

337
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,005
as you call her,
because someone like that

338
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:43,208
could ruin
whatever they had planned.

339
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,143
And if she appeared in my world,

340
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:49,147
your priestess of light would be
considered extremely valuable.

341
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:52,016
Bercouli: I still don't get
what the fuss is about.

342
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:53,552
You said so yourself just now.

343
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,354
There ain't a whole lot
of difference between our kinds.

344
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,757
The only thing
is the seal of the right eye.

345
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,493
Except for Alice here.
She broke her seal,

346
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,761
and according to you,

347
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,696
she's no different
than a real-worlder now.

348
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:07,499
You got a world
full of your kind already,

349
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,301
so why are you
and your enemies

350
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,237
so obsessed
with snatchin' up little Alice?

351
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,439
And once you do
get her in your world,

352
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,109
what are you plannin'
on doin' with her?

353
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,643
Asuna: Sorry.

354
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,646
I can't say, not right now.

355
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,249
She should see
the real world first.

356
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,386
Then she can decide what she
wants to do for herself.

357
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,387
It's not heaven.

358
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:32,391
It's no paradise, either,
not even close.

359
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,460
Compared to here,
it's not as tranquil.

360
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,796
It's not as pretty or as clean.

361
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,732
But still, there are
good things about my world,

362
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,667
the people, for one.

363
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,402
There's some
who'd want to exploit you,

364
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,605
but there's more who'd want
to protect this world,

365
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,672
just like Kirito.

366
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:48,673
( Alice gasps )

367
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,309
ｶ

368
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,278
I have questions,

369
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,546
but they can wait until later.

370
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:58,216
First we must focus
on breaking the enemy army,

371
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,353
and then we must make peace
with the dark territory.

372
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,822
I will not go anywhere
until then.

373
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,091
Asuna: Fine. Besides,

374
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,293
now that we know
vecta's from the real world,

375
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,363
it'd be dangerous for us to
leave the safety of your army.

376
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,165
He'll be expecting that,
I'm sure.

377
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,301
That said, I'll join your people
in the fight.

378
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,503
As for vecta,
let me deal with him.

379
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,638
- ( Captains murmuring )
- Captain: All right!

380
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,240
Bercouli: We're glad
to have you along.

381
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,444
About your skill, how you
split the ground open like that,

382
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,646
is there a limit to using it?

383
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,582
Asuna: There is. I can alter
the landscape like that

384
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,185
one or two more times,
but that's it.

385
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,653
( Captains sigh )

386
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,789
Alice: This is our world,
remember?

387
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:40,392
Protecting it
is our responsibility, not hers.

388
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:42,727
Let us show her
what we are capable of!

389
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:45,130
Renly: Yes. Yes, you are right!

390
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,799
Lady Asuna is not a god.

391
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,868
She just told us she was human,
like the rest of us.

392
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,536
If she is willing to fight hard,

393
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,472
then we shall fight
even harder,

394
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,875
Sheyta: I support this, if only
to fight that pugilist again.

395
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,811
Golgorosso: You're right.
It's our world!

396
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,479
It's our duty to protect it!

397
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,681
( Overlapping chatter )

398
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,484
Asuna: And I'll protect
this world Kirito loved

399
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,420
from the hijackers
aboard the ocean turtle

400
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,489
and from rath, if I have to.

401
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,692
( Insects chirping )

402
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,232
Alice: I knew you would come.

403
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,433
( Asuna gasps )

404
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:25,404
Alice: Hmph.

405
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,573
( Sighs )

406
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:31,576
All right,
I will let you see him,

407
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:34,513
and I will tell you
everything I know of him.

408
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,249
In return, however,
if you are agreeable,

409
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,718
you must tell me
everything you know of him.

410
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,386
( Asuna chuckles )

411
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,521
It's a deal,

412
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,789
but we go back a long way,

413
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,392
so there's a lot to tell.

414
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,594
Just how long
were you and he together?

415
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,663
Asuna: Let's see.

416
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,331
I was his partner in battle
for two years.

417
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,201
Then we dated properly
for a year and a half,

418
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,539
and for two weeks,
we even lived together.

419
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:01,940
Alice: Is that so?

420
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,543
Well, I fought
by his side for one night,

421
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,611
but for the past six months,

422
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,547
I have lived with him
and taken care of him.

423
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,216
Asuna: Uh, really? That long?

424
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,818
Ronie: Excuse me.

425
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:17,289
Um, he--he was my mentor,

426
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,558
and I cleaned his room
for two months,

427
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,894
and I also learned
sword skills from him.

428
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:25,830
He also brought me honey pies
from the prancing deer cafﾉ.

429
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,434
I know I didn't spend as much
time with him as either of you,

430
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,104
but I'd like
to swap stories with you.

431
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,640
- ( Both chuckle )
- Asuna: All right.

432
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,977
You're more than welcome
to join us if you want, Ronie.

433
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:39,978
( Ronie sighs )

434
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,914
Liena: Pardon me for intruding,

435
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:44,917
but would you have room
for one more in your group?

436
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,852
Asuna: Hello there.
I saw you at the meeting.

437
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,322
Liena: I am an imperial knight
of norlangarth,

438
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:52,925
and my name
is sortiliena serlut.

439
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:56,394
I was going to wait until
after the battle to see him,

440
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,464
but since Kirito and I
share a bit of history,

441
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,666
I was most eager
to see how he was faring.

442
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:02,935
( Alice sighs )

443
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,937
Understandable,
chief guard serlut.

444
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,405
How do you know Kirito?

445
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:07,740
Liena: You may call me Liena,

446
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,542
if it pleases you, lady knight.
( Clears throat )

447
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:12,811
Kirito was a primary trainee

448
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,413
at the north centoria
swordcraft academy,

449
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:16,881
where I, too, was studying.

450
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,618
For one year,
he served as my page.

451
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,620
We trained together,
and in so doing,

452
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,022
I taught him
some of my sword skills.

453
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,824
Asuna: Uh...

454
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,891
( Alice chuckles )

455
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,560
Asuna: Okay. It already sounds

456
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,829
like you'll have
tons of neat stories.

457
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,965
Welcome to the club, Liena.

Alice: What is it?

462
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,444
Asuna: Back where we come from,

463
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,981
he's called
"dual-wielding Kirito."

464
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:49,848
Alice: Really?

465
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,790
Perhaps we should start

466
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,192
with you telling us
how he got that name.

467
