off the hook for real.

Lisbeth: He did it!
Thank God! He did it!

Renly: Ever since
I first laid eyes on him,

171
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,765
I had faith in him,

172
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,234
that at the last moment,

173
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,703
he and those swords
would save us all.

Kirito: Thank you, everyone.

176
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,712
I won't let your faith in me

177
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:56,648
or all the blood and tears
you shed be for nothing.

178
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,784
I mean it. Thank you.

Emperor Vecta, he's after--

184
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:15,267
Kirito: I know. It's fuzzy,
but I know he's after Alice.

185
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,403
Let's go get her back,
you and me, Asuna

Kirito, wh-what are you doing?!

190

( gasps )

194
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:08,954
We got a little under
eight hours and 20 minutes to go

195
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,956
before the JSDF boards us.

196
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,291
Boss wanted me
to crank up the time again

197
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,360
at the eight-hour mark,

198
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,895
but since the other players
got wiped out,

199
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,696
might as well do it now.

200

00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,176
That figures. I need a key.

204

Eh?

00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,446

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,118
Can you hear me?!
Come on! Wake up!

H-How's Kirito?

211
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,127
Rinko: He's out of danger.

212
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,463
His Fluctlight activity's
been fully restored.

213
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:54,332
It's a little too active,
to be honest.

214
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,002
Higa: Really?
Oh, that's good to hear.

215
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,870
Kikuoka: I swear, Higa,

216
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,072
you had me scared
for a second there.

217
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,075
I'm sorry. It's all my fault
that mole got onboard.

218
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,077
I should've vetted
the staff better.

219
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,413
Higa: It's okay, Keeks.

220
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,815
What about Alice
and the Underworld?

221
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,216
Kikuoka:
They're both safe for now.

222
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,285
All the players
from the U.S., China,

223
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,353
and South Korea
have logged out.

224
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:19,024
Higa: W-Wait.
China and South Korea?

225
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,092
They had people
logged in from there, too?

226
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,494
Rinko: Yeah, tons of 'em.

227
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,496
They posted
all over social media

228
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,564
using their competitiveness
as gamers

229
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,900
to rile 'em up and lure 'em in.

230
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,770
Higa: Uh-huh. That would do it.

231
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,839
Kirito: The 2,000
from Japan you logged in

232
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,842
put up a good fight,
but they were mostly wiped out.

233
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,176
At that point, there were still

234
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:41,780
over 20,000 Chinese
and South Korean players left.

235
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,449
Luckily,
that's when Kirito woke up,

236
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,917
- and just like that--
- ( alarm blaring )

237
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,219
Kikuoka: Oh, my God.

238
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,991
Critter: That's not good!

239
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,193
Computer: Fluctlight
Acceleration rate

240
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,463
safety limiter disengaged.

241
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:01,199
15 minutes until
maximum-acceleration phase.

242
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,934
For personnel in the STLs,

243
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,936
initiate disengagement
protocol immediately.

244
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,204
Higa: Crap.

245
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,206
Rinko: Maximum
acceleration phase?

246
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:11,877
Isn't the FLA rate limited
to 1,200 times normal speed?

247
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,411
Higa: Only for folks diving.

248
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,013
1,200's the limit

249
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,549
for the life span
of a real-world human soul,

250
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:20,085
but for observing,
we can't speed it up

251
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,354
more than 5,000 times normal.

252
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,023
That said, the hardware
can go even faster.

253
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,291
Rinko: But how fast?

254
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,160
The hardware
does have a limit,

255
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,495
doesn't it?

256
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,563
Higa: During
the maximum-acceleration phase,

257
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:34,500
the FLA rate
will be just over five million.

258
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,903
The two STLs in Roppongi
can't keep up at that speed,

259
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,171
'cause they're on a SAT-link.

260
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,373
They'll be disconnected
automatically.

261
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,309
But Kirito's and Asuna's
STLs are hard-wired.

262
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,444
Rinko: They're in danger!
Come on!

263
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,047
We have to get them
out of those STLs right now be--

264
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,248
Higa: No! We can't!

265
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,450
The initial acceleration phase
already started.

266
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,586
If we pull 'em out
of those machines now,

267
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,254
it'll damage
their Fluctlights!

268
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,856
Rinko: What about
the disengagement protocol?

269
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,991
Can we start that?!

270
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,261
Higa: Hey, Keeks, I'm going back
to the maintenance connector.

271
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,531
Kikuoka: Understood,
but I'm going to go with you.

272
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,065
I think
I should be strong enough

273
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,000
to carry you
down that ladder on my back.

274
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,068
Nakanishi: It's too risky!

275
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:11,937
Please, sir, let me take him!

276
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,338
Kikuoka: No. I need you

277
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,341
and the other agents
to defend the stairs.

278
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,876
We have to open
the bulkhead again,

279
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,346
which means you'll have
to engage the enemy directly,

280
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
which means the risk
is greater for you.

281
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:25,250
I'm sorry, but that's
the way it has to be.

282
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,153
Nakanishi: Sir, yes, sir.

283
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,023
( Higa gasps )

284
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,225
Wait a sec!

285
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,493
When I was operating
the STLs before,

286
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,496
I set us up with an open channel
to talk to Kirito!

287
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:41,367
He's on line C-12!
Hurry up, and call him now!

288
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,700
Kikuoka: What do I tell him?

289
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,970
Higa: Tell him
to log himself out!

290
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,575
Asuna: Is Alice safe?
Can you tell?

291
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,309
Kirito: She hasn't
been caught yet,

292
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:54,179
but there's
a massive presence chasing her.

293
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,713
Asuna: Oh, boy.

294
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,184
I hope we can catch up to her
before it's too late.

295
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,185
- Kikuoka: Kirito!
- ( Kirito winces )

296
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,520
Kikuoka: Can you hear me?

297
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,589
Kirito, come in!

298
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,592
Kirito: Kikuoka?
How am I hearing you?

299
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,326
I-I'm not at a console.

300
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,328
Kikuoka: Never mind that.
Just listen.

301
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,729
You're in a lot of danger.

302
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,266
The time acceleration rate
is increasing,

303
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,334
because the hijackers
disengaged the FLA limiter!

304
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,603
Kirito: The limiter?

305
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,605
Kikuoka: Higa says
if you're still in there

306
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,739
when we reach
maximum acceleration,

307
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,942
by the time
we disconnect you here,

308
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,743
200 years
will have passed there.

309
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,479
Kirito: What?!

310
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,481
Kikuoka: You and Asuna
have ten minutes

311
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:31,617
to reach the console
and log out manually.

312
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,485
Depleting your HP
is another option,

313
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,153
but it's too risky.

314
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,223
If you die after we reach
maximum acceleration,

315
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,025
you'll spend 200 years
in the Underworld

316
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,360
in a state
of total sensory deprivation!

317
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,229
Kirito: Got it.
Me and Asuna are headed

318
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,164
for the console
at the World's End Altar.

319
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,966
I'll catch up to Alice in a bit,

320
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,102
so get ready.
We're bringing her, too.

321
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:54,306
Kikuoka: Thanks,
but you two are more important.

322
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:58,310
I want you to prioritize
your escape over securing Alice.

323
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:01,713
200 years is longer than
the life span of a human soul.

324
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,581
So even though
we can delete your memories

325
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,050
after logging you out,

326
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,784
if you've been
in there that long,

327
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,654
the odds of you
regaining consciousness here

328
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,055
would be almost zero!

329
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,124
Kirito: Don't worry.
We'll make it.

330
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,326
We'll all make it.

331
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:16,328
Uh, oh, and one more thing.

332
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,530
I'm sorry, you know,

333
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,466
for calling you
a son of a bitch.

334
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,534
Kikuoka: Not at all.
I deserved it,

335
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,203
and you can punch me
when you get back.

336
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,405
Looks like Higa's ready.

337
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,675
I have to go. Good luck.

338
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,742
Kirito: You, too.

339
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:32,277
We'll get to that console.

340
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,079
See you in ten.

341

You sounded like it was serious.

342

343

The time here's
gonna speed up in ten minutes.

345
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:47,225
He wants us
to log out before it does.

346
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,360
Asuna: All right, then.

347
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,095
I wish we could
float here forever,

348
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,563
but Alice does need us.

349
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,165
Come on. Let's go get her.

they may carry knights
as gallantly as their parents.
