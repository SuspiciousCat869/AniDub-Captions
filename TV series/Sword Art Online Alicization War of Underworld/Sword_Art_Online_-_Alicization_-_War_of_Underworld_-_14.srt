00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,496
by some kind of poetic
explanation like that.

166
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,431
There's gotta be
a more logical reason.

167
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,100
The self. The subject.

168
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,769
The image he has of himself
that defines him.

169
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:28,640
Could there be a backup of
that quantum pattern somewhere?

170
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,575
No, of course there isn't.

171
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,178
We never made a copy
of Kirito's Fluctlight.

172
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,513
Rinko: Hey.

173
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,849
Higa: And even if
there was a copy,

174
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,317
it'd be impossible
to extract his self-image

175
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,652
and transfer it over.

176
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,187
Rinko: Higa, wait a sec.

177
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,190
Higa: Maybe if there was
an active quantum pattern

178
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,459
that could connect
to his Fluctlight.

179
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,728
But where would we find that?

180
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,063
- Rinko: Would you listen?!
- ( Higa gasps )

181
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,132
I'm listening.

182
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,734
Rinko: The subject observes,

183
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,269
the object is observed,

184
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,105
but you can't separate them
that clearly and easily.

185
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,140
Higa: Huh?

186
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,076
Rinko: Subjective and objective

187
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,010
are just philosophical concepts

188
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,680
that explain
the relationship of things.

189
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,814
And since humans
are social creatures,

190
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,349
not isolated individuals,

191
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,752
you have an image
of others in your mind,

192
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,820
and they have one of you
in theirs.

193
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,022
It's like we're all connected
up to a point

194
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,691
in a kind of network,
if you will.

195
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,360
Wouldn't you agree?

196
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,830
Higa: The image of me
in others?

197
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:26,665
It's like a...

198
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,834
a backup of the self-image!

199
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,237
That's it! We got it!

200
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,908
We can restore his subjective
self-image! We have the data!

201
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,978
It's in the Fluctlights
of the people he's closest to!

202
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:45,117
All right, if we wanna extract
that data, we need an STL,

203
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,052
and reproducing it'll take
more than one person.

204
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,256
We're gonna need two--
no, three people.

205
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,726
Hey, Keeks, the girls
diving from Roppongi,

206
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,529
how tight are they with Kirito?
Are they close?

207
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:58,997
Kikuoka: Yeah, they both are.

208
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,267
You heard about the Death Gun
case six months ago.

209
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,869
Well, Sinon helped Kirito
crack that one.

210
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,740
And Leafa is Kirito's
little sister.

211
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,341
Higa: This'll work!

212
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,010
We got what we need
to save Kirito!

213
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,946
We can restore his self-image!

214
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,414
We'll extract the image of him
stored in their Fluctlights

215
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,683
and connect it
to the damaged regions.

216
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,886
That should repair
his subjective self!

217
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,156
Hot damn, this is gonna work!

218
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,292
( gasps ) Oh, no!
What am I saying?

219
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,761
This won't work!

220
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,296
The equipment
I need to run everything

221
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,231
is in the main
friggin' control room!

222
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,699
( Rinko gasps )

223
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,035
Kikuoka: Don't beat
yourself up, Higa.

224
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,704
We have a better shot
at restoring Kirito now,

225
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,775
and that's good.
But for now, we wait.

226
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,644
Once our guests leave and
the Ocean Turtle's ours again,

227
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,645
we'll get to work.

228
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:47,846
Higa: That'll be too late!

229
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,581
We have to do it now.

230
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,317
If the "Asahi"
sends commandos to board us

231
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,320
and they end up fighting
the hijackers in the Main Shaft,

232
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,656
it could knock out
the power in SubCon.

233
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:01,059
If that happens,
Kirito's STL would shut down,

234
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,596
and he'd be logged out
of the Underworld unconscious.

235
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,931
In that state,
we'd never get him

236
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,801
to pass
the initialization stage,

237
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,737
and he'll never be able
to connect to the STL again.

238
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,740
We can't wait. We have to try

239
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,143
now, right now,
while he and those girls

240
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,277
are still in the Underworld.

241
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,247
It's our only shot
at saving him.

242
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,751
I'll do it, Keeks. I'll go.

243
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,087
Kikuoka: I don't follow.
Where are you going?

244
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,023
Higa: All right, here's my plan.

245
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,025
There's a cable duct

246
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,427
running down the stern side
of the Main Shaft.

247
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,897
It connects STL 2,
Kirito's room, to Main Con.

248
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,765
I'm gonna climb down the duct

249
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,167
'til I get
to the maintenance connector.

250
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,236
I'll patch in to it,
and I should be able

251
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,906
to control Kirito's STL
from there.

252
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,241
Kikuoka: But that connector is

253
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,976
on the same side of the bulkhead
as the hijackers.

254
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,445
If they find out
you're in the duct,

255
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,980
they'll breach it
and attack you from below.

256
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,982
Higa: Right,
so I'll need a decoy.

257
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,118
Kikuoka: Yes, you do, but who?

258
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,653
Higa: Not "who?"

259
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,322
I wouldn't want anyone here
to risk their life, too.

260
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,058
We'll unlock the bulkhead door,

261
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,126
then send some thing
that can't get killed

262
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,896
on a walk downstairs
to Main Con, him.

263
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,200
Kikuoka: Oh, I get it.

264
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,070
Ichiemon.

265
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,404
Rinko: Your robot?!

266
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,873
But all it can do is walk.

267
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,341
It can't fight or run
or anything else.

268
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,809
Once they see him coming,

269
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,144
they're just
gonna blow it to pieces,

270
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,812
and that's the end of that.

271
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,214
Higa: It sucks for Ichiemon,

272
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,015
but he's the best decoy we have.

273
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,418
Besides, with how he looks,

274
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,954
they might think he'll explode
if they shoot him.

275
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,891
( Rinko sighs ) Well, he'll
definitely get their attention.

276
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,025
That's for sure.
At the very least,

277
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,827
they might think
we sent him down there

278
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,097
because we're planning
something even more ridiculous.

279
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,233
Higa: They can't ignore him.
That's the point of sending him.

280
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,035
Then while the hijackers
are dealing with Ichiemon,

281
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,438
I'll climb into the lower part
of the duct,

282
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:54,907
patch into that connector,

283
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,175
and operate Kirito's STL
from there.

284
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,911
Kikuoka: We have two robots.

285
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,846
Hmm. We should send Niemon.

286
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:05,117
Higa: Nope. Like I told Asuna
before this nightmare started,

287
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,585
he's not ready yet.

288
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:09,053
He needs a Fluctlight to pilot
and keep him in balance,

289
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,055
or he'll just roll
down the stairs.

290
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,190
Kikuoka: Damn.

291
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:16,128
Rinko: Higa,
I'm not so sure about this.

292
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,931
Even if the decoy works,
when you're in that duct,

293
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,066
you're vulnerable, and if
they find you in there...

294
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,069
You should take an agent to keep
an eye out while you work.

295
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,806
Higa: No way. The JSDF agents
have to stay here

296
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,541
to keep all of you safe.

297
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,943
Besides, the duct

298
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,011
is way too narrow
for most folks to fit,

299
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:36,281
but not for
a skinny little nerd like me!

300
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,551
Don't you worry. I'll be down
and back before you know it.

301
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,887
Kirito risked everything
for this project.

302
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,290
If it weren't for him,
Alice's Fluctlight

303
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,425
wouldn't have developed
into what it is.

304
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,430
He tried to protect her.
That's why he's in this mess.

305
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,967
And that's why,
if there's a chance to save him,

306
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,570
I have to take it. Doesn't
matter if I'm risking my life.

307
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,105
It's the only way
I can make it up to him.

308
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,106
- ( Kikuoka grunts )
- ( Higa gasps )

309
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,508
( chuckles )

310
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,043
Man: Um...

311
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,378
if you don't mind,

312
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,881
I'd like to go with you
and be your bodyguard.

313
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,050
I'm pretty skinny myself,

314
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,518
but there's enough meat
on my bones

315
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,920
to stop a bullet
if it comes to that.

316
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,657
I'm also the one in charge
of cable maintenance here,

317
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,526
so I could be useful.

318
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,128
