174
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,653
Iskahn: Yeah, well,
I trained 'em myself.

175
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,122
Look, they got us
hemmed in here,

176
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,591
so south's the only way to go.

177
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,194
We'll have to take 'em all on
at some point,

178
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,063
but there's so many,
it ain't gonna be easy.

179
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,330
Asuna: We'll break
through the lines

180
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,665
and head south like you said,

181
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,069
then put as much distance
between us and them as we can.

182
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,804
As soon as we're
far enough away,

183
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,540
I'll try to make
another canyon to block them.

184
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,609
Soldier: I bring a message!

185
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,545
( Grunts )
Milady Alice has been taken.

186
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,347
Emperor Vecta snatched her up
and flew off with her.

187
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,349
The spotters saw his dragon
heading due south.

188
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,551
Asuna: What?!

189
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,819
Iskahn: That's where we're--

190
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,222
wait! He took off with her?

191
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,157
Then when I saw him, he wasn't
just checking out the battle!

192
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,559
Hey, woman!

193
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,229
Your Alice is the priestess
of light, ain't she?

194
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,232
The whole point of my people
being here was to catch her.

195
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,500
Why does the emperor
want her so bad?

196
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,103
Wh-what'll happen
when he gets her?

197
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,439
Asuna: This world'll be...

198
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,373
- Destroyed.
- ( Iskahn gasps )

199
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,244
Asuna: That's vecta's plan,
to take Alice,

200
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,580
the Priestess of Light
down to the World's End Altar.

201
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,382
And once there,
this world and everything in it

202
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,452
is going to be wiped out.

203
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,659
Sheyta: A dragon
cannot fly forever.

204
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,996
And with passengers,
they only last half a day.

205
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,531
- ( Gloves clank )
- Iskahn: Right.

206
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,999
Then I guess
you should get goin'

207
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,000
while the gettin's good!

208
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,535
Asuna: You'd let us go,

209
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,471
just like that?

210
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,405
But you're
from the dark territory,

211
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,474
and he's your emperor.

212
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,608
You're talking treason.

213
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,744
Iskahn: I don't know about that.

214
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,079
At the start of this,

215
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,614
vecta gave
his council of ten an order

216
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,484
that all he wanted
was this Priestess of Light.

217
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,219
And now that he's
got what he wanted,

218
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,957
I'd say his order to us has
been fulfilled. Wouldn't you?

219
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:15,226
Me and my people
are free to do whatever now,

220
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,896
so if we wanted to help you
and the human army

221
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,432
steal the priestess back
from the emperor, we could.

222
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,102
The choice is up to us.

223
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,103
( Chuckles )

224
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,104
Right?

225
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,105
( Asuna gasps )

226
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,572
( Glove creaks )

227
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,174
Iskahn: I--

228
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,177
we can't disobey the emperor.

229
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:35,246
If he tells us
we have to fight you,

230
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,382
then my people have to obey,

231
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,318
or he'll kill us.

232
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:41,453
But here's
what we can do for you.

233
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,322
We'll keep
the red guys busy here

234
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,658
while you and the human army
catch up to the emperor.

235
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:52,998
When you do you,
you tell him, that bastard,

236
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:56,067
we're through dyin' for nothin'!

237
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,138
You tell him
we ain't his puppets no more!

238
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,539
( Pugilists yelling )

239
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,675
Iskahn: Now we're talkin'.

240
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,944
That's it, people!

241
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,013
Keep that line open, you hear?!

242
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,150
( Sighs ) There's your exit,

243
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,617
but you better hurry up.

244
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:13,952
We can't hold it forever.

245
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,754
Asuna: Thank you.

246
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,690
Sheyta: I think
I will stay here with him.

247
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:21,260
Asuna: All right, then.
Good luck, and stay safe.

248
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,530
( Armies yelling )

249
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,436
Iskahn: You sure
about this, woman?

250
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:34,439
Sheyta: Stop it.
You know my name.

251
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,175
Iskahn: You sure
about this, Sheyta?

252
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,377
'Cause there's no guarantee
you'll survive this.

253
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,979
Sheyta: I cannot
let anyone else slash you.

254
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,114
Only I reserve the right to.

255
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,050
Iskahn: Hah! Says you!

256
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,185
( Sheyta chuckles )

257
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,318
( Iskahn chuckles )

258
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:51,056
Come on!
Show me some fire, Pugilists!

259
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,924
( Pugilists yelling )

260
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,259
Iskahn: Get in a circle!

261
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:55,994
Defense position!

262
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,263
If any of 'em tries to attack,

263
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:01,200
- wind up, and give 'em hell!
- ( Pugilists cheering )

264
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,134
Dampa: Ready to kick
some ass, champion?

265
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,004
( Joints crack )

266
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,272
- ( Gloves clank )
- Iskahn: Yeah.

267
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,278
( Vassago moaning )

268
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,149
Critter: Morning, sunshine.

269
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,951
You were out for a while there.

270
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,888
Say something so I know
your brain didn't get fried.

271
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,822
Vassago: Asshole.

272
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,225
( Groans ) Damn it.

273
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,961
I died. I fell down
some bottomless pit.

274
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,831
Critter: Ooh, that sounds
both horrible and pathetic.

275
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,834
You know, you been out
for eight hours now.

276
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,770
Vassago: Wait. Eight hours?

277
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,573
Critter: Why do you look
so panicked, man?

278
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,308
Everything's cool.

279
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,577
Right before
you got your ass owned in there,

280
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,113
I dialed the time
back down to one-to-one.

281
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,115
Vassago: What? Son of a bitch!

282
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:53,052
What the hell are you messin'
around with the time for?!

283
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,520
- ( Critter gags )
- Vassago: In 12 hours,

284
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,590
the JSDF is gonna bust in here,
and they'll be gunnin' for us!

285
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,525
Critter: I know.
I've been keeping up.

286
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:04,596
I cranked the time down 'cause
Captain Miller ordered me to.

287
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,398
Using our satellite connection,

288
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,533
I just logged a bunch
of players from the U.S.

289
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,402
Into the dark territory.

290
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:11,870
Vassago: The hell for?

291
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,006
( Critter chuckles )

292
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,942
That's a log of you

293
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,877
and the cap's movements
in there.

294
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,947
A few minutes ago,
he passed the place you croaked

295
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,549
and is heading due south.
And get this.

296
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:27,619
He's not traveling
with the dark territory's army.

297
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,622
He's on his own,
and you know what that means.

298
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:33,825
Vassago: He could be chasing
after Alice, or he's got her.

299
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,961
Either way,
you should crank up the time.

300
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:38,029
Critter: Nope. Not yet.

301
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,999
We have a problem. Check it out.

302
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,367
That part in red

303
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,369
is what's left
of the U.S. players,

304
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,371
and that black circle
half-surrounded by 'em

305
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,640
is a chunk
of the dark territory's army.

306
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:51,042
Our problem is that white dot.

307
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,045
That's the human army,
or what's left of 'em.

308
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,116
According to the log,
there's about 700, give or take.

309
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,585
If they catch up to the Captain,
that would be no bueno.

310
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:03,054
They gotta be stopped asap.

311
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,723
Vassago: Then you
better get to it.

312
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,857
What you got in mind?

313
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,926
( Critter laughs )

314
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:12,063
I got us a second batch
of U.S. players on standby.

315
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,932
When there's 20 thou,

316
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,067
I'll drop 'em
on top of the human army.

317
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,403
That's 28 times their numbers.

318
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,405
It's gonna be
a friggin' massacre!

319
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:23,342
Then I'll crank time up
to 1,000-to-one.

320
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,545
We'll sit back and
let the Captain do his thing.

321
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,280
He'll have all the time
in the world and then some

322
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,216
to get Alice
to the Southern terminal.

323
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,952
Vassago: I hope it goes
as smooth as you say.

324
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,420
The human side's army

325
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,756
is a hell of a lot tougher
than you think.

326
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,292
Hell, those integrity knights
are straight-up bad-asses.

327
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,828
I sat there and watched

328
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:45,564
as they mowed down
the dark territory's front line.

329
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:49,034
We lost thousands
in one gigantic flash of--

330
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,836
flash of--( Gasps )

331
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:53,104
Lightning Flash!

332
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,973
It's her!

333
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,241
It totally was!

334
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:58,377
I'll never forget that bitch.

335
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,445
Critter: What? Who are
you talking about? ( Groans )

336
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,448
Vassago: Guess what,
you little four-eyed freak.

337
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,917
I just figured out
the rath guys in subcon

338
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,853
are doin' the same thing we are.

339
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:11,990
Yeah, but they got
Japanese vrmmo players logged in

340
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,392
and working with the human army.

341
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,126
- Critter: No way!
- Vassago: And I'll bet,

342
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,462
if Lightning Flash Asuna's
in there,

343
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,865
that dual-wielding bastard
is, too.

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,200
( Laughs ) This is great!

345
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,601
It's my lucky day.

346
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,070
I'm goin' back in, baby,

347
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:26,337
- so get me prepped.
- ( Critter growls )

348
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,273
Vassago: Send me
to the human army's location

349
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,941
with the second batch
of players.

350
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:32,011
Critter: Okay, if you want,
but you wasted

351
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:35,080
the only Dark Knight account
we had, remember?

352
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,550
All I got is a basic grunt like
the others, so no complaining.

353
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,286
Vassago: I ain't using
one of those accounts.

354
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,422
I got a special one instead.

355
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,858

358
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,382
( Gasps ) Whoa!

359

362
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,934
I leave the rest to you.

363
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,971
( Dragon roars )

364
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,540
Liena: Oh, no!

365
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,476
Sir Renly
is going to barrel through them.

366
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,543
Asuna: Don't!

367
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,279

( Asuna gasps )

373
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,519
Sinon: No rapid-fire? Oh, well.

374
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:23,455
I guess I'm more used
to single-shot weapons, anyway.

375
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,924

376

Sinon: I'm late. Sorry.

378
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,145
( Asuna laughs )

379
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,317
Shinonon!
