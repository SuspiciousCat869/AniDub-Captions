I promised her I'd give her
total control of the Underworld,

Although she did
make contact with me first.

349
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,399
I was working late one night,

350
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:10,535
and then suddenly I heard
her voice over the speakers.

352

all by herself and
opened up a line to our side.

354
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,147

I was using an STL

and spend time with her.

in every way imaginable.

she promised me something.
