00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:38,163
Yo, are you seein' all this?
It's better than a movie.

13
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,699
I'm starting to think we should
snag this graphics tech

14
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,167
instead of the A.I.,

15
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,903
go to Hollywood,
start an effects studio.

16
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,772
Dude, we'd be raking in money
faster than we could spend it.

Gabriel: I hate
to break it to you,

18
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,045
but all the stuff you're seeing
can't be saved to media.

Things in this world aren't

Eldrie: These vile creatures.

43
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,218

It's morning.

57
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:31,996
Deusolbert: It is the one memory
I have left of my past.

I cannot even recall
when it was or who.

Though you are long gone,

60
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,140
I will protect
the world we shared.

This, I swear.

62

the order
of the integrity knights.

72
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,896
Then we'll muster the imperial
knights of the four empires

73
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,365
and train them for battle.

74

There's strength in numbers,

we need all the help we can get.

I know what I told you
is hard to accept,

to protect the people here.

killed a bunch with his arrows.

92
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,761

killed bunches, too.

- Fizel: What's with them?
- Linel: Yeah,

94
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,699
the left flank seems
a bit weak, doesn't it?

95
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:24,769
Fizel: Mm-hmm. Sure,
Eldrie has amazing skills,

96
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,906
but as a knight, he's never been
in a battle like this before.

97
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,642
Linel: And then there's
renlicchi behind him,

98
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,644
not the most reliable.

99
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,646
Fizel: Poor thing.
He'd be better off

100
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,581
all the way in back
with the supply corps.

Linel: Speaking of,

102
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:40,019
I heard that kirito boy's
sitting back there.

Eldrie: No! You'll strike down
one of ours in all this smoke!

119

They're headed
for the rear unit.

I pray sir Renly
can hold them at bay.
