Besides, this time,
what you were doing

was something
very important, right?

If you say you're
going to do something, do it.

170

with writing a book

left something out.

For days, she had
no idea where you were,

and she was getting sick
from worrying.

I understand the importance
of what you accomplished.

you get a pass.

your focus be now?

putting all of your efforts,

go to America and study there.

but here,
at Toto Institute, actually.

his reservations.

Through my actions,

I proved to him
the depth of my conviction,

206
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,650
and I am sure in the end,

207
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,253

to remain a knight.
