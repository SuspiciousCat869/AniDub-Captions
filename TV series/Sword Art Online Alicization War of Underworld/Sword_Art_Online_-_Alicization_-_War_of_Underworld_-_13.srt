That reminds me.
I have another trick to try.

330
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,528
Bercouli:
You've gotta be kidding me.

331
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,862
( gasps )

332
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,731
( chorus vocalizing )

333
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,509
( yells )

334
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:41,012
( chorus ends )

335
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,750
He clouded my mind just
by pointing his sword at me!

336
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:47,152
How can I counter that?

337
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,687
I used Karagiri,
and that didn't work.

338
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,558
The only other skill
I got is Uragiri,

339
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,694
but he's not gonna stand there
as I fire it up. ( gasps )

340
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,232
Administrator: Have you ever
felt you were going to die?

341
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,634
( Bercouli chuckles )

342
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,836
If this is where
it's supposed to happen,

343
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,305
I'll make it count, Milady.

344
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,375

- Bercouli: Kiddo...

346
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:15,113
I don't know if I did it right,

347
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,715
but I tried to be
some kind of father to you.

348
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,919
( chuckles ) I can't even
remember mine, so it's not like

349
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,390
I had a clue as to what
being a dad's all about,

350
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:27,793
but there's one thing I do know

351
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:31,597
A good father would give
his life to protect his kid,

352
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,601
and that's something
you're never gonna understand!

353
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,068
( Gabriel chuckles )

354
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,470
Bercouli: You monster!

355
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,339
Red Knight: God...

356
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:45,076
this game sucks so much ass.
Might as well log out

357
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,478
and go back to--( gags )

( Asuna panting )

360
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,629
As long as I can stand,
I'm gonna keep fighting,

361
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,431
so come on if you dare!

362
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,766
I can do this all day
if I have to!

Sorry for the wait. You okay?
