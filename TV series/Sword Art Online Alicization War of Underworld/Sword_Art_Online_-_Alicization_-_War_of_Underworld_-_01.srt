( Alice sighs )

3
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,900
Girl: Alice!

4
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,102
( Running footsteps )

5
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,838
Good morning!

6
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,573
- ( Laughs )
- Alice: Selka.

7
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,708
Selka: Hee! ( Sighs )

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,909
( Alice chuckles )

9
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,378
Good morning.

10
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,780
What brings you here?

11
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,714
Selka: The weather's so nice.

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,717
I thought we could take
a walk to the eastern hill,

13
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,853
you, me, and Kirito of course.

14
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:00,925
( Alice sighs )

15
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,461
It is a lovely day.

16
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,664
The fresh air would do him good.

17
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,466
( Fire crackling )

18
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,502
Shall we go, then, Kirito?

19
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,807

¶

24
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,372
There.

25
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,841
Let's get going.

26
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,715
Kirito: Ahh. Ahh.

27
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,049
Alice: Oh. I'm sorry.

28
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,685
I'll get them for you.

29
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,622
¶

30
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,747
Be careful with them.

31
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:36,682
Hold them tight now.

32
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,451
( Dragon snorts )

33
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,958
Alice: I hope he is warm enough.

34
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,425
( Selka groans )

35
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,428
Sometimes you can be
such a worrywart.

36
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,364
You bundled him up so much,
he's sweating.

37
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,466
Aren't you, Kirito?

38
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,340
I know eugeo'd think so.

39
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,716
( Wind blowing )

40
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,392
Alice: How beautiful.

41
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,661
None of the paintings
in the cathedral

42
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,563
can compare with this view.

43
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,399
You saved this world, Kirito.

44
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,667
Remember?

45
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,805
Higa: We're screwed!
What do we do?!

46
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,007
If they cut
the main power line now,

47
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,875
it's gonna cause a surge!

48
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,743
Lightcube clusters
should be safe,

49
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:42,881
but the subcomputer where
kirigaya's s.T.L. Is won't be!

50
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,883
The surge'll cook
his fluctlight!

51
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,687
( Kikuoka gasps ) O-okay,
I'll handle the lockdown.

52
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,691
Higa, take Dr. Kojiro and Asuna
and get to the upper shaft.

53
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,958
Keep Kirito safe.

54
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:56,028
- Kirito: Asuna?
- Alice: Kirito?

55
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,562
Security:
They're cutting the power!

56
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,365
The screw propellers
are going down!

57
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,103
( Tone blares )

58
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,006

¶

60
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,747
Alice: Kirito!

61
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,115
Kirito.

62
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,051
Kirito!

63
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:22,054
You cannot die,
not after saving my life!

64
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,422
Kirito!

65
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,193
Kirito.

66
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,628
( Crying )

67
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,064
Bercouli: Hey, kid.

68
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,066
Alice: U-uncle.

69
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,402
Bercouli: What happened?

70
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,605
We're facing the biggest crisis

71
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,007
in the history
of the axiom church.

72
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,545
Those two elite disciples
we fought killed the Pontifex.

73
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,813
Fanatio: No! It can't be!

74
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,616
Eldrie: She's dead? Impossible.

75
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,951
Bercouli: That's not all.

76
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,554
Chudelkin died
with the Pontifex.

77
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,756
With him gone,
there's no more senate.

78
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,157
( Knights gasp )

79
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,759
Eldrie: This makes no sense.

80
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,094
Why would those disciples

81
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,162
risk angering the gods
with their actions?

82
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,565
Bercouli: To stop the Pontifex
before she turned

83
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,234
half the human realm
into weapons of war,

84
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,503
an army of mindless,
living swords.

85
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,106
Eldrie: How could she
do such a thing?

86
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,641
To subject the people
to such horror...

87
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,777
Deusolbert: It's diabolical,

88
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,714
eldrie: Sir bercouli,
where are the two rogues

89
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,515
who murdered her eminence?

90
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,784
They must be captured
and interrogated.

91
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,520
Bercouli: We don't have time
to deal with that right now.

92
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,189
The dark territory's
been itching to invade us,

93
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,858
and, when they find out
about the Pontifex, they will.

94
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,928
Our ranks are half as strong,

95
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,863
thanks to past battles
with the forces of darkness.

96
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,799
We should all
be worried about that.

97
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,536
If the dark territory
decides to attack us now,

98
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,005
the human realm
will fall for sure.

99
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,540
Fanatio: Then,
what should we do?

100
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,142
Or, rather, what can we do?

101
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,810
Bercouli: First, we'll restore

102
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,878
the order
of the integrity knights.

103
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Then we'll muster
the imperial knights

104
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,216
of the four empires
and train them for battle.

105
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,952
There's strength in numbers,

106
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,754
and right now we need
all the help we can get.

107
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:06,091
I know what I told you
is hard to accept,

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,560
but it's still our job
to protect the people here.

109
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,695
I can't do that without you.

110
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,531
Knights: Sir!

111
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,537
( Soldiers yelling together )

112
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,414
( Dragon grunts )

113
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:37,990
( Alice sighs )

114
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,925
I wonder if Kirito's hungry.

115
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,661
Man: There's a rumor
going around,

116
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,929
saying that rebel swordsman
is still alive.

117
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:48,000
Man 2: I heard.
He's supposed to be in a coma.

118
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,601
Man 1: I know we have to prepare

119
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,336
for the dark territory
to invade,

120
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,938
but leaving
that traitor in our midst?

121
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,941
He defied the church
and should be executed for it.

122
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,145
Man 2: Agreed. Who knows what
commander bercouli is thinking?

123
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,814
¶

124
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,717
Alice: It is no longer safe
for Kirito here.

125
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,821
( Gate grinds )

126
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,038
We shall go to rulid village.

127
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,707
Perhaps they
will accept us there,

128
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,143
since it is the place
where eugeo and I were born.

129
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,992
Zink: Huh? ( Gasps )

130
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,394
Hold on, you!

131
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,631
Strangers aren't allowed in
unless I say so!

132
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,740
( Gasps ) What in the...

133
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,275
( Gasps ) By the gods.

134
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,143
It can't be.

135
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,811
Alice: I am no stranger.

136
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:10,415
I am Alice.
Summon Gasfut Zuberg at once.

137
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,785
( Villagers murmuring )

138
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,161

¶

141
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,768
is that really you?

142
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,136
Alice?

143
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,038
Alice: Yes.

144
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,841
Gasfut: Well, then,
what are you doing here?

145
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,777
Have you been pardoned
for your crime?

146
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,980
Alice: Perhaps.
I certainly was punished for it.

147
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,317
All of the memories I had
of my life here were wiped away.

148
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:48,052
If that is not enough
to absolve me,

149
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:50,188
no one's said otherwise.

150
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,391
Regardless, I have returned,

151
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,094
because I could think
of nowhere else to go.

152
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,864
( Gasfut sighs )

153
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,400
- Begone.
- ( Alice gasps )

154
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,003
Gasfut: We cannot allow
a criminal to stay here.

155
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:12,978
( Alice sighs )

156
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,214
Selka: What's wrong?

157
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,353
Alice: It is nothing.

158
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,988
Shall we start heading back?

159
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,357
Selka: Sure.

160
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:27,693

161
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,372
( Selka grunts )

162
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,307
Alice: What is it, selka?

163
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,076
Something troubles you.

164
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,513
Selka: Well,
i-it's nothing serious.

165
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,248
It's Mr. Barbossa.

166
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,185
He asked if you could chop down
another tree for him.

167
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,188
Alice: Honestly?
That's why you're so quiet?

168
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,991
You do know
he and I have an agreement.

169
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,793
Selka: Yes, but how dare he?

170
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,996
The hypocrite,
both him and Mr. Ridack.

171
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,799
They don't hesitate to ask you
for help when they need it,

172
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,668
but they don't mind you
being shunned by the village.

173
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,940
Alice: It's all right, selka.

174
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,477
As long as I can have
a place on the outskirts,

175
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,278
that's enough for me.

176
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,415
Selka: Yes, but next year
my training will be done,

177
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:24,883
and I was thinking,

178
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,351
since I'll be earning
a little money,

179
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,486
I could give you that.

180
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,822
It's not much, but it's enough

181
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,090
that you won't have to help
those people anymore.

182
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,493
You and Kirito
don't have to worry.

183
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,029
I'll help somehow.

184
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,032
Alice: I'm grateful.

185
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,036
But having you close by
is all I could ever need.

186
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,506
I am happy
just to have that, selka.

187
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,811
( Wind blowing )

188
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,882
( Chopping )

189
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,153
( Woodcutter groans )

190
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,155
Barbossa: Why is
this taking so long?

191
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,024
In the time it takes you
to cut this damn tree down,

192
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,426
ridack's men will have expanded
his land 20 mels in--

193
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:11,363
Alice: Good day, Mr. Barbossa.

194
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,364
Barbossa: Alice!

195
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,432
How good of you to come,

196
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,101
and so quickly, too.

197
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,636
Alice: I heard
you need my assistance.

198
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,905
Barbossa: Yes.

199
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,639
It's that one over there.

200
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,910
We've been hacking away at it
since yesterday morning.

201
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,312
These damned
platinum oak trees are tough.

202
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,382
Why, ten grown men have put
their backs into every swing,

203
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,250
and they've barely
made a scratch in it,

204
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,451
so I asked for you.

205
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:36,188
I know our deal
is for one tree a month,

206
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,455
but this one's stubborn,

207
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,457
and I really need
your help here, Alice.

208
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,026
What do you say?

209
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,463
Alice: I shall do it,
and happily.

210
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,799
But just this once, understood?

211
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,903
Barbossa: Great!
I knew I could count on you.

212
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:55,640
( Scoffs )

213

214
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,691
Alice: If you don't mind,
Kirito,

215
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,128
I need your sword,
but only for a moment.

216
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,965
( Gasps )

217

00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,378
Alice: Thank you.

221

¶

222
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,586
woodcutter: Come on!
You think you're gonna cut down

223
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,588
a platinum oak
with a li'l old sword?

224
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,122
Woodcutter 2:
It'll snap in half.

225
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,524

- Huh?
- ( Murmuring )

229
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,339
Woodcutter 2:
Look at that. She missed!

230
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,410
Alice: You'd best
move away from there.

231
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,812
Woodcutter 2: What?

232
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,013
- Why should we--
- ( Tree creaking )

233
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,353
( Both gasping )

( Barbossa gasps )

235
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,369
Splendid!

236
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,504
Wonderful!

237
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,306
Magnificent!

238
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,508
Your skill is unbelievable!

239
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,444
No, exceptional!

240
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:39,845
Hear me out now.

241
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,779
I shall double
your compensation,

242
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,048
and, instead of once a month,

243
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,850
you'd work for me once a week--

244
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,384
no, once a day!

245
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,853
I know you could use the money.

246
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,387
Alice: Thank you, but the amount

247
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,323
you are paying now
is quite sufficient.

248

Alice: My payment.

252
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,133
Barbossa: Oh. Of course!

253
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,301
Yes, right away.

254
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,605

Man: What the--it's so heavy!

260
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,085
Man 2: How else do you think
she cut that tree down?

261
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:22,154
- Anyone could, with that sword!
- Man 3: Let me try.

Alice: That sword
belongs to Kirito.

267
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,634
Get your hands off it.

268
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:39,637
( Man 3 growls ) We asked him!

269
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,106
If he didn't
want us touching it,

270
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,274
he should've said something!

Man 1: He's right.

272
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,845
We asked him nicely,
and all he did was go,

273
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,715
"eh eh," like a gibbering fool.

Alice: Is this what
we fought for, suffered for,

280
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,087
to protect people like these?

281
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,558
Eugeo lost his life.

282
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:35,894
Kirito is a shell
of his former self.

283
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:38,696
If there was a point
to all we've been through,

284

Amayori. It seems
you've gained some weight.

288
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,328
You've been gorging
on too many fish.

00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,778
Is that...

298
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,785
( Dragon grunts )

( Amayori trills )

300
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:12,524
Alice: Takiguri,
amayori's elder brother.

301
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,593
Which means...

302
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,732
I'm impressed you found us.

303
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,334
Now, why have you come,

304
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,170
eldrie synthesis thirty-one?

305
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:28,273
Eldrie: It has been
far too long,

306
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:31,176
my lady, my mentor.

307
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,748
Alice: So how did you find me?

308
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,550
More importantly, why?

309
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,887
I am sure the order
has better things to do now

310
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,290
than send dragons all over
just to track me down.

311
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,093
Eldrie: You won't believe this,
but I simply followed

312
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:49,828
the bond between our souls.

313
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:52,230
Hah! If only that were true.

314
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,700
No, I found you
by complete coincidence.

315
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:58,570
Although, now that I am here,
I have news.

316
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,573
The goblins and orcs have
been mobilizing in the north.

317
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,775
- ( Alice gasps )
- Eldrie: As for why I'm here,

318
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,110
the commander ordered us

319
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,713
to collapse the caves
to the south and west,

320
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,381
and, here in the north,

321
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:13,251
I was sent to make sure
the fiends hadn't dug them out.

322
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,521
Alice: And? Is the cave
north of here safe,

323
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,189
or have they dug through it?

324
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,324
Eldrie: I spent
all day up there,

325
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:20,992
keeping a vigilant eye upon it.

326
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:25,397
In all that time, I did not
spot any orcs or goblins.

327
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:29,467
I'm happy to report the cave
is still filled with debris.

328
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:32,871
Then, as I made my way
back to the capital,

329
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:34,873
takiguri began
behaving strangely.

330
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,742
I allowed him free rein,

331
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,611
and this is
where he chose to land...

332
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,479
Your new home.

333
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,882
And, now that we've
been reunited at last,

334
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,218
you will forgive me
for speaking my mind.

335
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,353
Lady Alice...

336
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:50,488
Please return to the order!

337
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,824
We need your sword now
more than ever,

338
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,493
more than an army of thousands!

339
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,563
Alice: I cannot.

340
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:58,530
Eldrie: Why not?!

341
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,899
( Grunts )

342
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,369
Is it because of that one?

343
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:07,773
The man who escaped from prison,
the man who flouted the law,

344
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:10,175
who raised his sword
against your fellow knights,

345
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,710
the prime senator,
and the Pontifex?

346
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,046
Is he still
leading your heart astray?

347
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:18,784
If so, there is but one solution
for your confusion.

348
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,719
I shall eliminate him at once!

349
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:24,055
- Alice: Stop it.
- ( Eldrie gasps )

350
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,924
Alice: He fought
not for himself,

351
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:28,260
but for what
he believed was right,

352
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,728
for justice.

353
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:32,530
Is that not
what the knighthood fights for?

354
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,466
He defeated us
one after the other,

355
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:35,801
including the commander.

356
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,603
When you fought him,

357
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:40,005
surely you could feel
the purity of his conviction

358
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,739
in the weight of his sword.

359
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,609
Eldrie: If he is
as pure as you say,

360
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,544
then why won't he take up
his sword and help us now?

361
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,079
How could he allow himself

362
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,816
to be reduced
to such a pathetic state

363
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,884
and shackle you
to these hinterlands?

364
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,686
If what I heard is true

365
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,489
and he killed the Pontifex
for the sake of the people,

366
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,492
then it is his duty
to join them at the eastern gate

367
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,827
and defend the land!

368
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,764
Alice: Forgive me, eldrie,

369
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,968
but I cannot go with you
to assist in the battle.

370
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:12,304
It has nothing to do with him.

371
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,040
I can no longer wield my sword.

372
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,842
That is the reason.

373
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,377
If you and I crossed swords now,

374
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:22,580
I doubt I would last
three strikes.

375
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,115
Eldrie: Is that so?

376
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,719
All right.
I will not press you further.

377
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,662
I bid you farewell, milady.

378
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,665
You were my mentor,
and, as long as I live,

379
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,868
I shall never forget
all you have taught me.

380
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,470
Alice: Farewell, then.

381
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:46,038
I pray you'll be safe.

382
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,774
( Eldrie grunts )

383
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,746
( Amayori trills )

384
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,515
( Takiguri warbles )

385
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:00,686
¶

386
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,488
( singing in Japanese )

387
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:13,832
Alice: It's gotten late.
You must be tired.

388
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,101
Let's get you to bed, shall we?

389
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,970
( Singing in Japanese )

390
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,684
( Kirito breathing )

391
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,459
Alice: Tell me, Kirito.

392
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,361
( Shudders )

393
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:44,730
What should I do?

394
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,332
( Singing in Japanese )

395
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,267
Alice: What should I do?

396
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:50,402
( Singing in Japanese )

397
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:59,578
( Kirito gasping )

398
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:02,881
Alice: Kirito?

399
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,617
( Kirito gasping )

400
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,619
Alice: What is it? What's wrong?

401
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,556
- ( Amayori growls )
- ( Alice gasps )

402
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,424
( Singing in Japanese )

403
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:16,962
( Alice gasps )

404
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:28,706
A fire. ( Gasps )

405
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:30,842
The dark territory is attacking!

406
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,510
( Sighs )

407
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,381
Selka!
