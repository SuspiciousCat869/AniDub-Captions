How is Miss Alice here different

from any of the other
programmable robots

Rinko: Her brain, actually.

36
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,280
I'm referring to the mind,
not the organ.

37
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,015
Her consciousness,
which is stored

38
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,418
in the photonic brain
in her skull,

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,154
isn't a program
made up of binary code.

40
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,892
Essentially, it functions
the same as a human brain.

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
That's what makes her different

from the robots
we have currently.

is for Dr. Kojiro.

67

Labor unions have raised
the concern before

68
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,814
about the use
of advanced A.I. in industry

69

causing unemployment
to rise even further.

00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,952
Are those fears unfounded?

Rinko: Let me make
one thing perfectly clear.

72
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,490
Our institute has no intention

73
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,427
of providing true A.I. for
application in simple labor.

74
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,429

But the financial sector

75
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,896
seems to have hopes you will.

76
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,499
In fact, the stocks of
industrial robot manufacturers

77
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,769
shot up when you
announced this presser.

78
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,637
Rinko: A true A.I.,

79
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,374
or rather what we like to call
an Artificial Fluctlight,

80
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,908
is not the sort of thing

81
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,578
that can be mass-produced
in a short amount of time.

82
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,648
They're born as infants
and raised by their families

83
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,716
from children to adults,
just like us.

84
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,720
They mature and develop
their own unique personalities,

85
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,721

86
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,457
To force
an intelligence like that

to spend their existence
as a robot in some factory

88
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,595
is inhumane
and should not be allowed.

89
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:28,132
Reporter 2: Doctor, I'm sorry,
but are you saying A.I.s

90
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,669
should have
the same rights as humans?

91
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,672
Rinko: At this point in time,
I don't expect any of you

92

to accept
Artificial Fluctlights

93
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,409
as human beings
with human rights.

94
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,679
That's a topic that requires
a more thorough discussion.

95
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,482
However, I believe,
in a century or two,

96
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,684
our society
will advance to the point

97
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,952
where we'll be living
with them as equals,

98
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:51,423
interacting freely with them,
and accepting them as ordinary.

99
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,692
We'll even marry and
start families with them.

100
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,695
It's only a matter of time,
really,

101
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,764
and since a shared future
with them is inevitable,

102
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,034
it would be immoral
to subject them to slavery.

But they're not like us!

totally different from ours.

They're mechanical,
made by humans in a factory.

106
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,910
How are we supposed
to accept them as equal to us

107
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,778
when their bodies
aren't even flesh and blood?

00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,595
on the bureaucrats
in our government

161
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,798
trying to sabotage our goals.

162
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,932
I didn't think it went
all the way up the ladder

163
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:49,802
to the Vice-Minister
of Defense, though.

164
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,204
That was truly shocking.

165
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,872
Higa: No, not really.

166
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,940
Who needs ethics when
the U.S. weapons industry's

167
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,742
throwing cash at you?

168
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,812
Anyway, back to your plan.

169
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,547
Are you sure going public
with the A.I. Fluctlights

170
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,615
was the right move?

171
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,617
I mean, by doing this,

172
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,619
it's totally screwing
with Rath's big goal

173
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,155
to use 'em in weaponized drones.

174
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,556
Kikuoka: Maybe it does.

175
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,958
But now the Americans know
we have the capability,

176
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,228
and that, my friend,
is a good thing.

177
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,030
Now their weapons manufacturers

178
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,898
can't force us
to hand over our tech

179
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,767
under the pretext
of joint development.

180
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,636
This press conference
tells the world

181
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,772
we perfected the A.I. Fluctlight
without their help.

182
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,708
Even if they had
other plans to get it,

183
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,044
they won't try
after seeing this.

184
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,578
Higa: Yeah, I guess not.

185
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,749
And we have him to thank
for getting us here.

186
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,790
( sighs )

187
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,194
Kikuoka: Hey. Higa, look. Look!

188
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,729
Higa: What? What is it?

189
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,065
Isn't the press conference
over by now?

190
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,734
( monitor buzzes )

191
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,003
( gasps )

192
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,806
Rinko: Ultimately,
our hope is that you'll meet

193
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,942
Artificial Fluctlights
in the virtual world

194
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,744
to experience who they are,

195
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,681
and then perhaps
you'll change your mind.

196
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:12,217
That's all we ask of anyone
watching this broadcast today.

197
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,952
Go and see for yourself.

198
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,287
Reporter 3: Uh, Doctor!

199
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,422
That all sounds nice,

200
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,024
but have you considered
all the possibilities?

201
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,694
What if they decide to,
I don't know,

202
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,896
rise up and take us over?

203
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,364
Rinko: We have considered
that possibility,

204
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,432
but it's a stretch.

205
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,167
( Alice gasps )

206
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,703
Rinko: That could only happen

207
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,106
if, say, we tried to exterminate
their kind first.

208
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,840
Reporter 3: Okay,
but when you think

209
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,776
of all the movies
and books up to now--

210
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:38,843
Alice: Please excuse me.

211
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:39,778
( crowd murmurs )

212
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,213
Alice: I must take my leave now.

They're coming out of it!

215
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,592
( both gasp )

216
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,127

222
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,343
It's been a while, huh?

223
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,345
Alice: It has.

224
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,713
( crying )

225
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,682
Kikuoka: Listen.

226
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,752
It's about your little sister.

227
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,353
She went into Deep Freeze,

228
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,888
'cause she wanted
to wait for you.

229
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,757
She's up on the 80th floor

230
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:29,227
of the Central Cathedral
on that hill sleeping.

Kikuoka: Higa, I'm ready.

234
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,375
Dump the last 200 years
from my memory,

235
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,712
back to when
the max-accel phase kicked in.

236
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,648
Me and Her Highness
are done there.

00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:16,808
Sorry I'm so late.

00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,143
Kirito: You're not.

246
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:19,978
I only woke up a second ago.

247
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:29,421
( Asuna sighs )

248
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,225
It feels to me like you're
only 90% back to normal.

249
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,826
Are you eating enough?

250
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:35,894
Kirito: Yeah, I'm eating.

251
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,295
I'm eating all the time.

252
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,496
Have some patience.

253
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:41,900
Remember, I've been
stuck in bed for two months.

254
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,169
Anyway, you know when
they're letting me out of here?

255
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,904
Three days from now.

256
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,105
Asuna: Really?

257
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,041
Then we should celebrate
with a party or two!

258
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,445
We can have one in "A.L.O."
and in real life!

259
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,913
Kirito: Sounds good to me.

Kikuoka: Hey there!

00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,246
A little bird told me
you were getting out soon.

276
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,849
This calls for a celebration.

277
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,851
Kirito: Nurse Aki
just told me about that,

278
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,320
so either you have my room
bugged, or you're psychic.

279
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,188
I don't wanna know, either way.

The point is you're doing great.

282
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,060
I mean,
bouncing back from a coma

283
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,928
after only a week of rehab?
( chuckles )

284
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,464
Talk about the power of youth.

285
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,932
Asuna: Now that
everybody thinks you're dead,

286
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,267
what are you going to do?

287
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,536
Are you going to retire now?

288
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,872
We heard about
what happened at Rath,

289
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
about how they
put Rinko in charge.

290
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,409
You can't go
to the Roppongi office anymore.

291
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,211
Kikuoka: Don't worry about me.

292
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:36,214
I'm still around,
just working in the background.

293
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,150
I have enough
on my plate as it is

294
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,019
trying to keep the Ocean Turtle
and the Underworld safe.

295
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,554
Kirito: You are? That's great!

296
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:46,091
So do you know what'll
happen to the Underworld now?

297
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,292
Kikuoka: At the moment,

298
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:49,427
things aren't looking
that good for it.

299
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,031
The government still hasn't
picked a scapegoat to save face.

300
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,033
It's only
a matter of time, though.

301
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,435
They've been itching
to dismantle Rath,

302
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,304
and when they do, all our tech

303
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:02,574
will get divvied up
by the major conglomerates.

304
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,975
They'll seize Alice.

305
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,311
Then they'll
probably reinitialize

306
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,113
the Lightcube Cluster
on the Turtle.

307
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,915
Asuna: But they can't!

308
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,450
Kirito: You're not gonna
let that happen, are you?

309
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,119
You got a plan, right?

310
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,054
Kikuoka: A plan?

311
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,122
Not really.

312
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,924
It's more like a hope.

313
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,526
While the government's
running around,

314
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,660
trying to save their asses,

315
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,996
I'm hoping the public
will come to acknowledge

316
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,200
the human rights
of the Artificial Fluctlights.

317
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,135
And the way to achieve that

318
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,271
is to get as many people
from the real world as possible

319
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,942
to have as much contact with
the Underworlders as they can.

320
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,276
Sounds like the kind of thing

321
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,612
the Seed Nexus is for,
doesn't it?

322
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,548
Kirito: Yeah, I guess.

323
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,217
Kikuoka: The problem
is the Underworld

324
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,019
needs a high-bandwidth
connection to the Seed Nexus,

325
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:51,489
and the bigger the bandwidth,
the better the access.

326
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,292
Right now, the Underworld's
cut off from everything.

327
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:57,362
The government shut down
the Turtle's sat-link.

328
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:01,166
Restoring that connection is
next on my to-do list, in fact.

329
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,634
That press conference
the other day

330
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,436
was a step toward that.

331
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:08,706
It bought us attention
and, even better, time.

332
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,309
Kirito: The connection.

333
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,878
( grunts )

334
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,314
Kikuoka...

335
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,583
please...

336
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,118
don't let it die.

337
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,054
Please save it.

338
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,058
Kikuoka: You don't
have to beg me.

339
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,527
After all, the Underworld

340
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,431
is the one dream
I'd risk my life for, too.

No way.

344
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,147
It's gonna collapse,
like always

345

of me and Keeks did.

346
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,752
Hmm.

347

Once it finds out it's a copy,

348
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,090
there's no way a human soul
saved on a Lightcube

349
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,626
can survive the strain,

350
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:04,162
not even his soul.

Kirito: So you didn't delete me.

357

Instead, you copied

Higa: I did.

Higa: Uh, yeah.

I only had time for yours.

During
the memory-delete process,

372

Keeks and Rinko
were doing other things,

373
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,623
so I went ahead and copied you.

374
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,525
Kirito: I see.

The queen--that is, Asuna--

376
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:18,170
she and I talked about
the possibility of this.

377
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:23,241
She said that if she were
the only one who got copied,

378
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,178
she would have herself
deleted right away

379
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,180
and if we both got copied,

380
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,182
we'd use whatever time
we had left

381

to unite the real world
and the Underworld.

Higa: What about
if only you were copied?

383
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:38,656
Did you talk about that?

384
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,659
Kirito: Yeah.
We decided if that happened,

385
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,794
I'd protect the Underworld

386
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:46,498
and fight only for it
if it came to that.

Higa: What do you mean, "fight"?

388
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,137
Kirito: The Underworld's fate

389
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:55,807
is extremely unstable
over there, isn't it?

390
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,443
Higa: Yeah, it is.

391
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:00,346
Kirito: The Underworld
is powerless,

392
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,414
compared to the real world.

393
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,217
It relies on a power source,
hardware,

394
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,286
maintenance, and a network.

395
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,688
Its existence depends
on real-world people

396
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,690
to keep the infrastructure
running.

397
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,562
Its safety in the long term
is precarious at best.

398
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,298
Higa: You're right, but there's
just no getting around that.

399
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,235
The Lightcube Cluster,
that is the Underworld,

400
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,503
and it can't be moved
off the Ocean Turtle.

401
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:28,907
Besides, the government's
got control of the Turtle now.

402
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:32,177
If they wanted to, they could
cut the power tomorrow,

403
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:35,447
reinitialize the cluster,
and wipe it clean.

404
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,916
Kirito: How long
will the reactor's fuel last?

405
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:39,918
Higa: Um, I guess...

406
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:43,589
since it's a pressurized
water reactor from a sub...

407
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,190
and it's just powering
the cluster,

408
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:46,725
then four or five years?

409
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:49,527
Kirito: Then there's no need
to refuel during that time,

410
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:52,664
and as long as we prevent
outside interference,

411
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,201
the Underworld will continue to
exist for that length of time.

412
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,403
Do you agree?

413

but h-hold on a sec!
