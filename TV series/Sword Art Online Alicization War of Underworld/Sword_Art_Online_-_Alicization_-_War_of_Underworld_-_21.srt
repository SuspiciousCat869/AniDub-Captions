( gasps ) Oh, no.

183
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,114
Dr. Kojiro,
that jolt was caused

184
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,317
by our engine
firing up to full power.

185

Nakanishi:
We may have a problem.

187
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,856
The main engine
at the bottom of the shaft...

188
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,860
is a pressurized water reactor.

00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,006

They planted C-4 on that tank.

The CRD's under it,

193

Nakanishi: I'll go down there
and disarm the bomb.

198
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:29,093
I'm sure the hijackers
gave themselves enough time

199
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,830
to get far enough away
before it blows.

200

Nakanishi: True, but it's not
hotter than your typical sauna.

205
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,910
I'll rush in,
