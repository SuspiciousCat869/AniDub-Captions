00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,870
( chorus vocalizing )

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,472
Alice: I am Alice,

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:11,209
Integrity Knight
Alice Synthesis Thirty!

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,745
I am the proxy
of the three goddesses

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,147
who protect this realm!

7
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,549
I am the priestess of light,

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,351
and whoever dares defy me...

9
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,087
( Through skull )
Shall know the fury of my power!

10
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,757
( Gabriel gasps ) A-Alice.

11
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,226
( Chuckles )

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,129
Alicia.

13
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,566
This time...

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,035
This time,
her soul will be mine.

15
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,304
And once I have the lightcube

16
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,040
that holds her fluctlight
in my hands,

17
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,244
I'm going to savor
every last bite.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,513
Subjects, your attention!

19
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,384
We are heading south,
Pugilists in the lead,

20
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,453
then Dark Knights,
then the Supply Corps.

21
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,389
That knight
is the priestess of light,

22
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,192
and she is
to be captured unharmed!

23
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,200

24
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,102

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,436
¶

26
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,041
( gear rattling )

27
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,057
Bercouli: The plan's working
a little too well.

28
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,660
Vecta's got his whole army
coming after you now.

29
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,263
He's obsessed with you.
No doubt about that.

30
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:14,332
Alice: We should
be thankful he is.

31
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,203
It is much better
than being ignored entirely.

32
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,405
Bercouli: All right,
let's talk about strategy.

33
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,608
I was thinking me and the troops
keep leading them south

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,678
and slowly chip away
at their ranks.

35
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,345
Seems like the best approach.

36
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,613
Alice: Agreed.

37
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,349
We have already wiped out
half of their numbers.

38
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,553
That leaves their main force,
the Dark Knights and Pugilists.

39
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,821
Chasing us will wear them down.

40
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,224
And if we can defeat
Emperor Vecta,

41
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,560
I have hope the remaining
people of this land

42
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,827
will be open to a truce.

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,229
Bercouli: Hmm.

44
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,165
That's a good hope to have.
Problem is,

45
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,302
who's gonna be in charge here
when Vecta's gone?

46
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,305
If only that punk shasta
was still alive.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,506
Alice: Then, it is true.

48
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,841
The general
of the Dark Knights is dead?

49
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,443
Bercouli: Yeah.

50
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,580
I didn't see him
or his number two out there.

51
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,982
He would have been
our best shot to reason with.

52
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,650
- ( Wings flap )
- Hmm?

53
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:06,585
Huh?

54
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,124
Renly: I have finished
my reconnaissance, sir.

55
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,527
The shrubland south of here
should work for our ambush.

56
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,996
Bercouli: Thanks for
checking it out, kid.

57
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,532
Tell the units,
and get 'em ready to move out.

58
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,868
That dragon of yours
must be exhausted by now.

59
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,471
Make sure it gets food and water
before we go.

60
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,673
Renly: Sir!

61
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,743

62
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,144
- ( wings flapping )
- ( Bercouli chuckles )

63
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,612
Alice: What is it?

64
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,415
Bercouli: Oh, nothin'.
I was just thinkin'.

65
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,085
Part of me's glad there won't
be any more synthesis rituals.

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,621
I mean, havin' your memory
and life stolen,

67
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,357
that's a horrible price to pay
to be a knight.

68
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:49,094
But then, part of me's also
kinda sad we won't be seeing

69
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,764
any more young'uns like Renly
joining the order.

70
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,232
Alice: Perhaps we won't.

71
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,103
However, stolen memories
and lives do not make a knight.

72
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,706
I know of no such rule, uncle.
Do you?

73
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,644
When we are all gone, our souls,

74
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,246
our will, our purpose,

75
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:12,184
they remain to inspire
those we leave behind.

76
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,319
That is what I believe.

77
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,328
- ( Explosion )
- ( Gasps )

78
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,596
( Dark Knights and
Pugilists yelling )

79
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,999
¶

80
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,067
Alice: Here they come.

81
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,671
( Iskahn yelling )

82
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,473
Bercouli: Damn Pugilists.

83
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,809
They'll be a handful for us.

84
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,677
If you hit 'em
with your bare fist,

85
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,545
they'll happily take it.

86
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,481
But if you come at 'em
with a sword,

87
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,148
they refuse to get cut.

88
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,484
Alice: What? "Refuse"?

89
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,219
Bercouli: Yup,
that's what I said.

90
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,753
See, the more training
they go through,

91
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,090
the more they think a sword's
nothing to be scared of,

92
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,026
so watch out when you fight 'em,

93
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,495
'cause they can
will their skin to get hard,

94
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,230
and they can deflect any blade.

95
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,632
We'll have to keep 'em busy

96
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,035
'til the others are
in position for the ambush.

97
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,570
( Alice grunts )

98
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,506
Sheyta: I shall
go and face them.

99
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,008
( Both gasping )

100
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,217

00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,655
( Iskahn grunts )

102
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,457
I can't wait to fight

103
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,093
one of them
super strong integrity knights.

104
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,964
Eh? ( Grunts )

105
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,540
Who are you supposed to be,
and why are you in the way?

106
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,108
¶

107
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,612
Sheyta: Hmm.

108
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,414
I am a knight.

109
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,217
I am here to keep you
from advancing further.

110
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,152
( Iskahn laughs )
By the looks of you,

111
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,288
you couldn't stop a kid
from getting by!

112
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,090
Wait. Let me guess.

113
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,358
All you can do
is cast arts, right?

114
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,160
Sheyta: Mm.

115
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,362
I am not skilled
in formal arts.

116
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,497
( Iskahn grunts )

117
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,032
Ah, whatever.

118
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,568
Go kick her ass, Yotte.

119
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,835
Yotte: You got it!

120
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:11,670
( Chuckles )

121
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,641
Sheyta: Just you, then?

122
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:20,378
Yotte: I'm way more than you
can handle, you beanpole!

123
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,381
Now shut up,
and draw your sword.

124
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,656
- ( Iskahn gasps )
- ( Pugilists murmuring )

Iskahn: Damn, that's skinny.

126
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,461
( Yotte growls )

127
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,564
I'll break you in half!

¶

133
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,156
Administrator: I've heard that
you prefer keeping to yourself.

134
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,091
Why is that, I wonder.

135
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,028
Do people scare you?

136
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,097
Or perhaps...

137
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,566
Your urge to slice them
scares you.

138
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,700
( Sheyta grunts )

Administrator: I knew it.

141
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,439
I can see in your eyes
that it does.

142
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,843
If you had your way, you'd
slice up everything in sight.

143
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:28,981
You feel like you're cursed
with a drive for murder.

144
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,651
Cheer up. There's no reason
to feel ashamed about it.

145
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:37,055
In fact, I can help you
use it to your advantage.

146
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,390
( Sheyta grunts )

147
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,460
Administrator: On your last
reconnaissance mission

148
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,462
into the dark territory,

149
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,597
you brought
this flower back to me.

150
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,332
It absorbed massive amounts

151
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,602
of the spatial resources
generated on the battlefield.

152
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,672
I will turn it
into your divine object,

153
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,141
a sword with
the highest priority level

154
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,210
that can cut through anything.

155
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,045
( Sheyta gasps )

156
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,225
With this sword, you shall wield

157
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,761
a manifestation of the curse
carved into your soul.

158
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:20,298
Take it, and serve me
with your murderous impulse.

159
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,635
The curse you were born with
now has a purpose.

160
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,039
Slice and hack and slash away,

161
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,574
and at the end
of your blood-smeared path,

162
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,644
you will find the key
to breaking your curse.

163
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,480
At least, you might.

169
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,398
Alice: What a savage
fighting style.

170
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:57,135
And yet, as violent
as her attacks are,

171
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:01,606
I do not detect any hostility
or any emotion, for that matter.

172
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,943
Bercouli: I've known her
for more than a hundred years,

173
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,547
and I still have no idea
what goes on in her head,

174
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,948
not even a clue.

175
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,616
Don't worry about her.

176
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,151
She can handle 'em.

177
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,288
But we should go before
the main force catches up.

178
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,223
Come on. We have to make sure

179
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,292
everyone's ready
and waiting for 'em.

180
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,593
Alice: Right.

( Renly grunts )

184
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,578
According to Commander Bercouli,

185
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,581
the Pugilists
are vulnerable to sacred arts.

186
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,451
The plains might not have
enough spatial resources,

187
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,588
but here, there's
at least some vegetation,

188
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,055
so the priests should have

189
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,525
enough sacred power
to launch an attack.

190
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,394
Hopefully it'll cause confusion,

191
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,330
and we can use our dragons
to burn them.

192

( Gasps )

193

Are the Supply Corps
somewhere safe?

194
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,603
Soldier: Yes.

195
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,338
They're standing by
to the south.

196
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,672
They're far enough back

197
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,474
that they won't get caught
in the battle.

198
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,377
Renly: Very good. Thank you.

199
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,419

Come on, man.

205
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,703
I'm getting bored
sitting around, giving orders.

206
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,573
How's about we go outside
and have ourselves some fun?

207

Gabriel: No, thanks.

208
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,378
But you can go first
if you want to.

209
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,613
I'll pick a spot.

210
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,784
There. In those woods.

211
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,652
Vassago: That better be
where the action is,

212
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,520
or I'm gonna be disappointed!

213
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,256
Gabriel: I guarantee
you'll have fun,

Yeah, I know you are.

You're an Integrity Knight.

You're all supposed to be
immortal freaks or whatever.

I'll allow it.

However, you are also freakish.

Deal with it, granny.

your demon powers and all.

you're lookin'
way more like a fighter,

although you don't got
nearly enough muscles.

You should eat

Sheyta: As should you.

273

It must be this one's attack.

He seems weak
everywhere except his fists,

298

but he displays a will
worthy of an Integrity Knight.

299
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,400
I could end this
by cutting off his head.

I should, but...

330
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,166
( Vassago chuckles )

331
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:51,837
That's it. A little closer.

332
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,112
( Gasps )

333
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:02,981
( Ronie grunts )

334
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:04,716
Vassago: 'Sup, baby doll?

335
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:05,717
How'd you spot me?

336
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,853
Ronie: It wasn't too hard.

337
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,856
My mentor taught me to trust
my senses, not my eyes.

338
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:13,058
Vassago: What?
Where have I heard that?

339
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,993
( Ronie inhales )

340
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,629
Wake up! The enemy's here!

341
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,066
( Vassago scoffs )

342
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,134
( Growls )

343
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,036

344
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,808
( chuckles )

345
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,478
Oh, boys, time to party!

346
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,912
( Footsteps thumping )

347
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,016
¶

348
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,218
( soldiers gasping )

349
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,954
Renly: What?!
The enemy's behind us?

350
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,822
Dozens of them?

351
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,160
If they destroy our supplies,
we will be immobilized.

352
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,296
And those two girls and kirito
are back there.

353
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,366
I should send backup,
but if I do,

354
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:57,369
the enemy will know
about our ambush.

355
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,971
Or could they already know?

356
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,107
Maybe I should send all
of these troops back to help.

357
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,775
Bercouli: I guess they figured

358
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,844
we'd head this way
after we broke through,

359
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,913
so they stuck some troops
down here to meet us.

360
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,648
Renly: C-Commander!

361
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,185
Bercouli: Hmm. Renly...

362
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,320
Get the troops
up and out of here.

363
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,989
Kiddo, go and help
the Supply Corps.

364
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,059
I'll stay here and hold off
the Pugilists. Understood?

365
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,260
Renly: Sir!

366
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:23,995
Alice: You say
you'll hold them off,

367
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,397
but how?

368
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,400
They are 5,000. You are but one.

369
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,135
Bercouli: Kid, don't worry.

370
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,138
I got this. Now get goin'.

371
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:36,141
Alice: All right, then.
Please be safe.

372
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,813
Bercouli: Hmph.

373
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,749
( Vassago laughs )

374
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,684
( Ronie yelping )

375
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,486
- Tiese: Ronie!
- ( Soldiers gasp )

376
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,822
( Vassago laughs )

377
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,023
( Tiese gasps )

378
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,227
Vassago: There it is,
that old feeling.

379
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,295
God damn,
I missed the rush of it,

380
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,765
a life hanging
by the edge of my sword.

381
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,435
This right here's why I can't
get enough of player killing.

382
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:06,504
( Ronie whimpers )

383
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,505
Huh?

384
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,375
Vassago: Eh?

385
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,343
( Energy crackling )

386
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,082
Ronie: Is that lady stacia?

387
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,422
( Gasps )

388
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,925
( Woman vocalizing )

389
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,929
Dark Knight:
Th-the ground's opening up!

390
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,698
( Dark Knights screaming )

391
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:39,438
( Vocalizing continues )

392
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,153
Vassago: Holy crap.

393
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,822
You gotta be kidding me.

394
00:20:56,957 --> 00:21:00,426
Same hair, same face. It's her!

395
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,095
The Killer Queen of
the Knights of the Blood Oath,

396
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,232
Lightning Flash.

397
