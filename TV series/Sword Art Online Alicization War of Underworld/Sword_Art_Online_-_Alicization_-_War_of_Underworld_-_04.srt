00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,405
( Chorus vocalizing )

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,874
Man: Gabriel.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,111
¶

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,880
- Gabriel.
- Hmm?

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:19,684
Man: Did you know that bugs
don't have brains like we do?

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,821
Gabriel: Then what kind
of brains do they have?

8
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,624
Man: Their nervous system
acts as their brain,

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,759
and it runs
all throughout their bodies.

10
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,762
That's why,
if you remove their head,

11
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,197
an insect can continue living
for a bit.

12
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,905
Gabriel: If this can stay alive
after its head is gone,

13
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,475
then I wonder
where its soul's at?

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,148
( Exoskeleton cracks )

15
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:53,986
Girl: Yoo-hoo!

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,887
Gabriel: Eh?

17
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,589
( Girl laughs ) Hi, Gabe!

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,525

19
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,393
( laughs )

20
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,828
Gabriel: Hi, Alicia.

21
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,731
Alicia: I'm bored.
Wanna hang out?

22
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,599
Gabriel: Okay!

23
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,737
( Alicia humming )

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,211
Gabriel: I wonder
where Alicia's soul is?

25
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,945
¶

26
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,281
people aren't like bugs,

27
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,417
can't live without our heads,

28
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,887
so a person's soul
has to be in their head.

29
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,825
It's gotta be
somewhere in the brain.

30
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,294
Under her skin, her skull,

31
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,363
deep in her brain,

32
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,866
her soul's there, hiding.

33
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,904
( Gabriel sighs )

34
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:46,772

37
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,356
Hmph.

38
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,660
Vassago: No way.

39
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,328
Is that you?

40
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,296
Gabriel: Vassago?

41
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,733
Vassago: Oh, yeah. You know it.

42
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:17,402
Check it out.
That dork logged us in

43
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,537
and didn't screw it up.

44
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,438
Gabriel: Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,882
( Thinking ) A world
of artificial fluctlights,

46
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,887
and every one of them
with a soul, a human soul.

( Goblins yelling, laughing )

51
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,472
Kubiri: Run, you bastards!
Us flatland goblins

52
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,741
should be the ones
to get to the emperor first!

53
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,276
( Yelling continues )

54
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:37,682
Hagashi: Those flatland
slug slurpers won't beat us!

55
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,818
The honor
of his majesty's first spear

56
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,686
will go to the mountain goblins!

Pugilists: Yeah!

Rengil: I am the head

65
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,550
of the commerce guild,
your excellency.

66
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,686
Rengil gila scobo
at your service.

67
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:51,223
Lilpilin: I be Lilpilin,
chief of orcs!

68
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,359
Dee: I am Dee eye ell,
your majesty,

69
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,228
head of the dark mages guild.

70
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,897
It is my privilege to serve you.

71
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:03,035
My 3,000 mages, my heart,
and my body belong to you.

72
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,169
Gabriel: Hmm.

73
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,908
Shasta: Vixur ul Shasta,
head of the dark knights.

74
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,847
Before I pledge my sword,
I have a question.

75
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,783
Your majesty, now that
you've returned after so long,

76
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,618
what do you seek?

77
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,589
Gabriel: Blood and terror,

78
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,324
fire and destruction,

79
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,526
death and screams.

80
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,527
( Council members gasp )

81
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,796
Gabriel: The western lands flow

82
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,599
with the power of the gods that
banished me from the heavens,

83
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,602
but the great gate
that protects those lands

84
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:41,339
shall crumble very soon,
and so I've returned.

85
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,877
This world shall know my power
and tremble before it.

86
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,613
Once the great gate falls,
the realm of the humans

87
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,815
will belong
to the people of darkness.

88
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,752
I have but one request of you,

89
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,754
to bring me
the priestess of light

90
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,756
who resides in the human empire.

91
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:02,227
You have permission to terrorize
and murder any other human,

92
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,295
but she is mine.

93
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,632
Go forth,
my warriors of darkness!

94
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,802
Claim your destiny!

95
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,840
Lilpilin: Kill!
Drink their blood!

96
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,644
Smash in their skulls,
and rip 'em to pieces!

97
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,180
( Hagashi roars )

98
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,582
Hail to the emperor!

99
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,383
Kubiri: War!

100
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,785
Death to the white iums!

101
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,587
( Subjects cheering )

102
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,215
¶

103
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,284
Vassago: I gotta
hand it to you, bro.

104
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,819
You got some talent.

105
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,557
You could be a big-time actor
if you wanted.

106
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,559
Gabriel: Please,
don't be ridiculous.

107
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,828
A speech was called for,
and I gave it,

108
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,497
which is a skill
you should learn yourself.

109
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,367
Since you are their superior,
they'll be expecting it.

110
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,770
Vassago: I don't wanna
give orders or speeches.

111
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,105
I just wanna kill some fools.

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
I never seen v.R. Be so real,

113
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,643
so I figure I might as well
take advantage of it.

114
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,846
I mean, I can
friggin' taste this wine!

115
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:31,449
Gabriel: Just remember,
there's no pain absorber here.

116
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,719
If you get cut,
it'll bleed and hurt, bad.

117
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,389
Vassago: I know.
That's what makes this great!

118
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,126
¶

119
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,672
- Critter: That you, captain?
- Gabriel: Yeah.

120
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,207
Critter: Good timing.

121
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,810
We got back
to main control just now,

122
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,412
wanted to make sure
your dive didn't have issues.

123
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:01,613
Gabriel: Thank you.

124
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,349
So far,
our first day here went well.

125
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,284
The phenomenon
of accelerated time

126
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,353
takes a bit of getting used to.

127
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,288
Other than that,
everything's going as planned,

128
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,423
so I'm not complaining.

129
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,159
We should have these units
equipped and ready

130
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,894
in two days, our time.

131
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,697
Then we'll launch the attack
on the human empire.

132
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,565
Critter: Suh-weet.

133
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,767
All right, so here's what to do.

134
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,769
Once you have Alice,
get her back to that terminal,

135
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,172
and bring up the menu.
There'll be an option there

136
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,708
to eject her lightcube
to the main control room.

137
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,111
Click on that, and Alice's
lightcube's as good as ours.

138
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,513
Oh, and while you're there,

139
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,648
there's something
you and that dumb-ass Vassago

140
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,583
- should keep in mind.
- Vassago: What?!

141
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,586
Critter: Since we don't have
access to admin privileges,

142
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,655
we don't have
the luxury of resetting,

143
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,259
so if you gents end up
getting killed, I won't be able

144
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,662
to log you back in
with those superuser accounts.

145
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:53,598
The best I can do is send
you back as low-level grunts.

146
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,534
Gabriel: Got it.
We'll be careful.

147
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,001
What's the s.D.F. Up to?

148
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,871
Critter: Nothing at the moment.

149
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,605
I bet they're so freaked out,

150
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,207
they don't even know
you dove in there.

151
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,343
Gabriel: Good.
I guess that's it for now.

152
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,813
Hopefully, the next time you
hear from me, we'll have Alice.

153
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,382
Critter: Roger that! Good luck.

154
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,421
Vassago: God,
I hate that ass-wipe.

155
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,558
I was thinking.
Maybe I'll head downtown

156
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,427
and, you know,
blow off a little steam.

157
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,697
Gabriel: No, I'd prefer it
if you didn't.

158
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,566
Once the op's over, you can
have a night all to yourself.

159
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,767
Vassago: All right.

160
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,835
Standing down
on the chicks and murder.

161
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,073
I'll hit the sack
and dream about 'em instead.

162
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,580
( Gabriel grunts )

163
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,583
What are you doing here?

164
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,319
Lipia: I shall be
your company tonight,

165
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,288
if it pleases your majesty.

166
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,391
Gabriel: Well.

167
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,595
( Bed creaks )

168
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,597
And by whose order?

169
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,798
Lipia: No one.

170
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,867
My duty is to indulge
your whims, sire.

171
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,303
Gabriel: All right, then.

172
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,073
Lipia: If you please...

173
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,145

Gabriel: Who put you up to this?

177
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:24,289
Lipia: I am here
of my own volition.

178
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,225
Gabriel: Then who's
your commanding officer?

179
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:29,561
- Lipia: No one.
- Gabriel: Still,

180
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,297
you must have a reason
for your treachery.

181
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,700
Did you do it for money, or did
someone promise you status?

182
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,702
Lipia: For the good of the land.

183
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,437
( Gabriel chuckles ) Really?

184
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,639
Lipia: If war breaks out,

185
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:43,575
it will set history back
hundreds of years.

186
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,577
We cannot revert
to the old ways,

187
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,313
where the powerless
suffered under oppression.

188

There it is,

195
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,082
just like that day.

( Soft hum )

202
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,585
I just saw Alicia's soul,

203
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,187
and for a second there,

204
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,090
I could see
what her soul was seeing, too.

205

( Sighs )

206
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,333
A human soul.

207
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,602
I wanna see
more of what it showed me.

208
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,737
I can't wait to see it again.

209
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:53,672

( Shuddering )

213
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,389
Lipia: I love you so much...

214
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,958
Milord.

215
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,228
Gabriel: That was incredible.

216
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,697
What a glorious experience.

217
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:23,368
Even though our fluctlights
are in separate lightcubes,

218
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:27,439
they connected through
the s.T.L., so when she died,

219
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,508
maybe the release
of quantum data

220
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,444
flowed back to me
by way of that connection.

221
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,513
What am I doing?

222
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,315
Who cares about the how of it?

223
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,652
I've experimented with
so many people since Alicia,

224
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:45,424
and finally I've experienced
the phenomenon again here.

225
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,795
If that's what
an average a.I. Soul is like

226
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:54,399
Alice's should be
extraordinary.

227
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,602
Alice, your soul will be sweet,

228
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,305
and I shall relish it.

¶

230
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:24,096
Dee: Milord,
all preparations are complete.

231
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,030
We are ready
to launch the assault

232
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,166
whenever it pleases you.

233
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,335
Gabriel: Good.

234
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,641
Shasta: The life
of the eastern gate,

235
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:38,577
which has divided
the human empire

236
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,645
and the land of darkness
since creation,

237
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,114
will expire soon.

238
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,448
Lipia: The five tribes

239
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,784
are excited
about the prospect of war

240
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,787
and the bounty of resources
the human empire contains.

241
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,655
Shasta: And yet,
each integrity knight

242
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,258
is worth a thousand
of our warriors in battle.

243
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,460
The edge we have in our numbers

244
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,596
shall be whittled down
in no time.

245
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,933
Beating them may be possible,
but by the time we do,

246
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,667
we will have suffered
severe losses.

247
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,136
Lipia: If that's true,

248
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,005
it will lead to an imbalance
of power among the tribes.

249
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,274
Shasta: The council of ten
will be powerless,

250
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,143
and the treaty
among the five tribes

251
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,612
will be rescinded.
If that happens,

252
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,348
it will become another age
of blood and iron.

253
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,150
That cannot come to pass.

254
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:22,121
Our only hope is to make peace
with the human empire.

255
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:26,091
I must speak with bercouli.

256
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,294
I am certain he would agree

257
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,696
to our request for peace.

258
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:35,300
But first, I must kill
the one who stands in the way,

259
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,368
emperor vecta.

260
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,571
Gabriel: By the way, last night,

261
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,507
I discovered
an intruder in my chamber.

262
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,109
They had a dagger
hidden in their hair.

263
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,511
( Subjects gasping )

264
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,313
Gabriel: Fear not.

265
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,249
I won't condemn whoever
sent the assassin after me.

266

( Shasta gasps )

267
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,987
Gabriel: If you wish
to have more power,

268
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,990
there is nothing wrong
using treachery to obtain it,

269
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,591
and if you desire the throne,

270
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,260
feel free to attack me
however you wish.

271
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:06,331
With that said, if you decide
to embark on such a gamble,

272
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,134
know that the consequences
will be most severe.

273
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,269
For example, this traitor...

274
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,538

Lipia.

281
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:42,567
We must have peace,
for the sake of all.

282
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,504
That sounds so hypocritical,
especially coming

283
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,306
from the commander
of the dark knights.

284
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,108
Lipia: It is admirable,

285
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,144

Fu Za: The poison coursing
through you is so potent,

00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:37,222
it can kill a land dragon
with a life of over 30,000

of love, of the soul.

319

this man cannot be defeated

whoever is the next highest rank
to lead them.
