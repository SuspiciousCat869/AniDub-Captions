It's not a mission.

Well, when I heard
Lieutenant General Nakajima

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.740 position:50% align:center
asked to meet with you,
I just assumed it was.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.825 position:50% align:center
So what did he want?

[MAEDA sighs]

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] He asked me to take his
daughter's hand in marriage.

someone here to see you.

Hello, sir.
I've come to escort you.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello, Colonel Maeda.
I didn't expect to see you here.

you talk too much, Moriyama?

Sorry, I just can't help myself.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, sir,
we need to hurry.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're right.
Where has the time gone?

I'll accompany you.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] No. Thank you,
but there's no need.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
I would hate to subject you to
Okimura's incessant grumbling.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
But you're more than welcome to
stay here and relax for a while.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that would
make Misaki very happy.

One might say that

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
she resembles a little
piece of money, or perhaps

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
a little silver flower.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
Why, yes, the moon is
cold and she is chaste.

I am sure she is a virgin,
for she has a virgin's beauty.

Ah, it's the prophet!

He of whom the
Tetrarch is afraid?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
It is thy mouth.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
To kiss thy mouth,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
my lips to thy lips,
my words and thine.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
It is thy mouth that
I desire, Jokanaan.
