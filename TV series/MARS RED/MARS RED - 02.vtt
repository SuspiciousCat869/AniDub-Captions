Jokanaan.

Thou wert the only
man that I have loved.

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:40.167 align:middle
All other men are hateful to me.

for you, Colonel.

[MAEDA]
Was there an incident?

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:52.208 align:middle
Reported in Kayabacho.

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:54.583 align:middle
Any previous vamp
activity in the area?

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:56.958 align:middle
No, or none
that we know about.

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle
Start by locating
the whereabouts

00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:01.042 align:middle
of residents who've
moved in recently.

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.208 align:middle
You think the vampire could
be living in the district

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:04.583 align:middle
and not just feeding there?

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.667 align:middle
If it's hunting in
unfamiliar territory,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.583 align:middle
it'll stay close to home.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.083 align:middle

fire in the streets!

Now at Tokyo Station!
There are witnesses!

You nincompoop.
This paper doesn't print

[CHIEF EDITOR grunts] Why don't
you write about that actress

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.958 align:middle
from the Imperial Theater
who apparently up and eloped?

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:46.333 align:middle
Oh, Salomé! I mean, her name
was Misaki in real life!

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:48.792 align:middle
That performance was
utterly breathtaking!

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.625 align:middle
I can't believe she ran
off to marry her lover!

[CHIEF EDITOR]
It's just a rumor, but

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.333 align:middle
the headline could be,

00:03:56.417 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle
"Love is a fire that
transcends family and status!"

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle

to Misaki's Salomé.

[DEFROTT]
That which we call a rose

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:25.208 align:middle
by any other name
would smell as sweet.

You're Romeo?!

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:37.333 align:middle
Shh. So, miss, you
were a fan of Misaki's?

00:04:37.417 --> 00:04:39.083 align:middle
Actually I was
wondering about her.

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:42.208 align:middle
Did she really run off
and marry somebody?

May I ask who wants to know?

such an amusing mixture

of fact and fiction.

in writing about the truth.

who never came
back from Siberia.

matter what, he wouldn't die.

But what if I said no?

Can't do that.
You know the score.

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.458 align:middle
This is the only stuff

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:25.375 align:middle
we can eat or drink
since we've changed.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.208 align:middle
It's not like
you'd die without it.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:29.125 align:middle
You'd just shrivel up.

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:31.708 align:middle
[KURUSU]
That sounds awful.

00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:34.833 align:middle
[YAMAGAMI] Hold your nose
and pretend it's turtle blood.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:38.333 align:middle
[KURUSU] Ugh. I don't see
how that would help at all.

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:40.625 align:middle
[YAMAGAMI] Listen here, kid,
the quicker you accept that

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:43.208 align:middle
you're not human
anymore, the better.

Accept your new life.

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:50.625 align:middle

Calm down, it's not as though
there's any permanent damage.

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:15.917 align:middle
Just about any
injury you receive

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle
will be healed up in a jiff
as soon as you ingest blood.

Ahh, cut Kurusu some slack.

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:24.208 align:middle
A-Classes are extra sensitive
to tastes and smells.

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:26.875 align:middle
An unranked vampire
wouldn't understand.

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.375 align:middle
I can't do anything about that!

This is candy made from blood.

it more appetizing.

will be here soon.

So he's back from his

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:48.667 align:middle

a few days early then.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.792 align:middle
It's strange to think none
of us have met him yet.

Wonder what'll he be like.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.958 align:middle
Probably some kid
fresh out of Ichigaya,

00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:57.625 align:middle
but I'll beat the

00:06:57.708 --> 00:06:59.917 align:middle
I am Colonel Yoshinobu Maeda.

Code Zero is a vampire
unit in my command.

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:03.958 align:middle
You have unique abilities.

00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:05.833 align:middle
We'll use them to
collect intelligence,

as well as conduct
special missions.

Any vampires hiding in Tokyo

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:13.417 align:middle
who indiscriminately attack
humans will be dealt with--

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.125 align:middle
either captured or disposed of.

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:21.083 align:middle
There a problem, Yamagami?
Do I have something on my face?

00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:22.833 align:middle
[YAMAGAMI]
Why you of all people?

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:25.583 align:middle
Careful. Have respect,

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:26.667 align:middle
[YAMAGAMI]
Why should I?!

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.125 align:middle
We were trained at
Ichigaya together.

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:31.250 align:middle
And yet I was
promoted above you.

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle
and Lance Corporal Kurusu vastly
outranks you as a vampire.

00:07:35.083 --> 00:07:35.958 align:middle
That must sting.

00:07:36.042 --> 00:07:37.417 align:middle
Dammit, Maeda!

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle

What was that?

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:39.792 align:middle
[YAMAGAMI grunts]

00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:42.833 align:middle

00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:45.792 align:middle
[MAEDA]
That's better, Major Yamagami.

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle
What did I do to
deserve this post?

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:51.917 align:middle
Shutaro Kurusu. You were
bitten by an S-Class vamp,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.375 align:middle
making you our nation's
one and only A-Class.

00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:55.875 align:middle
But you don't look the part.

00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.792 align:middle
Yes, sir, I would agree.

00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:00.958 align:middle
[MAEDA] And yet you're the least
human of all of us, aren't you?

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:02.208 align:middle
[KURUSU grunts]

00:08:02.292 --> 00:08:03.542 align:middle
That'll be handy.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.167 align:middle
I'll have to make full
use of you in battle.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.417 align:middle
Why just me?

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.125 align:middle
When a vampire's bodily fluids

00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:11.292 align:middle
enter a human via
a bite or other method,

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:13.417 align:middle
nine times out of ten
they can't handle the shock

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.042 align:middle
and die of poisoning.

00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:16.417 align:middle
Is that so?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle
I guess that means we
ended up pretty lucky then?

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:21.708 align:middle
Huh?

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:23.542 align:middle
The problem is anyone
who survives a bite

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle
becomes a vampire.

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:26.625 align:middle
And that change brings
an overwhelming need

00:08:26.708 --> 00:08:28.167 align:middle
to drink blood.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle
Of course, we wouldn't starve
as quickly as a human would,

00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:32.708 align:middle
but the longer we go without
feeding,

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:36.833 align:middle
the more overwhelmingly intense
our cravings will become.

00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:38.292 align:middle
[KURUSU]
Hmm...

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:41.875 align:middle
[SUWA] That's enough talk
for now. Who should I kill?

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.792 align:middle
Reports of people
bursting into flames

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:45.292 align:middle
are currently on the rise.

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:47.333 align:middle
It's safe to assume
that these are vampires,

00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle
probably new ones, who've
been exposed to sunlight.

00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:52.208 align:middle
Until recently, there
were only a few cases

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:55.167 align:middle
reported every year,
but we had seven last month.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.792 align:middle
[TAKEUCHI] And the one
at Tokyo Station makes eight.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle
Unit Sixteen will map a search
area based on those locations.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.375 align:middle
Hopefully the humans
are able to find

00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle
the vamps in hiding and
leave us the fun part.

00:09:08.042 --> 00:09:10.083 align:middle
[KURUSU]
Sir, may I?

00:09:10.167 --> 00:09:12.375 align:middle
It sounds like most
people bitten by vampires

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.542 align:middle
should die of poisoning, right?

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle
So why aren't we finding
more random victims?

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.625 align:middle
[MAEDA] Someone may be either
hiding the drained corpses

00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle
or supplying the vampires
with sustenance.

00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:25.542 align:middle
There are plenty of
places that deal in blood.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:28.417 align:middle
Butchers and hospitals,
just to name a few.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.333 align:middle
I know a more
fashionable locale.

00:09:46.917 --> 00:09:51.875 align:middle
[bell tolling]

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.958 align:middle
[KURUSU chuckles]

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:01.333 align:middle
It's been so long
since I've played.

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:02.583 align:middle
[KURUSU]
You know the organ?

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:05.292 align:middle
Yes, I'm not some
kind of uncultured swine.

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:08.417 align:middle
[TENMANYA]
Please don't touch that.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle
You see...

00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:12.458 align:middle
...it's old and quite fragile.

00:10:12.542 --> 00:10:14.917 align:middle
Uhh...

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.833 align:middle
You were sent by Mr. Takeuchi?

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:29.167 align:middle
That's right. We were told

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.375 align:middle
you're in the
business of information.

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:34.375 align:middle
Yes, I am.
It's our specialty here.

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:37.333 align:middle
Tenmanya serves daytime
and nighttime clients.

00:10:37.417 --> 00:10:41.458 align:middle
I know the kind of intelligence
that people like you desire.

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:42.542 align:middle
Are you a vampire?

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle
No, look closely.

00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:45.708 align:middle
This boy's a human.

00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle
Wait, I don't get it. Why would
you want to help our kind?

00:10:48.583 --> 00:10:50.458 align:middle
It's a rather lengthy story.

00:10:50.542 --> 00:10:51.667 align:middle
We don't need it.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.583 align:middle
We want to know how
vampires are being fed

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:55.833 align:middle
if not through live victims.

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.042 align:middle
You seek blood-dealers, then?

00:10:58.125 --> 00:10:59.833 align:middle
Who are they?

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:01.542 align:middle
[TENMANYA]
Exactly what they sound like.

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:03.167 align:middle
Sellers of a lifeforce.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle
They take blood for transfusions
with sodium citrate added

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.667 align:middle
to prevent coagulation
and get it to buyers.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.583 align:middle
We used to have a
monopoly on the trade

00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:12.417 align:middle
and a loyal base of consumers.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.083 align:middle
That so? Talk!

00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:16.625 align:middle
Do you know where any
vampires are hiding out?

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:19.083 align:middle
I don't, not that I'd tell you.

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.125 align:middle
And why not?!

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:22.375 align:middle
Yamagami, stop.
He's a civilian kid.

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:24.458 align:middle
A wise merchant
protects his buyers.

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:27.208 align:middle
Otherwise his business
has no future.

00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:31.208 align:middle
I value my customers,
and I won't sell them out.

00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:34.125 align:middle
Although, a rival dealer
from another quarter

00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:36.292 align:middle
has encroached
upon my clientele.

00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:37.458 align:middle
[KURUSU gasps]

00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle
[TENMANYA]
I suppose I could sell them out.

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:40.875 align:middle
Who is it?

00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.625 align:middle
[TENMANYA]
I don't know that much.

00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle
However...

00:11:45.917 --> 00:11:47.125 align:middle
You want payment?

00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle
I can't operate without profits.

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:52.042 align:middle
But that said,
your first taste is free.

00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:54.875 align:middle
You'll be crushing the
competition for me anyway.

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.125 align:middle
Head clerk, the
vial if you will.

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:02.667 align:middle
Thank you.

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle
Here, this'll be of help.

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:09.875 align:middle
What is it?

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.375 align:middle
A bootleg of the
product that we sell.

00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle
It's what my rival's offering.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.417 align:middle
[ONATSU]
Masakichi, you dog. We mustn't.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.208 align:middle
[MASAKICHI]
Just let yourself give in.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.583 align:middle
[ONATSU gasps]

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:30.958 align:middle
[MASAKICHI] Well, Onatsu?
How's the "Ascra"?

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.792 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:37.083 align:middle
[ONATSU]
You're so naughty.

00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle
[MASAKICHI] Shall we go
on another feeding spree?

00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:42.083 align:middle
We'll have to find
another home after.

00:12:42.167 --> 00:12:45.417 align:middle
[ONATSU] I know it's
a heavy price. But worth it.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.917 align:middle
[ONATSU grunts]

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.375 align:middle
[ONATSU]
Enough of that!

00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:51.792 align:middle
[MASAKICHI]
All right, fine.

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:55.042 align:middle
[ONATSU] Darling, let's live
somewhere, just the two of us--

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:58.875 align:middle
like Okaru and Kanpei
in the old story.

00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.625 align:middle
[MASAKICHI] Uhh...
Don't they die in the end?

00:13:02.708 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle
[ONATSU giggles]
You're so adorable.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.875 align:middle
Fire!

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.833 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] What do you think?
They're the army's best.

00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:25.375 align:middle
They're useless.

00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:26.583 align:middle
Uh--

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:29.333 align:middle
A Type 38 rifle won't
put a vampire down.

00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:31.708 align:middle
Look into improving
our armaments.

00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:33.958 align:middle
And if possible,
stock up on grenades

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:35.208 align:middle
and Type Three machine guns.

00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:36.583 align:middle
We're based in the city.

00:13:36.667 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle
It's not as though
we'll be fighting tanks.

00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle
But it would be
easier if we were.

00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:42.292 align:middle
Tanks are large,
slow-moving targets.

00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:45.083 align:middle
Our enemies can
disappear in an instant.

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle
That's why often a blade
is your best friend.

00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:52.417 align:middle
If you can't fight back, you'll
die or become one of them.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.042 align:middle
Drag anyone bitten into the
sunlight before they can change.

00:13:56.125 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle
Now, assemble your men and find
the vampire causing trouble.

00:13:59.083 --> 00:14:00.625 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Yes, sir!

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle
Rule number one is to
always search in pairs.

00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:16.375 align:middle
Take no action alone. Don't
enter the shadows unprepared.

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:17.625 align:middle
Trust your eyes and ears,

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle
but double-check
what you see and hear.

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:23.458 align:middle
Pay mind to your senses even
when your hands are occupied.

00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle
Look through every scrap
of garbage you come across.

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:28.417 align:middle
Find evidence of any
suspicious activity.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle
That's all! Dismissed!

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:31.833 align:middle
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.542 align:middle
[AOI]
Hi there, Mr. Policeman!

00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:52.875 align:middle
You're the reporter.

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.833 align:middle
It's Aoi Shirase.

00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:58.167 align:middle
Are you investigating the
human combustion cases, too?

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.167 align:middle
[MAEDA] People going up in
flames? That's impossible.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.083 align:middle
I know it seems crazy,
but I do believe it can happen.

00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:08.417 align:middle
Sounds like you're someone
who's not easily swayed.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.875 align:middle
That's true. Shutaro used to
tell me the same all the time.

00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:12.917 align:middle
Shutaro?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.792 align:middle
A friend from my childhood.

00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:16.042 align:middle
He was reported dead,

00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:19.625 align:middle
but I believe he's
still alive somewhere.

00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle
Ah. I see.

00:15:22.583 --> 00:15:25.125 align:middle
[AOI] Those must be for
a person you cared about.

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:26.292 align:middle
Not so.

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle
[AOI] Then why are
you leaving them here?

00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:31.042 align:middle
I just couldn't keep
my word to somebody.

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle
Nothing more.

00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle
[AOI] Asters? Those mean
"I'll never forget you."

00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:43.917 align:middle
Aw, I knew it.
He must've lost a lover.

00:16:01.042 --> 00:16:02.042 align:middle
[MAEDA]
You mind?

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:03.917 align:middle
[MORIYAMA grunts]
Please, go ahead.

00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:07.625 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
I feel like I'm beginning

00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:09.292 align:middle
to learn your habits, Colonel.

00:16:09.375 --> 00:16:10.917 align:middle
I'm told you found something.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.625 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Yes.

00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Where?

00:16:14.083 --> 00:16:17.542 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Tenement house in Kayabacho.

00:16:17.625 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle
We'll seal all the bridges
and streets at midnight.

00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:21.458 align:middle
I'll bring in Zero.

00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:22.792 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Yes, sir.

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.292 align:middle
[MAEDA]
And thanks for your hard work.

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.875 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Of course.

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle
[MAEDA] Will this be
the last time I see the sun?

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:35.208 align:middle
Who can say?

00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] We're in place.
The perimeter is covered.

00:16:42.583 --> 00:16:44.625 align:middle
You're sure we've taken
enough precautions, sir?

00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:46.625 align:middle
There's a gap on
the Hamacho side.

00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:48.875 align:middle
[MAEDA] I left it open
on purpose. Let's go.

00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.875 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Yes, sir.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.833 align:middle
[SOLDIER 2C]
Residents are evacuated.

00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:02.083 align:middle
[SUWA]
I'll take it from here.

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:15.417 align:middle
[MASAKICHI exhales]

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.125 align:middle
[snarls]

00:17:16.208 --> 00:17:17.958 align:middle
[SUWA]
Two of them!

00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:20.917 align:middle
Run.

00:17:25.042 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle
[SUWA] A vampire couple?
What an unholy union.

00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:35.875 align:middle
[MASAKICHI]
Those bastards wanna murder us!

00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle
No, stay here.

00:17:37.083 --> 00:17:38.833 align:middle
There couldn't be
more than 20 humans.

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.542 align:middle
We've never had a problem
with that before.

00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle
I have a bad feeling this time.

00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:44.333 align:middle
Is this an elder's wisdom?

00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:46.792 align:middle
My centenarian wife
sounds paranoid.

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:49.667 align:middle
Don't start. I'm simply
worried about you.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.458 align:middle
Since buying that
stuff from Yokohama,

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle
you've been different.

00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:55.625 align:middle
Shut up! I'm sick of
living my life in hiding.

00:17:55.708 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle
I told you to stop!

[ONATSU chuckles]

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.417 align:middle
There's no going
back now, my love.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.292 align:middle
If they manage to capture us,

00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:09.208 align:middle
we'll never see
each other again.

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:10.708 align:middle
[ONATSU]
Shh!

00:18:10.792 --> 00:18:13.792 align:middle
We're surrounded. This way.

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:20.542 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
They won't let us pass.

00:18:20.625 --> 00:18:22.125 align:middle
Then ram them off of the street.

00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:23.792 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
That's a cabinet minister's car!

00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:26.458 align:middle
I'll take responsibility. Do it!

00:18:26.542 --> 00:18:29.583 align:middle
[ONATSU, MASAKICHI panting]

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:31.458 align:middle
Darling, are you
sure you're okay?

00:18:31.542 --> 00:18:32.542 align:middle
Be quiet!

00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:34.417 align:middle
[KURUSU] They did come this way.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.417 align:middle
[TAKEUCHI] Proof that Maeda
knows his stuff, I'd say.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.875 align:middle
[YAMAGAMI]
So who's going to take charge?

00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.917 align:middle
[KURUSU] 'Scuse me,
you're vampires, correct?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.083 align:middle
Don't dare try to stop us!

00:18:44.167 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle
No. Don't fight him.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.542 align:middle
That one is dangerous.

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.042 align:middle
[MASAKICHI]
He's practically a child.

00:18:49.125 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle
[KURUSU]
Uh, what should I say?

00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:51.917 align:middle
Um, let's see.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.875 align:middle
[ONATSU] Can't you even sense
someone's power anymore?

00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:58.125 align:middle
It'll be better for us all.
We don't have to fight you!

00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.292 align:middle
[ONATSU, MASAKICHI grunt]

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:04.292 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] Listen well,
vampires. You have two roads,

00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:05.875 align:middle
so make your choice.

00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:09.125 align:middle
One! Obey us, Special
Forces Unit Sixteen,

00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:12.167 align:middle
and you will receive
blood and registrations!

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.208 align:middle
Two! Refuse to comply

00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle
and we will end your
bloodlines here and now!

00:19:17.333 --> 00:19:19.417 align:middle
Fire!

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.958 align:middle

[ONATSU]
Darling.

00:19:55.833 --> 00:19:59.083 align:middle
Umm, please surrender.

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle
Let us live, my Kanpei.

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:03.625 align:middle
What'd you say?

00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle
You were right about
the ending of that old story.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.083 align:middle

[yells, cackles]

00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:18.667 align:middle
[TAKEUCHI] Careful.
She must be the parent root.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle
[YAMAGAMI]
Kurusu!

00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:22.792 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Listen, vampire.

[grunts]

00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:26.833 align:middle
[MAEDA]
There are two roads open to you.

00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle
Time for love and blossoms
to fall to the earth.

[MORIYAMA groans]

Now, will he die of poisoning,

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:58.042 align:middle
or become a creature
of the night like us?

Shall we take bet-- [gasps]

00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:10.417 align:middle
I'm sorry. It'll
all be over soon.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.125 align:middle
I can feel it.

00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:15.125 align:middle
Thank you, sir.

[MAEDA grunts]

00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:28.458 align:middle
A shame. He would have
made a valuable sample.

00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Hm?

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle
[MAEDA] I should be the only
one who becomes a monster.
