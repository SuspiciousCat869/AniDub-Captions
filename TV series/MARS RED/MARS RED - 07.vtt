00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
Ah, what a strange voice.
Speak again, please, Jokanaan.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:17.095 position:50% align:center
Once more.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Umm, excuse me, sir.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
Yes, what is it?

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
Where might I find
the Imperial Theater?

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.966 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER 7A] You're certain
the attic is fine with you?

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.970 position:50% align:center
I'd hate for Mr. Okimura to be
displeased after connecting us.

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:01.473 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] Oh, I'm perfectly happy
staying up there.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
In fact, I requested it.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Hmm.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
Quite a climb. Better get used
to it since this is my room now.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
You're trespassing in my home.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI gasps]

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
Did that mouse head talk?

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
I'm over here.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.388 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Are you a ghost?

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Leave this place.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to be alone here.
How did you get in?

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna tell anyone okay,
but you should get outta here.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
I don't think you're hearing
what I'm telling you.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
Oh my, gosh, you're so thin!

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
You can't be eating enough.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
Do you want some food?

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
You talk far too much.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
And put the lamp away--
the light's insufferable.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
Sure. I'm sorry about that.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center
It's just that you look sickly.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT grunts]

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI gasps]

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.423 position:50% align:center
Be gone when I return.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
Where are you off to?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
The time has come.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
Time for what?

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
This is a tale that
the wind still whispers.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
I, Defrott, play a devil.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
It is long ago.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
I dwell in a dark
Russian forest far away.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
One day, a tired
soldier on his way home

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
wanders into my domain,
a violin in one hand.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.116 position:50% align:center
He's a marvel.
Such a stage presence.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.076 position:50% align:center
Who is he exactly?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
A child actor who
hails from England.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
The British ambassador
recommended him.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect him
to be so perfect.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI giggles]

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Hmph.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
Welcome back. How's it going?

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
You're still here.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] The manager
told me about your history.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
England, wow!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
And a child actor?

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
It's incredible that you've been
developing a craft for so long.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT grunts]
What is it?

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.801 position:50% align:center
Hi, there.
We weren't introduced.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
I'm Misaki Nakajima.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
What I wouldn't
give for your silence.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
Oh, please! I'm a
performer here, also!

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.727 position:50% align:center
We might end up
in a play together.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
It's possible, yes,

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean
we have to be friendly.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
[foosteps]

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Your hat is crooked.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
I knew I would look
foolish in this thing.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
You have only yourself to blame;
you're the one who enlisted.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
It's not like
I'm having second thoughts.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
It woulda been copacetic for you
to keep staying at our place.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
I told you I can't
keep doing that.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
I've been staying at your house
since we lost our draper's shop

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
and I've outstayed my welcome.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm forever
indebted to your family.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
Please, we don't mind.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
Ever since my big
brother, Sentaro, died,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
Mom's come to think
of you as her own son.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
Trust me when I say

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
you'll always have a home
with us, cross my heart.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
I know. But I'm
a full-fledged adult now.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
I need to be independent.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
And besides--

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
Hold on, is this
because you hate it

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
when people assume
you're my fiancé?

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
No, I swear it isn't.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
You let gossip
bother you so much!

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
What? I never said it upset me.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50% align:center
Well, spit it out
already, would ya,

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.334 position:50% align:center
while we're still young?

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
Oh, listen to you.
You're so strong, Aoi.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
Where's that comin' from?

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Even when Sentaro passed away,

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
you tried not to shed a tear.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, I'm a crybaby.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
That's why I want to get strong.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Ow, that hurt.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.608 position:50% align:center
Promise me somethin'.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
That no matter how
dangerous things get,

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
you don't get killed.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.912 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Hm. That settles it then.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
Go to Siberia or wherever.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
And then come back
home to your friends.

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
May you get to him safely.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Thanks for your hard work.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Here.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.736 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Siberia cake.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.449 position:50% align:center
You'll collapse if you
don't get some food in you.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
There's no need.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid something like that
would never suit my palate.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center
Stop complaining
and eat the cake!

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
I'll have some of it later.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
Not just some of it--all of it.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
Oh! Is that Shakespeare?

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> .

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
Ahh! Are you going
to be playing Romeo?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
I am, but I'm told
they haven't found

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
a fitting actress for my
star-crossed love interest yet.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:41.271 position:50% align:center
If they don't hurry it's going
to be a one-man production.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
That'd be something.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
And you're vying for the lead
in Wilde's <i>Salomé</i> , are you not?

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
Oh, how wonderful
it is to see the moon!

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
Yes, she is like
a little piece of money.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
A little silver flower.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
I can see that the
moon is cold and chaste.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
I am sure she is a virgin.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
The Lord hath arrived.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
The son of man is now with us.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
Surprised?

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
Why do you know
Jokanaan's lines?

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
As a live-in actor,
I have to know every role.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
I doubt you could fathom

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
the amount of discipline
that would take.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:24.731 position:50% align:center
And, your Salomé needs
work. That will not do.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
You're simply reciting lines

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
and not thinking about
who the character is.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI grunts] Well, she's
a princess, of course.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
Then why don't you act like
one instead of pretending?

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
Don't play the part.

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
Be a princess on stage.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI giggles]

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
You make it sound as though
you've met real royalty before.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
That would be because I have.

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
What? Defrott,
that's incredible!

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
I must insist you stop
treating me like a child.

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
I've been acting
longer than you have.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
Not a problem.
You have my word, sir.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
"Sir" may be a little much.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
So what should I do to
become the best Salomé?

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT grunts, sighs]

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Ah. How good to see the moon!

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.324 position:50% align:center
She is like a
little piece of money.

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
Shining.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
A little silver flower.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
Yes, the moon
is cold and chaste.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
I am sure that she is a virgin.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50% align:center
Amazing.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
You're her.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
Do you understand now?

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
An actor's job is to inhabit a
role, not simply memorize lines.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
You play her as if you know
how the story will unfold,

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
which rings false.
Salomé is in the dark.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
She doesn't know her
love is cursed to end

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
in tragedy and blood.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
She believes that
her love is pure.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI grunts]

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Now, once more!

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Mm.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Ah. How good to see the moon!

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
She is like a
little piece of money.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
A little silver flower.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. She is cold and chaste.

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:21.264 position:50% align:center
I am sure she is a virgin.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
[OKIMURA]
Misaki!

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI grunts]
Oh! Mr. Okimura!

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
I hear you'll be taking the lead

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
in the next production
at the theater, yes?

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
That's right! I'll be
playing the role of Salomé!

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
[OKIMURA]
Let me think.

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.757 position:50% align:center
I believe that
would be Oscar Wilde.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.884 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm impressed you know it.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
Will Nakajima come
to cheer you on?

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] Hmm... My father is
quite busy with his work lately.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
That simply won't do!

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
We won't be able to deepen our
relations with Great Britain

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
if we don't have cultural
exchanges of the arts.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
I don't see how
he can be so dismissive.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea! I'll talk to
him and insist that he attend.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
Sir, I don't want to burden you.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
You already went out
of your way to help me

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
get a place to
stay at the theater.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
My pleasure.

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's no trouble.
I see your father often.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.125 position:50% align:center
I'll convince him.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
Well, I look forward to it. Bye.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Thank you very much.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] Hello, Defrott.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
Would you like some dessert?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT grunts]
I swear.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
You must be trying to pester me.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
Don't be that way.
I'm only joking.

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Where have you been off to?

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
My house.

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
It's so close that you
can leave in the morning

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center
and be back this quickly?

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
I live in Akasaka
in the Hikawa district.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] Splendid. Start
commuting to the theater.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.372 position:50% align:center
But that place frightens me.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
Does it? Don't you have family?

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
My father, so yes, technically.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
But he's always
so busy with work

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
that I don't know the
last time I saw him there.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
That's why I rarely
visit these days.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
Only to pick up fresh
clothes or correspondences.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
Now my true home is here in
this attic and the theater.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
I see. Are those letters
that you just retrieved?

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.398 position:50% align:center
Yes, some good ones.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
This is a note from Mr. Maeda,
a friend of my father's.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
Huh. What's the man like?

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
He's my fiancé,

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
but we've never met in person.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
He writes often. Short letters.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
There's nothing too
elaborate about them,

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.461 position:50% align:center
and yet they're
still somehow charming.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
He's sensitive.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
There was even a pressed
flower folded into the last one!

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
I don't believe
I'm as interested

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
as I thought I would be.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
Look here it is!
Isn't it a perfect clover?

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
That's a common weed;
it's not a flower.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Well, I like it.

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
I think it's darling.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
It's quite odd.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
Marrying a man you've never even
exchanged real words with?

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
It's like the 16th century.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.986 position:50% align:center
You may think that,

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
but it's a normal
practice in Japan.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
It's true I've
not met Mr. Maeda,

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
but I can tell so much
about him from his letters.

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
He's very kind
and strong and shy.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
I know we'll make a good match.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.544 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] Huh. It's like
Cyrano de Bergerac.

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
Should I know that name?

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
It's a story about
falling in love

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
merely by reading letters.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
That's so sweet!

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
How does it end?

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
It's a tragedy.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
I can't believe modern girls

00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
are falling over
themselves to see this.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
Doesn't this story take
place centuries ago?

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
What's supposed to be
fresh about that? Jeepers.

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
If this weren't
for work, I'd scram.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
So Salomé is a newcomer
in her first starring role.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
Talk about a snooze.

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
I hope I can keep my
eyes open till the end.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:29.971 position:50% align:center
I'm tellin' you, chief!

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
This play is the bee's knees,
amazing, incredible!

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
The lead, Misaki,
is a revelation!

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't even
call it a performance--

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
she is Princess Salomé!
Such nuance!

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
The staging, lighting, music,
and the set dressing!

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
Flawless!

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
You've used up all of your
adjectives for the year.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
It is a must see!

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
I need to do a piece on the next
play, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> , too!

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
Misaki is playing Juliet,

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
so we'll see how
her Shakespeare is!

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
And then there's Romeo.
He'll be a gem, I'm sure.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
Get this, the boy
playin' him has blond hair!

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
And I hear he's a foreigner!

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
The Imperial Theater, huh?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
I don't have many
connections with their people.

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
No excuse. The flappers
are clamoring for it.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Welcome, Father.

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
You decided to visit.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Yes.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
The theater is taking
up so much of my time.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:30.865 position:50% align:center
I wanted to see
how things were here.

00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
You cut off most of your hair.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
It's an example of my resolve.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
Doesn't it suit me?

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.508 position:50% align:center
It does.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.344 position:50% align:center
Okimura mentioned
the play to me.

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
Congratulations on the lead.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
I appreciate it, Father.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
By the way, I thought
you might like to know.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
Maeda is coming back.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
How wonderful!

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
Does that mean his
injuries have been healed?

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
I can't say for certain,
but he must be in better shape.

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
Thank you for telling me.
I hope he's here soon.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] Dearest Mr. Maeda,
please accept these few lines.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
I had to write. It is now the
season when sunflowers

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
burn brightly against
clear blue skies.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
How have you
been feeling lately?

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
I thought I told you never
to come to my residence.

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
And here I've brought

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.781 position:50% align:center
the gift of S blood
from Yokohama.

00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
Oh?

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
That is a pleasant surprise.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] The formula still
requires adjustments.

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
But I needed a batch for the
transaction with Mr. Okimura.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
There were a few sacrifices
that couldn't be avoided.

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
The path we walk is a dark road.
The blackest of nights.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
But dawn is ahead of us.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
Who is that man?

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS sniffing]

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
How careless of you.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] That long face--
is something the matter?

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
You look like
you've just returned

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
from a run-in with the devil.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
A devil?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
You may be on to something.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Be honest with me.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:58.179 position:50% align:center
Do you think the rumors about
vampires being real are true?

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
Why do you want to know?

[MISAKI grunts]
Last night, my father--

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, no.

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
I'm going to rehearse.

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
[STAGEHANDS chatter]

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Ah. How good to see the moon!

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:35.800 position:50% align:center
She is like a
little piece of money.

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
A little silver flower.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
Yes, the moon is
cold and chaste.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
I am sure that she is a virgin.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
To kiss thy mouth.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
My lips to thy lips.

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
My words and thine.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
It is thy mouth that
I desire, Jokanaan.

00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
Now,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
bring forth this prophet!

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
[crashing]

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
[STAGEHAND 7A]
Call a doctor!

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
[STAGEHAND 7B]
She's pinned under the set!

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
[STAGEHAND 7C]
Can you move it?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
[STAGEHAND 7A]
We need more people!

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:20.345 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear Misaki.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] I wanted to
show Mr. Maeda my Salomé.

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
But...

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
I'm certain that you
will be all right, miss.

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Trust me.

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
Take her to a cell.
Tsukishima will do.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
Wouldst thou speak?
For thy voice is as wine to me.

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Please, Jokanaan.

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
I believe you have a promise
to keep for Misaki's sake.

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
At least put an end
to the unseemly events

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
your idiotic military started!

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
Rise, on your feet, human!

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
I-I... c-can't.

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
You can't leave the stage
until you have fixed this.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center
The show must go on.

00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
Play your part to the end!
