[KURUSU yells, grunts]

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
Don't hold back.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:00.662 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
But I can't.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.956 position:50% align:center
Is it because I'm a human?

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.667 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.961 position:50% align:center
That kind of softness
will get your friends killed.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.136 position:50% align:center

[KURUSU groans]

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:38.616 position:50% align:center
Shameful. You can't even
beat a normal man like me.

[UNIT MEMBER 4A] Colonel Maeda!
A body was found in Yoshiwara.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
Bitten, sir.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center
On my way.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] It's almost dawn.
Stand by for now.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.810 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] Choyaro is a
large brothel in Yoshiwara.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
You said the prostitute's
name was Otama?

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
[UNIT MEMBER 4A] That's right.
She's been missing for two days.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
We were called in because of
the discoloration of the body.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] Your orders are
to have undercover agents

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
investigate the
area around Choyaro--

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
tonight. I'll send Zero in.

[AOI]
My story!

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
I wrote about the
red-light poisoning!

Not dead alley cats.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
That story lacked drama.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
You don't know that.
What if there's more to it

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
and a forbidden love is what
sent her to the big sleep?

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.358 position:50% align:center
It wasn't me. Your piece
got killed from above.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
Just let it go.

[CHIEF EDITOR]
The military didn't want it run,

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
and I don't want them mad.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center

Sure, but--

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
Save your "buts"
for the ash tray.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
Now, get back out on the beat.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
Head to the hotel.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
As in, the new Frank
Lloyd Wright building?

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
That's right. I need
you to get in touch

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
with a cosmetics
dealer that's set to be

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
advertising a line of
British perfumes there

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
during the completion
ceremony in September.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center

Just, uh, one question, boss.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF EDITOR]
What?

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
Will the paper buy me their
roast beef... for research?

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
Please leave.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
[OKIMURA]
Don't concern yourself.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
We swept the
story under the rug.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
Apologies for the trouble.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
Don't think twice about it--

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
it's the least I can do
given your circumstances.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
I understand.
You don't make the budget.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
I'm truly sorry about the cuts.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
That's quite kind.
When might they begin?

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
Your operating costs will
be halved as of next year.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
I won't even be
able to provide my men

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
enough to feed themselves.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
[OKIMURA]
The Vampire Unit Plan is the

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
most costly expenditure
in your ledger.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
You'll have to freeze it
or end it completely.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.384 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
This isn't limited
to special forces.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
The ministry is planning to
reduce the entire military

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
by a hundred
thousand men at least.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
Does this mean that
you're abandoning the plan

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
to fold us into
the secret service?

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
Be wise. Consider this
year as your deadline.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
If you don't produce
notable results by then,

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
Special Forces Unit
Sixteen will be disbanded.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA grunts]
If it comes to that,

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
we're gonna have a big problem.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
So this is Yoshiwara.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
It's been a district
where people go

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center
to have a good time
since the Edo period.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.085 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Suwa,

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
isn't that garb a little
flashy for undercover work?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
It's normal here.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
This place is like a
playground from another world.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
Colonel, any idea where we
should focus our investigation?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
Choyaro is our main target.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
Now get in there
and find that vampire

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
before they can kill again.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
But how are we supposed
to recognize them?

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Hm?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
You can't just look at someone
and tell they're a vampire.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you
talking about, you idiot?

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
I see! Of course!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
Kurusu is the highest-ranked
vampire in Japan.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
What does that matter?

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.745 position:50% align:center
Yamagami, it's easy
for you to tell

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
that me and him are undead,
right? Now why is that?

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
You scare me.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Exactly!

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
You instinctively fear big-bad
vamps who outrank you!

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center
You should take the lead.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
See if anyone else out
here gets you all trembly.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
As the weakest person among us,

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
I'd say it's a task you're
uniquely qualified for.

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] How fortunate
that you're unranked.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
A job just for you! Great!

you're so insensitive?!

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center

treating me like a lapdog, too.

Fine! I'll find the killer!

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
Besides, a vampire
probably won't attack

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
another of their kind.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
Who gave you that false idea?

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.038 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
To a higher-ranked vampire,

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.082 position:50% align:center
you're basically human.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
A tasty treat.

Huh?! Is that how
you guys see me?

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
Please, I'm just kidding.
We're not cannibals.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Who would want
to eat you, anyway?

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't worry!

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
We've got your back
and promise we won't

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
let any more powerful

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center

in more danger staying here!

If anything happens,
call us with ultrasonic waves

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:17.896 position:50% align:center

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center

what the vial contains?

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
You could technically
call it poisoned V Virus.

It doesn't even smell good.

You're right, miss.
It has a cloying sweetness.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
Huh? The stuff stinks so bad,
my nose wants to fly away.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
Would you mind if
I kept it, then? Please.

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, that's okay.
Like I said, it's gross.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.634 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful. [chuckles]

Uh, yeah, right, so I want you
to lend me your full attention!

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
There are two roads open to you!

Number one! Stand down! Obey us,

you will receive blood and--

That's swell. You're not even
listening to me, are you?

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
Hey! If you can hear
me, say something!

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
What's the deal?
Can't you talk?!

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
Stay back!

What's wrong?

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
I heard the major talking,
but his voice was so faint!

I think prostitutes
who die of illness

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
are generally dumped at a
temple over in that direction.

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
No sane person would
venture near a place so foul.

I'm sorry. It's too late.

have any blood left.

have done if I died?
