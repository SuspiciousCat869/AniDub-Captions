[YAMAGAMI] Partially right.
When Code Zero was created,

them loose in the city

Then,

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center

Colonel Maeda doesn't know about
these vampire units either?

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Probably not.

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
Suwa and I will follow
these new arrivals

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
and observe what happens.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
The two of you should
meet up with Colonel Maeda.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
Fill him in as to what's going
on and find out what he knows.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
We should go now. Quickly!

[YAMAGAMI grunts]
Hey! Wait!

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
I see. So this is
the finished product.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
Not a bad showing, General.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.383 position:50% align:center
There are more things
in Heaven and Earth,

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
my dear Horatio,

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:04.514 position:50% align:center
than you have ever dreamt
of in your philosophy.

[OKIMURA growls]
Nakajima!

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
You orchestrated the disturbance
in Yokohama, didn't you?

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:18.903 position:50% align:center
I completed what
I set out to do.

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:21.156 position:50% align:center
I showed results on
the schedule you gave me.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
[OKIMURA] I don't care
about your freaks of nature!

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
I want to know why the hell
you had all the S-Class vampires

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
we planned to add to
our forces murdered--

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
an act that's surely
tantamount to treason!

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
I believe you'll
find my vampire units

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
are more than a match for the

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
supposed "highest
rank" you imported.

00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
Does that not prove
they are the future of war?

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
This will not stand!

[NAKAJIMA]
We shared an ideal.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
When exactly did you
lose sight of our goal?

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:55.648 position:50% align:center
I will not waver, Okimura.

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:58.443 position:50% align:center
I am not weak.
