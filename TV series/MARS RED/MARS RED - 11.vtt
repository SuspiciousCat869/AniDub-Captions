00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
like invalids,
hiding away in the dark.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Instead of seeing the world,
they stay put for centuries.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
Every year that
passes they grow more

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
exhausted of
living in this world.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
...it's different for me.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
I play many types
of people onstage.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
I'm able to feel their highs
and lows, and I've even died.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
I get to experience
what others can't.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
Perhaps that catharsis
is what keeps me sane.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
We belong in fairy tales--
we don't belong in this world.

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
This place will
continue to change.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
It's destined to grow
more modern and rational.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.766 position:50% align:center
Progress may seem
like a good thing, but...

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
...I know that the
world of the future

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
has no place for
the denizens of myth.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Hey, maybe it's me,

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
but I get the
feeling that the Ascra

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50% align:center
was mixed with the
blood from Yokohama.

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] You're talking about
the stuff in Yoshiwara, right?

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
Surprised you know about that.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Is that true?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Hm? Yeah,

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
apparently the vampire couple
we dealt with in Kayabacho

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
became so dependent
on Ascra that

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
they were willing to
do anything they could

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.125 position:50% align:center
to get their hands on it.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
Ascra turns humans
into vampires,

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
but it also turns
vampires into addicts.

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
It should be
classified as a poison.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but it can be
a medicine for us, too,

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.386 position:50% align:center
as long as we use
the right dosage.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Poison is poison.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
healing about it.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
There's a form of alchemy
that turns poison to medicine.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
I guess you've never
heard of chemistry, eh, Suwa?

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
Even the skunk balls
were created using--

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Don't mention those!

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
The very thought of their
stench makes my nose wrinkle.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
What's Ascra do that makes
vampires want it so much?

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
It gives them a feeling
of euphoria similar to

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
what they'd experience
drinking blood.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
Because human blood is so
difficult to get these days,

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
vampires began to
search out Ascra

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
as a substitute
for the real thing.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
I've never heard about that.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Of course not;

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
records buried in the dark
rarely see the light of day.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] It might not be
too hard to find them though.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you've got a point.

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center
I mean, we're all here now...

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
...in present-day Tokyo.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
If the sun rises
just a little higher,

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
my body will be
engulfed in flames

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50% align:center
and I will be burnt to ashes.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.693 position:50% align:center
However, if the
water keeps rising,

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
then it won't be
long before I drown.

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
I wonder which way I will die.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
You talk about
dying so casually.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
Probably because I've grown
tired of living in a world

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
that has no place for me.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
You really are just a child.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT grunts]
For your information,

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
I'm actually far older than you.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
People who claim they've grown
tired of living are children.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how
young or old they are.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
Now, don't you start
making trouble for me

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
just like Shutaro did.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Shutaro? I know that name.

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
Ya see, I've always
thought that life was...

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.701 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Aoi!

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.662 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Shutaro Kurusu!

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Save this woman!

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
He is calling me.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Who?

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Tsukishima.

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
Aoi's hurt!

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] If you rush out now,
you'll be burned to a crisp.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
Aoi is dying at the
Tsukishima Island base!

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
I have to go there
and save her right now!

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
That's easier said than done.

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
It's going to take a long
time to get there on foot

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
and it's daylight.

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
There's no way we could make
it without being immolated.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50% align:center
If only I could
move faster. [gasps]

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
Do you think that
this thing is ready to fly?

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
No, not a chance!

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
I haven't even done
an unmanned test run yet.

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
Which basically
means I have no idea

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
whether it'll
hold up in the air!

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
But you're making it to
help us fly, aren't you?

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.510 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Yeah, but only theoretically!

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
Then let me try it out!

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
I know it'll work, Takeuchi--
you made it!

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
While I appreciate your
confidence, I'm not so sure.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
I wouldn't attempt it.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
Besides, I don't wanna
watch you get charbroiled--

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
I'm going.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Put on some
of this improved sunblock.

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:45.195 position:50% align:center
It'll help weaken the
impact of direct sunlight,

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
at least to a degree.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Also, be aware that
heat from the sun will build up

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.871 position:50% align:center
underneath the lotion

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
and will likely cause a
chemical reaction on your skin.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] You look like one of
those vampire unit bastards.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.047 position:50% align:center
With good reason. Their
equipment makes perfect sense

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
considering it's used to protect
vamps who are out and about

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
during the daytime.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
There are downsides though.

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Covering up like that creates

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
what is essentially
a steam bath in the suit.

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
So, it's gonna be sweltering.

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Chances are you'll pass
out.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
True.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
Tsukishima's a long way from
here

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
and even with
the flight machine

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
it's highly likely
that you'll reach

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
spontaneous
combustion temperatures

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
well before you make it there.

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.612 position:50% align:center
So you're saying
it's gonna be close?

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Let's just say,
you're gonna need

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
all the fortune you can get.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
I don't normally pray, but
we probably should this time.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
You know, just to be safe.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
In that case,

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
you've got your pick of God,
Buddha, or King Enma.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
Which one will it be?

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
I'll go with all
of them, please!

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
Right then, Shutaro Kurusu
is now setting out

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
to rescue Miss Aoi Shirase!

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
Best of luck to ya.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.052 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Don't fall out of the sky.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
I won't!

00:16:58.435 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Hang on, kid.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
We'll see him off from here.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3C]
You're late, Nakajima.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
Actually, I believe
I'm right on time.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3B] Well, we've
been waiting for quite a while.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3A]
Indeed we have.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
My sincere apologies, gentlemen.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
But I must say, this was
an unexpected summons,

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
and I have a job to do
just like everyone else.

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
In any case, I hope you
can forgive me this once.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
Let's move on.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
What did you want to discuss?

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3C]
We've no further use for you,

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant General Nakajima.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3B] It would appear
the vampire disturbance

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
is too much for
you to handle, sir.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
I don't understand, gentlemen.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
Is there a problem with my
vampire units' performance?

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3C] But they're
not really your vampire units,

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
are they?

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
We've been made
aware of the fact

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
that you are not the person
who's been in command of them.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.080 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3A]
Exactly.

00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3C] I've heard it's
actually an extremely clever,

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
young British man
named Rufus Glenn.

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3B] We've thought
long and hard about this,

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
and we've decided that you
should step down immediately

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
--and transfer all authority...

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
--[RUFUS] ...all authority over
--and transfer all authority...

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
--[RUFUS]  to him.
    

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:17.222 position:50% align:center
--[RUFUS cackling]
--[NAKAJIMA gasps]

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
I see. So you've wavered, too?

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
If there's one thing you
should know about me by now,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
it's that I never waver, sir.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
On the contrary,

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
I've remained steadfast
since the very beginning.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS as OFFICER 3B] I hate
to be the bearer of bad news,

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
Nakajima, but your
work here is...

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
...done.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
Surely you can see by now...

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
...a mere human could never
compete with Rufus Glenn!

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] It won't be
long before I'm king.

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
You may watch my ascension
from someplace more quiet.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:58.763 position:50% align:center
As the saying goes, "They all
lived happily ever after."

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time,

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
I, too, had a family of my
own whom I cared for deeply.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
I had a father, a mother,
a little brother.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
But I'm the only one
who ended up like this.

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
You know, the person
who made me a vampire

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
stopped drinking blood
after I changed.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
She felt so much guilt
for what she'd done,

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
she couldn't bear
to taste it again.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] I've met many
vampires through the years,

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
but she's the only one
I know who died of starvation.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
I offered her blood countless
times, but she'd never drink it.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
And then, as she was dying,
she looked up and smiled.

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:51.399 position:50% align:center
She quietly whispered,
"I'm already full."

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT sighs] I wish
I knew why we're still alive.

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Hm?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
What the--? What is that?

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Aoi!

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT gasps]

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.100 position:50% align:center
Aoi!

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
She's still alive,

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center
but I'm afraid she's lost
a dangerous amount of blood.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
You must get her
out of here quickly.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:37.654 position:50% align:center
I'll do that.

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
And you?

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:41.533 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine here. I can
manage as long as the clouds

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
continue to hide the sun's rays.

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
You sure?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:49.082 position:50% align:center
Please take care of Juliet.
Okay, Romeo?

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
Never mind me,
just take the girl and go.

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Best of luck.

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT laughs]
What an odd turn of events.

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
He really is flying!

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
It's ridiculous, but also like
something out of a fairy tale.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT chuckles]

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
I hope you're ready, Rufus.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
It's time for act two.

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Aoi.

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
I will save you.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.527 position:50% align:center
I'll protect you no matter what!

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
Oh, Shutaro.

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:03.365 position:50% align:center
Do you promise?

00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Yes. I promise.
