00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.325 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Let's see. Gotta work
on the Imperial Hotel piece

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.952 position:50% align:center
before construction's finished.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:00.829 position:50% align:center
Then there's human combustion.

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.997 position:50% align:center
The Yoshiwara poisoning.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.375 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Oh. And the picture
that I saw with Defrott!

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.377 position:50% align:center
So much to do.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.466 position:50% align:center
Jeepers, why'd the sky turn red?

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.927 position:50% align:center
Um, hi?

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center
Mister?

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:17.679 position:50% align:center
[snarls]

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:18.555 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.056 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE 6A groans]

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.475 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:27.564 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:38.491 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Wha... What's going on?

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Ahh.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.580 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
What?

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] It kind of feels like
we're walking around in circles.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Don't say that!

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center
Didn't Takeuchi give
you specific directions?

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] Well, yeah,
but this horrible smell

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.591 position:50% align:center
and the constant echoing
got me a little confused.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.344 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] Might be a
good idea to peek outside

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.928 position:50% align:center
and see where we are.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.181 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] Only if you
want to go up in flames.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50% align:center
The sun should be up by now.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
Let's keep going.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
I think we'll be fine.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
I wish that mad scientist

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
had thought of a better way
for us to get back to HQ.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] We're just lucky
the sewers are empty

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
and take us the whole way.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.198 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] I'd rather be
chasing after those soldiers.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
The vampire units?

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Obviously.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
[lighter clicks]

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
Their movements
appeared perfectly synchronized.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.375 position:50% align:center
That much coordination
takes discipline.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
Don't you wanna know
where they're from

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
and who trained them?

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
I do have a lot of questions.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
They didn't look
like they had a leader.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] We work as a team

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.303 position:50% align:center
because we have Colonel Maeda
giving us orders.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.513 position:50% align:center
But as far as I could tell,

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
they didn't have
a commanding officer.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
Well, if that is the case,

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
they're trained even better
than I initially thought.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
My dear vampire units,

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
you are doubtless this
old man's pride and joy.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] I knew
Lieutenant General Nakajima

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
was up to something fishy.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Where did he
get so many of them?

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
That's the question of the hour.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
Counting these upright coffins,
I'd say there's about 80.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed and jealous.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] He went through the
trouble of making nametags.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
No effort spared.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] And it looks like
there's room for more.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
I would look closer at him.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
I... I would speak with him.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA] That's odd.
Where is her voice coming from?

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.206 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
I am Salomé...

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Getting this?

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
It's recording.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] Ah, speak again.
Please, Jokanaan.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
Once more!

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
My. She's a fine Salomé.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
I apologize I kept you waiting.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
Let's hear it.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
What did you think
of my production?

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
It was a pitiful
three-penny play

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
that quickly went off the rails.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
And numerous civilians were
injured by those vampires.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.983 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] Every undertaking
requires a few sacrifices.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
Besides, don't forget--

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.405 position:50% align:center
you need a trumpeter to make
your toy soldiers march.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
I merely hope that you do not

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
become the trumpeter who
signals the end of the world.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.162 position:50% align:center
Revelation.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
How delightful.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
I'll face more backlash...

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
...but this is the way.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] I have other
things to attend to.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
Use this place as you see fit.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
It's dark, even in daytime.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
You're too kind.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
I wonder what beast was able to

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
destroy a prison
like this so thoroughly.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
It matters not.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
As a starting point to my plan,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
this isn't bad.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Okay. This is
the Imperial Hotel,

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
that's human combustion,

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
that's Yoshiwara,
and these are, um...

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
Heya, Boss?

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
What are you workin' on here?

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
A hot story about Yokohama.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
I'm heading there now.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
Got a scoop?

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
Sounds like there was
some kind of a riot

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
near the Red Brick Warehouse.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
I hear it went so sour
the military was called in.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's news to me.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
People are spreading
hysterical rumors

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
that vampires were
to blame for it.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
D'you say vampires?!

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
The chumps.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
[AOI grunts]
No way am I missing this.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
It's just a load of nonsense!

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
There's no such
thing as vampires.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
Besides, don't you
have other work to do?

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
Hotel construction's ramping up.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
I want that article
on my desk yesterday.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
Fine!

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO yelps]

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter
with you, Santaro?

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello, Shinnosuke.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
Those damn rats surprised me!

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
Rats you say?

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO groans]

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
I don't see any.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Good grief what a mess.

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
Morning dawn's blood red
and before long,

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
there's a grand procession
of rodents in the street.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
Think I need a stiff
drink and a long sleep.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA] There are plenty
more hours of light, you know.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO chuckles]
The sun can't get into my house.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
I'll pretend it's night.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO groans]
There we go!

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:36.122 position:50% align:center
Well, then, see you later.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
So bright. Looks like
another scorching day.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI sighs]
It's about time.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
I couldn't take much
more of that sewer stench.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
And now we know where
this door leads to!

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
Strange.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
Huh... Doesn't this
place feel different

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
than it normally does to you?

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] How so? I don't
think anything's changed.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] It's too quiet.
There should be more noises.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
Noises?

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
I can usually hear footsteps
and people talking.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
But it's almost like
the building's dead now.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm just
a common, unranked vamp.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
I can't hear everything you
can with your fancy ears.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
True. I apologize.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Forget it. Let's head up.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.384 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Okay.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
One more time.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
Imperial Hotel takes priority,

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.275 position:50% align:center
then I've got human combustion,

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
the Yoshiwara poisoning,

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
and, uh, there's something else.

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Why's it still
so hot in September?

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
Don't start complainin'
'cause when you do

What's inside?

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF EDITOR]
Vampires!

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
That's the truth
behind the Yokohama mob!

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
Everyone bitten turned into
an undead monster and rioted!

You know, that Yoshiwara
incident could be related.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
And it would explain people
goin' up in flames, too!

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
That does it.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
From now on, this rag is

First, we research.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
How?

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.071 position:50% align:center
Get the book.

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
Maeda, are you sure
you're fully recovered?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
I'm well enough.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
So glad to hear that.
We were worried, sir!

00:09:58.515 --> 00:09:59.599 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
They said you had
severe heart trouble.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.144 position:50% align:center
Surely you need more rest.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
It's my body and what I do with
it is frankly not your concern.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Now give me an update.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center
Were there any S-classes?

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
But by the time we crossed
the water and infiltrated,

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
every last one of them was dead,

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
as in dead-dead.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
Who could've killed them?

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.910 position:50% align:center
We have no idea.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Are you telling me you returned

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.539 position:50% align:center
without finding out the details?

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, sir.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
We had no time to investigate.

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
A mob of hostile
unranked vampires appeared

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
and started attacking
the townspeople;

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
it was chaos in the streets.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
And I take it you subdued
these enemies by yourselves?

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
No, the vampire units came and--

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Who was
leading those men?

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
I wasn't able
to figure that out.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
And the Lieutenant General?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
We came back to find him and
try to make sense of things.

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU gasps]

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
That's a Model T engine.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess,
I'd bet it's him.

[NAKAJIMA] Report, Maeda--
how are you feeling?

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
You needn't worry, sir.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
I see.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
In that case,
return to your work.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
Everyone is waiting for you.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant General, sir?

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
I have some questions.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
Well then, let's
hear what they are.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] The group of soldiers
on the train in Yokohama--

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
who are they exactly?

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
They're vampire units.

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
Then, does that mean
they've been perfected?

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] There's
still room for improvement.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
However,

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
they are quickly turning into
the mighty force I envisioned.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.
Who are these soldiers?

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
They're our new vampire
units as I said before.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
I understand that,

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
but how did you suddenly
find so many of them?

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
Careful with your tone.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
I don't mind, Yamagami.
He's still a young man.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
Also...

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
...a vampire.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
Common sense
hardly applies to him.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
Kurusu.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Sir.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
Why don't you tell
me what exactly

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
you know about vampire
units before we go on?

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
They use their powers

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.745 position:50% align:center
to complete special
forces missions--

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
mostly hunting vampires.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
When targets are discovered,

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
they're either
secured or eliminated.

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
You are correct.
That is their main purpose.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Have you heard of the
military intelligence squads

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.467 position:50% align:center
that rely on vampires
for covert operations?

00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
Britain's is the
most well known.

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
They gave us the idea
for the vampire unit plan.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Yes, sir.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] And do
you know why I wanted

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
to establish a force
like that in Japan?

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.356 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
It's simple.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
I did not want to
see another of our men

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
murdered on the
battlefield ever again.

00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
So I concluded that in order to
save the lives of our soldiers,

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:05.035 position:50% align:center
they needed to
possess immortal bodies.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
Or practically immortal.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
It may seem brash,

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
but time moves
quickly in this world.

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
The vampire unit plan
must be constantly evolving

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:19.215 position:50% align:center
just as swiftly in order
to achieve my goal.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
It's obvious that finding
and recruiting vampires

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
off the streets, as we
have done in the past,

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
is already an outdated method
of increasing our ranks.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
So I changed tactics
and decided to focus on

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
efficiently manufacturing
vampires instead.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
You made them?

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant General! What do you
mean when you say manufacturing?

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.195 position:50% align:center
I mean that
I successfully found a way

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.864 position:50% align:center
to create new vampires for us...

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
...using this: Ascra.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
Combining our research

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
with that of the
man behind Ascra,

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
we concocted a way to safely
turn humans into vampires.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.378 position:50% align:center
The process is nearly flawless.

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
This is truly
the fruit of wisdom.

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
And by using this on
my highly capable men,

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
I create my own vampire units.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
Then the soldiers we saw
in Yokohama were our peers?

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
You went and turned the entirety
of Special Forces Unit Sixteen

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
into vampires?!

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
What I did, soldier,

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
was give the gift of virtual
immortality to your brethren.

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
At this point, you're
the only human among them.

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
No, sir! Don't!

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] My life has belonged to
Lieutenant General Nakajima

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
since the moment he saved
it on the battlefield.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
I live for his cause.
This is my duty.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your zeal, Maeda.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
Once you become a vampire unit,

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
my ideal force will
be completed at last.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.767 position:50% align:center
There is... one problem.

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
And what is that?

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
It's Misaki.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
Your daughter
asked me to stop you.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] Her concerns about
you were recorded in a letter

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
that she wrote to me
while becoming a vampire.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] I'm amazed
she regained consciousness

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
and took action in such a state.

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
What a regrettable loss.

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
True, Misaki was my daughter,

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
but she was always
distant somehow.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
You two were supposed to marry
and support me together one day,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
but...

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:26.384 position:50% align:center
All of that is in the past.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
Besides, you're different, yes?

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
You know how much passion

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
I've poured into the
vampire unit plan

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
and how many young men
it will eventually save.

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
What a farce.

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
To hear such
protests from someone

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
already gifted with a
nigh-indestructible body.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant General,
this is despicable.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
You're probably right.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
But if I hadn't made
my choice and acted,

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
Japan would have continued to
wander down the incorrect path.

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
It would've become
a worthless country

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
where vapid old men
line their pockets,

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
whose wealth and status is

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
supported by the
sacrifice of young lives.

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Yamagami, is that the
homeland you wish to fight for?

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
You must have witnessed
this in Siberia.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:35.203 position:50% align:center
It was the youngest and
newest soldiers who were slain.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:38.415 position:50% align:center
The ministry shrugged and said
the expedition was a mistake.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
With those words,
the people in power dismissed

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
every man they led
to the slaughter.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
I will not let this
country rot on the vine.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
I want to make a world
where people can smile

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
and speak of the future
with anticipation.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
That doesn't justify sacrificing
the humanity of our comrades!

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
They didn't become
sacrifices, you imbecile.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
I turned your peers into heroes.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI grunts]

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
This won't do.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
I'm going to be late for lunch
with the new chief secretary.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.658 position:50% align:center
Maeda, I leave the rest to you.

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
They're your men
to command as always.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Oh, no, you don't--

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI groans]

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI groans]

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
Yamagami!

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
Move and I'll stop you as well!

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU gasps]
Maeda, please.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
I salute you, future generals.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
For Japan!

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
[BOYS laugh]

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.844 position:50% align:center
Maeda, no. Don't do this.

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
We're all friends
down here, aren't we?

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
Keep your damn
mouth shut, vampire!

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.434 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Tell me one thing.

00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Hm?

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.772 position:50% align:center
When did you become
like this, huh, boss?

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
I haven't changed.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
It's not right.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
Nakajima sees nothing except
for his foolish dream.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
He stole the future away from

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
each of those
special forces soldiers.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI groans]

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
While we struggle desperately

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
to cling to humanity
as best we can.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
He's asking you
and his soldiers

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
to give up everything
we wish we still had.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

Kurusu!

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
Maeda, get outta here!

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA gasps]

[YAMAGAMI muffled]
Maeda, sir?

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] Yamagami?

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
You all right?

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] Yeah.
Hell of an earthquake though.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
If I weren't a
vampire, I'd be dead.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
You?

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Can't make much of things.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.250 position:50% align:center
It's too dark.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] I think
you're behind this debris.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
I'll get you out soon.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Don't cause a collapse.

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
Good. You're still alive!

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
As if I'd let that kill me.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.221 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Got a light?

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
My arm is stuck.

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Hang on.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI gasps]

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
That hits the spot.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
I'll get you out now.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
One second!

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Yamagami.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
What?

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Let's go for a drink, just us.

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
Where'd that idea come from?

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
Actually, wait.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
You were always more of
a tempura man, weren't you?

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
Be wasted on me now.

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] There's something I...
want to apologize for.

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
When we were at Ichigaya,

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
someone stole your belt once
You remember that happening?

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Ended up getting my
ass whooped by my S.O.

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm the one
who took it from you.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
You're kidding me!

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.532 position:50% align:center
You were an
intellectual,

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
but you could always
be duped pretty easily.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] Nothing good
comes of being around you.

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
[sighs] You got that right.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI groans]

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
Yamagami?

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI groans] If I weren't
a vamp, I'd be a pancake.

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:12.230 position:50% align:center
Good thing, then.

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
Just this one left.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] Wait.

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:20.238 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI groaning]

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
It looks hot outside.

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.369 position:50% align:center
Stop it, you idiot!

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:30.081 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] Listen, Maeda,
take care of Kurusu for me.

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
He's a good kid.

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
Soldier! Drop that!

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Also, about that belt--

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
I actually stole it off
somebody else first.

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
Don't do this!

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.180 position:50% align:center
Tempura... sounds really nice.

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
