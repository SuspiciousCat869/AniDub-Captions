[MISAKI]
Ah. How good to see the moon!

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:26.417 align:middle
She is like a little piece of
money. A little silver flower.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.833 align:middle
Yes, the moon is
cold and chaste.

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:33.125 align:middle
I am sure that she is a virgin.

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:39.958 align:middle
The Lord hath arrived.
The son of man is now with us.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.042 align:middle
Who was that who cried out?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.875 align:middle
Twas merely the voice
of the prophet, Princess.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.042 align:middle
Ah, the prophet!

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.208 align:middle
He of whom the
Tetrarch is afraid?

00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:51.625 align:middle
It is thy mouth.

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:53.292 align:middle
To kiss thy mouth.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.417 align:middle
My lips to thy lips.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.167 align:middle
My words and thine.

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:02.042 align:middle
Won't you please be
my co-star, mister?

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle
I'd like that.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:12.625 align:middle
[footsteps]

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.333 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Major Yoshinobu Maeda, yes?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.167 align:middle
And you are?

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle
Moriyama, Special
Forces Unit Sixteen.

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:50.125 align:middle
Lieutenant General
Nakajima sent me

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:52.833 align:middle
to see to your things
and accompany you today.

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:54.125 align:middle
If we're going
to headquarters,

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:55.875 align:middle
I can easily walk from here.

00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.292 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] We have a
different initial destination.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:00.958 align:middle
I'm to take you to
Tsukishima Island.

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:02.875 align:middle
What's there?

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.917 align:middle
[MAEDA] They can't
swim across the water.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.583 align:middle
Makes a good prison.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:16.667 align:middle
Who's the vampire?

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] An actress
from the Imperial Theater.

00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:20.958 align:middle
Six days ago she was involved

00:04:21.042 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle
in what should have been
fatal injuries onstage,

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.042 align:middle
but survived.

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle
Special forces were
called in after that.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:28.958 align:middle
The Lieutenant
General gave the order

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:31.917 align:middle
to keep her alive
and in custody.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.083 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Her symptoms?

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:35.167 align:middle
We're still awaiting
confirmation, sir.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.208 align:middle
Mental state?

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:39.167 align:middle
Conversation is
sometimes possible.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle
[MAEDA] Can we bring
her over to our side?

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:42.417 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
That decision is

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.625 align:middle
entirely at your
discretion, Major.

00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:47.042 align:middle
Understood.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.833 align:middle
Well, it's certainly deep.

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:52.958 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] I'm told it can
be flooded in an emergency.

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:56.917 align:middle
You've been away for six months.
Does Tokyo feel different?

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.833 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
The Imperial Hotel renovations

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:01.625 align:middle
will be finished this summer.

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:04.917 align:middle
Wouldn't you love a night in
a first-class joint like that?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.042 align:middle
Moriyama.

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:07.542 align:middle
What can I do for you, sir?

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.208 align:middle
You're awfully talkative
for a special-forces man.

00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:13.375 align:middle
Uh, yeah, sorry. My wife
always says the same thing.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle
Thinks I need to be more mindful

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.292 align:middle
of my words since
I'm a born talker.

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:19.125 align:middle
[MAEDA]
So you're a married man.

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:22.542 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] Only recently.
Our wedding was in the spring.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:25.167 align:middle
We were childhood friends.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle
A newlywed, huh?

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.125 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
It's only been three months,

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:31.083 align:middle
but my folks are
already pestering us

00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:32.583 align:middle
to give them grandkids.

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:34.583 align:middle
Are you single, Major?

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:38.292 align:middle
I have a fiancée, but
I've never met her in person.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.708 align:middle
[MAEDA]
More stairs. Swell.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.708 align:middle
Are you ready, Major?

00:06:04.792 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle
Open the door.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:31.792 align:middle
Look up to the glass.

00:06:41.208 --> 00:06:42.542 align:middle
What did you send?

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:44.167 align:middle
It's the play she was in.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle
I was ordered to give her things
from before her infection.

00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.833 align:middle
[MISAKI]
What a strange voice!

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:51.958 align:middle
I would look closer at him.

00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:53.375 align:middle
I...

00:06:53.458 --> 00:06:55.292 align:middle
I would speak with him.

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle
That's odd. Where is
her voice coming from?

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:00.167 align:middle
Getting this?

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.583 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
It's recording.

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:05.875 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:11.167 align:middle
Ah, speak again.
Please, Jokanaan.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.250 align:middle
Once more!

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:14.125 align:middle
[MAEDA grunts]

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:22.625 align:middle
[MISAKI]
Ah. How good to see the moon!

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:28.583 align:middle
She is like a little
piece of money.

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:31.542 align:middle
A little silver flower.

00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle
Yes, the moon is
cold and chaste.

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:38.833 align:middle
I am sure that she is a virgin.

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:45.708 align:middle
The Lord hath arrived.
The son of man is now with us.

00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle
Who was that who cried out?

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle
Twas merely the voice
of the prophet, Princess.

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:55.375 align:middle
The prophet! He of whom
the Tetrarch is afraid?

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:57.083 align:middle
It is thy mouth.

00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:59.583 align:middle
[OKIMURA] Ever since our
victories in the Great War,

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:01.833 align:middle
we've seen Western
technology and culture

00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:04.583 align:middle
steadily adopted
into Japanese society.

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.792 align:middle
Our navy's fond of boasting
that it's invincible.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.333 align:middle
I won't say otherwise,
however...

00:08:10.417 --> 00:08:12.917 align:middle
All who prosper will fall.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle
That's fast becoming your
favored phrase, Okimura.

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:20.042 align:middle
I have high hopes for your
vampire unit plan, Nakajima,

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.042 align:middle
and look forward
to seeing it succeed.

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:24.792 align:middle
Wise to borrow a secret
tactic from the British.

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle
I like the way your mind works.

00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:28.917 align:middle
Still...

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.917 align:middle
I may be the secretary, but
even I can't convince a cabinet

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.125 align:middle
leaning toward arms
reduction to support you

00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:37.208 align:middle
if you don't
produce results soon.

00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle
That's a shame and a problem.

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:45.583 align:middle
[MISAKI] Jokanaan, thou wert
the only man that I have loved.

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:48.125 align:middle
All other men are hateful to me.

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:52.458 align:middle
But thou... Thou wert beautiful!

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.708 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle
[phone rings]

00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:08.792 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] Major Maeda.

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:11.292 align:middle
The Lieutenant General is
waiting for you sir.

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:13.667 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Let's go.

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.167 align:middle
[MISAKI]
I'm waiting, too.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.167 align:middle
Thine eyes that
were so terrible,

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.125 align:middle
full of rage and scorn.

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.583 align:middle
Wherefore are they shut?

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.542 align:middle
Art thou afraid of me?

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:30.208 align:middle
Thy tongue...

00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:31.417 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Moriyama.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.125 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Yes, Major?

00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:35.375 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Your assessment?

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.542 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
I'm not sure.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.958 align:middle
I've never actually
seen the real thing.

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:42.583 align:middle
[MAEDA] She has
a stigmata on her tongue.

00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle
They appear at the
point of infection.

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:48.083 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] That may be,
but does being turned

00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:51.208 align:middle
automatically
make her our enemy?

00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:54.333 align:middle
Hard to believe it's
so black and white.

00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:57.792 align:middle
[exhales] I was the same
as you in the beginning.

00:09:57.875 --> 00:10:01.375 align:middle
Every vampire has the potential
to become our enemy, though.

00:10:01.458 --> 00:10:04.375 align:middle
If we waver, we could
end up like them.

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:07.042 align:middle
We must protect our humanity.

00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle
Here with Major Maeda,
Special Forces.

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:27.875 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Major Maeda, reporting.

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.292 align:middle
[door closes]

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle
Lieutenant General,

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.958 align:middle
I've returned to Special
Forces Unit Sixteen.

00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:36.375 align:middle
Apologies for calling you back
to active duty three days early.

00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:38.833 align:middle
So tell me, how's
the arm treating you?

00:10:38.917 --> 00:10:39.958 align:middle
It works fine.

00:10:40.042 --> 00:10:42.292 align:middle
[NAKAJIMA]
Good. And Tsukishima?

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.917 align:middle
As far as I can judge
from our observation,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.708 align:middle
her vital functions
ceased due to the accident.

00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:48.833 align:middle
Given that her memories are

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:51.083 align:middle
stuck in the moment
of her near-death,

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:53.583 align:middle
she was likely infected
shortly thereafter.

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:56.417 align:middle
Will she be of use to us?
A new recruit?

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.875 align:middle
Communication's sparse.

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.792 align:middle
And if we attempt to
train her as an agent,

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:02.333 align:middle
I believe we would fail.

00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:05.208 align:middle
We'll dispose of her, then.

00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:08.458 align:middle
We could... if you command.

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:11.458 align:middle
Mind that pity doesn't
cloud your judgment, Maeda.

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:14.292 align:middle
Sir, you needn't worry about it.

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:15.917 align:middle
[NAKAJIMA]
She's an extremely rare specimen

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.333 align:middle
of the highest rank, but if
she can't be of service...

00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:23.083 align:middle
The highest rank? Then, she
was infected by no commoner.

00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle
Yes, someone older.

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:27.917 align:middle
An ancient dweller of the
night must be responsible.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.875 align:middle
Looking at reports,
it seems we've had many

00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.333 align:middle
unconfirmed instances of
vampires attacking humans.

00:11:33.417 --> 00:11:34.958 align:middle
[MAEDA]
The victims?

00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:37.375 align:middle
[NAKAJIMA] Three of them. Two
were found dead from poisoning.

00:11:37.458 --> 00:11:39.917 align:middle
The last one is
on Tsukishima Island.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle
Ah, I see. She's our only lead.

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:44.875 align:middle
Will you mobilize Zero now?

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.292 align:middle
Not yet. I'll have another
team search during the day.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.667 align:middle
We don't want to
spoil our one chance.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.125 align:middle
I'll begin by identifying where
the vamp was initially infected.

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:56.708 align:middle
I leave the Tsukishima
issue entirely to you.

00:11:56.792 --> 00:11:59.167 align:middle
Should you judge
her unnecessary...

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.958 align:middle
I'll take action
immediately, sir.

00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:05.083 align:middle
Good. I'm counting on you.

00:12:05.167 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle
And thy tongue, that was like
a red snake darting poison,

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:12.583 align:middle
it moves no more.

00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle
I will kiss thy mouth,
Jokanaan, as I said.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.208 align:middle
[MORIYAMA] Special Forces
Unit Sixteen will search

00:12:20.292 --> 00:12:22.292 align:middle
for the suspect
currently hiding in Tokyo.

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.417 align:middle
You are to discover the
place where they're holed up.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.667 align:middle
Do not engage. The task
force will handle them.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.792 align:middle
You already know
your assigned areas. Go!

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.625 align:middle
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:34.167 align:middle
And what of us, Major?

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.667 align:middle
We'll question the
vampire on Tsukishima.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.208 align:middle
Yes, sir.

00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle
[MISAKI]
How good to see the moon!

00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:47.792 align:middle
[MISAKI] She is like...
a little silver flower.

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:50.333 align:middle
She is cold and chaste.

00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:53.167 align:middle
I am sure that she is a virgin.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.375 align:middle
Who was that who cried out?

00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:59.125 align:middle
The prophet! He of whom
the Tetrarch is afraid?

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:00.917 align:middle
It is thy mouth.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.417 align:middle
To kiss thy mouth.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle
My lips to thy lips.

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:07.458 align:middle
What cute handwriting.

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:09.542 align:middle
[MAEDA grunts]

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:10.833 align:middle
[door opens]

00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:12.458 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Excuse me!

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.208 align:middle
[MAEDA]
What is it?

00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:18.292 align:middle
I just need your signature
on these documents, please.

00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle
Also, it's time for the
special forces unit training.

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:24.583 align:middle
First, I have another stop.

00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:25.875 align:middle
Where to, sir?

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle
The Imperial Theater.

00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:30.542 align:middle
[MISAKI]
Take care!

00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:34.125 align:middle
Now, bring forth this prophet!

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:37.875 align:middle
[MAEDA grunts]

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.583 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Hmm.

00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:19.958 align:middle
[DEFROTT] Good sir, I'm afraid
this performance has closed.

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:26.792 align:middle
I can see that.

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:29.917 align:middle
The end of a play is
the end of a dream, I'd say.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.167 align:middle
When the curtain falls,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.083 align:middle
the audience exits the
doors of the underworld

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:36.625 align:middle
and returns to reality.

00:14:36.708 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle
Go now, but do take care
not to leave your heart behind.

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:42.958 align:middle
Well, you certainly have
a way with words.

00:14:43.042 --> 00:14:44.292 align:middle
I'm an actor.

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.417 align:middle
Enticing speeches
are my speciality.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.583 align:middle
What's your name?

00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:51.875 align:middle
[DEFROTT, MISAKI]
Jokanaan.

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.833 align:middle
The prophet in <i>Salomé</i> ?

00:14:53.917 --> 00:14:55.417 align:middle
[DEFROTT]
You know your dramas!

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.667 align:middle
Well, then, I'm actually
Defrott, an actor employed here.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.583 align:middle
There was an accident.
An actress was gravely injured.

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:06.375 align:middle
Are you with the police?
You don't look like a reporter.

00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:08.333 align:middle
Something like that.

00:15:08.417 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle
It was a tragedy.

00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:12.417 align:middle
A large set piece fell
directly on top of the actress

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.833 align:middle
in the middle of
an evening rehearsal.

00:15:14.917 --> 00:15:17.542 align:middle
She was our Salomé.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.083 align:middle
Yes, I know.

00:15:19.167 --> 00:15:23.417 align:middle
Oh. Well in that case, there's
nothing else I can tell you.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.833 align:middle
Wait, perhaps there's
one more thing.

00:15:26.917 --> 00:15:30.667 align:middle
She was terribly excited to
show her Salomé to someone.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.417 align:middle
The man she loved.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.125 align:middle
So sad. If only he'd come
back a little bit sooner,

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:38.417 align:middle
she would have had her wish.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.458 align:middle
Excuse me.

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle
[MISAKI]
I must leave.

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:02.708 align:middle
[AOI] 'Scuse me, mister,
do you work here?

00:16:02.792 --> 00:16:04.958 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Misaki?

00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:08.792 align:middle
[AOI chuckles]
I get that a lot!

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:11.792 align:middle
People who saw the play
do say I look like her.

00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:13.833 align:middle
Say, could you get
me into the theater?

00:16:13.917 --> 00:16:15.583 align:middle
I'd really appreciate it.

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:16.417 align:middle
[MAEDA]
No.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.083 align:middle
I figured. Well, rats.

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:22.042 align:middle
Oh! I'm Aoi Shirase,
reporter with the Nitto News.

00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:23.417 align:middle
Would ya let me
know if you have any

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.042 align:middle
interesting leads on stories?

00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:27.542 align:middle
Not a chance. Goodbye.

00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:30.958 align:middle
Jeez, mister! You could
stand to be a little nicer!

00:16:31.042 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle
[horn sounds]

00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:36.167 align:middle
Major! The vamp escaped!

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle
Put station lookouts
in Formation I.

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:58.542 align:middle
Keep watch of the streets
from Kojimachi to Kyobashi.

00:16:58.625 --> 00:17:01.208 align:middle
Find the suspect, then follow.

00:17:01.292 --> 00:17:03.542 align:middle
Don't apprehend her.
Wait for my order.

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle
[MORIYAMA]
Understood.

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:06.417 align:middle
How good to see the moon!

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.667 align:middle
She is like a little
piece of money.

00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:20.917 align:middle
[MISAKI snarls]

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.083 align:middle
Wouldst thou speak
again, please, Jokanaan?

00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:27.333 align:middle
Thy voice is wine to me.

00:17:27.417 --> 00:17:28.542 align:middle
Dulcet words.

00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle
Thy voice is as
music to mine ear.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle
All that thou asketh,
I will give thee.

00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:40.875 align:middle
I will give thee all that is
mine, save but one life.

00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.583 align:middle
[MISAKI]
Ah, the prophet!

00:17:42.667 --> 00:17:45.458 align:middle
He of whom the
Tetrarch is afraid?

00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:51.375 align:middle
[MISAKI gasps] It is thy mouth.
I desire to speak to thee.

00:17:51.458 --> 00:17:54.333 align:middle
To kiss thy mouth.

00:17:54.417 --> 00:17:56.792 align:middle
My lips to thy lips.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.292 align:middle
My words and thine.

00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:02.458 align:middle
It is thy mouth
that I desire, Jokanaan.

00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:07.958 align:middle
Where are you?

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.667 align:middle
The men've all suffered
surface injuries,

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.125 align:middle
but their lives
aren't in danger, sir.

00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:14.375 align:middle
We've received word;
enemy's been sighted.

00:18:14.458 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle
She's near Shinohashi district.

00:18:16.333 --> 00:18:18.333 align:middle
She'll continue
activity until dawn.

00:18:18.417 --> 00:18:21.542 align:middle
Limit the search area
to east of Tokyo Station.

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:23.375 align:middle
Yes, sir!

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle
[MAEDA] Yoshinobu Maeda,
there are two roads open to you.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.083 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle
It's you.

00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:48.417 align:middle
Ah, thou wouldst not
suffer me to kiss thy mouth.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.917 align:middle
Well, Jokanaan.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.625 align:middle
I will kiss it now,
and show my love

00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:53.708 align:middle
with my teeth,

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:56.792 align:middle
as one would bite
into a ripe fruit.

00:19:56.875 --> 00:19:58.583 align:middle
Thine eyes that
were so terrible,

00:19:58.667 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle
so full of rage and
scorn, are shut now.

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:02.625 align:middle
Wherefore are they shut?

00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:04.917 align:middle
Art thou afraid of me?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle
Thy tongue, that was like
a red snake darting poison,

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle
it moves no more.

00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:16.292 align:middle
And thy head belongs to me.
I can do with it what I will.

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:20.333 align:middle
Jokanaan, thou wert the
only man that I have loved.

00:20:20.417 --> 00:20:26.167 align:middle
All other men are hateful to me.
Ah, but thou wert beautiful!

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.208 align:middle
[MAEDA gasps]

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle
Why hello, there. I'm Misaki.

00:20:37.583 --> 00:20:42.042 align:middle
I've wanted to meet you
for such a long time.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.208 align:middle
[MAEDA gasps]

00:20:54.292 --> 00:20:56.625 align:middle
[MISAKI] I'm thrilled
you're as I imagined.

00:20:56.708 --> 00:20:58.833 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Misaki!

00:20:58.917 --> 00:21:03.292 align:middle
I wish that we'd kissed.

00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:28.667 align:middle
[DEFROTT]
And then, beautiful Salomé

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.583 align:middle
was put to death under
orders of the Tetrarch.

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:38.083 align:middle
[MAEDA] The vampire was
incinerated by sunlight

00:21:38.167 --> 00:21:40.708 align:middle
in Marunouchi Plaza
at Tokyo Station.

00:21:40.792 --> 00:21:42.875 align:middle
I can confirm there's
nothing left of her.

00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:47.708 align:middle
You did excellent work.
Now, a reward.

00:21:47.792 --> 00:21:49.125 align:middle
Major Yoshinobu Maeda,

00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:52.625 align:middle
you are hereby
promoted two full ranks.

00:21:52.708 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle
You are to assume command of

00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:58.542 align:middle
Special Forces Unit Sixteen,
also known as Code Zero.

00:21:58.625 --> 00:22:00.917 align:middle
Your mission is the
apprehension or disposal

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.208 align:middle
of vampires hiding in Japan.

00:22:03.292 --> 00:22:06.625 align:middle
You need not repeat
that. Understand?

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.333 align:middle
Colonel Maeda,
reporting for duty, sir.
