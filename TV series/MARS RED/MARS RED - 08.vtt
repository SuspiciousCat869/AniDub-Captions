00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center

But who could that be?

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
This man, did he maybe tell you
his name or his unit number?

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
He didn't even speak.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center
Although, he was wearing
a uniform like yours.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
But he wore his cap low,
so it covered his eyes.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:16.324 position:50% align:center
That prevented me from getting
a good look at his face.

Only one side of the track
is completed thus far,

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.889 position:50% align:center
so it won't be fully
operational for quite some time.

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
The subway.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it goes
to Tsukishima Island.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] May I ask what
we're here to investigate?

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Yes, I'm surprised
you didn't ask sooner.

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:13.653 position:50% align:center
Do you recall the young
master mentioning

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
registration papers
back at the Asakusa shop?

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] Vaguely. Doesn't
Mr. Tenmanya manage them?

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Unfortunately, we're
unable to provide every vampire

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
we meet with a
safe place to live.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
The majority adapt to their
new lives rather quickly,

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.546 position:50% align:center
but some have a difficult
time adjusting.

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
As such, they're forced to live
out of sight of the public.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
Tenmanya feels
the least he can do

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
is provide them
with nourishment.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
So I have to come
down here periodically

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
to replenish their supply.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
There sure are a lot of vials.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.020 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed.
Let's just hope none of them

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
have been swapped out
for the vaccine.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
They seem fine to me.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.071 position:50% align:center
Agreed.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
Huh. But I don't understand
why there are so many left.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.206 position:50% align:center
Is there something wrong?

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
Well, young man,

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid we may have fallen
into the enemy's hands.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
 [KURUSU]
Vampire units?

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
Oh my.

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
It appears we've caught a bigger
fish than I'd anticipated.

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] Special forces
soldiers! Stand down!

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
It's me, Shutaro Kurusu!

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
Stop! I'm one of your comrades!

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
I'm not much to look at,

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
but I, Ishikawa, am still
Tenmanya's head clerk.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50% align:center
It is my duty to ensure
that our customers

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
stay out of harm's way!

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
So are you ignoring me now?

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
I don't understand how you
could target another soldier!

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.060 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU, ISHIKAWA gasp]

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
[SPECIAL FORCES
SOLDIER 8A groans]

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:21.906 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
The sun should be rising soon.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center
This is your chance.

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS sighs]

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
My dear Danny Boy.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
I can't believe what
a mess you've made of things.

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
You've been a bad boy.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
We know what
happens to bad boys--

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:45.555 position:50% align:center
they must be punished.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.515 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] I'm so glad
we made it outta there.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
I am as well.

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
If you'll excuse me, I need
to alert the young master.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
Where are you all?
I can't do this alone.
