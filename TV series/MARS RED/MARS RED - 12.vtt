Huh?

What're the vampire
units doing here?

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.826 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] It seems as though
you could use a little help.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
If you need a hand
when the sun sets,

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.289 position:50% align:center
I suggest you join my troupe.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
Greetings, sir,

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.501 position:50% align:center
I'm the commander of
Special Forces Unit Sixteen,

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
Rufus Glenn.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] Attention vampires!
There are two roads open to you.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
That means, you can
choose to obey me,

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
given that I have
the obvious upper hand,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
and in return you will receive
blood as well as registrations.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
Or... you can refuse my orders
and you will all be killed.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center

Oh, what's this?

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
Come now you're not
the star performer.

Nihonbashi. Kyobashi.

Hongo. Kanda.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
The vampires are
increasing in ranks.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
We desperately need
to rethink our defenses.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
If they continue
to grow like this,

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
it's only a matter
of time before

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
they breach the
Marunouchi safe zone.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
We're currently
doing everything we can

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
to maintain some semblance
of order in the area,

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
but handling the vamps
is proving to be

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
more than we can manage.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
Ah, I see.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
In that case, why don't
you just leave it to us?

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
Our Special Forces can help
restore order to Marunouchi.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, sir!

That's right! Burn it down!

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
Mark my words,
I'll search out anyone

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
who's stronger than me and
incinerate them! [cackles]

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
Boys, this is our
chance to clean house!

Tonight we hunt down every
last nuisance! [cackles]

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.974 position:50% align:center
I'd like to personally
thank you for your work.

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
While Code Zero may
have been your creation,

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
former Lieutenant
General Nakajima,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
I've taken it upon myself
to perfect the program

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
so that it may better
reflect your ideals.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
All of my soldiers
complete their missions

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50% align:center
and return without
a single casualty;

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
they're an invincible
fighting force.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
None of them are human,
but does it matter?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
Surely, that quells any
lingering regrets you may have,

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
old man.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
Hurry up and die now, would you?

[water drips]

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
No one's standing in
the way of my plans anymore.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
At long last, I've become
the king of vampires.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] Soon we shall cross the
ocean on that beautiful ship.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
We'll sail to new
shores to create our kingdom

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
in a new land.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
Another world war is inevitable,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
so in preparation, they've been
building an invincible army.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that sound like
fun to you? [cackles]

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
And what about the children?

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, of course.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.729 position:50% align:center
I'll be sure to find you
some replacements.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't be difficult,
as this is my world now.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
Whoops. Hold on.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
It's almost time for the
ambassador's farewell party.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
You can wait for me
on the vessel.

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I can no longer feel
sensations like cold or warmth.

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center
Because I am a vampire.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] Pardon my tardiness,
Your Excellency.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed with
your vampire units.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.652 position:50% align:center
Their performance
has been admirable.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it, sir.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
I promise we'll continue
to do great things

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
not only for your country,
but its people.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.535 position:50% align:center
Thank you. That's reassuring.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
I've the highest hopes for you.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center

This is absolutely delightful--

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
now I get to admire your
exquisite beauty all evening.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.443 position:50% align:center
I assure you, Rufus Glenn is
always at your service, Madam.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center

[DEFROTT]
Ah. How good to see the moon!

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
One might say she resembles
a little piece of money.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps a little
silver flower.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.926 position:50% align:center
The moon is cold and chaste.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
I am sure that she is
a virgin for her beauty.

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
My Lord, the son
of man, hath come.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center

have gone into hiding.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
Who was that who cried out?

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
While it is a valiant effort,

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center
no one could ever upstage the
original London performance.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.071 position:50% align:center
I would disagree!

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.617 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] Tell me the
thing that thou desirest.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
I will give thee
all that is mine,

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
save but the life of one man.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
Speak again, Jokanaan.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
Thy voice is as
music to mine ear.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.798 position:50% align:center
Please tell me what I must do.
I beseech thee, speak again.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
Oh, Danny Boy.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
Damn you, Defrott!

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Well, I guess
this is it for Code Zero, huh?

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA] What a shame.
I was rather fond of it.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] The <i>torii</i> corridor
acted as a kind of set dressing

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
to draw the enemy's attention.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
I'd already planned on
destroying any and all

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
evidence when the time came,

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
but they've gone ahead and
saved me the trouble. [laughs]

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Takeuchi.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
This is where I leave you.

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.543 position:50% align:center
I'm sure gonna miss you, Suwa.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
It's not like I want to go.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.505 position:50% align:center
Let me guess, is it Ayame?

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
I'm the one who left her loose.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
So, I have to handle it.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case, I'll just
have to depend on Kurusu

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
and push him to
do his very best.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Would you
please give that to him?

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
Yeah, consider it done.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.939 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Farewell, old friend.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA] That was an awfully
abrupt exit for a comrade.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] I'm sure we'll meet
again someday,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
that is, if we survive.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
Suwa and I both have
long lives ahead of us.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
[SONO]
Takeuchi! Let's play Mikan!

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
Pretty please?

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
Very well, if you insist. Hm?

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
Mikan.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
Persistent, aren't ya?
Let's head back to Asakusa.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
[YOH, TENMANYA giggle]

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Hey now, careful!
Watch where you're going.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Here you go, sir!

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.641 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
Here you are!

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.269 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE 12B]
Thank you for everything.

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Take some.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry about this.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
[AOI] I don't mind.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
Now, let's see, who hasn't
gotten one yet?

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.526 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
You seem to be feeling better.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center

To be completely honest,

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:46.706 position:50% align:center
it's thanks to all
the vampires here.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
They scared me at first,
but as I've gotten to know 'em,

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
I've learned they're
good dolls n' fellas.

I could do the same someday.

Is that so?

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
Not to change the subject,
but have you seen Shutaro?

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center

that Mr. Kurusu is out front.

both adjusted quite well.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
we're able to track the

But certain smells like
garlic, rotten fish, and <i>natto</i>

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center

Really, it's the
same for most humans.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center

would end this way.

and I'm just a human.

together for eternity.

I'd never keep up.

Vampires are very
different from you and I;

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
Their injuries are healed
instantly and they never age.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center

they question why they're alive.

such as this one,

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
they laugh and they cry,

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:09.492 position:50% align:center
they're going to
do something wrong,

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
they turn around
and do the right thing.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
Perhaps vampires and humans

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center

than we thought.

I am a traitor, after all.
Go right ahead.

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
I can't survive
on my own anyway.

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
[AYAME gasps]

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Do you really want to die?

00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
[AYAME grunts]

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
The sun should be up by now.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No!

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
Why would you do this, Suwa?

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
To show you just how easy it is.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:32.899 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] If you truly wanted
to die, you'd be dead already.

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
Instead, you're alive and well.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
I know that nothing
makes sense to you anymore,

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
but it's clear to me
that you want to live.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
Rufus. He made me like this.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
I can't break free of him.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.460 position:50% align:center
I hate knowing his tainted blood
is coursing through my veins.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:56.381 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] If we're comparing
the quality of blood,

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.842 position:50% align:center
I assure you mine's far worse.

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
I couldn't tell you how many
vampires contributed to mine.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
But it doesn't matter.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
Our kind hasn't lived
this long because of blood.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
It's our hearts
that have kept us alive.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
At least, that's what
I choose to believe.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
If you truly feel like you can't
go on living on your own...

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
...then I'll stay by your side.

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about Sono and Yoh.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
I swear they're in good hands.

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
[AYAME whimpers]

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Here's an idea:

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
How would you like to visit
the "new world" together?

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
I could use a change of pace.

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:54.647 position:50% align:center
