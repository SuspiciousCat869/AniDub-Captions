[VAMPIRE 10F yelling]

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.092 position:50% align:center
So what do you think?
Should we break through?

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Maybe if it
were just the two of us,

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.347 position:50% align:center
but not while we're carrying
such fragile baggage.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
Plus, we've got an extra
burden slowing us down.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.810 position:50% align:center
Yes, about that, I don't
recall asking you to follow me.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] You know, you really
should watch your mouth, brat.

I'm not a child.

something a brat would say.

I'll rush out
and act as a decoy.

That'll buy you some time,

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
so you can head back
to Tenmanya's place.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
Listen, vampires.

I have no doubt that Kurusu

Where have you been, young man?

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] I just went
for a walk, that's all.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
How many times have I told ya?

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous to go
walking at night.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
Yes, but I came
back in one piece,

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
so what does it matter?

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! I need
to ask a tiny favor.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
It's something only
you can do for me.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
Do I have the option to refuse?

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
[AOI chuckles, sings]

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That was
Misaki's costume.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
I know. I still can't
believe it survived the fire!

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.608 position:50% align:center
Me either.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
I think it's gonna be
perfect for Eurydice!

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're doing Orpheus?
But where though?

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center

the perfect spot right here!

So I'm playing Orpheus?

This is the first
I've heard of it.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center

They lost everything
in the quake

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center

they're gonna go from here,

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
ya know?

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50% align:center
So I thought--

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Okay, fine.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
To be completely honest,

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
Orpheus isn't my idea
of an interesting play.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
However, if you'll allow me to
change the ending with Eurydice,

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
I'll consider it.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
So you'll play Orpheus?

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] Mm. You're not the
only one who wants to dream.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
And whenever I'm on stage,
my wildest dreams come true.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
This is incredibly helpful.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
It includes the member's history
and their family background.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
And even has information
on their friendships.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] Why did you request
files on Code Zero's vampires?

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
Do you really need
them at this point?

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
Just think--if there
were a pebble in your boot,

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you want
to know about it?

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm relieved to
hear that you consider them

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
to be nothing more
than a mere pebble.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
But of course.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
After all, I've got the
vampire units you created.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
True, but you mustn't forget
that we're plagued with people

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
who don't seem to
understand their value.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center

principles will have

Go about your business

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
and leave the
removal of pebbles to me.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] Very well then,
I'm counting on you.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
With Maeda gone,
I truly believe that

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
you're the only
one who's capable of

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
commanding the vampire units.

[CHIEF EDITOR]
I still can't believe these duds

survived the fire.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
It was a lucky find
packed away in a box

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
with some random
spare costumes.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
I think it'll be perfect
for Eurydice, don't you?

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's the ticket.

perform the role of Orpheus,

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
but in order to
make that happen,

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
we're gonna need more costumes!

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
For the shepherds as well
as the guards of Hades.

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a lotta work.

Look, I'm onboard
with this Greek blowout,

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
but why's the paper
got to be involved?

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
'Cause it's a public service the
citizens deserve to know about!

[TAKEUCHI] I think there should
be enough material here

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
for me to build it if I
scrounge.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
Would you like to give it a go?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
Sure, it sounds like fun!

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center
Looks like a box
full of junk to me.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
That's because you haven't seen

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
the most important
item I stashed away.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
It's a sample of the blood used
to create the vampire units.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.154 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Seems like it
would've gone bad by now.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] You'd think,
but it's good as new.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
That's what's so
strange about this stuff.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
It could sit in a bottle forever
and it won't spoil or coagulate.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
That said, you don't
wanna expose it to sunlight

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
because it will explode.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
As you can see, I learned
that lesson the hard way.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
If it's so dangerous,
why did you recover it?

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50% align:center
Because it might help
me learn more about vampirism.

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
This blood is
influenced by sunlight,

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
or rather, by its
ultraviolet rays.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
I believe that reaction could be
used to our benefit somehow.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
We all know that ultraviolet
rays can cause death.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:06.106 position:50% align:center
So it's possible that,
depending on how they're used,

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center
the rays could also cause
vampires to age.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
So you're saying that
we could grow older?

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
That's correct, but there's
still a chance of death.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
I think I'm willing to risk it.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
When's it gonna be
ready, sir? Tomorrow?

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
No, I'm afraid it's
gonna take longer than that.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't count down the days,

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.419 position:50% align:center
but it shouldn't be
too far in the future.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
So 200--no, wait.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.424 position:50% align:center
I'd guess about
100 years from now.

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center
At least time is on our side,

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
'cause none of us
are going anywhere.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Is this far enough?

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA] Yes, thank
you very much, Santaro.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
We should be able to
handle it from here.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Don't mean to pry,

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
but may I ask why you
need all this bamboo?

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
I'm sheltering some craftsmen
who asked me to purchase it.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
They said something about
building an enormous kite.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
I dunno what they're up to,
but it sounds like fun!

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
They've got enough
bamboo here to make a kite

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
so massive that it would even
shock Goemon Ishikawa himself!

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed. I'm sure that
the craftsmen will be delighted.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.791 position:50% align:center
So they're really
gonna fly a kite, huh?

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope business
starts soaring as well.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
I figure things'll bounce back

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
once the vampire
panic dies down.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
There's just no way of knowing
when that's gonna happen.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
Sooner than later.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
I'm holding out hope
for next year.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
I certainly hope you're right,

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm ready for
this nightmare to end.

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks again
for your business!

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50% align:center
You're very welcome.

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
What are you doing?

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
I just wanted to look at it.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] You want to
be an adult that badly?

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
Yes, but a human one.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Then you'll
have to dream about it.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
I'm not certain
vampires can dream.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Me neither.
I've never tried it myself.

"Life is never fully
explained, my dear."

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Hey, Suwa! You have a moment?

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I know
this is last minute,

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
but they want you to carry more
packages tonight. Do you mind?

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Of course not. I'll leave now.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
A world without good is Hell.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
So, please tell me
why I should fear Hades.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
--[clapping]
--[DEFROTT grunts]

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
How magnificent.
But I would expect no less.

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
Why are you here, Rufus?

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center
Because I have an invitation

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
from darling Miss Aoi Shirase.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
I'm her guest.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward
to your performance.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to be
rude to an invited guest,

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
but would you please leave?
I thought I had made it clear

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
that I have no desire
to associate with you.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
I simply wanted to bid you
hello. If I'm being honest,

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
I don't care to
associate with you either.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
However, I couldn't
pass up the opportunity 

00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
to pay my respects
to a noble vampire.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:04.993 position:50% align:center
Best of luck. I hope you
enjoy your trip to Hades.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's time
for places, Orpheus.

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, you look upset.
Is there something wrong?

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Okay, lighting, check.
Costumes and scenery, check.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
So now all we
need are the actors.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
It's awfully bright over there.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
Apparently, they're
putting on an all-night play

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
at the Imperial Hotel.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
Mr. Tenmanya mentioned it.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
What?

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Don't even think about it.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
We can't go. We have
too much work to do.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] A little peak
wouldn't hurt, would it?

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Takeuchi said

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
I'm not supposed to
take my eyes off you.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.210 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's go.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
[SUWA grunts]
Well,

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll be able to go once
the city's back on its feet.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's hurry
and get this job done.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
You bet.

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
Aoi. I just know you're
there watching that play.

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Eurydice! The fire of my life!

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:28.034 position:50% align:center
Your light stayed with me
through all of my pain!

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
Please don't let it go out now.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
You are my love personified!

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
And now, I realize
that my mistrust of you

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
has ruined everything.

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50% align:center
I don't know how I can
carry on with the knowledge

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
that your glorious
spark is gone forever.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
My life's flame is
weak and flickering.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
I could extinguish it
with just a breath.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
O merciful god of love,
I beg this of you.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
If you can find
any pity in your heart

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
for the love we once shared,

00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
then lift our ashes
into the night sky

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
and combine them to
make a single star.

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:06.364 position:50% align:center
Let us serve as a
warning to other lovers.

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
May they look up at us and
never repeat our mistakes.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center
My God, do I love the stage.

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
It allows me to taste death,
if only for a moment.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
A thistle?

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center

you thinking, Rufus?

Hey, everyone.

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.619 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Welcome back.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
So tell me, how did it go?

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.664 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
See for yourself.

00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:59.209 position:50% align:center
And I even kept Suwa
from going to that play.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
I'll take your tongue.

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center

What're you doing?

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Suwa.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Get that thing away from me!

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
Would you look at
that? Nice work!

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
It seems our intel
was accurate, after all.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Yeah, no kidding.

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
I guess this means
we can move everyone, huh?

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
All we have left to do
is arrange the trains.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
I'm working on that now.

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:26.778 position:50% align:center
Oh, I almost forgot.
Mr. Takeuchi,

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
I procured the bamboo
that you requested

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.615 position:50% align:center
and I had it brought
inside for you.

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
That's wonderful news.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.119 position:50% align:center
Now that I've got the
materials we can try it!

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Hang on, try what?

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
Wish I could tell ya,

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
but that would just
ruin the surprise!

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.675 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
It's me, Defrott.

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
I have the invitation
you left behind for me.

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] What a strange voice!

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
I would look closer at him.

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
I--

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.938 position:50% align:center
I would speak with him.

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
That voice...

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] I am Salomé, daughter
of Herodias, Princess of Judea.

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
Ah, speak again.

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
Please, Jokanaan. Once more!

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
Enough with the games, Rufus!
Show yourself!

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] We have a
matter to discuss first.

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
Tell me where the girl is now!

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
Right this way.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT grunts]

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Hm.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
You know what they say,

00:17:57.285 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
"If you want to catch a big
fish, you need suitable bait."

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
Do you really
think I care whether

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
this human lives or dies?

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] I've seen how you cling
to her like an older sister.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
You care more than you realize.

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:10.507 position:50% align:center
Silence.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] You're the one who
needs to be silenced, Defrott.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.178 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] The sun bestows death
equally among our kind.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
I'm well aware.

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
However, I shall prepare
a different death for you.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
You needn't bother.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
It won't be long until
you're a pile of ashes.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
Rufus, have you no pride?

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
None whatsoever?

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.507 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
Pride? Surely you're joking.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
I haven't had any "pride"
since I lost my humanity.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
Here's a question for you.

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:01.474 position:50% align:center
Do you know what I hate more
than anything in this world?

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
The one thing I despise
most is proud vampires.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
[AOI grunts]
Oh, Defrott, it's you.

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Are you all right?
You're not injured, are you?

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
Stay back.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
But you seem so--

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.662 position:50% align:center
That's enough, Aoi. Please
stop treating me like a child.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
[chuckles, cackles]

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS] Aw, where'd
all of your pride go?

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
I can't stand watching
this three-penny opera!

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
Now, let's turn you to
ash and lower the curtain.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.847 position:50% align:center
I see an unexpected
actor has taken the stage.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] Where should I tie it?
Here?

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Yes, that'll be
perfect.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
Would you look at that?

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
Things are coming
along quickly, aren't they?

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN]
Hm?

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
[SONO]
Whoa, it's a big kite!

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
[YOH gasps]

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what is that?

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
It's a flying machine!

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
Flying? Like, in the sky?

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
That's right! I've heard
that over in Europe,

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.423 position:50% align:center
the military are using
airplanes to drop bombs

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
in the hopes of turning
the tide of battle.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
In this new age of
technology and enterprise,

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
I believe that he who controls
the skies will rule the world!

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but that doesn't mean

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
vampires should
have to fly, too.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
I understand your hesitation,

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
but the ground is littered
with perilous obstacles, 

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
we could cover more ground
if we take to the skies.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.067 position:50% align:center
I wanna try flying!

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
[YOH]
Mm!

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
Aw, c'mon, Suwa.
Don't you wanna try, too?

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] You're just tying cloth
onto a bamboo frame, right?

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
It's a kite.

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
Why would anyone
risk riding that thing?

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
I'd call it a "kite."

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
It's got more of a bat
shape in my opinion.

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
Isn't it dangerous?

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
According to my calculations,
each wing needs to be

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
about 20 meters long
in order to fly safely.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
We can't build them out of
iron because they'd break.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
However,

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
this green bamboo
I've been stitching together

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
is strong
but much more flexible.

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt that
it's going to hold up.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
The other benefit of using
bamboo is it's lightweight,

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.146 position:50% align:center
so it should only take 30 times

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.606 position:50% align:center
the strength of a
normal human to operate it.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
Our human friends
won't be able to use it?

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
'Fraid not, but that's
where we vampires come in!

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:19.696 position:50% align:center
Right, Kurusu?

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh! You
want me to do it?

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Humans aren't
supposed to fly.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
Well, I still wanna give
it a try! You do, too, right?

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
[YOH]
Mm. I wanna fly with birdies.

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
I understand why
you'd want to try,

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:37.130 position:50% align:center
but there's one major problem.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50% align:center
Birds don't fly in the darkness.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center
They fly in sunlight,
which we can't do.

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] If we were to even
attempt such a thing,

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:48.725 position:50% align:center
it'd be tragic.

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
We would burn up and die.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Misaki.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.112 position:50% align:center
[AOI gasps]

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:12.457 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
I will... eliminate vampires.
