Move it! We have a job.

Coming, sir.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.621 position:50% align:center
Get back here!

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.331 position:50% align:center
Go around!

[gasps] What the--?

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center
Listen, vampire, there are
two roads open before you!

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.090 position:50% align:center
First, obey Special
Forces Unit Sixteen--

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

[MAEDA]
Hm.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Great. This man isn't a vampire.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.193 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
Interesting turn.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
The perpetrator was a human.
Good thing you didn't kill him.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. The man was acting
as a courier delivering Ascra.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.993 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
This substance?

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
Seems he makes a living
transporting criminal goods.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50% align:center
Pickups and drop offs are at
designated meeting points.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
He doesn't appear to know

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.086 position:50% align:center
the slightest thing
about Ascra though.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
I've assigned Code Zero to
investigate the matter further.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
Where was he set to
deliver this last shipment?

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we
captured him before

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
he was informed where the
merchandise was to be taken.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
Sounds to me as though
it would have been

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
wise of you to follow
him longer, then.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
Apologies, sir.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] Your subordinate
who was killed in action--

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50% align:center
his name was Moriyama, was it?

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
We lost another young man.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:59.656 position:50% align:center
A family is left behind
to grieve. It's frustrating.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
I regret his death as well.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
In my service, I've had
to say goodbye to many

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
promising soldiers
on the battlefield.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
My great hope is that
I never lose anybody else.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
That's why we must
perfect our vampire units

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
as soon as possible.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] I completely
agree with you, sir.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
I'll return to the scene

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
and search for
more clues right away.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
No. I have a request for you.

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
How can I help?

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow morning, I'm meeting
with the army's top officials.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to accompany me.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
But why me, may I ask?

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
Ah, lovely.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
You managed to find
someone running shipments.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
The problem is that vial

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
is the only thing we
have in terms of leads.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA] Have you examined
the contents, Mr. Takeuchi?

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
Yes. The liquid
contains the V Virus.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
You fool. That's
classified intel!

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
Oh, who cares, Yamagami?

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
We're in a quid-pro-quo
relationship with Tenmanya here,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
so we gotta give something.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI grunts]

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
By the way, I've been
meaning to mention it--

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
your sunscreen was well received

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
by our female
customers and sold well.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, head clerk?

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] You've been providing
him with products on the sly?!

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Pharmaceutical development

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
was my career
before I grew fangs.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
Honestly, my work with Code Zero
is more of a side gig to that.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
I've actually been
meaning to ask you

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
how you ended up
becoming a vampire.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Oh, you know,
freak lab accident.

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
The army hired the company

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
I worked for to
study vampire blood,

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
and while I was
working one day...

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI blows raspberry]
Right in the eye.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center
Jeez, that's some
pretty terrible luck.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
You have my condolences.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Why the glum faces?

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
I couldn't be happier
about my newfound longevity.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
Now this oversized brain
of mine will never grow old.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
I can try to decode the
mysteries of our universe

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
until it no longer exists.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
It's the price
I paid to obtain wisdom,

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
like Odin sacrificing
himself for knowledge.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.938 position:50% align:center
He's a vampire, yes.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
But first and foremost he
is a dedicated intellectual.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
He's somewhat different
from those of you

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
devoted to the military.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Different is an understatement.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
And what about Suwa?

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
It's not my place to say

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
how he feels about
his life or lack thereof.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
That being said, our
little masked-warrior Suwa

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center
has walked this
cruel world as a vampire

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
longer than any of
the rest of us have.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
How long?

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
If what I've heard is true,
since before the Edo period.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
He turned that long
ago? And survived?

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
Perhaps now you see why

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
middlemen like us are necessary.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
Not so much.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
Head clerk.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
What's that?

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
These are registration
papers we've prepared.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
We live in a society where you
can find out who someone is

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.064 position:50% align:center
and where they're
from fairly easily.

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
But government registration

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
puts vampires in
a difficult position.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Because if someone reports,

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
"I think my
neighbor's a vampire!"

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
and said neighbor
can't prove who they are,

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
they'll get dragged
into the sunlight,

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
and, poof--the dead
die a second time.

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
You see, vampires are weak.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.832 position:50% align:center
Their fear is constant.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
That's why people like
us come to their aid.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, head clerk?

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
Like they say, "Ah, frailty,
thy name is vampire."

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
That's the line, right?

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, your
families have been sent

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
notices reporting
your untimely deaths.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
Untimely what?!

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.476 position:50% align:center
They'll survive, but
do everybody a favor,

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
and try not to bump
into anyone you know,

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50% align:center
'cause that'd be
a real hassle to explain.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
Act like proper vampires.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI growls]

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.740 position:50% align:center
Western. Yes. That's
a genre type, like romance.

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] I guess Western things
just don't sit right with me.

Who's narrating the

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Bang.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.514 position:50% align:center
Uh! What's that?

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
Why was that fella wearin'
a weird mask? Suspicious.

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
He could be up to
somethin' scandalous.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.647 position:50% align:center
Oh! There you are!

Where have you been
lollygaggin', Defrott?

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] You were the one
who suddenly ran off, miss.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] What is a monster
like that doing here?

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center
This is not good.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.
I'm a sucker for the pictures.

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
We only see each
other at these festivals.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
If Tomiko saw me, she'd wail.
It'd be such a scene.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
Who's Tomiko?
Somebody you used to know?

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
My wife, you idiot.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You were
married, Yamagami?

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
Why do you sound
so surprised, kid?

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.819 position:50% align:center
I apologize.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
I wonder...

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
Are we really so
different from these people?

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Chinese lanterns?

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
Day of Forty-Six
Thousand Blessings.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
A Sensoji Temple festival.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
It's fairly common.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
Happens when there are festival
days on July ninth or tenth.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
Supposedly it grants you 46,000
days of blessings.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] Okay. But what does
that have to do with the plants?

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] It's said
the fruit cures disease

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
if you swallow it whole,
with water, of course.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
That tradition got folded
in with the festival,

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
which is how the
Hozuki-Ichi Fair started.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
Tomiko and I came like
clockwork every year.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
Do you suppose that means
she might be here right now

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
carrying on the
tradition without you?

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
If so, she's getting ready
to release a lantern for Bon.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
It sounds lonely if you ask me.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
It's a shame.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
I wanted to at least say
goodbye and wish her well.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Oh, it's you.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
You almost slit my throat!

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
Why are you drawing a
weapon against your comrade?

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
There's a danger among us.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you the rest at HQ.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
You have a vampire
sighting to report?

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Yes. He was in front
of the theatre in district six.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
Blonde. Looked like a kid.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
He was meeting a woman.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50% align:center
A fair-haired boy?

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
What was his name?

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
Does that mean there
are vampire children?

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
I know of a few cases
that've been written about.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
Technically, Suwa would fall
into that group

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
since he's a forever minor.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
He was younger than me
and clearly above my rank.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Maybe even higher than
the new guy.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
Yikes. If that's
really the case,

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
then it means we're dealing
with an S-Class vampire.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
Not exactly
a comforting thought.

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.012 position:50% align:center
Any information on
the girl he was with?

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
Could be that she
was just his dinner.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
I don't know anything else.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
Poor thing might
be dead by now.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Whoops.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
Looks like the sun's about
to peak over the horizon.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
Let's continue the
investigation after nightfall.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
I'm going out.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
What, alone?

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Lieutenant General Nakajima

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
ordered me to attend
a military conference.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
You haven't slept, right?

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:01.036 position:50% align:center
You need to rest.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center
But make sure that
you all get some sleep.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
It's a new day and
these are human hours.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3A]
Most citizens are treating

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
the human combustion case
at Tokyo Station as a joke,

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
but in truth that was a vampire

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
who escaped your
custody at Tsukishima.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong, Nakajima?

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3B] You don't
appreciate the severity

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
of this failure.
Such negligence!

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3C]
Vampire units are meant to be

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
the cornerstone
of our military--

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
the force that causes the
other major powers to tremble.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
If this ineptitude continues,

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
the navy will get all the glory
and we'll be an afterthought.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
We need measurable results.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
Have you perfected
the vampire units yet?

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center
Nakajima, how long
has it been since

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
you first proposed the use
of these special soldiers?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
It's been my focus for 20 years.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
And what progress have you made?

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
Special Forces Unit
Sixteen is thriving.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
There are 80 members in all.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3A] Of course,
but how many aren't human?

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center
I command four vampires
reserved for special missions.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
They're highly skilled.

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
Surely you jest. After 20 years
you've cobbled together

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
a mere handful of
blood-drinking recruits?

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
the transformation
are in short supply.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.903 position:50% align:center
One of the four is an A-class,

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
making him exponentially more
useful than a common man.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
He's the first of his kind
ever confirmed in Japan.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
A unit led by such might

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:27.414 position:50% align:center
would be more than equal
to a regular army platoon.

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
You must put things into
perspective, gentlemen.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
This is modern warfare
and military strength

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
is measured in weapons,
not soldiers!

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
Now, now. Lieutenant
General Nakajima is a hero

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
who returned to the battlefield
for just one of his men.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
He values men.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
I respect that.

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
Focus, please.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
Can you defeat England's rumored

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
vampire forces
with your own units?

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
In due time.

Why don't we just surround
enemy vamps in the night

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
and drag them out in the
morning when the dawn breaks?

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3C]
Exactly.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
Definitely human hours. Right...

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
I'll be frank, criticism
of Code Zero is intensifying

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.639 position:50% align:center
rapidly among the higher-ups.

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
That much I had gathered.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
[OKIMURA] Why not consider
using their vampire abilities

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
for covert intelligence
operations?

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
I hear that that's what the
English do to great success.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
That would defeat the point.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.779 position:50% align:center
When the units
I envision are perfected,

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:43.239 position:50% align:center
our army will be reborn.

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
It will stand as the
strongest force on the planet.

It's not just the military
that you have to worry about.

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
I'm certain he'll burn out.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] Hmm. Well, you
do have a point there, kid.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
I wonder if I can pull this off.

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
Tomiko!

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
Wow! She came to
release a lantern!

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
Let's go after her!

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI grunts]
Wait, not so fast!

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3B]
I hear some nations have

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
reinstated
submarine development.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
A bold move I'd say,

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
since public opinion these days
is all for military reduction.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] Those who have
only made war on paper

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
do not understand
what it's like.

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.916 position:50% align:center
Their frontline is
the political stage.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
They don't fear being shot or
blown to pieces by shrapnel.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
They fear the public opinion

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
and the assault of civilians
clamoring for peace.

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
No matter what they said,

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
I don't believe
I made the wrong decision.

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
I can't save a country
if I can't even save one man.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
I'm sick of seeing
young soldiers

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
being wounded or
killed in their prime.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
I must see the vampire unit
plan through to the end

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
for the sake of my comrades

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
who were sacrificed
on the battlefield

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
even if it means selling
my soul to the devil.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
Code Zero is the key.

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:17.245 position:50% align:center
The new A-Class,
Lieutenant Kurusu,

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
is our strongest
home-grown vampire.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
I want you to get
him ready for action.

00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
I will. I promise you, sir.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
I am fully prepared
to devote myself

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center
to completing the plan
that you have envisioned.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
Colonel Maeda, we've learned
of the package's destination.

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Which was?

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
Yoshiwara.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
Sir?

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
Go immediately.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
I won't fail.

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] "It vanishes
with each step we take.

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
How sad this dream
within a dream."

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
What's that?

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
There she is.

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center
Now's your chance.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
Don't hesitate.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
we can pull this off?

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:21.643 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me.
Now, here we go.

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
--[thud]
--[YAMAGAMI coughing]

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
My dearest.

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
My love.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
Have you come from the
afterlife to visit me?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, uh, yes.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
Apologies.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
Seeing you again, the joy
I feel seems to me profound.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
"Like dreaming a dream
from which I'll never wake."

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
"Be this a dream,
then we are ephemeral.

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
But we may speak and do as
we please in this brief time."

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
Who's there right now?

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
[SPECIAL FORCES 3D]
Code Zero's Lieutenant Suwa.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
And where's Kurusu?

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
[SPECIAL FORCE 3D]
I'm told he's on patrol.

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
Once I'm out, go back to
base. Sound a type-I alert.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
I don't want any vampire
entering or leaving the scene.

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
--[heart thuds]

[SPECIAL FORCE 3D]
Colonel?

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA]
It's nothing! My hand slipped.

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA groaning]

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] So, uh, what
happened to my harpsichord?

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
[TOMIKO]
I clean it every day, of course.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI]
And my rosewood armchair?

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
[TOMIKO] It's a great comfort
to me when I'm knitting.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
If you ever need money,
sell my belongings.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
Don't keep them around
to remember me by.

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
Take care of yourself. Your
future is what's most important.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
[TOMIKO chuckles]

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
I like seeing
your things around.

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's the case...

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
You know what?
You should remarry, too.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
I know more often than not
I was hopeless as a husband.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
But know this--

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
there was never a day that I
didn't wish for your happiness.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center

What wonder is it if
two birds of a like kind

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:31.231 position:50% align:center
should choose to
flock together?"

My Tomiko...

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
That's exactly right.
I'll always be your Tomiko.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
Please come visit me
again sometime...

Were you able to
say a proper goodbye?

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.482 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGAMI] I'll be asking
for your help again next year.

"The person for whom
I had waited anxiously for

What can there be to regret
in a meeting such as this?"

I'll see you next year.

00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:26.698 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] There were no signs
of whoever drained her

00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:28.324 position:50% align:center
when I arrived.

00:23:28.408 --> 00:23:30.827 position:50% align:center
