This joint's slated
for demolition, too?

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.832 position:50% align:center
Everyone is disappearing now.

[SONO giggles]

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.470 position:50% align:center
Hi, there!

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:18.555 position:50% align:center
Hi, Sono and Yoh.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.140 position:50% align:center
You two seem like
you're having fun.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
We were just pretending.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.560 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.396 position:50% align:center
[SONO] Can I ask you somethin'?
Why aren't we allowed to go out?

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.107 position:50% align:center
Because you're safer
here with Mr. Tenmanya.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.650 position:50% align:center
[SONO]
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:34.279 position:50% align:center
But we're startin' to get sick
of playing house every day.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50% align:center
[YOH]
Did you find them?

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.489 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.450 position:50% align:center
You're "it," aren't you?

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
We figured you must be
playing hide and seek.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
I guess you could say that,

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.416 position:50% align:center
but I haven't managed
to find anybody yet.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50% align:center
Have you asked
Ayame to help you?

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Huh?

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.922 position:50% align:center
[SONO] She knows lots of stuff!
You should talk to her.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
You're looking for your friends?

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Yes.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.389 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose you know anyone
who fights against vampires?

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Anyone at all? Please...

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I've heard a rumor,
but it's disturbing.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's okay.
I'll take whatever I can get.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.944 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] They say there's
a man on the loose

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
who's slaughtering
vampire children.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
I heard he wears a weird mask
and attacks with bladed weapons.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
It's because of
that awful rumor,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
and all the red specs
roaming around,

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
that I decided to run away
from where I'd been staying.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
I felt less alone after
meeting Sono and Yoh,

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center
but I was still
absolutely terrified.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
I was scared the masked
man might come for me.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
So where were you
staying before?

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Near Tsukishima Island.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA chuckles]

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
Pardon, head clerk.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir?

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
Have you seen the
gentleman from Code Zero?

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
He left about an hour ago.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to retrieve
him for you if you wish.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
No, that's fine.
It's nothing urgent.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
I know where to find him.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
He went to Tsukishima, sir.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
The island?

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
For hide and seek?

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
Please be quiet, Yoh.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
I believe he may be
looking for someone.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
Must be his comrades. Sure,
they could find him easily,

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50% align:center
that is, if they
wanted to be found.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
That said, maybe not,
these are dangerous times.

I don't like the looks of this.
No way I can leave now.

[thudding]

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
So those are the
infamous red specs.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting
for this moment,

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
so please be a good lad
for me tonight, Danny Boy.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, it looks as though
some unexpected prey

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
stumbled into our net yet again.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
Get the job done, my dears,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
and be sure to make it
home before morning light.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center

That's Code Zero's base.

They're not here?

you hear me? It's Kurusu.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center

please respond.

I would...
I would speak with him.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] I am Salomé, daughter
of Herodias, Princess of Judea.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
Speak again. Please, Jokanaan.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
Once more!

"Salomé"?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] This is Colonel Maeda,
Special Forces Unit Sixteen.

[gasps] Maeda?

[MAEDA]
Suwa, Takeuchi,

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
destroy any and all vampires
who could become enemies.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
Artificial vampires
should take priority,

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
but larval vampires are
also considered a threat.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
Show them no mercy.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
"Larval" means they're
killing kids, too?

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] Shutaro Kurusu
is also a risk factor.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50% align:center
[MAEDA] If found,
eliminate him immediately.

I repeat,
eliminate Shutaro Kurusu.

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
I pray for your good
fortune, gentlemen.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center

Why am I a risk to you?

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
If there's something wrong
with me, I need to know!

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
Please, Maeda! Come out
and speak to me right now!

You killed that child.

think of my improved skunk ball?

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant General
Nakajima likes things tidy.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
♪ Oh, Danny Boy... ♪

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] I can't seem
to shake that stench.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Good to hear!

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
I added extra <i>natto</i> to help it
really cling to the nostrils.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Hit me with one of those
again, and you'll regret it.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
I suspect the smell down here

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
might be amplifying the odor.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
So, um...

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Yes?

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
I'm wondering...

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
What happened to you
both after Yokohama?

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Honestly, things were going well

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
until we caught up
to the vampire units.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
But there were just too many
of them for us to handle.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
We were spying on them
whenever the quake hit.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
We were worried about HQ,

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
but we took advantage of
the confusion and ran for it.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
Luckily, I have my own safe
house so we holed up there.

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] I wanna know
what happened to you.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
And where's Yamagami?

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
So he's dead.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
I see. What about Maeda?

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
I haven't run into him.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
That said, I think
he's all right.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
Yamagami's wife said

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:47.225 position:50% align:center
someone who resembled
Maeda left her a memento.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
But the recording.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
That wasn't really the
colonel speaking, was it?

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] No, it must've
been an impersonator.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
I gotta say though, the voice
was a perfect match for his.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Why would anyone do that?

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
I wish I could tell ya.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50% align:center
I guess now that the vampire
units are up and running,

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
they consider the
older model vamps like us,

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
a thorn in their side.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:09.247 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Damn you, Nakajima.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.417 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] We came to Tsukishima
Island so we could check on HQ.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50% align:center
What was your reason
for going back, Kurusu?

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
What is it?

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
I heard a rumor that

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
you were killing
vampire children, Suwa.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
That's why you attacked.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
Yes, I've killed children.
I won't deny it.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] We should be able
to get outside from here.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
There's only one problem:

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.154 position:50% align:center
the sun's out in
full force by now.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
Here. You wanna
try some of this?

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Huh?

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] It's a special
sunscreen I created.

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
It's been selling like hotcakes
in the department stores.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
C'mon, don't you
wanna give it a try?

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
I thought you were a scientist.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.668 position:50% align:center
Now you're going into
the skin-care business?

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] It lasts
for three whole minutes!

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
I'll give you a discount
on your first purchase.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
I don't need that junk.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Well then,
would you like to try some?

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI chuckles]

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
We should get going, too.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Yeah.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
The sun is glaring down on us.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
Where do we go from here?

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.785 position:50% align:center
That's a very good question.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
We could go to Mr. Tenmanya's.

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
Glad he made it
through the quake.

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
He did move, though.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
To the <i>torii</i> corridor?

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Yeah, you know the place?

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
Of course! We've actually
stopped by a number of times.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
Right, Suwa?

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Another child with vampirism...

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
I was really hoping there
wouldn't be any out here.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
Is it the vaccine?

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Yeah, that's what I suspect.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
The rats taste terrible,

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.529 position:50% align:center
but at least they keep the
kids from starving to death.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
No, don't--[gasps]

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
Why did you stop me, Suwa?

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Because it's useless.

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
We can't save all
of them on our own.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:23.173 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
You have a lot to learn.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
I've been around 300 years
longer, so I'll try to explain.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] You wanna know why there
are so few vampire children?

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
It's because they can't survive.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
They can't be in the sun.

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
They sink in water.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
They're disgusted by smells.

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
And they can't live out
their lives in one place

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.405 position:50% align:center
because they don't age.

00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
It's a hundred times
harder to live as a vampire

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.161 position:50% align:center
than as a human.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:59.959 position:50% align:center

Welcome back, mister!

[SUWA]
Children?

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU] Yes, but these
children are all right.

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
So you found your friends?

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Mm!

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
Oh my, what do we have here?

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
[SONO]
Uhh...

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
Children who've been turned

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
into vampires by the vaccine.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center
Tenmanya agreed to take them in.

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Evening, gentlemen.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
I welcome you
to our humble shop.

Hey, old man! Long time no see!

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Please come in. The
young master's waiting for you.

[SONO, YOH grunt]

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
What an incredibly rare find!

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.117 position:50% align:center
These kids have become vampires

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
while simultaneously
retaining their sanity!

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center
Wow, that vaccine
is more effective

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
than I could've imagined.
I gotta admit, I'm impressed.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
So, do we know
what's in the vaccine?

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
I can't say for certain,
but Lieutenant General Nakajima

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.464 position:50% align:center
must've had it
manufactured in Akabane

00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
using both my research and

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.135 position:50% align:center
the Ascra he imported
from Yokohama.

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
That's my guess, anyway.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.805 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Damn you, Nakajima.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU grunts]

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center
[KURUSU]
What's the matter?

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
Is he the killer?

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
'Cause he matches the
description from the rumor.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
No need to worry.
I promise Suwa's a good person.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
He still scares me.

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:13.033 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] Huh? Why're you
staring at me like that?

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
There a problem?

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I'm sorry!
I was frightened,

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
but you must be a good person if
you're a friend of Mr. Kurusu.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
You're the only person

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
who can decide if
I'm good or not.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
The decision's yours to make.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
My goodness. How do you take
care of all the vampires

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
you've got staying here?

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
It must be difficult
to find enough food

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
to keep them satiated.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
You can say that again. [sighs]

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
We do our best, but I'm afraid
it never seems to be enough.

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
The number of vampires
is skyrocketing

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.522 position:50% align:center
because of the vaccine.

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
But it's Tenmanya's policy to
never refuse a request for aid.

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
That's nice, but at this rate,

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.613 position:50% align:center
you're gonna have
a riot on your hands.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
Which is precisely why

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
I'm hoping to move everyone
to a safer location.

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
Smart. Do you have any leads?

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
One thus far.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it there's
a village of vampires

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
that's hidden in a quarry
somewhere in this area.

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
So whaddya think, Suwa?
Have you ever heard of it?

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Can't say that I have.

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
From what I'm told, it's yet
to be discovered by outsiders.

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center
All I can say is that it
must be quite a village.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
I think it'd be best
to send the head clerk

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
to the area to
scout it out for me.

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
Yeah, probably so.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA] We'll have to
prepare for the journey,

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
so we likely won't make
the move until winter time.

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
I suppose that we'll just
have to make do until then.

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, if you're
looking for more food,

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
I know one place where you
might be able to find some.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
[TENMANYA]
Oh, really?

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
It won't be much, but it
should tide you over for now.

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
We may have to get
a little aggressive

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
with some folks in order
to make it happen, but...

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
...I don't think that'll
be any problem for these two.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
So we have to do all the work?

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI]
Of course. I'm counting on you!

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.631 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
What is it now?

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
I don't think she likes you.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
[SUWA] She never
liked me from the start.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
[TAKEUCHI] Aw, c'mon,
we all know that deep down

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
you're dying for affection.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
[SUWA]
Shut up.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA]
I believe that the vampire units

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
have proven quite effective.

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
They were able to maintain order
after the earthquake,

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
which is no small feat.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] I think that fact
alone is enough reason

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
for the military to clear the
way for their official adoption.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
While your argument is sound,

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid we've not
reached that point yet.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
We have other
concerns to address.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
The world's
attention is on Tokyo.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
We must strike
while the iron's hot.

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
Maintaining order is important,

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
but speedy recovery is
the only thing that'll prove

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
to our allies and enemies
that we're a developed nation.

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
The government is asking
for major military cuts.

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
In fact, they just sent us

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
a directive to focus
all efforts on rebuilding.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
I'm concerned.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
Multiple civilians have
come forward saying

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
the vampire unit's gear

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
and glowing red eyes
are frightening.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
What we need to do
more than anything

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
is win back the peoples' trust,

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
and we can't do that
by threatening them

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
with military might.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3C] You've said they're
a force that never tires,

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
correct? If that's
the case, then perhaps

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.530 position:50% align:center
they'd be more useful to
us as military engineers.

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3A]
Yes, good thinking!

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
I agree. That would
be a perfect fit.

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
You're sure there's no way
for me to convince you

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
that the vampire units
should be utilized

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
for their intended purpose?

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3A]
Hmm.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3B chuckles]
Afraid not, Nakajima.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
We need engineers
more than anything now.

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
I agree. We have our men
working to demolish Ryounkaku

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
and we're still short-handed.

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
Which is precisely
why I don't care

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
if they're vampires or drivers.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
We're gonna utilize
them regardless.

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
We need all the help we can get.

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 3B]
How 'bout this?

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
We'll leave the vampire issue in
your hands, Lieutenant General.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.438 position:50% align:center
However, we won't discuss

00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
officially adopting
the vampire units

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:34.901 position:50% align:center
until Tokyo's been restored.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
Understood?

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
[NAKAJIMA] What do those moronic
pencil-pushers know anyway?

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS]
Oh, Danny Boy, guess what?

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
It's dinner time.

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
You must stay patient now.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
But when fall turns to winter,
it'll be your time to shine.

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:11.146 position:50% align:center
[RUFUS cackling]

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
[AOI] I don't understand
why he has the curtains shut

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
during the daytime.

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT]
No, don't.

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.579 position:50% align:center
[Oh, Defrott, I didn't
realize you were awake.

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] I haven't been able to
sleep much since the earthquake.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
Please don't interrupt me
when I'm trying to rest.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.211 position:50% align:center
Well, sorry for disturbing you,

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.422 position:50% align:center
but if you're gonna go out, you
should do it while the sun's up.

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
You really shouldn't
leave here at night

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
because of the vampire panic.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
[DEFROTT] I have chosen
to leave the stage.

00:21:55.815 --> 00:22:00.487 position:50% align:center
I've grown tired of watching
this three-penny opera.
