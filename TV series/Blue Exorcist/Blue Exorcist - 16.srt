I'VE ALWAYS CALLED THIS

EVEN KNOW THAT?

IT'S THE SWORD'S REAL NAME.

NO ONE ARGUES THE FACT...

THAT WE VIEW DEMONS

HOWEVER, WE'VE LEARNED MUCH

IN ORDER TO FORGE
A JAPANESE SWORD,

249
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:04,782
YOU NEED IRON SAND
SMELTED IN A FURNACE AT
A SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE.

250
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,649
THE PROCESS IS
A LITTLE DIFFERENT
FOR DEMON SWORDS THOUGH.

251
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:11,182
YOU HAVE TO INFUSE
THE IRON SAND WITH SPIRITUAL
POWER THROUGH A RITUAL.

BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM--
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE...

WHO REMEMBERS HOW TO PERFORM
THAT RITUAL ANYMORE.

OF IT LEFT ANYWHERE?

MY HANDS ON SOME.

SOMETHING LIKE THAT NOW?

THEM AT OUR SISTER TEMPLE.

266
00:15:56,816 --> 00:16:01,616
ANYWAY, LONG STORY SHORT,
THOSE NAILS WERE MADE
BY THE YOSHIKUNIS, RIGHT?

267
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:05,649
SO THERE'S A CHANCE THEY WERE
MADE WITH THE SAME IRON SAND
USED FOR THE SWORD.

268
