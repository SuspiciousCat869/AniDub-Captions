00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,958
[NANASHIMA]
Here we go again.

2
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,250
Same people, same place.

3
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,416
Talkin' about the same old crap.

4
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,250
But I've been noticin'
things are startin'

5
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,333
to feel...

6
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,291
...different.

7
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,625
[IGARASHI laughing]

8
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,875
[IGARASHI]
It's time for today's handshake.

9
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,708
It'll help you get
more comfortable.

10
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,625
[SERINUMA laughs]
Um...

11
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,750
--Okay.
--Good!

12
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:06,958
So how do you feel?

13
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,125
Um... it's just a handshake.
No big deal.

14
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,500
Then why don't we
turn it up a notch?

15
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,625
[SERINUMA gasps]

16
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,958
[IGARASHI]
Too much too soon?

17
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,041
Sorry about that.
Let's start over.

18
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,875
[SERINUMA]
Uh, I guess that's okay.

19
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,333
Just the handshake, right?

20
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,958
Thanks for that.

21
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,541
I love the new episode.

22
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,500
Their bond got so much deeper!

23
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,458
<i>Katchu Ranbu</i> changed my life.

24
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,750
I'm glad we can share this!

25
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,875
[NANASHIMA]
And these two...

26
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,333
Ever since they had
that throwdown,

27
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,041
they're even closer
than they were before!

28
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,583
They're all over each other!

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,958
[LORD 06A] We have a
new skill! Take this!

Sametora Flame-Horned Slugger!

31
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,458
Oh. The Sametora
Flame-Horned Slugger.

32
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,625
How'd you know?

33
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,083
Remember my dream?

34
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,791
You performed that same
move with such grace!

35
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,166
I love it!

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,000
Good thing we had our
charms to protect us, right?

37
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,583
Your heroism is legendary!

38
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,083
You defeated a samurai
and his ghostly army!

39
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,166
It's so cool!

40
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,541
If only it were real.

41
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,750
Please wake up. Serinuma?

42
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,333
Wait... A dream?

43
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,291
But... No way.

44
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,666
Something wrong?

45
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,000
Uh... no.

46
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,833
[SERINUMA] Was it real?
Was it a dream?

47
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,875
I can't tell anymore.

48
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,875
[NANASHIMA] She doesn't
know how obvious she is.

49
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,291
Blushing around Mutsumi?
You gotta be kidding me!

50
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,791
Even Shinomiya is getting
somewhere with her!

51
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,458
[NANASHIMA]
I'm the only one falling behind.

52
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,875
[DIAMOND] As long as
<i>Puri Puri Moon</i> is here,

53
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,333
there will always
be stars to guide you!

54
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,791
Never fear!

55
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,791
[NANASHIMA] My one advantage
was that I kinda look like

56
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,166
the dead dude from
that anime she liked.

57
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,500
Now she's over it.

58
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,000
How am I supposed to keep
up with everybody else?

59
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,708
She's closer to them.

60
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,291
I don't like fighting
for her attention

61
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,500
with the rest of those dweebs,
but I don't wanna give her up.

62
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,916
[DIAMOND]
Ruby, we can't stop!

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,375
No matter how long it takes,
we have to keep trying!

64
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,250
[RUBY] If you believe,
all your dreams can come true!

65
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,208
[NANASHIMA]
Thought I was the man,

66
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,000
but guess I got ahead of myself.

67
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,291
They're walkin' all over me.

68
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,333
[KIRARI] Bubba, get up!
Our dance is starting!

69
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,208
[NANASHIMA]
Oh, yeah!

70
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,583
I wanna be Diamond this time.

00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,583
while I'm dancing away the
weekend with my little sister?

Right. Let's make some grub.

00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,250

Yummy! Fried, please!

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,750
You got it.

94
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,750
[NANASHIMA]
So I'll step up my game.

95
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,916
I'll get a date no
matter what it takes.

there, startin' tomorrow!

100

[NANASHIMA]
I didn't get a fair shot!

101
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,458
I would...
but I'm short on time

102
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,583
since I'm working
every day after school.

103
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,625
You work?

104
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,666
Is there a reason you got a job?

105
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,875
They're dropping
new like crazy next month!

106
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,208
It's gonna be huge!
The anime just started

107
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,333
so it's a pretty big deal.
I spent all my money on

108
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,041
the pilgrimage
so I'm totally broke.

109
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,208
There's no way I'm gonna miss
out on <i>Katchu Ranbu</i> toys,

110
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,791
albums, voice actor appearances,

111
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,083
the <i>Katchu Ranbu</i> Café,
oh, and the new stage show!

112
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,208
I gotta make some fat cash
as quick as I can!

113
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,375
I'll do anything for that dough!

114
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,041
My dignity is nowhere
near as important

115
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,833
as the merchandise I crave!

116
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,166
I won't be able to go
to any cons for a while.

117
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,458
Spending money on
my passions is essential!

118
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,041
I have no choice but
to join the workforce.

119
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,333
Uh... oh.

120
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,166
So where will
you be working?

121
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,958
Usami Land! Yep!

122
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,666
A flyer said they
were hiring part time!

123
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,750
I'll be working on the
<i>Puri Puri Moon</i> show!

124
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,416
Isn't that awesome?

125
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,708
I'll be playing Ruby!

126
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,583
I'd like to work on
the <i>Puri Moon</i> stage show.

127
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,958
That's right! Always watch
the cartoon. I love it.

128
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,375
Who's your favorite?

129
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,750
Favorite? Easy.

130
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,375
I think Puri Moon is awesome!

131
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,416
<i>Puri Puri Moon</i>
is the title of the show.

132
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,625
Why are you wasting my time?

133
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,125
Please, go home.

134
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,041
See? I'm an actor!

135
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,208
Oh, you have jokes.

136
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,666
I think I have the perfect
job for someone

137
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,833
with your unique skillset.

138
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,541
[NANASHIMA] They hooked
Igarashi up with his own boat

139
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,541
as the skipper of
The Amazon Cruise.

140
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,291
The <i>Puri Puri Moon</i>
show, please.

141
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,291
I can't work too often
because of due dates.

142
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,375
I draw... and comics
don't make themselves!

143
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,083
I also travel,
not much free time,

144
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,708
I'd be an asset to the company.

145
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,458
I'm not so sure
this would work out.

146
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,708
Oh, wait!

147
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:03,708
There is a place in the
park where we could use

148
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,791
the occasional new face.

149
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,583
[NANASHIMA] Nishina was assigned
to the pretty boy butler café!

150
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,791
No surprise there.

151
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,208
I've done some live theatre.

152
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,458
I'd like to apply for the
<i>Puri Puri Moon</i> show.

153
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,208
I'm more than happy
to work backstage.

154
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,458
You're a star!

155
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,666
I knew the perfect role
for you the moment I saw

156
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,458
your sweet face!

157
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,291
[NANASHIMA] Shinomiya was
cast as the cute little

158
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,666
Princess Usamimi!

159
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,041
[SHINOMIYA]
I'm not cute!

00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,791
Such a nice show.

I'll have to go to

Not too bad.

But for Ruby you gotta
put your hips into the pose

pretty well for Nana.

that kind of thing,

for a kid's show.
