1
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,875
'Scuse me.

2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,708
Would you like to go
on a treasure hunt?

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:16,750
[GROUP]
What?

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:18,833
[MUTSUMI]
Take a look!

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,041
The other day I was cleaning
out the history club's

6
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,750
storage room and found this.

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,916
[SHINOMIYA]
A map?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,208
[NISHINA]
Well, where did it come from?

9
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,500
I have no idea!

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,041
But I believe it leads
to a buried treasure!

11
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,041
[GROUP]
Uh...

12
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,333
Wait, wait, wait.

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,791
You just happened to find
a real treasure map

14
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:35,916
hanging around.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,625
It was concealed
within a ceramic pot

16
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:38,916
a former club member left.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,375
Oh, my happy heart!

18
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,291
What? No way!

19
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,666
I'm not surprised.

20
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,666
The history club has all
kinds of neat odds and ends.

21
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's see here...

22
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:51,125
Cursed daruma dolls,
replica swords, old haniwa.

23
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,625
Ooh!

24
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,833
Okay, that sounds awful.

25
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,208
[MUTSUMI]
I didn't realize.

26
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,625
We'll pass this time.

27
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,791
[NANASHIMA] Just go
with another club member.

28
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:00,875
Sure.

29
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,166
I think it sounds
like a lot of fun.

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,708
Why don't you and I go together?

31
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,041
I'd... love to!

32
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,666
One second!
Just the two of you?

33
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,708
[SERINUMA] Well, I am a
member of the history club!

34
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,000
But... you aren't the only one!

35
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,333
Everyone else said
it sounded really lame.

36
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,791
[GROUP]
No kidding!

37
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,708
Mutsumi! I changed my mind!

38
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,791
So did I!

39
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,791
I'm excited! Hooray!

40
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,291
Ready to follow that map?

41
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,750
Yep!

42
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,791
He seems innocent, but he's
gotta be up to something!

43
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,916
Mutsumi acts like
some kind of saint.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,041
It can't be real.

45
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,291
Got that right.

46
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,291
Invite the girl you like
on some wild goose chase

47
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,708
and then try to
put moves on her.

48
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,708
That creep.

49
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,041
[IGARASHI]
You think he'd try that?

50
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,041
He's more of a gentleman
than you are, Nana.

51
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:17,916
Shut up!

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,458
I can be gentle!
Watch me!

53
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,833
Hmm... I think both
of you are terrible.

54
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,875
[NISHINA]
Actually...

55
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,000
There's something I've been
curious about for a while now.

56
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,083
Is Mutsumi interested
in Serinuma?

57
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,166
I'm not so sure about it.

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,625
[GROUP]
What?

59
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,958
[NANASHIMA] Well duh, that's
the reason we're all here.

60
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,750
[SHINOMIYA] Why would he try
to spend time alone with her?

61
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,208
All I'm saying is that when
we're all hanging out together,

62
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,875
he usually keeps to himself.

63
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,083
I'm curious.

64
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,458
I guess.

65
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,791
I always assumed he was
some weird guy with a crush.

66
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,416
Let's think about it.

67
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,958
Hasn't he been competing
with us from the start?

68
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,666
I... was, as well.

69
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,666
You can tilt luck in your favor.

70
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,916
That's great!
I missed you guys!

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,208
I know. Let's all
go to Comiket.

72
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, huh...

73
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,583
You see? Odd, right?

74
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,708
Wait. Then why is he here?

75
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,958
I don't get it.

76
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,416
[NANASHIMA]
What's his endgame?

77
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,166
I can't stop thinkin' about it!

78
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,208
[SERINUMA]
Oh!

79
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,458
Mount Fuji!

80
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,041
[IGARASHI]
This is the cave?

81
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,541
[NANASHIMA]
We ain't goin' in there, are we?

82
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,041
[MUTSUMI]
According to the map, we are!

83
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,833
Wow, to think there
was buried treasure

84
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,458
in Mount Fuji all this time!

85
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,625
What are the odds?

86
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,541
All set?

87
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,625
[SERINUMA]
Totally!

88
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,958
Are you guys ready
for an adventure?

89
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,375
Look pretty dark;
why don't we go ahead in?

90
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,458
We'll be right back.

91
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,791
Bye!

92
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,208
[SHINOMIYA]
It's so cold.

93
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,375
[IGARASHI] Tough to get
your footing in here.

94
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,750
[NANASHIMA]
It's bigger than it looks.

95
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,125
[MUTSUMI]
Be careful, everyone.

96
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,333
--[IGARASHI] You okay?
--[MUTSUMI] I'm fine.

97
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,666
[IGARASHI]
Gotta watch your step, man.

98
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,333
[MUTSUMI]
Right. I'm sorry.

99
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,666
[NANASHIMA] It's way too
easy to slip in here.

100
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,625
Would've been too dangerous
for you and Serinuma.

101
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,166
That's so true.

102
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,375
I'm glad you all
decided to come.

103
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,708
Thank you.

104
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,833
Hey... One sec.

105
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,958
[MUTSUMI]
Yes?

106
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,166
[IGARASHI]
I have a question.

107
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,250
Will you tell us how you
feel about Serinuma?

108
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,541
Listen.

109
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,583
So... we all hang around...

110
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,958
...because we all have
feelings for Serinuma.

111
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,833
We were wondering
if you like her.

112
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,583
Yes. I like her.

113
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,916
Yeah, of course you do.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,958
I knew that.

115
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,083
Ya see?
We know our stuff.

116
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,875
Maybe Nishina's intuition
could use a tune-up.

117
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,166
[MUTSUMI]
I like you too, Igarashi.

118
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,916
I love every single person
in our cozy little group!

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,083
Uh... what?

120
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,666
I think you're missing
the point here!

121
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,291
I'm asking if you
like her romantically.

122
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,666
Why do you hang out with us?

123
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,125
If you're trying to get
closer to her, just say it.

124
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,583
What?! There's no way
you're that oblivious!

125
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,875
Sorry.

126
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,666
I don't quite understand;
can you explain it?

127
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,750
Huh?!

128
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,583
Like when your heart starts
poundin' when she's around!

129
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,750
And you don't want to
share her with anyone else!

130
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,583
Yeah!

131
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,833
I'm... still confused.

132
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,416
[NISHINA]
Hey!

133
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,333
[NISHINA] You were gone
so long, we got worried!

134
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,708
[SERINUMA]
How are you doing?

135
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,250
Oh. Well... good.

136
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,416
We're good.

137
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,333
[IGARASHI]
Nothing worth worrying about.

138
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,458
Keep moving.

139
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,500
[SERINUMA]
Okay!

140
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,416
[NISHINA]
It's such a large cave!

141
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,375
[SHINOMIYA]
Still cold.

142
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,166
[NANASHIMA]
Ready to get out.

143
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,791
[NANASHIMA]
Watch your step, Princess.

144
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,166
[SHINOMIYA growls]

145
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,625
Why do you hang out with us?

146
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,666
If you like her...
just say that you do.

147
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,708
Cool?

148
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,500
Hey. Is something
on your mind?

149
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, I was only daydreaming.
Shall we go?

150
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,041
[SERINUMA]
Yep!

151
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,000
[MUTSUMI]
I don't know.

152
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,166
Serinuma has always
been so sweet.

153
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,791
She has the biggest heart
that I've ever known.

154
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,666
Spending time with her
is a lot of fun.

155
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,583
When we're together, I'm happy.

156
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,500
But does that mean that
I have feelings for her?

157
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,833
[SERINUMA]
What's wrong?

158
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,708
Do I have something on my face?

159
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,041
[MUTSUMI]
No.

160
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,375
[NANASHIMA yelps]

161
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,875
Jeez. What now?

162
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,458
Water. It dripped on my head.

163
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,375
[SHINOMIYA]
Oh, yeah?

164
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,916
[ALL yell]

165
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,666
[NANASHIMA]
Why are there so many?!

166
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,000
[IGARASHI]
Just go!

167
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,041
[yelling]

168
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,583
[NANASHIMA]
Crap! I dropped the flashlight!

169
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,375
[NANASHIMA]
Everybody cool?

170
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,375
Uh, guys? Answer!

171
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,500
[NANASHIMA]
Serinuma... Come here.

172
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,333
[NANASHIMA]
Don't worry. I've got you.

173
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,416
Well... happy birthday to me.

174
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,250
[BOTH yell]

175
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,041
You're not Serinuma!

176
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,250
I'm glad it was me!

177
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,750
You'd tried to grab her
and get all handsy!

178
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,708
[NANASHIMA]
Get away from me!

179
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,500
Hey! Where's Serinuma?

180
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,541
[SHINOMIYA growls]

181
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,791
[IGARASHI]
Mutsumi's gone too.

182
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,791
They aren't here?

183
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,041
Not good.
They could be anywhere!

184
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,208
Um... Guess we're lost too.

185
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,333
That's funny.

186
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,208
[SERINUMA]
Bats... in my hair.

187
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,625
Uh... hello? Where am I?

188
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,958
Guys?

189
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,041
[SERINUMA]
Oh, no. Need light.

190
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,125
Here we go.

191
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,166
[SERINUMA yelps]

192
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,083
[SERINUMA]
Mutsumi?

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,500
For a second I thought
I'd be lost here forever!

194
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,583
You're safe now.

195
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,625
Where's everyone else?

196
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,291
I hope they're together.

197
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,500
Let's catch up to them!

198
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,500
They may not be too far away!

199
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,500
Uh...

200
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,458
[MUTSUMI]
I'm... stuck.

201
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,750
Way back,

202
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,875
I got locked in a
storage room as a child.

203
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,583
It was so petrifying.

204
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,291
Now I freeze up in the dark.

205
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,791
Even the moonlight
couldn't get in.

206
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,333
Just awful.

207
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,041
It was like being trapped in
the middle of a gloomy dark pit.

208
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,083
The howling wind
sounded like a scream.

209
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,208
I thought I was slowly
losing my mind.

210
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,708
I'll never forget.

211
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,666
[SERINUMA] I'm getting the
creeps just thinking about it!

212
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,416
I'm sorry.

213
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,958
What a bother.

214
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,583
The light from your phone should
be enough to get me moving.

215
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,875
Mutsumi.

216
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,916
Well... How about
we walk together?

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,250
I won't let you go.

218
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,416
We'll be okay.
Yep. No need to be scared.

219
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,708
I'm right beside you.

220
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,083
A step at a time.

221
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,791
[SERINUMA]
Now, let's go.

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,041
[MUTSUMI]
Her hand is so warm.

223
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,166
[SERINUMA]
What?

224
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,833
Oh! Look at the lights!

225
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,458
I bet it's our group!

226
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey!

227
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,166
[IGARASHI]
Serinuma!

228
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,375
[SERINUMA]
I knew it!

229
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,541
What a relief.

230
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,583
[laughs]

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Please hold on.

232
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,125
Something wrong?

233
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,083
Well... I'm not sure.

234
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,750
[MUTSUMI]
Don't go.

235
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,291
[SERINUMA]
Mutsumi?

236
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,291
I'm sorry!

237
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,250
Are you that scared of the dark?

238
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,625
Oh! No...

239
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,958
[IGARASHI]
They're over here!

240
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,375
Let's try to stay
together this time.

241
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,500
Yeah, boy am I glad
you caught up with us.

242
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,500
You're safe;
that's what matters.

243
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,000
[MUTSUMI]
What did it mean?

244
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,333
I... don't know.

245
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,416
Oh, yeah.

246
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,833
We found what you
were looking for.

247
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,208
You should check it out!

248
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,250
Yeah? You guys
found the treasure?

249
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,000
[IGARASHI]
Well... You'll see...

250
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,750
[SHINOMIYA]
What a dramatic display.

251
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,625
It has to be fake.

252
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,375
[IGARASHI]
Anyone know how to get up there?

253
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,083
I told you I didn't wanna
come on this stupid trip!

254
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,541
It was a waste of time!

255
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,875
That thing's fake!

256
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,125
Who would go through the
hassle of setting this up?

257
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,541
It's so much effort.

258
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,125
What's the point?

259
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,750
It's... open.

260
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,125
It says that I'm now the
president of the history club.

261
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,041
But I'm already the president.

262
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,250
[NANASHIMA]
We did all this for crap!

263
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,875
[NISHINA] This was
written three years ago.

264
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,125
Hold up, does that mean
we're finding this "treasure"

265
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,166
three years late?

266
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,583
I guess.

267
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,500
We spent our whole day
rooting around in this cave

268
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,208
so the history club founder
could feel like a big shot?

269
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,125
Who's that?

270
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,333
My brother.

271
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,416
[GROUP]
What?

272
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,458
[overlapping chatter]

273
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,833
[SERINUMA] And so our grand
adventure had come to an end!

274
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,708
Or... so we thought.

275
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,875
[STUDENTS chattering]

276
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:07,958
[KAZUMA]
Why, hello.

277
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,375
I'm your new teacher, Kazuma.

278
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,916
Consider it my... pleasure.

279
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,166
What?! Isn't that guy
Mutsumi's brother?

280
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,000
[SERINUMA] A heavy storm
had begun to brew.

281
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,416
[NISHINA] He'll be teaching
Japanese history.

282
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,041
[NANASHIMA]
Ugh. I hate him already.

283
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,333
How are you feeling?

284
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,041
I'm... sorry.

285
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,458
There's no reason for
you to apologize, dude.

286
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,666
[MUTSUMI]
It just felt right.

287
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,833
Teaching. Funny...
He didn't tell you?

288
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,958
You seem so surprised. Why?

289
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:49,791
Well...

290
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,333
My brother lives on his own.

291
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,125
I'm afraid we haven't
kept in touch.

292
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,958
Ah! You must think he sucks.

293
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,833
[MUTSUMI]
It's not that.

294
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,375
[KAZUMA]
Hi, there.

295
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,375
He's quick!

296
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,750
--Sure is.
--Came outta nowhere.

297
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,208
Um... hi.

298
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,166
Hello!

299
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,208
[laughs]

300
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,916
You're lookin' handsome, Asuma.

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,166
[MUTSUMI]
Oh, thanks, um...

302
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,250
You didn't tell me you
were student teaching.

303
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,541
[KAZUMA laughs]
Well now you know!

304
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,708
[MUTSUMI]
Yeah.

305
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,875
I kept quiet about it
as long as I could

306
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,791
because I wanted
to surprise you!

307
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,291
You really got me!

308
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,583
[SERINUMA] Now that's what
I call brotherly love!

309
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,416
[NISHINA]
Give me more!

310
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,041
And who are you?
Friends of his?

311
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,750
Yeah. Kinda.

312
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,750
[KAZUMA]
I see!

313
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,250
They are.

314
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,291
Yesterday we searched for
treasure and had a great time.

315
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,125
Oh? Treasure? Where?

316
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,166
Nearby?

317
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,208
Yeah!

318
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,875
The one you hid in that
cave three years ago!

319
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,875
Um... What cave?

320
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,583
Liar!

321
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,375
Wait, you really don't remember?

322
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,000
You even drew a map and
hid it in the clubroom.

323
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,166
So clever!

324
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,208
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

325

Oh!

00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,583
You mean the map I hid in Mount
Fuji that led to the treasure.

327
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,208
The treasure that would
declare whoever found it

328
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,708
the appointed president
for the history club

00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,166

for you to find that?

So which one of you delightful

Uh... I think you're
a bit confused.

What? I can't be.

You shouldn't be wasteful.

I'd be thrilled to
date the entire group!

I'm sure you
don't mean all of us.

to do with anything?

to me, you sexy Adonis.

Ugh! Mutsumi's brother
is depraved!

Oh, you're right.

00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,916
I should head back.

Too free.

Yeah. I can tell
that you're related.

Your big brother seems just as
kind as you are, Mutsumi!

How unusual.

[MALE TEACHER 01A]
Listen up, everyone.

The student teacher will be
observing our classroom.

I know he's handsome,

but I'm the one who
doles out the Fs.

He's a good teacher.

His lessons were interesting
and easy to understand.

take long for the boys

to start liking him too!

00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,375
I've got some time
before my show begins.

This place is so
fancy I can't relax!

425
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,000
[KAZUMA] So, you're a member
of the history club.

Yes, I am!

[KAZUMA]
Tell me, how's he doing?

428
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,416
Do you think he's a good leader?

429
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,000
Asuma. He's always
been rather meek.

430
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,583
I wondered if
the job suited him.

431
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:49,083
When it comes down to it,
he's not an assertive guy.

432
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,958
I think he's
doing a great job.

433
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,125
[KAZUMA]
That's good.

434
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,958
I know he kind of
stays in his own world.

435
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,208
Makes him gullible.

436
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,791
When were little I used
to pull pranks on him.

437
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,791
Couldn't help it!

438
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,333
He was so cute when he cried.

439
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,291
[SERINUMA]
What kind of pranks?

440
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,500
[gasps] Oh!

441
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,541
Did you ever lock him
in a storage house?

442
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,666
Yeah! That kind of stuff!

443
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,541
It was at our grandpa's
place in the country.

444
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,583
I forgot about him all night!

445
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,041
How heartless.

446
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,750
That prank traumatized Mutsumi.

447
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,416
We got stuck in a cave.

448
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,833
And he was too afraid to move!

00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,291
Oh.

450
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,916
Heh. Did my brother put you
through a lot of trouble?

451
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,416
No! I wasn't even
implying that!

452
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,125
You know what, though?

453
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,500
So Mutsumi isn't exactly
the assertive type.

454
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,833
It's true.

455
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,916
But I don't think all guys
have to be that way.

456
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,208
He's kind.

One of my best friends, and I
always feel safe around him.

Looks like he's growing
up to be quite a man.

00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,583
--[SERINUMA] Hi!
--[KAZUMA] That's dangerous!

487
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,583
You need a hand?

488
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,750
[SERINUMA]
I'm fine! Almost got it!

489
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:23,625
How are you?

490
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,958
I'm good.

491
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,041
I have something here
that I wanted to give you.

492
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,166
It's nothing too big.

493
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,958
This is from that show you
told me you liked, right?

494
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,458
[SERINUMA yells]

495
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,583
That's... That's the
legendary <i>Mirage Saga</i>

496
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,041
local collaboration prize!

497
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,916
I've never seen it before!

498
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,125
How did you manage to find it?

499
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,125
I won it at the
arcade a while back!

500
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,791
It was sitting in my house
collecting dust all this time!

501
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,625
Well, well!

502
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,333
Good to know you'll enjoy it.

503
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,458
Our little secret.

504
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,541
But why?

505
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,208
Are you sure you
wanna give this to me?

506
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,958
[KAZUMA]
Mm-hmm.

507
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,208
[SERINUMA]
I can't!

508
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,458
I wouldn't feel right
taking this from you.

509
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,333
It's too expensive!

510
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,416
Look out!

511
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,041
[KAZUMA]
That was close.

512
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,041
Are you okay?

513
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:07,875
[SERINUMA]
Yeah.

514
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,916
Wow. I didn't see it.

515
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,166
Thank yo--[gasps]

516
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,333
[SERINUMA]
Too close!

517
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,791
[SERINUMA]
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to--

518
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:30,916
[KAZUMA]
Know what?

519
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,916
You're the cutest girl
I've ever seen.

520
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,166
[KAZUMA yelps]

521
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,791
[MUTSUMI]
Kazuma!

522
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,500
What was that?

523
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,375
Mutsumi!

524
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,083
I can't accept that behavior.

525
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,708
It's inappropriate
for a student teacher

526
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,875
to make a move on
one of his pupils.

527
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,416
So... I can woo her
once my term is up?

528
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,000
You have no good
reason to stop me.

529
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,541
I do.

530
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,375
[MUTSUMI]
You see... 

531
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,375
She's my girlfriend.

532
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,041
Please stay away from her.

533
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,708
[SHINOMIYA]
Sorry I'm late!

534
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,625
[MUTSUMI] Oh!
It's not like you to be tardy.

535
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,250
[SHINOMIYA] A little old lady
started talking to me

536
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,458
on the train. She said I looked
just like her grandson

537
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,500
and wouldn't let me go!

538
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,750
[NISHINA]
That's adorable.

539
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,000
Did your cheeks get raw
from all the pinching?

540
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,083
[SHINOMIYA] It's a lot easier
for me to talk to older women

541
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,250
than girls my own age.

542
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,750
[MUTSUMI]
How interesting!

543
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,083
[SHINOMIYA] I'd like to think
it means that I'm mature!

544
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,000
[NISHINA] I suppose,
though I have to wonder

545
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,125
if you're just afraid
of being shot down.

546
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,458
[SHINOMIYA]
No!

547
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,750
Everyone has a type they're
not compatible with!

548
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,083
[NISHINA]
I don't.

549
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,333
When I meet someone,
it only takes a few moments

550
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,958
for us to warm up to each other.
