483
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,291
[MUTSUMI]
My turn! Draw!

484
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,541
I end my go with
one card face down.

485
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,708
In defense!

486
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,708
[KAZUMA]
I activate my skill card!

487
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,166
Grade S enhancement!

488
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,958
Defense up 2000!

489
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,791
Oh. Wow.

490
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,250
Kazuma used a quick attack,
then came from behind.

491
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,791
His tactics are slowly
chipping away at Mutsumi.

492
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,708
They're both so
good at this game.

493
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,291
Kazuma fights aggressively.

494
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,750
No matter the cost,
Mutsumi is calm.

495
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,458
He's just using technique.

496
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,750
[SERINUMA]
Such a good battle!

497
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,041
[GROUP]
No idea what's happening!

498
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,375
Mutsumi is being cornered!
He needs our help!

499
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,916
Cheer! It's the only way
we can help him win!

500
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,166
The power of friendship
will keep him strong!

501
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,625
Oh! Sure thing!

502
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,833
[GROUP]
Asuma, you're our dude!

503
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,250
If you can't win,
then we're all screwed!

504
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,333
I know you can do it!

505
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,583
Kick his butt!

506
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,208
[MUTSUMI]
Reinforce rifle unit!

507
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,833
Encouragement squad!

508
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,958
Activate trap... Kunoichi!

509
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,166
Skill card...
Final Burst Strike!

510
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,625
This is amazing!

511
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,958
Mutsumi finally
has the upper hand!

512
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,333
Looks like you haven't changed
a bit, my sweet brother.

513
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,916
Always a fair
and frontal attack.

514
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,083
Your kindness is your weakness.

515
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,125
The general... has fallen.

516
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,416
Mutsumi!

517
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,958
[MUTSUMI]
I win.

518
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,583
[MUTSUMI]
Body double. Spy.

519
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,916
Wow. He won the match!

520
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,750
[cheering]

521
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,416
Don't know the rules
of the game or how he won,

522
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,791
but I'm glad he pulled it off!

523
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:05,958
You da man! Woo!

524
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,916
Congratulations, Mutsumi!

525
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,083
You had the nerve to use
a body double and a spy?

526
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,375
Really? You?

527
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,875
Funny... never suspected
you would play a hand

528
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,583
that's so close
to breaking the rules.

529
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,291
I'm sorry.

530
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm afraid I couldn't let you
have your way this time.

531
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,916
Well done.

532
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,083
From now on,
if you want something...

533
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,541
Fight for it.

534
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,791
I'll do that.

535
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,375
[applause]

536
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,625
I'll put this back.

537
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,875
Sure. Thank you.

538
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,791
[SERINUMA]
Mutsumi! Congratulations!

539
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:54,625
[MUTSUMI chuckles]

540
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,500
Ha! I'm so happy!

541
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,291
Now you get to keep whatever
it was you were fighting for!

542
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,916
Hmm, so...

543
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,625
What was it that was
so important to keep?

544
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,583
Someone who's precious to me.

545
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,375
[MUTSUMI]
I like you.

546
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,625
I do.

547
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,666
[GROUP yelling]

548
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:51,833
[NAKANO]
Kae, why do you think we like it

549
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,083
when boys are together?

550
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,375
[SERINUMA]
There's a whole list of reasons!

551
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,458
It can be beautiful,
heart-wrenching, powerful.

552
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,125
Oh, I just love it!

553
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,541
[NAKANO] Do you think
you'll ever take a step

554
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,208
out of the shadows and
actually be with a guy yourself?

555
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,791
[SERINUMA]
You never know!

556
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,333
Every so often I'll think about
it and my heart beats faster!

557
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,708
What do you think it means?

558
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,041
[NAKANO] I think it means
that it might be time

559
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,375
to make your decision!

560
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,708
[SERINUMA]
Really? Um...

561
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,208
Are you sure it's not just
time for a new episode

562
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,208
of <i>Katchu Ranbu</i> ?

563
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,750
Maybe the manga
has a new chapter!

564
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,375
Uh... I think I'm ready.
