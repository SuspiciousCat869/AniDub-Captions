1
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,500
Igarashi, you're crazy.

2
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,500
You're really gonna
use that dorky keychain

3
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,500
Serinuma gave us?

4
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,916
Ah. Well, yeah.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,458
It was a present.

6
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,875
Why is that crazy?

7
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,166
Dude, are you serious?

8
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,541
[SERINUMA] These are the
new mini action figures!

9
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,416
This is the
first one I've held!

10
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,750
Mini Shion is adorable!

11
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,291
As a thank you
for this evening,

12
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,041
I'd like all of you to have one.

13
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,041
Tonight was so special to me.

14
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,458
[laughs]

15
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,000
She gave us matching
anime character keychains!

16
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,666
I'm not gonna be
caught dead with that!

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,750
[laughs]

18
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,625
[NANASHIMA] You don't see
me laughing about it.

19
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,333
Guess she wants the four
of us walking around

20
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,833
showcasing those things
like we're her little fanclub?

21
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:32,958
What a turn-off.

22
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,166
I dunno.
It's kinda interesting.

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,291
No, it's dumb.

24
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,083
Maybe you should
go ahead and give up.

25
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,250
If you back out, that's one less
guy I have to compete with.

26
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,791
Yeah. You'd love for me
to do that, wouldn't ya?

27
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,791
[NAKANO]
Comin' in!

28
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,833
Leave it to me!

29
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,833
[grunts]

30

[GIRLS cheering]

31
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,541
[GIRLS]
That was awesome!

32
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,041
Go Serinuma!

33
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,541
I always knew you
were pretty athletic,

34
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,375
but I had no idea
you were this good!

35
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,958
Those moves were impressive!

36
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,458
My body feels so light!

37
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,791
I could play any sport I want!

38
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,416
Wow... let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

39
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,708
[NANASHIMA]
Now that I think about it,

40
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,541
she was always good at
those jumping exercises.

41
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,833
They were intense.

42
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,916
[clapping]

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,916
I've never seen anyone
pull off a receive like that!

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,041
I've never seen
anyone suck up so much.

45
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,666
The soccer club needs help?

46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,875
That's too bad!

47
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,000
What happened?

48
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:29,875
Well...

49
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,250
Normally we have eleven members,

50
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,208
which is just enough
to play a game.

51
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,583
We have a practice
match next weekend,

52
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,208
but we're down one player.

53
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,916
I got injured.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,458
[GIRL STUDENT 02D] Since you
seem so good at sports,

55
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,000
we were wondering if you could
take her spot for the game.

56
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,375
We'd be so grateful!

57
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,708
[GIRL STUDENT 02E]
Please!

58
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,875
You assumed she
could play soccer?

59
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,625
I've never seen Serinuma
kick a ball in her life.

60
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,083
Okay!

61
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:51,791
Huh?!

62
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,833
You really will?

63
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,666
Thanks a lot!
You're a lifesaver!

64
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,000
Uh, wait a second.

65
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,000
Maybe think about it a
little before you say yes.

66
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,458
It'll be fine!

67
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,958
Believe it or not, I actually
know a lot about soccer!

68
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,125
Huh?!

69
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,916
I'm a fan of...
<i>Captain Tsubasa</i> ,

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,041
<i>Inazuma Eleven</i> ,
and <i>Giant Killing</i> !

71
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,750
[NAKANO gasps]

72
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,000
A soccer game!
Are you prepared to compete?

73
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,416
Sure am!

74
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,416
I've spent years studying
by watching sports anime!

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,625
[IGARASHI]
Wow.

76
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,916
[SHINOMIYA]
Better than nothing.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,666
[NANASHIMA]
Is this chick for real?

78
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,666
But still... It'll be
my first time playing,

79
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,541
so I definitely want to
squeeze in a practice or two.

80
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,375
Feel free to skip the
history club meetings

81
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,958
this week while you're training.

82
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,708
I'll cheer you on.

83
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,416
I'm supporting you too!
I'll even watch the game!

84
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,666
Would you allow me to coach you?

85
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,291
We could run a few
drills after school

86
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,750
and work on your technique.

87
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,625
Yes! That's perfect!

88
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,750
You guys are making me
so excited to do this!

89
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,333
I appreciate your support!

90
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,666
[NANASHIMA]
This is just sad.

91
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,125
[IGARASHI]
Just one problem.

92
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,583
I have my own practice so
I'll have to duck out early.

93
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,916
But I bet Nanashima
could take it from there.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,708
He used to play soccer way back.

95
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,125
Yeah, there's no way
I'm doin' that.

96
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,208
It takes years to
develop that kinda stuff.

97
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,750
Doesn't happen overnight.

98
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,916
You let her on the field now,

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,833
and she's gonna slow
the whole team down.

100
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,291
Mark my words.

101
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,041
I'm gonna spend the
whole week practicing

102
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,958
so I'll be ready for anything.

103
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,708
Just take it from Tsubasa!

104
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,583
"The ball is my friend"... Yep!

105
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,958
Fangirling over
an anime about soccer

106
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,083
doesn't mean you
can play the game!

107
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,291
You'll look like an idiot!

108
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,875
An underdog can rise
to the top if they put

109
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,208
their heart into the work!

110
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,916
You planning on having
a little training montage

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,375
or somethin'?

112
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,250
You need to wake up and stop
living in a fantasy world!

113
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,250
Why are you being
so heartless, Nanashima?

114
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's all calm down. It's okay.

115
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,333
Yeah, take it easy!

116
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,958
No reason to get this upset.

[NANASHIMA, SERINUMA growl]

118
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,875
I'm not gonna have any
part in this in this joke.

119
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,333
Do what you want.

120
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,250
[SERINUMA]
What's his problem?

121
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,791
I don't care what he says!

122
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,250
I'm going to put my all into
this and prove him wrong!

123
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,875
I can do it!

124
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,083
[SERINUMA]
Nice to meet you!

125
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,333
[SOCCER TEAM]
Thanks for coming!

126
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,166
All right, let's kick things off
with some warm-ups! Cool?

127
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,166
[SERINUMA]
Okay!

128
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,291
We'll start with some stretches,

129
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,041
then its twenty laps
around the school.

130
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,250
I'm so dead.

131

Fight! On! Fight! On!

132
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,541
Fight! On! Fight! On!

133
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,375
[SOCCER PLAYER 02A]
Okay!

134
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,916
Sit-ups and reserve sit-ups!

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,208
Five sets of twenty!

136
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,250
Put your hands
behind your head

137
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,833
and keep your legs together.

138
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,666
[SOCCER PLAYER 02A] Next is
two sets of 10 push-ups!

139
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,625
[SOCCER PLAYER 02A]
Deep stretches now!

140
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,541
I'm dying!

141
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,041
[SOCCER PLAYER 02A]
Time to start practice!

142
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,958
[SOCCER PLAYER 02A]
That's all for today, ladies!

143
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,791
[SOCCER TEAM cheering]

144
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,958
Your first practice.

145
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,291
Well, how are you feeling?

146
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,416
I'm... great, why do you ask?

147
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,750
[IGARASHI] You
look like a newborn giraffe

148
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,125
learning how to walk.

149
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,500
[SERINUMA]
I feel... fantastic!

150
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,708
[SERINUMA]
I'm a filthy liar!

151
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,750
This is ridiculous!

152
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,541
I've never been
an outdoor person!

153
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,541
I don't do sports!
I don't do sweating!

154
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,291
I don't even think
I have muscles!

155
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:57,541
My body will never
forgive me for this abuse!

156
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,875
Maybe you should take it easy
for the rest of the night.

157
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,750
I got this! Bring it on!

158
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,583
That's not too tight, is it?

159
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,333
Wrapping your foot limits
the range of motion

160
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,750
so you'll be less
likely to get a sprain.

161
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,833
Thanks! That's much better!

162

You're the best, Shinomiya!

Ugh. She's terrible.

[GIRL STUDENT 02D] Maybe we
should look for someone else.

Do you think we'll be able to
find someone last minute though?

I guess anyone would
be better than she is.

Why did I take up for her?

Every time I kick the ball,

it flies back and
smacks me in the head!

Every time?
That's actually impressive.

want to be away from me.

been playing soccer for years.

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,250
Aren't you a freshman
or something?

321
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,750
Have you even been able to
keep up with what we're doing?

322
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't worry about me.

323
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,000
In prep school we've been
doing problems like this

324
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,208
for a while now.

325
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,916
By the way, you put
the wrong answer

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,375
on question number two.

327
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,916
Would you like me to explain it?

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,125
Oh, yeah, he's right.

329
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,833
Looks like you messed up
on the formula.

[NANASHIMA gasps]

331
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,708
I did that on purpose!

332
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,875
Right. Your stupidity
is a choice, huh?

333
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,125
You expect anyone to
believe that you wanted

334
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,791
to put the wrong answer down?

335
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,166
[IGARASHI] Nana, being caught in
a lie is no reason to get upset.

336
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,750
[NANASHIMA] All right, smart
guy, you and me! Let's go!

337
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,583

Get out of here!

all of our customers that

339
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,166
though we do appreciate
your business,

340
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,291
this is a family establishment
that does not condone

341

loud outbursts,

342

or coarse language of any kind.

343
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,208
[SERINUMA] We couldn't
stay in the library,

344
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,666
and the restaurant is
a definite no-go.

345
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,125
[NANASHIMA] Not many places
around here to study.

346

[SHINOMIYA]
There sure aren't.

347

[SERINUMA, IGARASHI]
No thanks to you two.

348
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,541
I know where we can go!

349

How about Serinuma's?

All right with you?

Huh?

00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,625
[SERINUMA]
What do I do?!

353
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,166
It's not like I mind everyone
using my bedroom as a workspace.

354

They were awesome enough
to help me, after all.

[SERINUMA]
Just one little problem.

356

They don't need
to see all of this.

357
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,291
Jeez, it's bad.

358
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,333
I can't let them in on my shame.

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,791
They already know about you,
so that's no big deal.

360
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,750
It's those I'm not sure about.

361
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,875
I can't have this kind
of stuff lying around

362
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,750
when real boys come over.

363

[SERINUMA]
Okay!

Into the closet you go!

Forgive me, treasures!
I'll let you breathe again soon!

Until then, you're safe
and sound in here!

Hey, we're here!

Sorry I don't have much space.

[IGARASHI]
This is perfect.

Ah, thank you.

372
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,916
I managed to pick up a little
before you got here,

373
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,791
but didn't have time
to do too much.

00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,083
I brought your guests some tea.

What handsome

--[SERINUMA] No, no, no, no!
--[GROUP] What was that?

380
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,291
We don't need
any room service,

381
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,583
and why do you look
like a clown?

382
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,541
Sweetie.
So much to learn.

383
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,708
Now... when you invite
men into your home,

384
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,500
the least you could do
is whet their appetite

385
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,750
while looking your best.

386
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,291
They can whet their
own appetites after we

finish studying!

[SHINOMIYA]
So this is Serinuma's bedroom.

389
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,250
Man, this is lame!

390
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,958
Why don't you guys beat it and
give us a little privacy here?

391
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,166
[SERINUMA]
Um...

392
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,541
I think this part is
a little complicated.

393
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,625
Which part?

394
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,250
Question three.

395
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,250
Please... tutor.

396
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,291
Right now.

397
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,875
I could be teaching
her anatomy right now!

398
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,333
Do you have to be so lewd?

399
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,625
From the looks of your answers,

400
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,458
I wouldn't trust you
to teach her the alphabet.

401
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,041
Shut it, baby-face!

402
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,291
It's true.

403
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,875
Sitting in a girl's room
with three other guys

404
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,750
isn't the ideal scenario.

[NANASHIMA]
Yeah.

No.

to get any one-on-one time

with her tonight.

Well, maybe we can still
get a peek at the goods.

[NANASHIMA screams]

422

I talked the store
clerk into giving me

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,750
the display.

424
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,958
It's usually up for decoration.

wouldn't be weirded out.

00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,000
[TAKURO]
But what about this?

480
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,625
[SERINUMA screams]

481
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,416
[TAKURO]
Check it out!

482
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,375
She's a disgusting perv!

483
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,708
[SERINUMA]
Will you stop?

484
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,291
I'm allowed to be interested
in anything I want!

485
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,916
[GROUP]
Oh. It's boy love.

486
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,125
I hate you!

487
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,291
You gonna cry?

488
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,458
Pardon me.

489
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,875
If you don't mind, we're trying
to get some studying done.

490
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,166
[MUTSUMI]
Now, if you'll please...

491
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,208
--[TAKURO] Wait a sec!
--...excuse us!

492
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,458
I'm... sorry about
the way he acted.

493
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,708
Okay, everyone.

494
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,583
Why don't we help her
tidy up all these books?

495
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,458
[GROUP]
Yep. Sure thing.

496
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,000
There's no need
for you to do that!

497
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,666
I can handle all of this myself!

498
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,750
[MUTSUMI]
Wait.

499
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,750
Don't be so rough with them.

500
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,583
Aren't they important to you?

501
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,666
[SERINUMA]
Yes, they are.

502
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,916
[GROUP]
Thanks for having us!

503
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,375
[SERINUMA]
Oh. Mutsumi.

504
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,708
I don't know how to thank you
for all you've done for me.

505
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,708
[MUTSUMI]
There's no need.

506
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,708
Will you apologize
to your brother?

507
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,875
I acted so rudely to him.

508
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,500
I don't think
you were rude at all.

509
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,875
He had it coming!

510
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,000
[MUTSUMI]
Oh, I got this for you.

511
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,250
It's for the test.

512
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,000
[MUTSUMI] If you're ever torn
between different options,

513
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,541
this will help.

514
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,791
You can tilt luck in your favor.

515
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,000
[chuckles]

516
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,958
What a wonderful present!

517
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,750
[MUTSUMI]
Oh... you three.

518
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,375
Here's one for each of you.

519
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,625
Good luck on all of your tests.

520
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,625
Wow. Thanks a lot.

521
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,041
[IGARASHI] That was the
most fun I've ever had

522
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,666
in a girl's bedroom,
and all we did was study!

523
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,666
Unbelievable.

524
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,166
[NANASHIMA]
Tonight was awesome.

525
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,750
This is his way of apologizing?

526
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,875
Forgiven.

527
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,666
I passed!
No summer classes for me!

528
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,625
This girl is ready for vacation!

529
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,666
[GROUP]
Congratulations!

530
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,208
We should go hang
out at the pool!

531
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,916
That sounds like a good idea!

532
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,125
Just the two of us!

533
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,416
There are historical
sites we could visit.

534
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,958
[SERINUMA]
Uh...

535
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,458
[SERINUMA]
And so I chose... 

536
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,250
[SERINUMA, NAKANO screaming]

537
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,208
You're the greatest
boy band ever!

538
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,791
[SERINUMA] To attend every
single one of the otaku events

539
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,000
with A!

540
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,375
[SHINOMIYA]
When I was a kid,

541
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,666
I stayed down in
the dumps a lot.

542
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,041
[MUTSUMI]
Why?

543
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:54,833
[SHINOMIYA] People teased me
for being too delicate!

544
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,208
It was frustrating.

545
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,166
[NANASHIMA] Yeah, well I've
always pretty popular

546
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,166
because of soccer.

547
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,750
Igarashi has me beat though.

548
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,708
[IGARASHI] That's because I'm
still playing in high school!

549
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,791
Why did you ever quit?

550
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,333
[NANASHIMA]
It's exhausting!

551
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,541
How am supposed to do that plus
everything else I wanna do?

552
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,666
[MUTSUMI]
That reminds me--

553
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,500
The cultural festival
is coming up.

554
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,208
There are so many
fun things there!

555
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,000
[SHINOMIYA] Unless you're
stuck having to wear a dress.

556
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,041
[NANASHIMA] Aww, but you're
such a pretty princess!

557
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,333
[SHINOMIYA]
Do you ever stop talking?

558
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,666
[IGARASHI]
Dress or no dress,

559
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,375
I'm pumped to see what's
going on at the festival!
