1
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,208
[SERINUMA] A new <i>Mirage Saga</i>
chapter just got posted!

2
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,250
So nice...

3
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,708
Terra and Shion.

4
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,000
Heaven. You two are perfect!

5
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,875
[SERINUMA yelling]

6
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:58,958
[SERINUMA]
Don't think about it!

7
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,125
Don't think about it!

8
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,500
You've gotta stop
obsessing over this!

9
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,208
[NISHINA] We'll have a problem
if you don't take me seriously.

10
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,666
It was a joke!

11
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,666
I'm sorry!

12
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,541
You looked so precious,
I couldn't resist

13
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,375
having a little
bit of fun with you!

14
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,833
Oh, right!

15
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,750
You really had me going there.

16
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,708
[SERINUMA]
She's such a troublemaker!

17
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,125
[NISHINA]
Do forgive me!

18
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,291
[SERINUMA] It's not like the
kiss meant anything!

19
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,583
Physical contact
is perfectly normal.

20
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,875
Snap out of it!

21
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,666
What's this?!

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,708
[GROUP]
A Valentine's contest?

23
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,333
[SERINUMA]
I saw it on their website!

24
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,666
Create a treat inspired
by a <i>Mirage Saga</i> Character.

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,208
I have to win. I need it!

26
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,666
There's even a grand prize!

27
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,500
A drawing by the lead designer!

28
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,625
I'd have to be insane
to let this rare opportunity

29
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,791
slip out of my fingers!

30
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,375
No! I can't let that happen!

31
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,250
Let's see. What to make...

32
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,333
[NISHINA]
Serinuma!

33
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:57,875
Hello there.

34
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,166
Oh. Hi!

35
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,416
Please move.

36
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,583
I'd like to have an intimate
discussion with Serinuma.

37
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,000
No surprise.

38
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,583
A little bit of advice for ya...
She's not interested.

39
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,166
Get lost. Now.

40
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,458
Hello!

41
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,416
You're entering the
Valentine contest, right?

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,750
Of course! What about you?

43
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,625
[NISHINA]
Yes!

44
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,833
It's exciting! Any ideas yet?

45
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:22,000
[NISHINA] I have few things
in mind, but I'm still deciding.

46
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,916
If you have any free time,

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
how about we try
each other's recipes?

48
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,166
Uh...!

49
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,416
Hey! You've spent
enough time with her!

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,416
You two are more
than welcome to join us.

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,875
Help yourselves.

52
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,958
Perhaps we should invite
Mutsumi and Shinomiya as well.

53
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,291
Let's do that.

54
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,041
And besides... I wager
that it'll be a lot of fun

55
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,000
to see you boys aching
to sample desserts

56
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,541
you'll never get to eat.

57
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,416
[NANASHIMA, IGARASHI]
She's such a jerk!

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,416
I'll be there!

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,166
I can make my own
desserts anyway!

60
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,708
Be my guest!

61
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,166
[SERINUMA] Are you ready to
make our chocolate character?

62
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,791
[NISHINA]
Absolutely!

63
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,458
Today we can try
a few things to see

64
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,875
what works best for us!

65
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,750
First, you choose
a picture of a character.

66
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,791
[NISHINA]
Isn't this from my <i>doujinshi</i> ?

67
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,666
Yeah! It's one of my favorites.

68
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,000
I should have asked you.

69
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,666
Would it be all right if
I used it for the contest?

70
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,208
Yes!

71
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,333
I'll draw a hundred more for
you if it would make you happy.

72
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,625
[SERINUMA]
You're so kind.

73
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,166
What do we do after that?

74
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,291
[SERINUMA] First, copy the
picture onto parchment paper

75
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,041
with a pencil.

76
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,083
Flip it over and trace the
image with a chocolate pen.

77
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,000
Then put it on the fridge
until it hardens.

78
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,458
Fill in the empty spaces
with colored chocolate,

79
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,166
take away the parchment
paper and voilà!

80
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,708
All done!

81
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,916
[GROUP]
Whoa!

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,833
[NANASHIMA]
It's so cool!

83
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,000
That's incredible!

84
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,458
With a picture like that,
they'll give you

85
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,875
the win for sure.

86
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,083
[SERINUMA]
It's not good enough!

87
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,208
This piece of trash isn't
capturing Shion's angelic beauty

88
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,875
at all!

89
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,125
[SERINUMA]
I've failed him!

90
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,250
I devour this pathetic
tribute as a sacrifice!

91
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,708
[NANASHIMA]
Please stop...

92
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,458
I think everyone chooses
character chocolates first.

93
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,625
I need ideas.

94
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,166
That's true.

95
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,291
If you'd like to stand out,
you'll need to be more original.

96
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,875
Let's make the piece 3-D.

97
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,250
3-D?

98
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,791
One second... a little...

99
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,541
...like this!

100
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,791
No way!

101
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,541
Nothing less from Yokoshima.

102
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,833
Brilliance pours from
everything you create.

103
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,125
Happy to help.

104
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,583
Together, you and I
can reach the stars!

105
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,583
Okay!

106
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,208
We're still here, ya know!

107
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,250
[NANASHIMA]
I'm done!

108
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,416
Mine turned out awesome!

109
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,208
My flower is the best!

110
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,458
Yes, it is.

111
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,625
Don't forget we're
here to support Serinuma!

112
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,458
[IGARASHI] She's been working
with that thing for hours,

113
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,291
but hasn't improved at all.

114
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,541
[SERINUMA]
I don't get this.

115
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,541
Why is it so tough to
make something in 3-D?

116
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,875
Aren't I in 3-D?
Or is that 4-D?

117
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,416
People make art look too easy.

118
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,958
Stop thinking and start working!

119
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,375
If you can't figure this out,
you won't make the deadline!

120
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,875
I'll help you.

121
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,916
You need to relax and let
yourself have fun with it, okay?

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,958
Yeah.

123
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,958
Thank you for the advice.

124
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,375
[SERINUMA]
She's so close!

125
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,500
[NANASHIMA]
Hey!

126
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,708
Let her focus!

127
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,541
Call me protective,
but I still don't think

128
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,291
you and Serinuma
should be left alone!

129
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,333
Neither do I!

130
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,750
[NISHINA]
You're too rough.

131
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,500
You said it yourself...
We're both girls, so why worry?

132
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,583
I disagree.

133
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,416
Personally, I think
Nana is dead on.

134
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,750
So why are you doing
all this for Serinuma?

135
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,708
[NISHINA] I suppose you could
say I'm drawn to things

136
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,666
that are cute and beautiful.

137
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,208
I can't help myself.

138
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,458
You're saying you only
like her for her looks?

139
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,041
I assure you there's
more to it than that.

140
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,375
Actually...

141
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,166
That sounds more like
your character than mine.

142
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,458
Yes! It took me over
three days to complete,

143
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,833
but it's done!

144
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,958
[GROUP] That thing doesn't
look like Shion.

145
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,625
[SERINUMA]
It's terrible, isn't it?

146
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,208
I worked on it for so long,
I can't tell anymore!

147
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,375
[NANASHIMA] It's okay!
I'd totally eat that thing!

148
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,416
[MUTSUMI] It's got uniqueness
only a true artist

149
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,583
could capture!

150
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,125
They're right!
Your eyes are drawn to it.

151
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,500
I'd call it an
eccentric masterpiece!

152
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,250
[SERINUMA]
Eccentric?

153
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,125
Idiot!

154
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,166
I didn't mean it! Sorry!

155
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,291
If you're comfortable with it,

156
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,041
why don't you submit my design
using your name instead?

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,916
No way!

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,375
I wouldn't feel
right doing that.

159
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,541
Thanks!

160
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,958
Wait a sec.
Isn't the deadline tomorrow?

161
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,541
If you wanna win that contest,

162
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,125
using Nishina's chocolate
might be the safer bet.

163
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,291
[GROUP]
That's true.

164
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,500
[SERINUMA] I spent so
much time practicing.

165
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,000
[SERINUMA]
It's so sweet.

166
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,958
Everything is clear now.

167
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,625
I know what I have to do.

168
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,416
What? You ended up sending
in the one you made?

169
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,458
You did?

170
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,875
Was there something
wrong with mine?

171
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,375
Not at all.

172
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,416
I thought about how it was
supposed to be a Valentine.

173
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,041
It's special when you
get something like that

174
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,500
from another person.

175
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,958
It was hard to look at,

176
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,541
but it came straight
from my heart.

177
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,708
There's no way I could
use anyone else's.

178
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,666
I'm really sorry
for wasting your time!

179
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't worry!

180
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,750
You're such a loving person.

181
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,000
That's what makes you wonderful.

182
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,125
Well, what a nice
thing for you to say!

183
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,375
I almost forgot.

184
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,791
Here you go!

185
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,208
It's a small gift to say thanks
for being so nice to me.

186
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,500
I hope you like it.

187
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,500
This chocolate is really good.

188
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,583
Yeah.

189
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,125
She's pretty cute, huh?

190
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,500
You're saying you only
like her for her looks?

191
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,666
That sounds more like
your character than mine.

192
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,416
[IGARASHI] In the beginning,
it was about her looks.

193
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,791
But now...

194
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,166
[IGARASHI]
I don't wanna give her up.

195
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,041
I had no way of knowing that
a time was coming very soon

196
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,250
where my feelings
would be put to the test.

197
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,125
[IGARASHI]
Serinuma?

198
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,791
Oh. Hi!

199
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,250
[NAKANO]
Huh?

200
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,958
[NAKANO]
Kae?

201
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,250
Yeah? What's up?

202
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,958
Uh, what... what happened?

203
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,916
It's just been a... weekend!

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,500
[SERINUMA laughs]
Funny story!

205
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,875
I had a ton of that Valentine
chocolate left over,

206
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,375
and you can't let that stuff
go to waste, right?

207
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,291
Over the weekend
I started nibbling...

208
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,791
...and nibbling...
and before I knew it,

209
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,291
they were all gone!

210
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,166
Next thing I knew
I looked like this!

211
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,291
Crazy, huh?

212
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,791
Good morning!

213
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,125
Oh, really? Is it?

214
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,416
Are you feeling okay?

215
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,583
We learned in health class that
it's unsafe for your weight

216
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,125
to fluctuate quickly.

217
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,458
I appreciate you checking
on me, but I feel great!

218
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,500
[laughs]

219
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,291
Nana!

220
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,791
[SERINUMA] I'll go get the
teacher! Just hold on!

221
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,083
[SHINOMIYA]
What's wrong?!

222
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,250
[yelps]

223
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,083
[SERINUMA]
Shinomiya!

224
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,416
Oh, no! Please wake up!

225
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,916
We need help!

226
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,375
[SHINOMIYA] A dream. A dream.
This is a dream!

227
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,666
I'll close my eyes and drift
into a peaceful slumber,

228
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,750
and when I wake up Serinuma
will be normal again!

229
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,208
Right. She's gonna have
to lose the weight!

230
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,916
[IGARASHI] I don't think there's
anything we can do about it.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,666
Well not with that attitude.

232
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,500
And don't say anything about
her having a good personality.

233
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,750
You're as bad as we are,
Mr. High and Mighty!

234
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,458
What's the point if she
doesn't have a hot body?

235
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,000
You're awful. That's offensive.

236
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,333
But...

237
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,541
I'm with you!

238
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,791
Yeah, boy!

239
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,833
Wow.

240
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,375
Oh, wow!

241
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,666
This is delicious!

242
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,125
Are you sure you
don't want some?

243
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,958
No way, it's all yours!

244
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,000
[NANASHIMA growls]

245
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,000
Why are you feeding
her all this food?!

246
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,125
Hey, Nanashima, you should
try a bite of this thing.

247
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,666
Are you any feeling
better now, Shinomiya?

248
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,500
Did you give her
all of these desserts?

249
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,666
I'm afraid so.

250
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,375
Her body is so
beautiful and soft

251
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,666
that I want to
keep feeding her.

252
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,333
I can't stop myself!

253
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,083
[NISHINA laughing]

254
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,208
You're tickling me, Shima.
Cut it out!

255
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,375
[SHINOMIYA, NANASHIMA]
You're not helping!

256
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,125
You made him cry!

257
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,458
Guess what?

258
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,458
I have to tell you about
the great news I just got!

259
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,250
[IGARASHI]
Oh, yeah? Go ahead!

260
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,250
They sent me an email about it.

261
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,250
Apparently, my entry won
the Valentine contest!

262
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,875
[IGARASHI, SHINOMIYA]
What?! It can't be!

263
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,041
[SERINUMA] They judges said
that only a true visionary

264
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,666
would have the bravery
to submit something

265
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,708
so off-the-wall!

266

I'm so happy
I can hardly stand it!

269
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,416
Oh! There's gonna
be an award ceremony,

270
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,791
and the director, voice actors,

271
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,750
and a few animators
will be there!

272
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,333
I'm so excited!

273
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,791
It'll be the best day of your
life so you have to be prepared!

274

I know! Let's get
our nails done!

275

[SERINUMA]
Yeah! That's a great idea!

276
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,916

277
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,458
I wanna help you.

That day... It'll be awesome.

You deserve to look
as good as you feel.

Yeah, so you gotta
lose the chub!

Okay!

00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,500
Do five more laps!

That's too much.

No way. It's great!

Look at her. Faster!

Um...

00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,083
So why are they
doing this again?

290
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,750
I think Serinuma looks
beautiful just the way she is.

291

Why don't you go
get your eyes checked?!

Why don't you take a break

Okay!

A quick time-out and then
it'll be back to business!

I think you might be
pushing her too hard.

build her strength up.

to stay the way she is, right?

It looks so neat!

323
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,416
It's a type of dancing that you
usually see at idol concerts.

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,083
You sure it's not
too intense for her?

She's fine.

Fangirls or whatever
love this kind of crap.

It's quite simple.

Wow. That's not embarrassing.

You're really good.

me to gyrate my hips

Of course! No problem!

We don't wanna injure ourselves.

you pushed her too hard.

Oh, right. Thanks.

485
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,625
Slow and steady.

486
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,166
I know you can do this.

487
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,875
[NISHINA]
That was considerate of you.

488
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,208
[IGARASHI]
You think so?

489
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,000
I care a lot about Serinuma.
And her health.

490
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,750
You know,
I started to wonder...

491
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,041
Am I the type of person
who only cares about looks?

492
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,500
At one time,
that might've been true,

493
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,166
and it was wrong of me.

494
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,875
I realized that I've never
met anyone like her before.

495
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,833
She's beautiful, inside and out.

496
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,083
It's clear to me now.

497
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,166
I think...

498
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,041
...I'm in love with Serinuma.

499
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,333
That's why I want
her to be happy.

500
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,958
I'll do anything for her.

501
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,000
I believe you.

502
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,166
If I may say so...
You have a beautiful spirit.

503
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,291
I reached my goal!

504
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,750
All thanks to you!

505
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,375
[NISHINA]
Astounding! Well done, Serinuma!

506
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,458
That's wonderful.

507
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,916
You sure worked hard.

508
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,166
We knew that you'd
be able to pull it off.

509
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,666
[SERINUMA]
Thanks!

510
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,333
It was a lot more difficult
than I thought it would be.

511
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,500
I kept going.

512
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,291
And you were with me
through every step.

513
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,083
[giggles]
You made it fun!

514
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,500
Thanks for everything.

515
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,375
[GROUP] We gave up so much...
for the cause.

516
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,625
[NANASHIMA] I don't know if
the sacrifice was worth it.

517
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,083
[SHINOMIYA] We should've
given it more thought.

518
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,375
There's only one reward left.
I can't wait for this!

519
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,583
[BOTH gasp]

520
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,958
[IGARASHI]
What's that?!

521
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,708
[NISHINA] I added it to give
her further incentive.

522
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,000
Just a little smooch.

523
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,416
[NANASHIMA]
Hell no!

524
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,000
Show the one you adore
you respect her hard work.

525
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,166
You wanted this.

526
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,541
[NANASHIMA yelling]

527
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,250
[NANASHIMA]
Wait!

528
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,125
What are you doing? Stop it!

529
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:09,875
[BOTH yelp]

530
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,750
[BOTH whimpering]

531
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,583
[NAKANO] And so... the <i>Mirage</i>
<i>Saga</i> Valentine Contest

532
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,875
Award Ceremony went even
better than she expected!

533
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,000
[MUTSUMI]
What's the matter, Shinomiya?

534
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,250
You seem down.

535
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,333
[SHINOMIYA] There was a
fight in my class today

536
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,833
and I got stuck in
the middle of it.

537
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,041
We all got in scolded.

538
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,625
[MUTSUMI]
That doesn't sound like you.

539
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,833
What happened?

540
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,291
[SHINOMIYA]
They stuffed my head in a toilet

541
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,750
when I reminded them that
fighting is for degenerates

542
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,000
with too much free time.

543
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,000
[MUTSUMI]
Poor thing.

544
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,583
I hope you didn't get hurt.

545
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:07,916
Let me comfort your ego.

546
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,333
[SHINOMIYA]
Uh... no thanks.

547
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,875
Physical rough-housing
isn't exactly my strong suit.

548
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,125
I'll use my mind to
outwit those idiots.

549
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,166
[MUTSUMI]
Oh, I see.

550
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,375
Well, good luck!

551
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,208
[SHINOMIYA]
Mutsumi, are you a good fighter?
