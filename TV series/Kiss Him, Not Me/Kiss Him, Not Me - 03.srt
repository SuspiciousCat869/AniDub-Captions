164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,166
That's sad.

165
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,541
This coming from the guy
who's misspelled words

166
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,875
on every poster he's touched?

167
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:08,916
Give me a break!

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,958
[NANASHIMA]
Shut it!

169
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,375
[MUTSUMI]
Idle hands!

170
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,541
[NANASHIMA]
Whatever.

171
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,541
[IGARASHI]
Wait. What am I doing here?

172
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,333
This is all for Serinuma... but
she's not even in the same room.

173
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,541
--[SHINOMIYA] Back off!
--[IGARASHI] Nana.

174
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,750
Do you... like this?

175
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,000
[NANASHIMA]
Uh... Well...

176
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,583
I mean there are better things
to do, but I don't mind.

177
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,250
It's kinda cool to help her out.

178
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,125
[IGARASHI]
I see.

179
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,416
[SERINUMA] The festival
started coming together.

180
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,583
It was a lot of work,
but somehow we survived.

181
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,916
[SERINUMA groaning]

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,416
I'm all done!

183
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
[NAKANO]
Good job!

184
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,041
I finished the
accessories a while ago!

185
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,750
[SERINUMA]
It's finally happening!

186
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,791
Have time to try it on
to check the fit?

187
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,000
[NAKANO]
I can't wait!

188
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,333
[SERINUMA]
How are the guys doing?

189
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,208
They've already changed
into their costumes.

190
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,541
Here they come!

191
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,958
[FEMALE STUDENTS scream]

192
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,500
[GIRL STUDENT 03A squeals]
So hot!

193
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,708
Oh, wow, they look even better
than we thought they would!

194
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,625
Shion...

195
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,708
Uh... what?

196
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,041
You look like the real Shion!
He's standing right here!

197
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,916
You're wonderful, Shion!
I love you so much!

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,666
I bow before you,
oh, majestic one!

199
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,791
Please never leave me!

200
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,666
I'm speechless, Shinomiya!

201
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,166
You're absolutely gorgeous!

202
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,625
A perfect woman!

203
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,166
I'm so glad you approve.

204
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,375
Tough luck.

205
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,250
Too bad she doesn't
see you as a real man.

206
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,916
At least I'm not
being forced to play out

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,875
an animated fantasy... Shion.

208
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,125
[NANASHIMA growling]

209
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,208
[GIRL STUDENT 03C]
Smile for the camera, Igarashi!

210
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,458
[GIRL STUDENT 03D]
You look great!

211
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,500
I'm really happy that you're
all wearing the costumes

212
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,541
that I made for you.

213
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,416
It means the world to me!

214
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,958
[SERINUMA]
I can't wait for the festival!

215
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,416
[MUTSUMI]
Tomorrow's the big day.

216
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,458
[SERINUMA] Our class worked
hard on the cosplay café!

217
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,791
Will you be able to stop by?

218
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,291
[MUTSUMI chuckles]
Of course.

219
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,250
And if you don't mind, I'd
like to attend your class play.

220
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,416
Still at 2 PM?

221
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,250
[SHINOMIYA]
Uh...

222
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,708
Can I come watch, Princess?

223
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,750
You're too stupid
to understand the show.

224
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,125
What'd you say?!

225
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,416
I know!

226
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,125
Why don't we all go
to the festival together?

227
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:22,958
[NANASHIMA]
I'm down.

228
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,750
[SHINOMIYA]
Sounds fun!

229
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,791
[IGARASHI]
You can count me out. Sorry.

230
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,708
If you can't do it
because of scheduling,

231
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,291
maybe we can figure out
a time to meet up.

232
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,750
I'm gonna pass.

233
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,500
Listen.

234
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,750
I'm tired of pretending
we're hanging out

235
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,375
because we like one another.

236
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,166
[SERINUMA]
What's wrong?

237
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,333
[IGARASHI]
I like you.

238
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,291
If I'm going to this festival...

239
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,166
I don't want to be
with anyone else but you.

240
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,166
Okay?

241
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,666
Not on your life, pal!

242
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,083
Igarashi has a point though.

243
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,166
Why am I wasting all
my time paling around

244
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,291
with you losers anyway?

245
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,291
For once I can
actually agree with you.

246
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,000
It's clear that we all
have the same objective,

247
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,791
so friendship isn't
really an option.

248
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,000
No, it's not.

249
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,791
[SERINUMA] I can't handle
all of this pressure!

250
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,416
There's no reason for
them to get so worked up!

251
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,250
Why can't we just go to the
festival and enjoy ourselves?

252
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,416
Wait a moment...
Let's be reasonable here!

253
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,791
Aww. Mutsumi!

254
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,458
[MUTSUMI] We can make a schedule
so we can split her time equally

255
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,708
--between us!
--[SERINUMA] Huh?!

256
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,416
I guess it's worth a shot.

257
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,458
[IGARASHI] We'll divide the
day into four mini-dates.

258
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,875
That way, each of us can spend
time with her at the festival.

259
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,375
[SHINOMIYA] Let's make
a rule that none of us

260
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,750
can interfere with each other.

261
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,791
[NANASHIMA]
Finally we're makin' some sense!

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,958
Yeah! Let's go with that!

263
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,291
[SERINUMA]
What?!

264
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,791
[STUDENTS chattering]

265
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,458
[SERINUMA]
Welcome to the cosplay café!

266
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,000
How are you?

267
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,625
Allow me to show
you to your table.

268
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,833
[NAKANO] Kae!
Your shift is almost over!

269
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,208
Coming!

270
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,083
Looks like you have
four dates lined up

271
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,333
with four hotties.

272
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,458
Lucky dog!

273
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,708
[SERINUMA]
Cut it out, A!

274
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,375
I'm freaking out
and I need your help!

275
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,791
I have no idea how to deal
with being alone with a guy!

276
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,375
You'll be fine.

277
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,958
It's not like you'll be alone
in the middle of the festival.

278
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,666
Just try to have a good time!

279
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,875
Yeah. That's true!

280
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,000
No need to worry!

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,916
[NANASHIMA]
Hey! You ready to go?

282
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,041
[SERINUMA]
Yeah!

283
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,875
Oh. I need to change
outta this outfit.

284
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,791
Would you mind leaving
your costume on?

285
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,208
You're such a perfect Shion!

286
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,583
[GIRL STUDENT 03E]
Hey!

287
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,041
If you two are leaving,
take these flyers with you!

288
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,416
Advertise for us!

289
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,375
[STUDENTS murmuring]

290
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,083
[GIRL STUDENT 03F]
Can I take a pic?

291
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,166
[BOY STUDENT 03A]
Me, too!

292
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,458
[GIRL STUDENT 03G]
I'd like a flyer!

293
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,750
They won't have a chance
to be alone together.

294
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,458
The cosplay was his undoing.

295
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,708
No way!

296
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,333
This date'll be pointless
if we don't leave.

297
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,541
[NANASHIMA]
Serinuma, come on!

298
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,333
Here you go!

299
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,541
Thank you!

300
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,500
[laughs] It's amazing!

301
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,041
Amazing?

302
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,875
I finally got my picture
taken with Shion.

303
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,000
I love it.

304
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,916
Well, then... glad to help.

305
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,166
But, you know...
I'm not an imaginary character.

306
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,916
I won't let you forget that.

307
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,083
Pardon.

308
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,625
It's time... date's over.

309
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,875
Didn't ya notice we're kinda
in the middle of somethin'?

310
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,416
I'm afraid your time is up.

311
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,208
We agreed.

312
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,125
You better back off and--

313
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,375
Don't you worry, Kae!

314
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,125
Just a few more dates
and I'll be with you!

315
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,708
We weren't finished yet!

316
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,750
[STUDENTS chattering]

317
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,208
[SERINUMA]
I got so flustered.

318
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,125
My face is burning up.

319
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,125
[MUTSUMI]
Serinuma, you look upset.

320
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,375
Are you all right?

321
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,458
[SERINUMA]

same about Shinomiya.

484
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,958
Got ya! Now what're
ya gonna do?

485
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,625
Help me!

486
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,750
Please, help!

487
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,833
[IGARASHI]
Hey!

488
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,583
Wait! Let go of hi--Ow!

489
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,500
Treat Serinuma like that
and you get stomped!

490
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,958
Nana! Look out!

491
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,791
I'm gonna kill you.

00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,958
[yells]

493
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,666
The hall is no place
for this sort of ruckus!

494
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,583
Hey! Are you with those guys?

495
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,041
You're safe now.

496
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,583
Oh, man, it's a fight!

497
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,666
[SERINUMA]
This is ridiculous!

498
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,625
Why did things
turn out this way?

499
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,875
I have to speak up!

500
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,000
Wait. Please!

501
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,458
Can you just--Ugh!

502
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,625
You're dead.

503
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,250
Okay.

504
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,666
I'm done!

505
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,791
[SERINUMA]
I'm done with this.

506
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,583
It's impossible.

507
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,458
Real life is just... is just... 

508
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,416
No damn fun!

509
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,791
[crying]

510
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, no!

511
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,416
Don't cry!

512
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,083
I'm so sorry about what happened
in the haunted house.

513
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,125
I swear...
it was an accident!

514
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,833
[SERINUMA]
No. I'm sorry.

515
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,291
I felt overwhelmed.

516
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,958
So I just...
Just ran away.

517
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,875
Instead of speaking my mind.

518
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,291
But um...
Being cornered...

519
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,250
Being fed...

520
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,291
Holding hands...

521
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,583
Getting touched...

522
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,833
[GROUP]
Seriously?

523
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,833
Can't let these guys
out of my sight.

524
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,625
[SERINUMA]
I'm not used to it!

525
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,208
You're wasting your time.

526
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,833
The dates were
supposed to be fun,

527
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,833
but I couldn't focus on them!

528
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,541
And then those guys
came and I... I...

529
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,708
I can't do this!

530
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,625
[crying]

531
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,083
I'm so sorry, Serinuma.

532
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,125
I don't want you to ever feel
pressured with me.

533
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,791
Our time together
should be special.

534
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,291
I think... 

535
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,666
We should take it slow.

536
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,125
Yeah. They rushed you.

537
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,083
I can wait.

538
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,833
Just the kinda guy I am.

539
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,708
It's an acceptable compromise.

540
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,458
That's great!

541
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,708
I missed you guys!

542
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,250
[NANASHIMA]
Yeah, you would.

543
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,083
[IGARASHI]
Let's go back to the festival.

544

[SHINOMIYA]
It's almost over.

00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,708
[SERINUMA]
You're wonderful. Thank you.

546
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,333
[laughs]

547
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,833
[SERINUMA]
Today has been one wild ride.

548
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,375
[NAKANO] I'm just glad those
creeps got it in the end.

549
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,000
[ANNOUNCER 03A] It's time
for the cultural festival's

550
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,958
grand finale! The folk dance!

551
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,541
Feel free to join us
for this special event!

552
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,333
Please find a partner if you'd
like to participate!

553
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,375
Serinu--

554
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,416
No more competing today.

555
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,375
That's somethin'
coming from you.

556
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,791
Well, might as well
dance, Nana!

557
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:53,958
[NANASHIMA]
Let go of my hand!

558
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,708
That's desperate. How sad.

559
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,791
What a warm display
of friendship!

560
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:58,791
Let's dance too!

561
00:21:58,875 --> 00:21:59,666
Wait, why?!

562
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,458
[STUDENTS laughing]

563
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,166
[SERINUMA]
A?

564
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,208
[NAKANO]
Yeah?

565
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,750
It's official...

566
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,083
Watching from the sidelines
is the best place I could be!

567
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,458
You're right!

568
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,833
[SERINUMA]
This is my way of life!

569
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,125
I love it!

570
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,625
[NAKANO]
Hey, Kae!

571
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:52,958
Do you know of any
good dessert places?

572
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,541
[SERINUMA]
I know of a few bakeries. Why?

573
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,166
[NAKANO] I thought it would
be nice to share some cookies

574
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,708
with my boyfriend for Christmas,
but I'm at a loss.

575
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,166
There are so many choices!

576
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,500
[SERINUMA]
What a nice idea!

577
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,958
Maybe you could go to a
few Christmas events too!

578
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:04,916
They're always fun.

579
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,125
[NAKANO]
Huh? Like what?

580
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,500
[SERINUMA]
Well, last year there was this

581
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,958
"Noel with Shion" event.

582
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,125
He invited me and
we partied all night.

583
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,000
[NAKANO] Wait, are you talking
about that cut-out thing?

584
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,583
[SERINUMA]
I have a picture of us together.

585
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,625
Wanna see?

586
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,625
[NAKANO]
So it really was a cut-out.

587
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,708
[SERINUMA]
Those are minor details.

588
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,250
Shion and I had the best time!
