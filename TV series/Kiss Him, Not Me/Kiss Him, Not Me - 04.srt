A Christh--

Christmas party!

Oh. Sounds fun.

[NANASHIMA]
How about Christmas Eve?

7
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,875
If we all throw in some money,
we could book a karaoke room.

I'm in.

That works for me.

Little problem!

00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,125
I've got plans.

been a lot of fun though!

So you're busy? Why?

There's no way we'll hang
out together without you!

Not trying to be a pain,

20

Comiket happens to fall

Who gives a crap about Comiket?

What do you even
do there anyway?

Fangirl stuff.

Mm-hmm.

Wait a second.

Why would you need
to go twice a year?

Christmas only happens once!

I'm sorry!

I've been saving up.
It's important!

They've expanded
to other genres!

Like foreign dramas

I can't wait to check it out!

Let's all go to Comiket.

Serinuma won't miss the event,

together on Christmas Eve.

Oh. Are you going
with someone else?

Not this time.

It looks like there are a lot
less people than last year.

realize it at the time,

it would take another hour

We met, and it turns
out that she and I

324
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,250
have a lot of things in common!

325
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,625
[BOTH laugh]

326
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,541
Well then I guess
that kiss doesn't count.

327
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,416
[GIRL 04O]
Nishina.

328
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,666
Wanna come sit with us?

329
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,458
What are you doing
for New Year's?

330
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,041
If you're free I'd love to have
you come over to my house

331
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,375
for a party.

332
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,458
Nishina!

333
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,125
We're gonna go
play some volleyball.

334
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,291
Wanna come be on my team?

335
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,791
That not fair!
I was gonna ask first!

336
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,875
[NANASHIMA] Why do I feel
as lame as you are?

337
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,583
[SHINOMIYA] I know you're dumb,
but can't you see?

338
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,916
She's part of their world.

339
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,291
[NANASHIMA]
What a brilliant tactic.

340
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,875
[SHINOMIYA]
We don't stand a chance.

341
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,416
I have to say...

342
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,791
It's a surprise to find out that
you go to our school, but...

343
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,875
I don't think you two
met by chance.

344
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,166
Oh. I did hear some
things about Serinuma

345
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,791
before going to Comiket,

346
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,958
but meeting her there
was a coincidence.

347
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,875
[NISHINA]
Was it too good to be true?

348
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,083
A delightful meeting
by random chance.

349
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,916
Perhaps we could
call it destiny?

350
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,583
I'd like to get
to know you better.

351
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,916
If you're interested,

352
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,583
I'd love to have you...
come home with me

353
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,625
so we can talk about anime.

354
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,916
[SERINUMA] She's inviting me
over to talk about <i>Mirage Saga</i> ?

355
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,291
I'm in!

356
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,666
Hold it!

357
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,000
Us too!

358
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,625
I was just thinkin' about
how I don't know squat

359
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,125
about that show you watch!

360
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,666
Right... you... guys?

361
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,208
I'd like to hear about it!

362
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,458
Talking about anime isn't
a waste of time at all!

363
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,958
You can count me in!

364
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,833
Mind if I join you?

365
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,041
Really?

366
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,791
You'll let me go on
and on about the show?

367
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,041
Dreams come true!

368
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,291
Yeah!

369
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,833
I can't wait to hear all
about the dudes you want

370
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,208
dating each other.

371
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,125
You know it!

372
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,333
Can't wait!

373
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,458
Well, then.

374
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm more than happy
to invite you all.

375
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,791
However, if you'd like
to come over,

376
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,500
I do have to make one
very small request of you.

377
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,583
[SERINUMA]
It's a mansion!

378
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,458
We're happy to have you
home again, Lady Shima.

379
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,958
Please... come in.

380
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,625
My room is upstairs.

381
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,458
[NANASHIMA]
I don't get it.

382
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,875
What does this chick make
me feel like less of a man?

383
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,416
[SHINOMIYA]
I'm so inadequate. Pathetic.

384
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,000
[NISHINA]
Take a look.

385
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,791
This room is dedicated
to my figure collection.

386
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,916
Oh, my gosh!

387
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,750
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh!

388
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,750
So many little Shions to love!

389
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,083
Hello, babies!

390
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,208
Mama sees you in there!

391
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,458
[NISHINA] I bought this one from
last year's Wonder Festival.

392
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,375
That's cool!

393
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,041
So much detail! Wow!

394
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,958
Isn't this a limited-edition
figure by that famous sculptor?

395
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,375
Did you paint this yourself?

396
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,750
Yep... all me.

397
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,291
Great job!

398
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,125
[IGARASHI, SHINOMIYA, NANASHIMA]
Ugh. We've lost her.

399
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,083
[SERINUMA]
Gorgeous!

400
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,916
Tsuruga Castle. Hikone Castle.

401
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,208
Did you paint each
of these models as well?

402
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,041
Yes... they're scale models.

403
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,416
Oh, my.

404
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,541
I'm still quite amateur.

405
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,041
[NANASHIMA]
Fight it, Mutsumi!

406
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,291
Fight it!

407
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,000
This is all part of her plan.

408
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,708
I'm not gonna fall for it!

409
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,000
That's right!

410
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,666
[IGARASHI] Their hate
brought them together.

411
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,875
This is my costume room.

412
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,666
These are all the clothes I've
made for different conventions.

413
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,208
Whoa. I wish I could
make clothes like this.

414
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,791
[NISHINA] I have to say, the
dress you made for Shinomiya

415
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,125
was simply breathtaking.

416
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,916
I was quite impressed.

417
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,875
[SERINUMA]
You were?

418
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,291
I attended the play.

419
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,500
And you...
were the cutest thing ever.

420
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,083
Don't call me cute!

421
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,125
Don't you want me to
tell you how pretty you were?

422
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,250
[SHINOMIYA]
Of course I don't!

423
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,500
You think you're funny?

424
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,958
Yeah, you let her know!

425
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,666
I would never make fun of you.

426
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,708
You carried yourself
with such grace.

427
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,375
I was spellbound!

428
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,875
Thank you. I guess.

429
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,416
[NANASHIMA]
You fell for that?

430
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,041
There's no way you
idiots are this gullible!

431
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,333
[IGARASHI]
Easy, there.

432
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,625
She'll slip up... it's only
a matter of time.

433
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,916
Now. There's one room I can't
wait to for you to see.

434
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,666
[SERINUMA yelling]

435
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,375
[SERINUMA]
Comic books, graphic novels

436
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:56,041
limited edition releases,
rare prints, <i>doujinshi</i> for days!

437
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,375
This collection is hot
and ripe for the picking!

438
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,500
Unbelievable!

439
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,291
[screaming]

440
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,958
May... I... touch... them?

441
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,083
Please do.

442
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,125
[SERINUMA]
The <i>Zebra Stripe</i> series!

443
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,458
She's got all of them.

444
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,625
Why are there so many
I've never seen before?

445
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,083
So then... she's more
obsessed than you are?

446
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,041
Oh. I helped make that.

447
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,125
[SERINUMA, NANASHIMA]
Huh?!

448
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,791
That's my series. I draw.

449
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,666
I'm so honored that
you read them!

450
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,083
You're a freakin' liar!

451
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,291
No one can be good
at that many things!

452
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,625
What's wrong with you?

453
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,000
She's a fake!
Can't you see that?

454
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,541
So you're... So you're
the great author Yokojima?

455
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,541
[panting]

456
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,208
Yes. Give me one moment.
I'll prove it.

457
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,500
Here.

458
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,166
[NISHINA]
Does this convince you?

459
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,125
Are you some kind of goddess?!

460
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,000
[GROUP]
Whoa. She's good.

461
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,250
I want you to know...

462
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,291
I... love to read
<i>Zebra Stripe</i> books.

463
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,833
I always buy them.

464
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,416
And... I'm honored to be in
your presence; may I touch you?

465
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,750
I think... I just... I'm so
in love with your work!

466
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,416
Calm down, Serinuma.

467
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,916
That's so kind of you.

468
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,833
I'd love to draw
for you anytime.

469
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,375
Your wish is my command.

470
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,416
[echoing]
Your wish is my command.

471
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,541
Marry me.

472
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,666
Cut it out!
Anyone can draw a picture!

473
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,291
Let me show you how it's done!

474
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,333
I got a B in art class!

475
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,375
A B is a perfectly
average grade!

476
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,333
All right! How's that?

477
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,041
[NANASHIMA]
I'm a failure!

478
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,666
The girl is rich.
Good looking. Talks cool.

479
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,000
She can do anything!

480
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,791
She's way too perfect!
How could I ever compete?

481
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,291
I'm throwin' in the towel.

482
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,333
[SERINUMA]
Wow!

483
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,541
This is Shion... isn't it?

484
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,125
[NANASHIMA]
Huh?

485
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,166
It's so cute!

486
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,750
Do you mind if I take it home?

487
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,916
You don't want that. It sucks.

488
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,333
No way! It's cute!

489
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,750
It's one of the best pictures
of Shion I've ever seen!

490
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,291
Okay... well in
that case it's yours.

491
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,750
I drew Shion too.

492
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,250
Mine has a little crown!

493
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,708
[SERINUMA]
Ah! Love 'em!

494
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,958
[NANASHIMA] She's happy with
anything as long as it's Shion!

495
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,083
[chuckles]

496
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,833
Now, then.

497
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,625
Do you remember when I told you
that I had one small request?

498
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,041
Oh... right.

499
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,333
Come this way.

500
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,416
[SERINUMA]
What are we doing?

501
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,791
I want the boys
to model for me.

502
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,166
Just for fun!

503
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,083
Huh?

504
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,541
You're a photographer too?

505
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,791
Don't you think that's
a strange thing to ask?

506
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,041
I get it.

507
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,916
[SERINUMA] You wanns get
a few shots of these hot men

508
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,333
together, right?

509
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,416
[NISHINA]
Yes!

510
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,416
[SERINUMA] They're totally
oblivious to how good they look!

511
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,750
[NISHINA]
Yeah!

512
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,208
They'll be perfect to use
as character references

513
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,583
for my next project.

514
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,666
[SERINUMA]
That's a great idea!

515
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,958
Let's go for it!

516
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,041
Okay!

517
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,708
Time to pair up, everyone!

518
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,416
Igarashi with Nanashima.

519
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,833
You guys are up first!

520
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,833
[NANASHIMA] What were you
two whispering about?

521
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,583
[NISHINA]
Looking good!

522
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,750
Bring your faces in.

523
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,541
Look into each other's eyes.

524
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,041
[NISHINA] Good! Keep your
lips parted just like that.

525
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,625
[NISHINA]
That's perfect!

526
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,125
Now how about resting
your chin on his shoulder?

527
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:26,791
[MUTSUMI]
Like this?

528
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,375
[SHINOMIYA squeals]

529
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,208
[MUTSUMI] Shinomiya, you use the
same laundry detergent as I do.

530
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,583
It smells so good.

531
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,416
Stop!

532
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,791
[SERINUMA screams]

533
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,083
This is heaven!

534
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,708
Why don't one of you lay
your head in the other's lap?

535
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,333
No! What're you, nuts?!

536
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,208
What?

537
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,666
I thought you made a promise.

538
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,041
We've done more than enough
to fulfill our commitment!

539
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,625
[SERINUMA]
Shima!

540
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,958
It'll be faster if we
show them how it's done.

541
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,833
Watch closely, boys!

542
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,666
[SERINUMA] You must gently
caress your partner's face.

543
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,666
It implies affection and catches
the eye of the viewer.

544
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,625
[GROUP]
What are we looking at?

545
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,833
Then you bring your
face close to his.

546
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,208
Slowly part your lips.

547
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,875
[SERINUMA gasps]

548
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:15,708
Sorry!

549
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh, wow! I'm so embarrassed.

550
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,500
[NISHINA]
My dear... don't stop.

551
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,250
[GROUP gasps]

552
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,916
Get your grubby lips
off Serinuma!

553
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,083
Yeah... ew!

554
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,458
[NANASHIMA]
Are you crazy?

555
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,208
[SERINUMA]
This girl... kissed me!

556
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,083
[NISHINA]
I wasn't joking!

557
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,541
Hey! Listen!

558
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,666
Getting kissed by another
girl doesn't mean anything!

559
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,375
I can kiss you to get the
taste out of your mouth!

560
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,333
Me too! I'll kiss you right now!

561
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,416
[NISHINA]
I said I wasn't joking.

562
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,708
We'll have a problem if
you don't take me seriously.

563
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,041
Is that so?

564
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,875
[NAKANO]
Kae Serinuma, 17 years old.

565
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,916
Her first kiss was
with a handsome girl.

566
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,333
[NISHINA] Serinuma,
whenever I see you eat,

567
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,208
the food always
looks so succulent!

568
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,000
You're absolutely lovely.

569
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,500
[SERINUMA]
Really? Thank you!

570
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,458
I'd love to share a meal
with you sometime!

571
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,708
[NISHINA]
It would be an honor,

572
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,541
though I can eat enough
for the both of us!

573
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,833
[SERINUMA]
But you're so slender!

574
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:04,958
How do you do it?

575
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,541
[NISHINA]
Nothing special, I'm afraid.

576
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,250
Everyone in my family is slim,
so it's probably in my genes.

577
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,583
[SERINUMA] Well, in my family,
my brother is pretty skinny!

578
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,958
It might have something
to do with me always

579
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,541
stealing his candy
when we were little.

580
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,250
I'd gobble it up
before he even realized!

581
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,833
[NISHINA] I get the feeling
that you and your brother

582
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,416
share a special bond.
