[SHINOMIYA]
Hello, Serinuma!

2
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,500
It's nice to see you!

3
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,458
It was a cowboy
and an astronaut.

00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,625
[IGARASHI]
Hey, good morning!

5
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,666
[NANASHIMA]
What's up?

6
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,500
[MUTSUMI]
Serinuma.

7
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,708
Serinuma?

8
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,000
[MUTSUMI] It doesn't feel
like you have a fever.

9
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,458
Ugh! What are you doing?!

10
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,416
Serinuma, is something wrong?

11
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,250
You're acting strange.

12
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,875
Oh, I'm sorry.

13
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,041
I can't hide it.

14
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,250
The truth is... 

15
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,375
...last night I fell... in love.

16
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,083
Who are you in love with?!

17
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,125
His name... 

18
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,250
[SERINUMA] ...is Akane from
the anime <i>Katchu Ranbu</i> ! Ah!

19
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,041
The anime just started,
so this is new for us,

20
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,416
but I couldn't take it slow!

21
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,791
It was love at first episode!

22
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,500
We really got to know
each other last night

23
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,541
while I was reblogging.

24
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,541
I never slept but...
I feel great!

25
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,583
[squealing]

26
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,875
I guess I should've
seen it coming.

27
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,208
That man...

28
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,250
I've started using his
picture for the wallpaper

29
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,250
on my phone.

30
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,666
Of course you have!

31
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,083
You get it!

32
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,333
Wait a second.

33
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,541
This guy you're in love with...
is a character?

34
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,666
That's right!

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,125
Akane is the main
character's servant,

36
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,375
but totally loyal to him.

37
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,541
He'd do anything to keep
his lord safe and happy!

38
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,041
They are so in love!

39
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,750
And the main character has
a childhood friend turned rival!

40
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,666
There's a teacher he adores
so there's no telling who

41
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,291
he's going to want to spend
the rest of his life snuggling!

42
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,750
Make no mistake.
Akane is definitely in the lead!

43
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,208
When I saw them my
heart knew it was real!

44
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,416
[GROUP]
We get it.

45
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,208
Don't you love Shion?

46
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,666
What about him?

47
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,625
Of course I do, but my heart
always has room for more.

48
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,541
[SHINOMIYA]
How convenient.

49
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,458
Akane will do
anything for his lord!

50
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,375
Right? They are so in love.

51
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,791
They go to such great
lengths to stay close.

52
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,791
[NANASHIMA] So I guess the
plot is that these two dudes

53
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,166
have a thing with each other?

54
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,041
Let us tell you about the show!

55
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,250
[NANASHIMA gasps]

56
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,875
First, you can take
a look at the trailer!

57
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,541
My lord! Forgive me
for disturbing you!

58
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,875
Word from the
northern mountains.

59
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,833
The enemy has attacked!

60
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,000
Then we fight!

61
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,958
Akane, let us depart at once!

62
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,000
Right!

63
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,666
There are bowmen waiting
to ambush you outside!

64
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,791
What did you say?

65
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,333
[AKANE]
Get back here!

66
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,541
No! My lord!

67
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,458
And now we fight!

68

Ready?

69

70
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,416
[AKANE]
Yes!

71
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,708
[AKANE] I will protect you
with heart, body, and soul,

72
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,500
even if it costs me my life.

73

[BOTH squeal]

74
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,791
It's just so perfect!

75
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,458
I feel it in my soul.

76
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,291
An amazing man. Precious.

77
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,250
Uh... Akane was the
naked one with the red hair

78
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,125
and green eyes, right?

79
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,333
Yep!

80
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,625
You like the one who
can turn into clothes?

81
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,541
Why did he disappear
after he hugged that guy?

82
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,166
"Katchu" means
armor and helmet.

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,500
Huh?

84
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,291
Akane is his lord's
exclusive armor and helmet,

85
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,291
so when they enter battle,
he can transform.

86
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,083
Into what?

87
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,208
Armor and helmet!

88
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,291
So... his boyfriend is a hat.

89
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,500
Go buy some armor.

90
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,833
What's the point?

91
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,500
He's an anthropomorphized
helmet and armor, right?

92
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,458
[SERINUMA]
Exactly!

93
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,125
What's that mean?

94
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,583
It means to give something
humanlike attributes.

95
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,375
People do it for
all sorts of things!

96
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,333
Animals, cars,
household appliances,

97
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,791
food, even countries!

98
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,958
[NANASHIMA]
This is getting weird.

99
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,791
<i>Katchu Ranbu</i> is unique
because the armor

100
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,458
doesn't fit anyone but the lord.

101
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:53,125
The lord's personality
perfectly complements Akane.

102
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,625
Their bond is eternal! Precious!

103
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,916
Yes! No one can come
between their fervent desires!

104
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,708
Isn't it great?

--Akane and Lord.
--Lord and Akane.

106
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,666
What? Perhaps you
misspoke, my dear girl.

107
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,500
Akane and his lord are
surely your true pairing.

108
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,875
It must be a mistake.

109
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,708
I guess you haven't had
the chance to read through

110
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,541
the opening and
closing theme lyrics.

111
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,750
It obviously implies
Lord and Akane.

112
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,166
[NISHINA] I'm afraid
you're misunderstanding

113
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,291
their relationship.

114
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,333
Servants always care
for their masters!

115
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,458
[SERINUMA] No, no, no!
Look, you aren't getting it.

116
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,666
A servant will put all
of his trust into his lord.

117
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,916
Yes, but Akane has devoted
himself to maintaining

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Lord's comfort
despite hardship.

119
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,500
The embracing of his lord
in battle is symbolic

120
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,583
of the relationship
that they have forged!

121
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,666
[SERINUMA] Akane only transforms
because of the trust he has

122
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,791
in Lord!

123
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,000
[NISHINA]
Lord showcases vulnerability

124
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,125
in the transformation!

125
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,208
Even his body type
demonstrates that!

126
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,500
[SERINUMA] What show
are you even watching?

127
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,666
Akane has a much
more delicate build!

128
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,708
Please don't argue.
You're both making great points.

129
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,125
[NISHINA, SERINUMA]
As I was saying,

130
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,875
the pairing that you
love so much...

131
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,166
...is absolutely impossible!

Okay, what was that?

133

[IGARASHI]
I don't know.

Are you going to tell

[SERINUMA]
What do you mean?

You didn't even
stop to say hello.

That was Nishina!

138

[SERINUMA]
Here it is again!

Why is there so much
Akane and Lord?

These fangirls just
aren't getting it!

Hey, did something happen?

Kae and Nishina aren't speaking.

145

On the way to class they gave
each other the cold shoulder.

We're not sure.

147

They can't agree on
whose name would come first

148
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,208
in a couple, I guess.

No way! Please tell me
you're joking.

150

Why go on in a
world so convoluted?

can ruin friendships.

[NAKANO]
Listen up, rookies!

159
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,250
We're caught in
the middle of a reverse

shipping war, soldiers.

161

When two sides can't agree
on the leader in a pairing,

Oh, okay... but why?

00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,500
Is there a reason why
they can't take turns?

165
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,125
There's no way!

166
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,291
Let's see here...

167
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,833
If you wanted to start
dating each other,

168
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,041
who would be the one most
likely to make the first move?

169
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:12,958
[BOTH gasp]

170
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,083
Not doing this!

171
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,416
Chill, it's hypothetical!

172
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,083
Would Nanashima
ask Igarashi out,

173
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,916
or would it be
the other way around?

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,541
In a <i>fujoshi</i> 's world, that can
change the entire relationship.

175
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,500
The dynamic always changes

176
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,625
based on personality
and core need!

177
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,208
[IGARASHI]
We get the picture!

178
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,500
Those two are arguing
over who asks the other

179
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,000
on a date first?

180
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,041
Which character holds the reins
in a romantic relationship

181
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,250
can be a big issue.

182
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,916
Don't take shipping
wars lightly.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,666
This stuff is serious business.

184
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,500
Proud fangirls will always
stand by their pairings.

185
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,916
Even a small rift in shipping
is a rift in the friendship!

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,375
It's true!

187
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,791
Opposing opinions feel like
a betrayal to your fandom!

188
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,208
But they're not!

189
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,458
There's no helping them.

190
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,208
All we can do is pray
that they have a bond

191
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,791
strong enough to overcome.

192
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,041
Kae is one of the toughest
shippers I've ever known.

193
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,041
She doesn't get
over these things.

194
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,750
What? Are you for real?

195
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,083
[IGARASHI]
Poor Serinuma.

196
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,625
I hate seeing her like this.

197
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,875
[MUTSUMI] I'm sad that Nishina
isn't sitting with us today.

198
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,458
Well, I guess they're
still going at it.

199
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,750
Time to take action.

200
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,625
We've gotta do
something about this.

201
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,000
[SERINUMA]
Hello?

202
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,750
Oh, hi, Mutsumi!
How are you?

203
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,833
What? You'd like me to come with
you on a trip to Anime Ito?

204
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,958
[MUTSUMI]
Yes!

205
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,541
I've been studying
the Sengoku period,

206
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,583
and thought I might
check out <i>Katchu Ranbu</i> .

207
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,458
Wow! Do you really want to?

208
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,416
[MUTSUMI]
I do! It seems interesting.

209
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,750
[SERINUMA]
It is!

210
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,041
[MUTSUMI] There are a lot
volumes in the manga,

211
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,875
so I'm not really
sure where to start.

212
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,333
Any way could you meet me?

213
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,750
[SERINUMA]
I'll be right there!

214
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,458
[NISHINA]
How odd, Igarashi.

215
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,083
Since when are you
interested in Anime Ito?

216
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,333
[IGARASHI]
Since now.

217
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,875
We don't know what
we're doing. Come with us.

218
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,208
Mind telling me why
you're going at all?

219
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,750
[IGARASHI]
Serinuma has been down lately.

220
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,750
Nana and I thought
a gift might help.

221
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,000
[NISHINA]
Keep dreaming!

222
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,625
I would never go out of
my way to help you two

223
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,041
score points with her.

224
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,000
That's almost insulting.

225
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,125
[IGARASHI]
Huh...

226
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,375
And here I thought
you'd given her up.

227
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,875
I mean, you aren't
even speaking.

228
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,083
[NISHINA] Fine. I'll come
if you never call me again.

229
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,333
Thank you!

230
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,541
We'll be waiting by the
door when you get here.

231
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,875
[NANASHIMA] I gotta learn
Igarashi's techniques.

232
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,625
What a nice surprise!

233
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,750
We're on our way into Anime Ito!

234
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,375
What do ya know? Us too!

235
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,458
We're here, so might
as well go to a café!

236
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,333
[MUTSUMI]
Good idea.

237
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,375
[NANASHIMA]
I'm starvin'!

238
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,708
[SHINOMIYA]
This is what friends do!

239
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,541
No way!

240
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,291
Igarashi, you lied to me!

241
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,958
[IGARASHI laughs]
I wouldn't dare!

242
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,958
How are ya?

243
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,583
Since we're all here by random
chance and there's no way

244
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,500
it was planned,
might as well catch up!

245
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,916
[SERINUMA] How can I make
small talk with this stranger

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,291
sitting in front of me?

247
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:01,875
Oh! That's right!

248
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,750
I watched that show
you girls like!

249
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,583
You did?

250
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,333
Yeah! I saw it, too.

251
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,416
[NISHINA]
What did you think?

252
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,666
I thought it was gonna be dumb,

253
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,958
but once I ignored
the stuff I hated,

254
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,125
it wasn't that bad.

255
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,375
What he means is
that we actually liked it.

256
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,291
That's right.

257
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,041
The fight scenes
were remarkable.

258
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,708
[MUTSUMI] The designs on the
armor are historically accurate!

259
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:19,791
Fanboys?

260
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:20,791
They have to be.

261
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,833
I know, right?

262
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,500
The show is so good!

263
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,666
The original writer had
complete creative control,

264
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,458
so they couldn't
cut corners! Nope!

265
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,416
Things are looking good!

266
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,000
I think that
Princess Mitsu seems

267
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,291
like a pretty cool chick.

268
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,458
She's courageous.

269
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,041
Oh, yeah!

270
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,958
I mean, the touch of coldness
they gave her adds to the charm!

271
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,583
I have a theory
that she and the lord

272
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,083
are going to end up together.

273
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,041
It's obvious that
the lord has Akane.

274
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh. I forgot.

275
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,708
[NANASHIMA]
You little idiot!

276
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,875
[NANASHIMA]
Well, I can tell ya one thing.

277
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,291
Akane is loyal!

278
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,083
He lays it all on the
line for that Lord guy!

279
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,333
So true!

280
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,750
The lord seems to really
treasure the friendship

281
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,625
that they share.

282
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,416
He does!

283
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,666
I checked the internet.

284
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,833
Seems like people enjoy
that pairing the most.

285
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,416
--Akane and the lord?
--The lord and Akane?

286
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,166
Your foolish ways
haven't changed.

287
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,583
Embarrassing.

288
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,166
People love Akane and Lord...
yet you cling to hope.

289
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,000
Pathetic.

290
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,750
Lord and Akane. It's canon.

291
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,458
There is no other option.

292
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,666
[NANASHIMA]
What's the matter with you?!

293
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,000
Why don't you ever
stop talking? Ugh!

294
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,041
[SHINOMIYA]
I'm reawy sowy!

295
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,791
Enough of this! I'm finished
quarreling with you!

296
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,666
A duel!

297
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,208
We'll write fan fiction!

298
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,625
Once completed we can put them
online for the world to see!

299
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,333
That's right! The one true
pairing will have the most hits!

300
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,250
How's that sound?

301
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,833
[SERINUMA]
I love that idea!

302
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,166
[NISHINA]
Let's set a few rules.

303
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,083
The format is short story with
a deadline we have to meet.

304
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,625
[SERINUMA]
I accept!

305
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,166
[BOTH growling[

306
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,250
Really? I think we just
made things worse.

307
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,166
[SERVER 06A]
Thanks for coming!

308
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,708
[IGARASHI]
Nishina.

309
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,875
[IGARASHI]
You won't let this go?

310
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,791
No, I won't.
I can't sacrifice my beliefs!

311
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,208
I'll prove to her which
is the true pairing!

312
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,166
All right. But...

313
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,875
What then? What happens
when it's all over?

314
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,708
There's a chance this argument
might ruin your friendship.

315
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,416
Will you be okay with that?

316
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,750
I don't know.

317
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,625
[IGARASHI]
Well, I'm not gonna complain.

318
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,625
I don't mind having
less competition.

319
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,666
Hey, but at least you'll
have those bragging rights.

320
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,625
I'm sure that's just as good.

321
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,291
Shut up, Igarashi!

322
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,708
[IGARASHI] You should learn
to respect your elders!

323
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,791
[NISHINA] I've always
loved beautiful things.

324
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,000
I enjoy looking at them.
I enjoy making them.

325
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,750
As odd as it sounds, one could
call beauty a passion of mine.

326
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,333
But... 

327
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,208
[SHADOW 06A]
What a cute drawing.

328
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,916
[SHADOW 06B] I'd expect
nothing less from the daughter

329
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,458
of such a wealthy family.

330
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,958
[SHADOW 06C]
Give your father my regards.

331
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,000
[STUDENT 06C]
Treat her nicely.

332
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,375
She has money.

333
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,208
[STUDENT 06D] She'll
never have to work for anything.

334
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,000
She's so lucky.

335
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,000
[STUDENT 06C]
It's not even that good.

336
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,208
[STUDENT 06D]
Of course she won first place.

337
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,833
[STUDENT 06E] Every year
her family gives the school

338
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,250
a ton of donations.

339
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,125
[STUDENT 06C] Yeah.
That's why she always wins.

340
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,041
[NISHINA]
Why would they say those things?

341
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,666
I put everything
into what I love!

342
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,250
I'll show them!

343
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll try harder!

344
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,166
[gasps]

345
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,625
Just a dream.

346
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,791
Keep writing!

347
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,500
[NISHINA] I had to fight to earn
the respect I've been given

348
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,708
in this world.

349
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,250
I won't back down now.

350
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,000
[GROUP]
Why?

351
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,750
I'm concerned that you
might not be well-rested.

352
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,458
I'm still working
on my fan fiction.

353
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,291
Everything is running together.

354
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,583
I can't even tell
if it's good anymore.

355
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,583
Could you please read it for me?

356
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,666
Of course.

357
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,375
Mm-hmm. Very nice.

358
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,875
I like the concept.
There's potential here!

359
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,791
I'm so glad!

360
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,833
Make it clear how
the story is being told.

361
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:58,916
Maybe first person?

362
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,083
Third works just as well.

363
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,791
[SERINUMA gasps]
I had no idea!

364
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,125
[MUTSUMI]
When a character is speaking,

365
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,208
consider using quotation marks.

366
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,416
Why say yes to a fan fic
contest if she sucks this bad?

367
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,958
There goes her confidence.

368
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,791
[NISHINA]
What? Why would I give up?

369
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,750
[SHINOMIYA] Writing doesn't
come easy to Serinuma.

370
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,208
Her story is awful and she's
trying as hard as she can.

371
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,583
You've had years of
experience publishing stories.

372
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,083
So it's unfair.

373
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,125
Please give up.

374
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,875
This whole thing
is a waste of time.

375
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,166
Oh, really?

376
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,041
It's pathetic. And...

377
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,041
[NISHINA]
What were you saying?

378
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,875
Always so condescending.

379
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,916
Your opinion means
nothing to me.

380
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,791
My soul won't rest
until I prove my point!

381
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,750
I'll defend what's
beautiful to me.

382
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,500
Consider this your
only warning.

383
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,958
Stay out of my
business, little kitten.

384
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,125
She's so cool!

385
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,958
Nishina is putting
that boy in his place!

386
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,750
I bet he wants to
disappear right now!

387
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,416
You're saying...
she shoved you to the wall,

388
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,375
almost kicked you in the
crotch, and made threats

389
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,791
while everyone was watching?

390
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,958
You're so lame!

391
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,791
Huh?! Go see
for yourself then!

392
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,166
She's out of her mind!

393
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,958
She always defends
what's beautiful?

394
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,458
Uh-huh.

395
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,375
What's beautiful about imagining
two anime guys hooking up?

396
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,875
Those men are quite attractive.

397
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,708
I think it's more than that.

398
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,833
We'll see.

399
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,125
[NAKANO] A friendship on
the line, history in the making.

400
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,583
The fan fiction community
would decide their fate.

[IGARASHI]
Here we go.

[NANASHIMA] This thing'll
be over at 4 PM Monday.

407
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,916
Whoever has the
most views wins.

[SHINOMIYA] We're rooting
for you, Serinuma.

[MUTSUMI]
Wow. They're doing well.

410
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,750
[NAKANO]
Finally... the day had come.

411
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,375
It's time!

412
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,916
The moment of truth!

413
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,166
I win!

414
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,250
[SERINUMA]
How did I lose?

415
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,416
What a glorious triumph to
see my enemy on her knees.

416
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,375
What a pathetic fool
you've become!

417
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,708
Now cast your
eyes to the ground

418
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,750
and admit to the world
that you've lost!

419
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,083
I... I lost.

420
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,416
[NISHINA laughs]
What was that?

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,083
I can't hear you!
Speak up!

Hey. Chill.

Come back!

00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,041
Are you satisfied?

00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,958
[NISHINA]
Yes.

You've won the argument.

What happens now?

434
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,458
[NISHINA]
Why are you asking that again?

435
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,958
You once told me that you're
drawn to beautiful things

436
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,500
and will do whatever it
takes to protect them.

437
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,958
Do you think it's beautiful to
make the woman you like cry?

[NISHINA]
It was here.

This is the place where
I first met her.

[NISHINA]
Finally.

441

This is the school I've chosen.

everything will be different.

Oh, yeah. I heard a super rich

girl might be coming here.

00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,916
[FEMALE STUDENT 06C] Why would
someone like that come to

447
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,583
a plain public
school like ours?

448
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,083
[NISHINA] No. I can't
go through this again.

Oh! I'm so sorry!

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,583
I didn't mean to fall on you!

Please don't die!
Just breathe; you'll be fine!

came to my rescue that day.

[NISHINA]
My very first <i>doujinshi</i> .

00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,250
One sale would be nice.

They're first issues!

No one is interested.

[NISHINA]
It's that girl!

461
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,708
I'd like to buy a copy
of each of your <i>doujinshis.</i>

Thank you for your
purchase. Enjoy.

Would you mind telling
me your name?

465
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,666

put out an entire series

I feel rather refreshed
after making that sale!

Dear Yokoshima,

471
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,875
Earlier today I bought
all of your books.

472
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,791
[NISHINA gasps]
It's from that girl!

473

[SERINUMA]
I hope you continue this series!

474
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,708
I feel like words can't even
express my love for your style.

00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,291
I started looking for her
in the halls at school.

479
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,750
She wasn't anywhere to be found.

480
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,958
I busied myself with work.

481
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,750
I was absorbed in my craft,
and gained popularity.

482
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,416
But on that fateful day,

483
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,791
we reunited without
even realizing!

484
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,916
[MALE STUDENT 06A]
Oh! Her name is Serinuma.

485
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,416
She's pretty cute!

486
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,375
Yeah. I heard she's
kind of a fangirl.

487
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,250
[MALE STUDENT 06A]
If she's that hot, who cares?

488
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,458
[MALE STUDENT 06B]
I guess,

489
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,166
but not too long ago
she was a huge fatty!

490
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,708
[STUDENTS gasp]

491
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,083
[NISHINA] This girl... and that
girl... are one in the same?

492
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,333
This must be...

493
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,208
...fate!

494
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,291
[NISHINA]
Oh, Serinuma.

495
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,375
She was always so beautiful.

496
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,750
That's enough!

497
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,125
I don't want to lose her
over something like this!

498
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,333
[NISHINA] She's more precious
to me than anything

499
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,833
I've ever known!

500
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,708
Aren't you going
answer your phone?

501
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,625
Looks like Nishina.

502
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,125
Well... so what?

503
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,625
Pick it up, please.

504
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,916
[SERINUMA]
No!

505
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,166
[IGARASHI]
Fine then.

506
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:03,916
[phone chimes]

507
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,250
It's not as bad
as you think it is.

508
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,291
Your awkward love story
still got a lot of hits!

509
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,458
It certainly did!

510
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,708
I'll read it again.

511
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,541
A loss is a loss.
I'm okay with that.

512
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,458
But... I'm her friend.

513
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,250
The story she wrote was amazing!

514
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,083
No! This can't be the
way things end for us!

515
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,208
I assure you that
our arc is far from over.

516
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,750
You have to know
how much I love you!

517
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,083
Really? Oh, Shima...

518
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,833
I'm here. Always.

519
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,833
Can you forgive me?

520
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm so sorry!

521
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,375
As long as you forgive
me for my cruelty!

522
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,416
Please?

523
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,916
You made up;
that's enough hugging.

524
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,166
Yeah!

525
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,208
Does this mean you
finally know which couple

526
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,750
you wanna start shipping?

527
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,166
[NISHINA] I know exactly
how we can fix that.

528
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,250
[SERINUMA]
Yeah! I think so too!

529
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,916
The lord and Akane
will be versatile!

530
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,000
That's exactly why
you're my soulmate!

531
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,625
"Versatile" refers to a pairing
in which the leading position

532
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,125
can be switched from
one partner to another.

533
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,250
[NAKANO]
All's well that ends well.

534
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,333
[IGARASHI]
Nishina, are those new sneakers?

535
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,250
[NISHINA]
Yes, they are.

536
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,666
Thank you for noticing.

537
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,500
[IGARASHI] I've never seen
you wear shoes like that.

538
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,375
They're nice.

539
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,666
I have a collection of them!

540
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,041
[NISHINA]
Really? Be careful.

541
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,875
Small collections
can easily grow into

542
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,000
all-consuming obsessions!

543
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,583
[IGARASHI laughs] Mine isn't
bad compared to yours.

544
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,916
Does one person really need
that many plastic models,

545
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,750
or costumes, or books?

546
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,291
[NISHINA]
If you think it's bad now,

547
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,041
you should've seen it before
I had the shelving installed!

548
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,291
My collections were everywhere!
