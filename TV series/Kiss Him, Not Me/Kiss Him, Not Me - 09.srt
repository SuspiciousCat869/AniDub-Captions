[SERINUMA]
Ah!

2
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,125
Gorgeous!

3
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,750
[SERINUMA]
School is out.

4
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,541
We were all invited to
Shima's summer home

5
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,958
for a little fun in the sun.

6
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,250
It's so beautiful!

7
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,541
[NISHINA]
It's quiet out here.

8
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,291
Unfortunately,
not right on the beach,

9
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,791
but we'll have a lot of privacy.

10
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,125
It's perfect!

11
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,666
Man! I've never stayed
in a room this big.

12
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,041
Kinda feels like I'm getting
away with something.

13
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,458
Cute.

14
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,708
Don't worry. We've got plenty
of rooms to go around.

15
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,583
Thanks for letting us stay.

16
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,583
Sure! What do you say
we get our swimsuits on

17
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,708
and head to the beach?

18
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,791
Yeah! I can't wait!

19
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,125
[NANASHIMA groans]
What is this, summer camp?

20
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,916
Why do we all have to
be in the same bedroom?

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,166
Take it easy.

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,208
Only you would complain
about a free vacation.

23
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,458
Chill out.

24
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,208
There's more to it.

25
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,041
This trip is a big deal.

26
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,958
I can't blow it.

27
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,458
She and I have to get closer
if it's possible.

28
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,166
Serinuma was cool enough
to give me another chance

29
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,583
after what happened with us.

30
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,500
I just wanna prove
myself to her.

31
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,625
But I can't!

32
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,916
You guys'll hover
around us like bugs!

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,416
Well...

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,291
Then you already know why
Nishina made us share a bedroom.

35
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,166
I hate her so much!

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,333
[IGARASHI] You might as well
take a breath and relax, Nana.

[NANASHIMA]
Ugh!

38
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,458
[SHINOMIYA]
I can't do this.

39
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,166
Why did I agree to come here?

40
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,875
I'm not an outdoors type
and I hate the ocean.

41
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,166
Pasty. Scrawny.

42
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,208
I don't even wanna
take my shirt off.

43
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,083
[SHINOMIYA groans]

44
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,750
This is gonna be humiliating.

--[knock on door]
--[MUTSUMI] Shinomiya?

46
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,625
Just checking.

47
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,000
You've been in there
quite a while.

48
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,375
Do you need some help?

49
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,875
[SHINOMIYA]
No, I'm fine.

50
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,250
Be out in a second!

00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,333
Oh, that's good.

52
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,250
I was starting to get worried.

53
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,125
Hey, you taking
a dump in there?

54
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,541
We all gotta use that thing
so don't stink it up.

55
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,708
I wasn't!

56
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,666
Sure.

57
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,166
Go ahead and grab the plunger.

Shut up! You're disgusting!

Okay, that's enough.

Let's get going.

00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,625
Like dealing with
a bunch of children.

Hey, boys!

69
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,625
How do you feel
about bodyboarding?

70
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,166
The water's waiting.

71

Bodyboarding?

72
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,458
Yeah.

73
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,083
I'm down to do a little surfing.

Same here.

Um... I don't really
know how to surf.

80

[SERINUMA]
Neither do I.

81
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,500
Maybe we can learn together!

could it be?

Okay, then.

00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,541
This should be
relatively simple.

Oh, yeah? You think so?

already forgiven him,

then nothing needs to be said.

00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,500
[MAN 09A]
Eh... I'd give her an 8.

167
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,000
[MAN 09B]
What? Way too high.

168
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,666
I'm feeling generous
so I give her a 6 out of 10.

169
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,083
Hey, 6, get to walking
and grab us a few more beers!

170
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,583
[SHINOMIYA]
Who are these guys?

171
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,708
No class.

172
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,125
Listen.

173
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,333
Why don't you and I head
back out to find a beach ball.

174
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,375
We could start a game.

175
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,416
But Shinomiya
hasn't finished eating.

176
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,291
[IGARASHI]
You ladies go ahead. 

177
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,958
We'll stay behind.

178
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,291
Okay.

179
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,958
I guess we'll see you
on the beach.

180
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,583
Yes! Check out those 10s!

181
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,666
[MEN]
Whoa!

182
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,708
[MAN 09C]
10 plus interest!

183
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,041
Being that hot
should be illegal.

184
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,666
Check out the rear on
that girl with the hoodie.

185
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,000
[MAN 09C] I'd love to
break off a piece of that.

186
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,958
--[SHINOMIYA] What?
--[NANASHIMA] Hi.

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,541
Hey! What's your problem?

188
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,958
You lookin' for a fight?

189
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,125
Let's all settle down.

190
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,333
[MAN 09C]
Who are you?

191
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,375
Hey, listen.

192
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,708
We don't wanna start trouble.

193
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,041
I mean it.

194
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,291
But you should be more
respectful to those girls.

195
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,500
If not... We'll have to make
sure you learn your manners.

196
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,041
I'll kill you.

197
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,125
Yeah?

198
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,041
Who do you think
you're dealing with?!

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,333
[MUTSUMI]
Are we clear?

200
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,708
Sure thing.

201
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,875
Got the ball! Come on!

202
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,708
[IGARASHI]
On our way!

203
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,125
All right, you can
be on my team.

204
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,166
Awesome!

205
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,125
Thanks for that.

206
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,333
Yep.

207
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,375
I don't think we'll have
to worry about them.

208
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,875
That's the first time I've
seen you angry, Mutsumi.

209
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:58,875
You okay?

210
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,458
Those men weren't
behaving nicely.

211
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,041
[SHINOMIYA]
Nishina led Serinuma away?

212
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,750
That means I'm the only one
who didn't do anything.

213
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,958
I'm a coward.

214
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,875
[SERINUMA]
Okay! Let's play!

215
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,708
[SHINOMIYA]
What was I thinking?

216
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,750
I can't compete with these guys.

217
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,875
How could I?

218
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,250
I'm not even in their league.

219
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,333
I... love...
food on a stick!

220
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:40,083
Barbecue! Barbecue! Barbecue!

221
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,166
I'm glad to see you happy.

222
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,166
But you know,
I could've had a chef

223
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,750
prepare the meal for us.

224
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,166
When we do all
the work ourselves,

225
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,166
it makes the food
taste even better!

226
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,666
Something wrong?

227
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,541
Nope!

228
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,458
Maybe I got too much sun today.

229
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,416
[SHINOMIYA] I've got
to get a hold of myself.

230
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,708
Serinuma needs someone
she can rely on.

231
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,541
Someone who isn't afraid
to take a stand.

232
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,416
A real man would protect her.

233
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,375
Hey! Be careful!

234
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,791
[NANASHIMA] Yeah, great!
Just put that anywhere!

235
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,916
[SHINOMIYA]
No...

236
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,333
[IGARASHI]
What was that about?

237
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,166
[SHINOMIYA]
I... I... 

238
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,666
[NANASHIMA]
You're such a klutz.

239
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,166
[NISHINA]
We'll have to start over.

240
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,666
[MUTSUMI]
Easily done.

241
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,041
[SHINOMIYA]
I can't do this.

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,583
[SHINOMIYA]
I... I'm going home.

243
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,208
[NANASHIMA]
Hey... kid!

[thunder rumbles]

245
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,416
[SHINOMIYA]
Why am I surprised?

246
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,333
Did I think they'd understand?

247
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,208
They're all laughing at me.

248
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,791
That's what I get for trying.

249
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,458
This was a waste of my time.

250
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,291
[SHINOMIYA gasps]

251
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,000
[SHINOMIYA] If I had
given up from the start,

252
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,083
I wouldn't be this miserable.

253
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,791
This is humiliating.

254
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,750
It's about to rain.
We have to find Shinomiya!

255
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,791
So, uh... Where did he go?

256
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,833
He's going... back home.

257
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,041
Okay.

258
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, the woods are
in the wrong direction.

259
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,708
[MUTSUMI]
Poor Shinomiya.

260
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,958
[NISHINA] Am I supposed
to feel bad for him?

261
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,541
[NANASHIMA]
He ran into the woods.

262
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,500
[GROUP]
Idiot.

263
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,125
He might get lost!

264
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,125
Eh... He'll come back
on his own eventually.

265
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,791
Getting lost in the woods
is a real possibility.

266
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,375
If he strays off the path
he may not find his way back.

[GROUP gasps]

268
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,458
I won't leave him.

If one of us is missing,
we're all missing!

00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,916
[IGARASHI]
That makes no sense.

I'll be right back!

Wait a second!

00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,083
Now we have to go in.

Fine!

I'm spending my vacation

Where are you?

We have to find him
before the storm gets worse.

Come on.

It'll be easier if
you don't look down.

Watch your step!

[MUTSUMI]
Thanks.

00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,916
Are we sure Shinomiya even
crossed this swinging casket?

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,291
[IGARASHI]
There's nowhere else to go.

[NANASHIMA] I can't do it!
Don't make me!

Nana. Let us walk around!

The rest of us
are trying to pass!

Just go! Hurry up!

00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't move!

I'll wait.

297
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,333
[SERINUMA]
I made it.

298
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,958
Just a bit farther!

299
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,500
[screaming]

300
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,708
I'm sorry!

00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,000
[SERINUMA]
Oh.

302
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,416
[IGARASHI]
Heh... All good here.

303
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,791
It's not quite as high
as it first appeared.

304
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,625
We almost died!

305
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,791
Who could've guessed
that we'd all live?

306
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,541
I thought I lost you
to the abyss!

307
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,375
We still might be too
far down to climb up again.

308
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,041
Look, there's a pathway.

309
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,041
Detour?

310
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,250
Maybe.

311
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,750
There's an old hotel
around here somewhere.

312
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,250
It may lead us there.

313
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,791
Right! Let's regroup there.
Good luck!

314

00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,833
Is that you?

327
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,791
[SHINOMIYA]
Serinuma?

328
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,750
Where are you?

329
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,750
[SHINOMIYA]
Stay away from here!

330
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,291
I thought I heard yelling.

331
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,541
He's over there.

332
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,833
[SERINUMA]
I'm coming!

333
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,625
[SHINOMIYA]
No! Please, stop!

334
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,500
[SERINUMA]
Tentacles versus pretty boy!

335
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,750
Please... Don't look at me
while I'm vulnerable.

336
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,833
[SERINUMA]
I'll get you out of there.

337
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,416
[SERINUMA]
How did this happen?

338
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,291
Well... Long story.

339
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,375
[SHINOMIYA] The vine got
caught on my ankle.

340
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,958
Then I fell.

341
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,583
I tried to get it off of me.

342
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,083
But for some reason it
twisted around my wrists!

343
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,083
I thrashed around
to break free.

344
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,833
But it made things worse!

345
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,958
So exposed! Helpless!

346
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,541
Yeah. It was terrible.

347
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,583
Sorry you saw me like that.

348
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,333
No! I'm happy
you weren't hurt!

349
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,083
Feel free to describe the
experience in vivid detail!

350
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,791
[SHINOMIYA] I must have looked
so weak and pathetic to her!

351
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,125
The group is searching for you.

352
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,541
We're meeting at an old hotel.
Back that way!

353
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,916
But... it's dark.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,416
We can find it!

355
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,625
[SHINOMIYA]
Why now?

356
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,041
[SERINUMA]
Let's get going, okay?

357
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,125
[SHINOMIYA]
Yeah!

358
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,791
[SERINUMA]
This must be it.

359
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,375
[BOTH yell]

360
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,458
[SERINUMA] Creepy building,
but at least it'll be dry!

361
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,250
Let's stay here
until the rain stops!

362
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,625
[SHINOMIYA]
Uh... sure!

363
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,791
[SERINUMA] I hope
everyone is else finds shelter.

364
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,833
[sneezes]

365
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,958
You cold?

366
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,583
Put this on.

367
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,541
What?

368
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,875
Are you sure you don't want it?

369
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,208
It's getting colder.

370
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,583
[SHINOMIYA]
I'll be fine.

371
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,375
Well... thank you.

372
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,750
Means a lot.

373
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,333
There's no reason for you
to thank me right now.

374
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,041
This is all my fault.

375
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,833
I ran away from all of you.

376
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,333
Sorry.

377
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,500
I feel like I can't
do anything right.

378
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,708
That's not true.

379
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,250
[rustling noise]

380
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,750
Did you... hear something?

381
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,375
Hey! Show yourself!

382
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,041

[BOTH yell]

384
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,458
[SHINOMIYA]
There's something in here!

385
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:25,583
[footsteps]

386
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,166
[SHINOMIYA] What do I do?
What do I do?

387
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,000
What do I do?
What do I do?

388
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,041
[CHANTING] I can save us.
I can save us.

389
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,333
I can save us.
I can save us.

390
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,208
[SHINOMIYA screams]
Where'd the chanting come from?!

391
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,541
I can save us.
I can save us.

392
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,833
Why do you look like that?!

393
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,000
Leave it to me!

394
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,666
All I have to do is use
my good luck charm

395
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,416
to deliver us from evil!

396
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,666
Oh!

397
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,333
I just remembered that
it was only an illusion!

398
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,916
But don't you worry!

399
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,708
I'll protect you in this scary
hotel in the middle of nowhere!

400
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,750
[SHINOMIYA] Calm down!
You're freaking me out!

401
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,250
[SERINUMA]
I can handle this.

402
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,250
I promise that you and I are
gonna get through this thing.

403
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,541
I'll be brave for
both of us, okay?

404
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,041
Sure. Thank you.

405
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,500
[SHINOMIYA]
She's shaking.

406
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,458
[SERINUMA]
Yeah! We're safe!

407
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,458
[SHINOMIYA]
She's as scared as I am.

408
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,000
[SHINOMIYA]
This isn't about me.

409
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,208
I can't keep wondering
if I'm good enough.

410
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,750
I have to take action.

411
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,250
Don't worry.

412
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,541
[SHINOMIYA]
I can't lose my nerve.

413
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,708
I promise you
have my protection.

[MAN 09A]
Yeah, right?

00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,250
I swear, both of 'em
started to shake!

Hi, there.

420
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,208
Nice to see you again.

421
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,041
Now why'd you
two sneak in here?

422
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,208
Looking for some privacy?

423
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,291
[SHINOMIYA] Those are the
guys from the beach house.

424
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,375
Why are they here?

425
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,666
[MAN 09C]
Surprised?

426
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,666
Didn't Mommy ever
teach you to knock?

427
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,000
We said we'd beat the crap outta
whoever came to our hangout

428
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,250
and here you are!

Aww. You don't have your
knights in shining armor

to take up for you!

431

Lucky break for us.

432
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,083
But wait.

433
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,833
I thought I heard you say
you'd protect her... right?

434
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,833
Weren't you the chump that hid
while your buddies

435
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,208
did all the work?

436
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,250
You feelin' like a big man now?

gonna do with you?

It's true.

I'm not strong like they are
and I'm a bit of a coward.

I am growing.

surprising all of them.

[NANASHIMA] Grow up, get a job,
and work until you're dead.

488
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,500
Life is meaningless.

489
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,041
[SERINUMA]
What's the matter, Nanashima?

490
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,333
[IGARASHI]
Let me guess.

491
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,833
You didn't bother to start
your summer homework

492
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,208
and now you're out of time.

493
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,333
[NANASHIMA]
Lemme copy yours!

494
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,791
I know you and all
the soccer club guys

495
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,833
cheat off of each other.

496
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,083
[IGARASHI]
Man, I would.

497
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,666
But... what's in it for me?

498
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,208
[NANASHIMA] Does our
friendship mean nothing?

499
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,208
Gimme a break!

500
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,458
[SERINUMA]
I'll let you copy mine!

501
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,291
All I want in return
is one little thing.

502
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,500
[IGARASHI, NANASHIMA]
We don't trust you.

503
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,583
[SERINUMA]
It's not what you're thinking!

504
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,041
Well, maybe it is.

505
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,875
Come with me to every one
of the otaku summer events!

506
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,375
[NANASHIMA]
It's cool. I'll just fail.
