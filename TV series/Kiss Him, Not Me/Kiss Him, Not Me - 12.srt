Thank you for your time.

165
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,500
Mutsumi!

166
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,958
You've got a lot of nerve!

167
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,458
Yeah, ya jerk!

168
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,166
[MUTSUMI]
Why are you trying to stop me?

169
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,250
Listen.

170
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,916
If you have the freedom
to tell someone

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,375
how you feel about them,

172
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,875
why wouldn't you?

173
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,958
Now's the time.

174
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,166
If you're ready,
then meet me on the roof.

175
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,791
See you after school.

176
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,541
[TEACHER 12A] Pay attention.
My job is on the line.

177
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,708
[IGARASHI]
Mutsumi makes a lot of sense.

178
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,041
This is Serinuma's decision.

179
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,458
We can't keep tripping
over each other.

180
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,416
Maybe we've all
been avoiding this.

181
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,750
If she's not interested,

182
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,250
will we still be able
to hang out together?

183
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,208
Am I okay with
just being a friend?

184
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,291
[SERINUMA]
Uhh...!

185
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,458
[SHINOMIYA]
If I tell her everything,

186
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,750
what good will it do if she
doesn't feel the same way?

187
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,000
There's no going back.

188
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,958
[BOTH laughing]

189
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,791
[NANASHIMA]
I know I'd be good to her.

190
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,458
She's inspired me
to be a better person.

191
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,958
[SERINUMA laughing]

192
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,458
[NISHINA] I want to be
the one she chooses.

193
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,333
[SERINUMA]
Mutsumi?

194
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,958
Serinuma. It's nice to see you.

195
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,083
Uh, is everything okay?

196
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,500
You all look a little worried.

197
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,916
Um... what's up?

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,458
Well... I asked you here

199
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,958
so I could tell you that
I have feelings for you.

200
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,541
But then... I found out
that I'm not alone.

201
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,666
It's true. I really like you.

202
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,416
I like you.

203
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,958
I... I like you.

204
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,041
I like you as well.

205
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,625
So do I... I really like you.

206
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,291
[GROUP]
Will you be my girlfriend?

207
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,083
Aw... Stop!

208
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,666
You're making me blush!

209
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,541
Well, no of course
I don't mean that,

210
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,333
--keep it coming!
--[doorbell rings]

211
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,750
Someone's at the door.

212
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,208
[NAKANO] No, you don't
have to hang up.

213
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,291
One second, okay?

214
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,625
I'm sure this won't take... 

215
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,166
Help me, A!

216
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,791
[BOTH yell]

217
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,625
Huh? They all asked you out?

218
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,416
[SERINUMA]
Yeah.

219
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,916
[NAKANO groans]

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,083
And they really put
themselves out there.

221
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,791
They were honest.

222
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,625
That's so awesome!

223
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,041
So spill it, girl!

224
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,125
What happened?

225
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,625
Well, um...
It's hard to explain.

226
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,125
We're not saying
this to put any kind

227
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,416
of pressure on you.

228
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,875
All of us have feelings for you

229
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,875
and it's been that
way for a while now.

230
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,541
Didn't mean to
put you on the spot.

231
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,041
Sorry.

232
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,458
[SERINUMA]
It's okay.

233
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,791
We think it's far that you
know exactly how we feel.

234
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,791
We'd never want
to rush you, but...

235
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,375
...you needed to know.

236
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,875
Come on! If they don't need
an answer right away,

237
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,916
why not savor the
process a little?

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,333
[SERINUMA]
I can't.

239
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,583
They deserve better.

240
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,375
I have to learn to
handle these situations.

241
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,500
And they're my friends.

242
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,291
I need to be truthful.

243
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,958
And... think this out.

244
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,625
I owe them that much.

245
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,375
You're right, Kae.

246
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,833
[NAKANO]
She's come so far.

247
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,541
I'm really proud of her.

248
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,000
So... Which one?

249
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,250
--What?
--Girl talk.

250
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,416
I'll name them,

251
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,041
and you tell me
what comes to mind.

252
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,500
Yeah? Ready?

253
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,583
Not sure.

254
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,458
[NAKANO]
Igarashi.

255
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,416
[SERINUMA]
5 x 7!

256
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,333
[NAKANO]
Nanashima?

257
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,500
[SERINUMA]
5 x 7!

258
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,916
[NAKANO]
Mutsumi?

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,166
[SERINUMA] His soothing
presence would help timid guys

260
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,458
come out of their shell.

261
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,833
[NAKANO]
What about Shinomiya?

262
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,916
[SERINUMA] He's a bit of a
klutz and very stubborn,

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,708
but the right man
could totally handle it.

264
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,958
[NAKANO]
And Nishina?

265
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,458
[SERINUMA]
The great author Yokoshima!

266
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,458
She's brilliant,

267
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,000
but so wrong about
Lord and Akane.

268
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,583
Will you give it a rest
with the fangirl talk?

269
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,375
It's okay to let yourself have
feelings for another person!

270
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,333
I just can't help myself!
It's tough!

271
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,458
I've always been more
comfortable on the sidelines!

272
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,875
I'm still learning!

273
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,250
I guess they brought
it on themselves

274
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,458
for hanging on this long.

275
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,625
You need time to
figure your feelings out.

276
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,333
How should I handle it?

277
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,166
Get to know them individually?

278
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,791
That might be a good start.

279
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,958
Yeah.

280
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,291
Wouldn't it be great
if you could follow

281
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,000
their character routes
like an <i>otome</i> ?

282
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,250
Too bad.

283
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,500
[SERINUMA]
I love it!

284
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,041
[NAKANO yelps]

285
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,375
If you're okay with it,

286
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,833
I'd like to go on separate
dates with each of you.

287
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,208
I'll get equal time
with everyone

288
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,916
and then make my decision.

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
A date?

290
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,625
That's right. Sorry.

291
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,583
I realized we never get alone
time, so why don't we?

292
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,625
It'd be nice.

293
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,666
Thank you for your patience.

294
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,791
Bye!

295
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,458
[IGARASHI]
Wait a sec!

296
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,000
It's finally happening.

297
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,666
She'll go on dates
with all of us.

298
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,708
I suppose that's the
best way to handle it.

299
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,250
We all get a chance with her
and then she's gonna choose?

300
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,750
Everything we've
been working towards

301
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,083
has come down to this.

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,958
[laughs]

303
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,833
So cool! Check it out.

304
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,125
[gasps]
Look how big that shark is!

305
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,625
That's the strangest
fish I've ever seen!

306
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,250
[IGARASHI] That's the
Asian sheepshead wrasse.

307
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,291
Oddly enough, they're
females when they're born,

308
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,791
but change sex once they mature.

309
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,250
Really? That's neat!

310
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,583
Wait, how did you know that?

311
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,166
I just know fish.

312
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,083
Okay. Research.
I wanted to impress you.

313
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,208
[SERINUMA]
Oh, yeah?

314
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,541
That's right. I'm smart.

315
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,125
[SERINUMA]
I wonder if I can stump you.

316
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,541
Why don't we give it
a try by the jellyfish?

317
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,458
[gasps]

318
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,041
Careful.

319
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,416
Yeah. Thank you.

320
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,791
[SERINUMA] Igarashi is
a lot of fun to talk to.

321
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,958
He's always
considerate and kind.

322
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,125
We get along really
well, actually!

323
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,125
And doesn't seem to mind
when I'm a goofball.

324
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,875
[IGARASHI] Why don't we

I have an answer.

485
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,833
I've chosen... 

486
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,750
[GROUP]
Who is it?

487
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,875
Right here.

488
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,875
[SERINUMA]
Shion from <i>Mirage Saga</i> !

489
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,250
[GROUP]
Huh?

490
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,916
They totally just announced
a whole 'nother season

491
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,916
of <i>Mirage Saga</i> !

492
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ah! And!

493
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,791
The ad had a mysterious
lurking shadow!

494
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,583
Without question it
had to be Shion, right?

495
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,750
There's no one else!
It just had to be him!

496
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,250
I didn't sleep a wink
last night because

497
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,291
I was looking through every
animators' blog for clues.

498
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,333
It looks like the production
is already in full swing!

499
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,833
I gotta be honest with you.

500
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,250
I don't think I'll have the time
to focus on anything else!

501
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,125
How could I possibly start a
relationship with anyone

502
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,666
right now when my
attention is being tugged

503
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,958
in so many directions?

504
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,291
There'll be so much
to learn and little hints

505
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,791
are already being scattered
across the internet!

506
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,208
Oh, and all the new faces!

507
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,000
A naughty little
pairing might be born!

508
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,666
You see what I'm saying?

509
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,541
No, it's gotta be Terra
and Shion hands down.

510
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,708
They're meant to be!

511
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:21,916
I've been patiently
waiting for so long!

512
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,041
My boy love dreams
are finally coming true!

513
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,291
Can't you just feel the magic?
I'm shivering in delight!

514
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,458
I can't stop thinking about it.

515
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,166
Oh! Anime Ito is having a sale!

516
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,500
Well, guess I
better head off! Bye!

517
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,416
[laughing]

518
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,458
[GROUP]
Wait!

519
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,541
[IGARASHI] Uh... Anybody
get what just happened?

520
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,708
[NANASHIMA]
You call that an answer?

521
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:41,750
Don't leave us hanging!

522
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,291
[SHINOMIYA]
Serinuma, come back!

523
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,750
[NISHINA] Is <i>Mirage Saga</i>
really getting another season?

524
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,791
[MUTSUMI] She looked
so happy as she ran away!

525
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:48,791
Isn't that wonderful?

526
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,166
[GROUP]
No, it's not!

527
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,083
[SERINUMA] The prince should
always be with the princess.

528
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,916
Who's the one in charge
of making rules like that?

529
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,166
I mean, come on,
look at these two!

530
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,708
I can't deny the
longing in my soul!

531
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,958
The princess lived
a life full of joy.

532
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,875
In fact, everyone else did too!

533
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,291
It was a heartwarming
happily ever after.

534
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,125
And she loved every second!

535
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,708
[laughing]
