00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,583
Well, it's this weekend.

2
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,083
The anniversary of Lord's death.

3
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,458
[GROUP]
Huh?

4
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,708
The lord in <i>Katchu Ranbu</i>
was based on a real man.

5
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,375
He was a samurai
named Hyakki Sametora.

6
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:53,708
Sametora?

7
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,416
That's an interesting
person to inspire a show.

8
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,875
There's going to be
a memorial service

9
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,000
held for him tomorrow at 7 AM.

10
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,541
Even if we left early,
we still wouldn't make it.

11
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,750
[SERINUMA gasps]

12
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,250
There are no tickets
for the night bus left!

13
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,083
Why don't we take my helicopter?

14
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,500
We can't!

15
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,791
The journey is far!

16
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,250
The road is long!

17
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,291
For him... I'll get there
without taking the easy way!

18
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,958
Inspirational!

19
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,500
You've touched my heart!

20
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,666
I'll stand proudly by your side
as we slum it like peasants!

21
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,666
You'd do that?

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,916
You realize we're the
peasants she's talkin' about.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,416
[NISHINA] In that case,
it might be a good idea

24
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,833
for us go a day early.

25
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,166
[SERINUMA]
Okay!

26
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,958
And we'll need to figure
out a cheap place to stay.

27
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,958
Wait! You're not spending
the night together, right?

28
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,625
Well, we may have
no other option.

29
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,708
None of you have an
interest in history, do you?

30
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,708
Me!

31
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,166
Would you mind
if I tagged along?

32
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,583
My eyes!

33
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,958
We'd love to
attend the ceremony.

34
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,958
Bring us.

35
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,958
Aw! Let's go together!

36
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,125
All right!

37
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,791
[SERINUMA laughs]

38
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,208
It's so rustic
and charming! Nice!

39
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,208
I love the decrepit motif!

[SERINUMA, NISHINA giggle]

[NANASHIMA]
Yeah, baby!

42
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,291
Let's hit the hot springs!

43
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,291
Woo!

00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,625
[IGARASHI]
Give it a rest, Nana!

Look at your little nipples!

What? Shut up!

[NANASHIMA]
They're like pencil erasers!

[SERINUMA, NISHINA] What on
Earth's going on over there?

00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,666
[NANASHIMA] Come here!
I'm gonna twist 'em off!

Ha ha! I got one card left!

Oh, yeah?

I have your back, Nanashima!

I bet they were
cheating! Shameful!

Oh, you guys are goin' down!

Yeah. Thank you.

I scared her.

We certainly have a
lot of young women here

this morning.

How peculiar.

I wonder what brought them here.

Rest in peace.

That was the most beautiful
service I've ever been to.

to his memory.

that he protected his lord!

Now we're crowded today,

so you kids need
to move along, please.

[SERINUMA]
I'll miss you!

let us spend the night?!

It's their precious Sametora!

Adorable! Look at that face!

[IGARASHI] The character is
based on that guy?!

[NANASHIMA]
Which one is the improvement?

123

They're both gross.

[SHINOMIYA] How does a
dead samurai get more girls

than I do?

Hey.

How many times am I gonna have
to tell you kids to move on?

No, my lord!

We didn't get
enough time with him!

That's okay! I have an idea!

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,375
How would you like
to pay the lord a visit?

But how?

[NANASHIMA]
Mutsumi, you freak!

134

This is where
the lord was buried.

[SHINOMIYA]
We don't need to see this!

[SERINUMA, NISHINA]
My lord!

[IGARASHI] Um... are you
two ready to get going?

He's a happy lord.

Your grave is lovely.

Man, am I starving!

Maybe we should
take a break for lunch!

[NISHINA crying]

144
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,125
One or two pictures, okay?!

145
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,333
[NANASHIMA]
You're sick!

00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,375
[SERINUMA sighs]
I'm glad we came.

Agreed. Splendid!

So cool!
The cutest gravesite ever!

I'm gonna make it
my wallpaper picture.

I think that's a terrific idea!

You need help. Bad.

Fun fact.

155
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,708
This is where they buried
his headless remains.

00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,416
[MUTSUMI]
Sametora battled his son in war.

157
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,916
He won, then pleaded
to have his son spared

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,625
from imminent execution.

159
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,333
Though his appeal was accepted,

160
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,958
they demanded a
sacrifice in exchange.

161
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,583
Sametora had to take his own
life by performing seppuku.

[NISHINA, SERINUMA gasp]

163
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,625
[MUTSUMI] Moments before
he performed the act,

164
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,500
he discovered that his son
had already been murdered.

What?

Here again...

00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,750

need to turn around.

[MUTSUMI]
Serinuma!

339
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,458
Did you trip?

340
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,000
She's burning up!

341
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,458
So... cold...

342
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,083
She has to get warm somehow.

343
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,833
We have to get her out
of these wet clothes.

344
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,166
Forgive me.

345

I must...

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,958
This is freakin'
me out, you guys!

347
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,083
I can't take it!

348
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,000
Have we been going in circles?

349
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,000
[IGARASHI] We never
even turned off the path!

You think I don't know that?

[NISHINA]
Then how?

Your fever's gone down!

00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,833
[MUTSUMI]
Back into your clothes.

360
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,416
I promise not to peek!

00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,208
Huh? What?

00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,458
Where am I? What happened?

363
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,708
You fainted.

364
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,041
I brought you here to warm up.

What? You saved my life!

best dream I've ever had!

Wonderful.

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,166
I was being snuggled
by a big cat.

369
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,416
So warm. So fluffy.

370
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,833
I wish it were real.

helped us out back there.

Have you seen anyone
else around here?

379
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,083
We got separated from
our friends a while ago.

[MAN 07B] There's no need
for you to worry about them.

You'll be reunited

They look like some kind
of weird floating fireballs!

This can't be real!

I bought it at the shrine.

It protected us.

know that incantation?

for shiitake mushrooms

so real and amazing.

sauna outside right now,

494
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,250
so don't plan anything outdoors.

495
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,666
[NANASHIMA] All right,
then where would you go,

496
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,541
smart guy?

497
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,916
[SHINOMIYA]
Um... the zoo?

498
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,750
[NANASHIMA] How many inside
zoos have you been to?

499
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,208
[SHINOMIYA] It was the
first thing I thought of!

500
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,583
Really, it doesn't
matter where you go

501
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,000
as long as you're punctual.

502
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,166
[NANASHIMA] That's the dorkiest
thing I've ever heard.

503
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,666
It's not normal to be an
hour early for everything.

504
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,750
It makes you look like
a time-obsessed loser!

505
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,791
[SHINOMIYA]
Hey!
