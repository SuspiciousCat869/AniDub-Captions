I'm fine. What happened?

Nanashima fell on
top of you in P.E.

39
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,375
You hit the wall and passed out,

it's gotta be 5x7.

This is my second year

it's pretty obvious!

When I witness the
splendor of a passionate bond

my chest starts getting hot

and I can't help but pair them!

a real connection,

more than enough!

[SERINUMA]
What?!

485
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,625
[SERINUMA] Any special merch
will be gone in no time.

486
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,833
This is obviously some divine
intervention beckoning me in,

487
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,666
tempting me with precious goods!

488
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,291
What if there's something
super rare inside,

489
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,708
and this is my one chance?

490
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,416
I have to go check it out!

491
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,208
[NANASHIMA]
Hey, Serinuma?

492
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,458
What's the matter with you?

493
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,250
Uh, nothing!

494
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,708
[SERINUMA]
You're doing great!

495
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,166
Take some deep breaths and
focus on staying in control.

496
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,083
You've kept it together
all this time.

497
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,458
Don't throw it away now!

498
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,666
Not with the end in sight!

499

[SHOPKEEP 01A] We have
only one limited item left!

500
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,041
Sorry about this.

501
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,708
But I... 

502
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,208
I have to go.
I have to go.

503
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,166
I have to go!

504
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,416
Serinuma!

505
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,458
[IGARASHI]
There she is.

[GROUP gasps]

507
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,625
I'm sorry.

508
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,708
I cannot deny it.

509
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,875
I'm an otaku.

00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,458
Oh. Fangirl.

511
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,000
I apologize for
running off like that.

512
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,000
If I had let the opportunity
for rare merch slip away...

513
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,125
I'd regret it for
the rest of my life!

514
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,916
It's precious.

515
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,708
Seriously?

516
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,083
[SERINUMA] I'm still surprised
that you asked me out.

517
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,125
I really tried to act
like a normal girl,

518
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,416
but I didn't have it in me.

519
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,333
[SERINUMA]
It was all for nothing.

520
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,000
I blew it.

521
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,750
[SERINUMA] I worried so much
about not showing you my flaws

522
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,291
that I couldn't enjoy myself.

523
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,166
I'm so sorry.

[GROUP gasps]

525
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,916
[SERINUMA] But... I can't
pretend to be something I'm not.

526
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,041
Thanks for today.

527
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,708
I'll never forget it.

528
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,500
Sorry.

529
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,666
I mean no disrespect...
but what's the problem?

530
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,666
You have interests.

531
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,166
Isn't that a good thing?

532
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,000
There's no harm in that.

533
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,000
Your eyes are sparkling.

00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,333
For the first time this
evening, you're glowing.

535
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,458
I like it.

You're lovely.

Thank you so much!

[GROUP gasps]

This is so much better than
the weird lifeless eyes

540
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,333
you've had all night.

541
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,916
I was starting to think
you had the personality

542
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,458
of a dead fish.

543
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,791
Ya know, I've seen anime
before... <i>Evangahlion</i> ?

00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,125
[SHINOMIYA]
Don't worry about it.

545
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,875
[NANASHIMA] Why don't you pick
the next stop for the night?

[IGARASHI]
We're down for anything!

You mean it?

Thank you so much!

I know exactly
where I want to go!

We can check out
the store again!

Is that cool?

552

[SERINUMA]
And that's how it went.

553
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,458
We had such a great time!

554
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,375
They were all so nice to me.

555
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,208
And... This is the best part.

556
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,291
I got a 5x7!

Kae, why'd you even
go on a date with them?

558
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,916
And it's 7x5.

559
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,625
[NANASHIMA]
So spill it, Igarashi.

560
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,250
Have you ever had
a crush on anyone?

561
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,125
[IGARASHI]
Of course I have.

[NANASHIMA]
Oh, yeah?

563
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,041
Well, what's your type?

What's with the interrogation?

00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,833
[NANASHIMA]
You ashamed or something?

566
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,041
[IGARASHI] I guess I like a
mature girl who has a good head

567
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:02,916
on her shoulders.

568
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,375
[NANASHIMA]
No way!

569
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,500
I figured you'd want a girl
who's your age or younger.

570
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,333
[IGARASHI sighs]
It's not about age.

571
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,500
I just can't deal with girls
who are loud and childish.

572
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,666
[NANASHIMA] Your type of girl
sounds way too predictable.

573
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,916
Kinda dull.

574
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,708
I go for the ladies who
are upbeat and bright.

575
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,333
They're way more fun that way!
