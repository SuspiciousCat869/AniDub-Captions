[KIDS chattering]

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
He has excellent movement.
He's well trained.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI]
Hmph.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:28.194 position:50% align:center
Call us up anytime you like.
Always happy to help the team.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.281 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Good. Use your
jab to set the pace.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.450 position:50% align:center
That's how you control
the flow of the fight.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
Always be planning
the next move.

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center
The other guy isn't
gonna wait for you.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] The important thing
is finding a balance

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
where you can use
the Gear effectively

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.876 position:50% align:center
without losing speed.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50% align:center
Nobody wants to
watch a slow boxer.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
If you wanna make it, you gotta
put butts in those seats.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
It seems like things
are going well.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center
Those two could be
the perfect duo.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
What, you mean
they're better than us?

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI chuckles]

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.442 position:50% align:center
I got a big one!

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.569 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Us, too!

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
Hmm.

Abuhachi's here!

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.702 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.245 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
Come on, Oicho, let's go.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.339 position:50% align:center
[KIDS chuckling]

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.549 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
Okay, everyone, try and behave.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.636 position:50% align:center
At least for long enough
to get a picture.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.888 position:50% align:center
I managed to get you guys
the whole sports column,

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.306 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm awesome like that.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.058 position:50% align:center
No need to thank me.

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.853 position:50% align:center
Hey, Bonjiri! Get those
veggies in the shot!

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.397 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.148 position:50% align:center
Hey, you two in the back, it's
not gonna kill you to smile!

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.692 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.237 position:50% align:center
[KIDS laughing]

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.197 position:50% align:center
Now, here we go!

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.828 position:50% align:center
Ready, and... cheese!

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.777 position:50% align:center
Not sure why you thought
now's the time

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.071 position:50% align:center
to start worryin;'
about the place.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I just wanna know
what happened to it.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50% align:center
That's all I need. I won't
cause you any trouble.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI]
Cause me trouble?

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.334 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna make somethin'
perfectly clear to you,

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
so listen.

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
I don't know where
you've been, or why.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50% align:center
And I could give a shit.
We're strangers.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.595 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.477 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI] Everything they
had got washed away.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
A typhoon came through
and the river flooded.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
By some miracle,
everybody made it out

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
with no injuries or deaths.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
Hey, boss?

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
Maintenance is done,

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
so I'm takin' this
to Veterans' Affairs.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
After that, I'll follow up
on the delinquent tabs,

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
and then head home.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
Thought you said you
didn't take apprentices.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI sighs]

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI] You've got some
nerve bringin' that up.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
Five years ago, you walked
out on those kids.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
Oicho. Forgive me.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
How are they? Is everyone
doing all right?

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
[OICHO] They're all fine.
Thanks for nothin'.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
And Sachio?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
Is he okay?

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
Do you really think he
wants to see you again?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
All that's in the past.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
All that's in the past.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
[JOE] So even if he had
another surgery...

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A] Right. It's already
spread into his lymph nodes.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
At this point, it's doubtful we
could remove it completely.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50% align:center
It's time to discuss how his
treatment should proceed.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50% align:center
Does he have family?

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
That's us.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
We're having lots of fun...

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A] We've done as
much as we can for him.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
It pains me to have
tell you this,

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
but Mr. Nanbu is
unlikely to live

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
more than about six
months, at most.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
There are a few cutting-edge
procedures available

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
that might buy him
a bit more time,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
but they're all quite expensive.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
By his own indication,
he would prefer

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50% align:center
to live out the rest
of his days in peace,

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
with his family at his side.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
I've been listenin' to the news.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
They say the kid that
Yuri's been bringin' up

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
is lookin' for a match with you.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
Think his name was
somethin' like--

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
You mean Liu?

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
Yeah, that's the one.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
Well, Joe? You got
the offer, didn't ya?

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
Hm?

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
They're asking
for an exhibition.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
It's been more than a year now,

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
and everybody wants to
see Joe back in the ring.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
Even if it's an exhibition,

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
if the kid's serious
about it, why not?

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
I say you should think
of it as a gift to Yuri.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
Celebrate his return
to Megaloboxing.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
I got the chance to fight
Yuri in the ring.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
I don't regret the way
things have gone.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
We sure had fun.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
That's all in the
past now, though.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
Joe. Sachio. We've put
up one hell of a fight.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
But God's honest truth is,
I don't have a lotta time.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna waste it
try'na borrow a little more.

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
Is this what you want?

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
I don't have to tell
you what matters.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
You already know, don't'cha?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
I'm home!

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
Welcome back.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] Pops seemed to
be doing well today.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he's been getting a
little bit of his appetite back.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Sachio.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
Don't overdo it, okay?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Pops told me the same thing.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
That taking care of him
was the doctors' job.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
He said I didn't need
to be there every day.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
And I told him off for it.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
I said I was there
'cause I wanted to be,

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.383 position:50% align:center
and I didn't have to
do what he told me.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
And he said: "Well, I want some
peace and quiet, so get out!"

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
I didn't wanna argue.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
But when I got ready to leave,
he looked so lonely.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
At least he's letting
that much show.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] He was the one who
told me to figure out for myself

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
what I wanted to do.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense at all.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.534 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Is this really all we can do?

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
Sachio?

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
I get that it's
Pops' choice to make,

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
and I should honor his wishes,

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.960 position:50% align:center
but there's gotta be a
better way, hasn't there?

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
I... just don't know
what's right anymore.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Hey, Joe?

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
This can't really be
how it ends, can it?!

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO crying]

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
I don't wanna watch you suffer.

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
But if there's still a chance,

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna give up, either.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Please, Pops. Will you
fight with me one more time?

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
[NANBU grunts]

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
The nerve of ya,

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
not even lettin' an old
man die in peace.

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
To hell with it.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
I knew my luck ran out
the moment I met you.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
Who's there?

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
You.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
Who said you could
be in our house?

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
You weren't invited! Get out!

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO yells]

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
[JOE groans]

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:23.159 position:50% align:center
I was wrong... Sachio.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
I heard you'd been
skulking around here,

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
and beating the shit out
of ya sounded good.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
Seems somebody else
had the same idea.

[JOE]
Aragaki.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI]
It happened about a year ago.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
Sachio realized the
river was flooding.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
He gathered all the kids and
got 'em to safety in the truck.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
If he'd been a minute later,
they might not have made it.

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
They apparently didn't get
evacuation notices out there.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI] It was a real shock
when they all showed up

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the night,
soaked to the bone.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
The little ones were
the first to take off.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
They all ended up
at an orphanage

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.406 position:50% align:center
run by the Shirato Group.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
That was at Sachio's request.
He knew they'd be safe there.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
The other four stuck around a
while and they grew up quick.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
They're not the kids
you remember anymore.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
Oicho's apprenticing
for Mr. Abuhachi,

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
as you've already seen.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
Santa is a freelance reporter
working the Megaloboxing beat.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
Bonjiri became a chef and
opened up his own restaurant.

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
It's a tiny little place
on the outskirts of town,

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
but it's his,
and he's makin' it work.

00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
And Sachio? Do you know
what he's up to?

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
He came to me after the flood
wanting to learn Megaloboxing.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
He wasn't built for fighting,
and I knew that from the start.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
But the look in his eyes said
he wouldn't be talked out of it.

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI] About six months
later, he told me he'd found

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
somewhere else he could
stay, so he took off.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
And not long after that,
I heard he was fighting matches

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
on the underground circuit.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.599 position:50% align:center
Ready, kid? It's showtime.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.480 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI] I'm not sure why you
finally decided to come back,

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
but honestly, it makes
no difference anymore.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.319 position:50% align:center
I don't know how many times
I wished you were here,

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
and that makes no
difference either.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
Somehow, the kids managed
to pull through it

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
all on their own.

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
There's no one here
who needs you now.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.749 position:50% align:center
Nowhere for you to go back to.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] C'mon, tiny,
ya gonna swing back or what?

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
You scared or somethin', kid?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
[MAN C]
What do you call those?

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
[MAN D]
You're nowhere near him!

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
Aww, Christ. I dunno how
much more I can watch.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
Kid's a loser.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
[JOE] You keep fighting like
that, you're not gonna survive.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Stay away.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
brought you back, Joe,

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
but take care of it quick,

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
and then get the
hell out of town.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
Don't let any of us catch
you around here ever again.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
You should've died for your own
dream and left us out of it.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] What do you mean
you accepted the match?

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
Why are you scowling
at me like that?

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.127 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] You told us you
were never setting foot

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
in the ring again!

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
[JOE] It's one last
match before I retire,

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
and with the prize money,

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
we can get Pops the
best treatment there is.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
That's your plan?
Did you tell Pops about it?

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about that.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
By the way, you went to
see him today, right?

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
Did he seem okay?

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
He was mostly asleep.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
We talked to him, but we didn't
know if he could hear us.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
Mhm.

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
He gets sleepy 'cause
his meds are strong,

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
and today, he couldn't
even recognize me.

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:23.168 position:50% align:center
But we're almost there, guys.
I know I can figure this out.

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] Joe, you heard
what the doctor said.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
We could buy him some time,
but he can never fully recover.

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
And Pops told us himself
he didn't want us to--

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
But we don't know!

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center

[GIRL B cries]

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:47.817 position:50% align:center
You guys, as long as
Pops keeps holding out,

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
we can still have hope.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
I wanna believe that more
than anything, but please.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
Remember how we got here?

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
We chased an impossible dream
and made it come true.

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
Right, Sachio?

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.002 position:50% align:center
I need you all to believe.

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
And if I can win this match,

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
Pops will come home to
us happy and healthy.

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Yeah.

You can do it, Joe!

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
[BOY C]
You're the best!

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Now, let's eat!

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center

Yeah!

[SACHIO]
Pops! Doctor! Anyone!

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:44.249 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? Hang on, Pops!

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A] Mr. Nanbu!
Can you hear me, Mr. Nanbu?

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
Let's get his
breathing stabilized

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
and get him back to bed
for an examination.

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Joe!

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
Whatcha doin' there, kid?

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
It's a good luck charm.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
If it comes off,
I'll put it right back.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
Ah. Not bad.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI] Come on. You've got
more than that, right?

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI] Even if you weren't
coming off a two-year gap,

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
Liu's a tough fight!

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
Last minute!

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
Let's go visit Pops.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI] I want you to know
that I'm only helping you

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
at Coach Nanbu's request.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
I don't believe you
should've taken this fight.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
I've made up my mind.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Why don't you ever visit Pops?

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
[JOE] You know why.
My match is coming up.

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] Who the hell
cares about the match?

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
Pops really needs you
to be there with him!

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
Go stay by his side, even if
it's just for a little while.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
Joe, please!

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center
That's enough, Sachio.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
I made him a promise
that I would fight.

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
I told you, if I win this match,

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
the prize money might
be enough to save him.

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
As long as he's alive, there's
a chance he can still get--

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
How are you so sure?!

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
Will he last that long? It could
end today, or tomorrow.

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
You know that!
Enough excuses already!

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't be thinking
this much about death.

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
It'll wear you down quick.

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:28.079 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] And you
shouldn't be avoiding it!

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
What Pops needs more than
anything right now

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:30.999 position:50% align:center
is his family.

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
He doesn't have much time left,

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
and he should be
spending it with us!

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
But all you wanna do
is run away to the ring!

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
Look, I just--

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.390 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
We're not a team anymore.

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
It's over!

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:11.539 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
All that's in the past.
