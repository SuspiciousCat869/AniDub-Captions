That's the way

Show up uninvited and start
makin' trouble out the gate.

Man, someone oughta chase 'em

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:55.699 position:50% align:center
[DRIFTER A] There's a little
nest of immigrants

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.411 position:50% align:center
just outside the city limits.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:02.872 position:50% align:center

You deal with those
immigrants? What for?

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
Because I'm running
a business here.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.627 position:50% align:center
I deal with whoever pays me.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
Because in this world,
the customer is king.

[BERTIE] Cash is king,
dumbass. He just said that.

Seems like you're also "dealing"
with one of those immigrants.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
Didn't I tell you,
no more stealing?

These are easy to part out.

Already sold it.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
Didn't get half of Jack

That hurt!

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center

Hey, you woke up.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
Think you've slept off
whatever it was?

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Yeah. Sorry for the trouble.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
It was scary watching you

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
suddenly take a
header like that.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling you've been
through a lot, haven't you?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be a while
before your bike's ready,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
and you're more than welcome

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
to stay in this
trailer till then.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center

Don't worry about that.
He barely ever comes home.

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
Now and then I let myself
in, clean up a bit,

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
and air it out before
it gets too bad.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
I hadn't mentioned,

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
we're holding our
yearly festival today.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
The spirits of our family

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
to visit us for one
night out of the year.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
So to make sure they
don't lose their way,

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
we line their path
with flower petals.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
My name's Mara.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.068 position:50% align:center
If you need anything,
let me know, okay?

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
Not that it makes up for
what my fool of a son did.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
Wait, your son? Right.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you figured it out.

We're allowed to be here--

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.375 position:50% align:center
we've been keeping up
with the payments!

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
[MASUDA] Yes, but your agreement
was with the late landowner,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
and the new landowner
plans to sell the property.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.758 position:50% align:center
But where are we supposed
to go if we can't stay here?

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
Your living arrangements
are your own concern.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center

It's you.

Looks like your

Herbal tea must've
done the trick.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] The auction's
not for a while yet.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
No need for the show of force.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
This doesn't have to be
a big confrontation.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
It wasn't until you
chose to make it one.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
All due respect, sir,

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
you can't push us and
think we won't push back.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
Today's a very important
day for us, you see.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
No reason we can't enjoy
it in peace, is there?

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
[MASUDA]
The auction is in two weeks.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
Your right to occupancy ends
when the sale closes.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
That's it. Let's go.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT A]
They can't just throw us out!

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.504 position:50% align:center
What gives them the right?

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
[MIO] Um, the law?
It's not like we own this land.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
And would you even
wanna own this dump?

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
I say to hell with it,
let's move on.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
Hush, Mio. You know better.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.852 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
The kid might have
a point, though.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] It'll be okay.
I'm gonna buy this land.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
And here's Chief, as always,

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
with another fat
load of hot air.

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
Say whatever you want,
but it's just words.

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
I believe words are the best way
to solve things most times.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
How's that approach been workin'
for you in the ring, huh, Chief?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANTS laughing]

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
Hey, the festival's still on
and it's gettin' dark.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.798 position:50% align:center
Let's get those petals down,

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
or else the dead are
gonna lose their way.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:09.521 position:50% align:center
Ever heard that?
"My home is your home."

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
And this place is our home now.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] They'd be cockscomb
flowers in the old country.

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
Hard to come by 'round here.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
So it's your place.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for
taking up your bed.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] You're fine.
Got another one right there.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
I know I've always got
a place to go back to.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
Doesn't bother me bein'
away from it a little while.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Fact is,
I was never a Megaloboxer.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Meaning you were never ranked.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Makes for a hell of a
sales pitch though, don't it?

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
[JOE chuckles]

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
In that parking lot,

00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
you asked me if
I was embarrassed.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:02.300 position:50% align:center
None of us were looking
for a place to die

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
when we came to this country.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
We're here to live.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
So if we're living, what's
to be embarrassed about?

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
[JOE] When'd you figure
it out? Who I was.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
Right off the bat.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
You were my son's
idol way back when.

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
You might not have known this,

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
but Gearless Joe was
our symbol of hope.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
You walked into
that ring Gearless

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
and walked out the champion.

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:34.749 position:50% align:center
You set foot on new
ground with nothing

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
but your hunger and your wits
and made it your own.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
And for that whole long,
dark boat ride over,

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
we all hoped our stories
might go that way, too.

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
But the truth of it hasn't
been quite so rosy.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
We scrape by on slave wages

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
at the jobs none
of the locals want.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
Then they turn around
and call us parasites

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
like we took something from 'em.

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
So we set up camp in this
abandoned amusement park,

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
well out of their way.

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
But it seems that's
an issue now, too.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
Gearless Joe is here.

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm a fool, but you
put a dream in my head

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.835 position:50% align:center
and I'm not ready to wake up.

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
They're gonna be holding a big
tournament in town here soon,

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
and I plan to win it and use the
prize money to buy this land.

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:32.057 position:50% align:center
Even if none of them
believe I can do it.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.685 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Your dreams are
your business, not mine.

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
But are you sure you're willing

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
to give up everything
chasing that dream?

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
Maybe you've made up your mind.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
Not my problem.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
So, where you off to next?

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Couldn't say.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
Without a home to go back
to, it doesn't matter.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
The way you've been fighting,

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
you know it'll kill you.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Yeah.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:11.096 position:50% align:center
May I have this
dance, young lady?

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
You mighta had a few
too many, Chief.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:18.144 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANTS laughing]

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
[SHIGA]
C'mon. Friggin' game.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
Yo.

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.490 position:50% align:center
Hey. What up?

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
Dude, that sucked back there!

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
Nah, bitch, don't even.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
Y'all just straight
up ditched me.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
What sucked back there is you.

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's not like that.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
We were gonna come back
with some weapons. Right?

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure.

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
[TATSUO]
Who the hell is this?

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
[TAKUBON]
Oh, right, his name is Mio.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
He's part of the crew.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
[TATSUO]
Your crew? This kid?

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
[TAKUBON] He's the guy
I was talkin' about.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
This is Tatsu, and he
takes care of us.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
Good to meet you.

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
[TAKUBON] So what's with that
creepy hobo from before?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
Oh, that guy? Well, you see...

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
[MARA] Sorry for causing
you so much trouble.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
All good.

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
[MARA]
Oh, and also,

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if
this'll be enough

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
to get you into a
new set of Gear,

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
but it's as much as I
can afford right now.

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
My Gear was falling apart,

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
and it was nice having
someone take care of me.

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
Call it even.

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
At times, we gotta commit
bad deeds for a good reason.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
Some wisdom from back
home. Remember that.

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
He's leaving?

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
Papi, he left.

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Why would you let him go?

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center
[MARA]
Huh?

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
Chief, my friend.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
Mister Hikawa.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
We told your associates we're
not quite ready to leave.

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center
We can have that
conversation later.

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
Right now I'm more
interested in somebody

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
who's been staying
in your community.

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
That so? What's this
amigo look like?

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
Cut the crap!
Where the hell is he?

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:57.637 position:50% align:center
Cat's outta the bag.
I know Gearless Joe's here.

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
I'm a big fan,
and I'm willin' to bet

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
there are more than
a few of us around.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
Wait, Gearless Joe?

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
Is he saying that guy was Joe?

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
[HIKAWA] And having a living
legend headlining the show

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
is just good business.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
It might be worth more
to our associates

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
than a rundown amusement park.

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
You put us in touch with Joe,

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
we might be able to find a way
to push back the auction.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:22.620 position:50% align:center
So can we help each other out?

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
That is a generous offer.

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
But your info's a
little out of date.

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
Gearless Joe took off
just a bit ago.

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:32.881 position:50% align:center
He took off?

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
Little piece of shit.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
Well, him being here or not
doesn't change a thing.

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
[HIKAWA]
Hm. What do you mean by that?

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
I'm entering that
tournament myself.

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
Paperwork's already filled out.

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
You're not joking.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.070 position:50% align:center
You're so punch-drunk
you think you're a boxer.

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
You're a fraud who
makes boxers look good.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
Not much money in that.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
Sure as hell not enough
to pay for this land.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
[HIKAWA]
Well then, if it's like that,

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
I suppose we don't
have much to discuss.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
I'll be prayin' for ya.
Better hope God hears.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
Chief, you're crazy.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
That's your plan, really?

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering, yelling]

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Maybe I'm a fool,
but you put a dream in my head

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
and I'm not ready to wake up.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
First things first, you're gonna
need a new set of Gear.

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
Joe ain't gonna be fightin'
Gearless. Not now.

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Hey, Pops.

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.399 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
It was me who killed
you, wasn't it?

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
You're damn right it was you.

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center
[NANBU] So, partner,
where we headed next?

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:05.617 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
You forget somethin', Joe?

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Your dream.

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:10.830 position:50% align:center
You said you're not
ready to wake up yet.

00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:12.582 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
I'd forgotten that dream.

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
I wanna see how it ends.

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
Let me help you with this.

00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:21.341 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:27.347 position:50% align:center
Offer's appreciated, mi amigo.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.474 position:50% align:center
One condition.

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.518 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:39.275 position:50% align:center
I got rid of the pills.
