00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:12.512 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] I gotta win
three fights to clinch it.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.099 position:50% align:center
How would you go about that?

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
I'd focus on avoiding
damage first.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
Can't go into the
final match injured,

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
else the work you did for
the first two won't count.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
So I'd play the defensive
game, make 'em chase me,

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.488 position:50% align:center
let 'em wear themselves
out on my guard.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Find an opening, and counter.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Good. Find your
range and stay there.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center
[NANBU] You're really
gettin' after it, kid.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.015 position:50% align:center
It's like you're fightin'
right there with him.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.434 position:50% align:center
Just like the old days.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.773 position:50% align:center
Whoa. You good, Joe?

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:08.651 position:50% align:center

Pops, no!

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.922 position:50% align:center
How come you never showed up?

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.801 position:50% align:center
Sachio, I was--

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:36.137 position:50% align:center
Now Pops is dead and
it's all because of you!

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.771 position:50% align:center
I wanted to believe in you,
but how could I let that go?

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
You wanna try readin' the sign?

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
It's an important skill
none of you have.

Good work, fellas.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
You don't let up for one second.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
These people step outta line,

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
you gotta remind 'em
where they stand.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
Like our boy here.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center

Yes, sir!

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT A]
Oh, this is wrong.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT D]
How can they be so cruel?

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
Once I win the tournament,
we won't have to deal with this.

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
Give it a rest already, Chief.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
You think any of us wanna
hear that right now?

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
Especially since Hikawa's only
on our backs 'cause of you.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
Why don't we just have Joe enter
the tournament in your place?

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
He came back here
to help us out,

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
and if we give Hikawa what
he wants, he might--

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Joe's nowhere close
to fighting shape right now.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.240 position:50% align:center
Plus, this is our
home they attacked.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
If we can't hold onto it
with our own hands,

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
we'll lose more than
the roofs over our heads.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
We give up here, our kids
get to live with it.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
[MARA]
He's right.

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
But more importantly, right now,
we've got graffiti to clean up.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
Why bother cleaning it up when
we're about to get thrown out?

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
True enough. I'm heading home.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
You know it's not your fault.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
They're just a bit
stressed out, is all.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get it.

Where's Joe?

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.279 position:50% align:center

[JOE groaning]

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] His body forgot
how to handle pain.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
He had the pills for that.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
The junk's still in his system,

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center
and it's going to try and take
a piece with it when it goes.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center

You fought that battle too, huh?

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
Yes.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center

a long struggle ahead of him.

Sorry for all this.

Causing so much trouble
right before the fight.

Nah.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
I would say havin' you in my
corner is more than worth it.

This is an herbal tea they
make back in the old country.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center

From when we first met.

the old country, too.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center

wander the earth for eternity,

them a place to call home.

built a new life here.

this since we got here.

you to worry about it.

That was his son's name.

He was about as
old as Mio is now.

been a sickly kid.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
The boat ride over is a
hard journey for anyone,

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
and it turned out to be
more then he could take.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
After his son died, Chief
stepped into the ring each night

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
to get beaten and battered

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
as he stumbled through a
haze of booze and pills.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50% align:center
Maybe he thought of that
as his way to atone.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I had a home before.
A whole life that I destroyed.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Back when I lost my son,
I thought the same of myself.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
[MARA] But eventually, the Gear
gave out under all the abuse.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
And for the first time
since Carlo passed away,

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center
Chief just broke down and cried.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
[MARA] That Gear was something
his boy had made for him.

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
He'd tuned it for defense

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:33.086 position:50% align:center
'cause he wanted to
keep his papa safe.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
When it fell apart,
Chief realized

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
he had been throwing away
the life Carlo wanted for him.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
That was what he told
me through the tears.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
And on that day,
he became a different man.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
[MARA] He let himself
feel his real pain.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
He's not fighting to dull
the hurting anymore.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
Now he's fighting for his home.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
His real pain.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
[MARA]
Sí.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
And that's the reason Chief
is gonna win this whole thing.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
I believe it in my
heart of hearts.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] You let me know if
you need anything, okay?

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT J]
Gracias.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A gasps]

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
And that's for you.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, Chief!

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT D] We got trouble!
They messed up the water pump!

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT I]
Why would they go this far?

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
They must've come around while
everyone was out for the day.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.805 position:50% align:center
What're you gonna
do about it, Chief?

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT B] We told you
this was going to happen

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
if you mouthed off!

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT I] How can they do
this? Our kids live here.

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT D] Answer me!
Where do you think you're going?

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.940 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
I'm grabbing my tools.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:24.322 position:50% align:center
[JOE retching, coughing]

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
What is it now?

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
Think you get to redeem
yourself like he did?

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
Who do you think you are, kid?

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
You're delusional.
You know what you did.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.550 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
I killed you.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
That's right.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
You know you shoulda
been the one to die.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:54.227 position:50% align:center
I know. If I could've
died in your place...

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
What?

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
If you'd died, you'd never've
had to walk away from the kids.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
Is that what you wanna say?

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
Don't lie to yourself.
You think this is penance?

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50% align:center
You think anyone's gonna
forgive you now?

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
Huh?

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
Hey, Chief, it's break time.

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT D] We live here,
too. It's only right.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT D]
I'll do it.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
The hell you will.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
We won't have running
water till the new year.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center

Ah, <i>callate</i> and watch me work.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:37.854 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT I]
I can handle this.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
[IMMIGRANT A]
Take a break, Chief.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
[NANBU] There's no use
dwelling on what's behind ya,

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
'cause there's no
goin' back to it.

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:48.656 position:50% align:center
It's over, Joe. Move on.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
This can't really be
how it ends, can it?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
[NANBU] You know how to
stop the pain. Take 'em.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Back then, Sachio asked me

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
if this was really the
way it was gonna end.

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
I didn't have an answer for him.
That's why I went to see you.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Please, Pops.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
Will you fight with
me one more time?

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center

The nerve of ya.

Can't even let an old man die
in peace, huh? To hell with it.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
I already knew my luck ran
out the moment I met you.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
You remember? The light I lost?

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
That tiny little flame

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
that I thought had
burned out years ago.

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
I think I was wrong.
I think I found it.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
But I gotta know... if it's
real, or another delusion.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's working!

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
I'm begging you.

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
One more time.
Will you fight with me, Pops?

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Chief, you still
remember our fight?

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
Of course.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
You halfway rolled off my punch,

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
but you sold it like
I'd landed flush.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
Think he would go for it?

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Your punches need to land

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
in this ten-centimeter
sweet spot.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
You'll be out of range
if you're too far back.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
Too close, you lose power.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center

gifts is your eye for distance.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
is I'm the best actor ever

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
Tear him up, Goro!
