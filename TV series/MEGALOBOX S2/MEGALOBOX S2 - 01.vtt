He's not bad.

Heh. It's goin' how we figured.

Hey, folks.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:40.273 position:50% align:center
Between us two, who's got
the more unfortunate face?

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
Can't call that one, Chief,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.985 position:50% align:center
but you're a hell
of a lot more fun!

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
Hah. It ain't that tough
a call to make, mi amigo.

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:51.576 position:50% align:center
Never seen a man
look that beat-down.

If you can't see
that for yourself,

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
I suggest you get
your eyes checked.

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:00.126 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Just had mine checked
before the match, in fact.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center

me issues, too.

There's something eatin' ya.

[NANBU] You've done this more
times than you can count.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:20.105 position:50% align:center
This one's no different.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center

I'll still be feelin'
that right next week.

stumblin' 'round like a fawn.

There's no way that
shot landed that clean.

real talent in the real ring.

How are you not embarrassed?

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center

tripping over these,

maybe you'd be standing,
and I'd be on the ground.

Take care of yourself, Nomad.

That all comes down to you.

[NANBU] You were pretty
worked up back there.

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:20.924 position:50% align:center
No goals and no prospects,
but I guess you've still got

00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:24.135 position:50% align:center
a sliver of fighter's
pride to cling to.
