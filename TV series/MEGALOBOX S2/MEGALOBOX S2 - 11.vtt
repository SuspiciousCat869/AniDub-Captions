00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:14.806 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Hey, Joe.
Can I ask you something?

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.057 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Sure.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
When you started boxing
underground as Nomad,

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.646 position:50% align:center
you began fighting
in Gear, as well.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50% align:center
Of course, you didn't want the
crowd knowin' who you were,

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
but was that the only reason?

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
Simply out of curiosity.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.326 position:50% align:center
"Gearless Joe" was far
more than a ring name.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
He belonged to the folks I
left behind, as much as me.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
We're opposites in that way.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
Before my son Carlo passed, he
and I built this Gear together.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
You put on the Gear to separate
you from your past.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:54.220 position:50% align:center
I put it on to connect me
with the family I lost.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:58.475 position:50% align:center
It's a good luck charm that
my boy left behind for me.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] You can't take
back your mistakes,

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
but if you let the
past weigh you down,

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.777 position:50% align:center
you will never find
your way to tomorrow.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
The day is gonna come

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.659 position:50% align:center
when you step back into
the ring where you belong.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.707 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
No embolisms, no aneurysms,

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:27.253 position:50% align:center
no single proximal cause
showing on the scans.

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:30.006 position:50% align:center
But I suspect he's been
suffering recurring headaches

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.341 position:50% align:center
for quite some time.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.802 position:50% align:center
There's evidence of
inflammation and ulceration

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.553 position:50% align:center
throughout his digestive tract.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.098 position:50% align:center
And that's most likely arising
from long term abuse

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
of some cheap pain medication.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.396 position:50% align:center
This all happened
before he came back.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.897 position:50% align:center
He'd told me about that,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.691 position:50% align:center
but he's been off
the pills a while now,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
and said he didn't
get headaches anymore.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.112 position:50% align:center
Even so, his brain has
been absorbing punishment

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.697 position:50% align:center
his whole career.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.989 position:50% align:center
Every boxer develops some

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.866 position:50% align:center
cerebral hemorrhaging
and contusions,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.161 position:50% align:center
and the aftereffects
can last for many years.

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:03.206 position:50% align:center
In some cases,
they can even be fatal.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.766 position:50% align:center
Where's Sachio?
Did he already leave?

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He headed back to the
Drunk Monk to get his things.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.314 position:50% align:center
Color's coming back
into his face.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:31.151 position:50% align:center
And none of the tests
showed any problems.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
I don't care what the tests say,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
passing out out of
nowhere is a problem!

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:40.326 position:50% align:center
Does your head still hurt?
Are you feeling nauseous?

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.039 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling okay.
Sorry I made you guys worry.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
That's what Pops said when we
first checked him in. You reme--

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.918 position:50% align:center
Why are you bringing
that up right now?

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
You realize his fight with
Mac's around the corner!

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
You yourself were
just talking about

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.468 position:50% align:center
how Joe might be punch drunk.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
What, you're the only one
who's allowed to freak out?

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
I don't know everything
you've been through,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.146 position:50% align:center
but hearing about
the pills was a shock.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
Please give us your word
that you won't lie

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
or keep any secrets
from us anymore.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:21.451 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll put everything
on the table from now on.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
Repairs to the gym
are nearly done.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll all
come see the place.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
Perfect!

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
We can throw a big party
to celebrate that

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.962 position:50% align:center
and you getting
out of the hospital!

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI] That's a great excuse
to cook up a feast for everyone!

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
Yeah, it is!

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
You were with the Shirato
Group, weren't you?

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
[MAYA] The brain chip
is causing side effects?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
Until we have more data,
it's just conjecture,

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
but the Shirato Group
has played a major role

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
in the development and
implementation of BES.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
If the system is having an
adverse effect on Mac's health,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
our company bears
some responsibility.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.220 position:50% align:center
I see. But why tell me now?

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
Because you're his family.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
You see more of
him than anybody.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
You'd be the one most likely
to notice any subtle changes.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
Well, nothing is coming to mind.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
He's been taking plenty of time
to relax between fights,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
and I don't think he's been
having trouble sleeping.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL laughs]

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL]
Here!

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
This looks tasty.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL laughing]

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
It's quite fortunate.
Miguel, I mean.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
I was told that a
transplant saved his life.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
That was a blessing.
Finding a donor is never easy.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
[clapping]

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
This foundation's mission
is simple and vital,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
to build medical facilities
in conflict zones

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
when the military withdraws.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
Providing immediate
humanitarian aid

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
to populations
devastated by violence,

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
and jump-starting
the rebuilding process

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
through the creation of--

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO] I believe the
overlap in the timelines

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
for Miguel's transplant
and Mac's enrollment

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
in the BES trial is significant.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
When I broached
the topic with Maya,

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
she was eager to
change the subject.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
Although it's not safe
to assume based on that.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's tough to revisit.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Well, this is something
else, President Shirato.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
Quite unexpected.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
Evening, ladies and gents!

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
You're all good with me
crashing your party, yeah?

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
Get back up here, Yukiko!

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
I wanna congratulate
you personally.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
There we go.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you found the time
for me in your busy schedule.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
To this day, you never
fail to surprise.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center
But of course!

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
One always has to make
time for their partner

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
if they hope to find
the way forward together.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
And our partnership
is truly dear to me,

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.265 position:50% align:center
even if it's strictly business.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
[PARTYGOERS laughing]

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
Hope the match announcement
didn't throw you off.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
We didn't give you
so much as a heads up.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.189 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
You're full of surprises,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
but it's always safe to
guess you have an angle.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
Well, you're hardly
predictable yourself.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
Your spy games certainly
threw me for a loop.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] A toast. To a future
brimming with hope!

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI] Santa, can you please
do something useful?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.304 position:50% align:center
Hey! We're not gonna have
any left for the party!

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Don't take--

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
It's pretty.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
Before I made it back,
I stayed at a place called Casa.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
Once a year, they hold
this festival there.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
They lay down flower petals
to guide the souls

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
of their families home.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
Wow. So those're for Pops?

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Yeah.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
He's gonna love that.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
Watch his ghost stroll
around the corner.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
[SANTA, BONJIRI laughing]

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
[SANTA] "Uh, thank you all
for coming here today

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.706 position:50% align:center
to celebrate the, uh--"

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.209 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but you'll have to
imagine the flop sweat.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
Be nice, he practiced!

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
Went ahead and got your
ride tuned up real nice

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
while you were out.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
Since you were laid up
in the hospital,

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
Boss thought he'd go ahead
and fix your bike.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI]
The thing was fallin' apart.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
I don't know how it could
run in that condition,

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.312 position:50% align:center
but it's been buggin' me
ever since you got back.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
I was never expecting you
to work on my bike again.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
Well, I never expected you
to come back to town

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.361 position:50% align:center
and fix up the old gym.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:09.781 position:50% align:center
That tells me you're still
someone I can believe in.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:10.907 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Thanks for that.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.992 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI]
No problem.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
What's he all mopey about?

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
Hm? Who knows?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
So anyway, Joe.

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
Wanna tell us about your life
as a pill-popping drifter?

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna not
ask him about it!

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.549 position:50% align:center
I'm a freelance journalist!

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
C'mon, Santa.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact, I was
hoping to talk about that.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
After I left here,

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
I went back to boxing
in underground matches.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
My whole life was fighting
and traveling.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
Town to town till time
stopped meaning anything.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
I always said I'd go
home the next day,

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
but it never came.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
So every night I would
take more pills

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
and step into the ring again.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
And just like when I fought Liu,
I told myself I did it for Pops.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
[JOE] That's where I was
when I met this guy.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
So in the end, Chief died.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Yeah.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
But his legacy lives on, in
Casa, and everyone living there.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
And it always will.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
It's thanks to Chief
I got clean.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
Without him, I would never
have seen you all again.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
He kept me alive.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
That's the story. I'm glad
you finally heard it.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
Yuri's here?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Five years ago,

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
Pops was preparing to
live out his final days

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
in peace with his family,
but I didn't let him do it.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
I put the rest of you
through it, too.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
Taking that match
without asking anyone?

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
Of course I'd lose
with no team.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
I may be off the drugs now,

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
but my body's still not
what it used to be.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
There's no telling how
this fight ends up for me.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
All I know for sure is,

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.264 position:50% align:center
the next time I step in
the ring will be the last.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
So I'm not gonna try and make
the call on my own this time.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
I wanna know what you think.
Should I take the fight?

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center
I'm not doing it unless
Team Nowhere's with me.

00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center
You can put me down
as a hard "no."

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
Wait, when they started
talking about this fight,

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.032 position:50% align:center
you were more excited
than any of us.

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
Because I thought
Joe was healthy.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.995 position:50% align:center
I'm just not ready to lose
any more of my family.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
I'm not either.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.875 position:50% align:center
I'll accept Joe's decision.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
I agree with everything
Bonjiri's saying,

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
but Joe came clean with us
like he promised he would.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
It's your call to make,
and whichever way you go,

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
you'll have my support.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
I haven't forgiven you
for agreeing to fight Liu,

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
and I don't think
I'm ever going to.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
But something finally sank in
when we fought the other day.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.528 position:50% align:center
Whether I can
forgive you or not,

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
I've wasted too many years now
staying hung up on what you did.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
I've got my own life
to worry about,

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
and I'm gonna live
it to the fullest.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
You wanna fight Mac?

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
If shit goes sideways,

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.007 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna throw in the towel,
no questions asked.

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:58.134 position:50% align:center
That's my condition.

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
We got training to do.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
Yuri.

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
Liu told me he wanted
me in your corner.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
I could hardly refuse him.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
It's happening, guys!

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center
We're witnessing the
return of Gearless Joe!

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Actually, about that.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Santa.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
For my final match,
I'll just be Joe.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm gonna be
fighting with this.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
It belonged to Chief.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
His son Carlo designed it,
and they built it together.

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
It's a memento for both of us.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
Carlo was always at Chief's
side when he fought.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
He built this Gear
to protect his dad,

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50% align:center
so he would always
make it home safe.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
I want that, too.
To come home to my family.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
So I'm using the Gear.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:26.848 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] You know, I'd been
wanting to fix up the gym, too.

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
For a long time.

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Yeah.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
With all these flowers,

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Pops'll find
his way back to us.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
He will.

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A] The ink is dry,
and the match is on.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.002 position:50% align:center
But on paper,
it's not entirely clear

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
how much of a match this
exhibition will really be.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A] For the moment,
all eyes are on Joe.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.719 position:50% align:center
It seems the legend believes
he's up to the challenge.

00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
But Mac has shown himself
to be near indestructible,

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
knocking out the King
of Kings, Edison Liu.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.395 position:50% align:center
There's no disputing he's
one of the all-time greats.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.492 position:50% align:center
His readings have
already started passing

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
the safe threshold.

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
He's getting there
faster than before.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
Hm.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
Noted.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
Sir, I'm afraid the increase
in Mac's physical abilities

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
may have come at a cost.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.716 position:50% align:center
A human can't sustain this
level of brain activity.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.844 position:50% align:center
At this rate, it'll destroy him.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
It's a new level of integration.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
Nobody ever said pushing
past the limits

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
of human performance was easy.

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:59.607 position:50% align:center
We can't stumble over this now.
Make the usual adjustments.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
But, sir, he--

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] The door to the
future is swinging shut

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
while you stand
there hesitating.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
You understand that, don't you?

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL crying]

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
Did I do this?

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
You did, and you have before.
It's happened so many times now.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
[MAYA gasps]

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
Mac, you can't step
into the ring again.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you.

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
I can't back out. Maya,
I swear, we'll be okay.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
[MAYA]
Read this!

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.083 position:50% align:center
It's predicted every detail.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center
You're having episodes just
like it says in the article!

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center
The article's made up.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
You can't seriously think Sakuma

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
would keep me in the dark
if I were in danger.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL crying]

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm gonna be okay.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
I need you to believe
in me and Sakuma.

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
[MAYA]
But you're not yourself anymore.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
Maya.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:28.863 position:50% align:center
And I'm the one who just let him
turn you into something else!

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center
[MAC] Hold on. What are you
saying, Maya? I'm still--

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
Leave her alone!

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
[MAYA] Back then,
the same day you got hurt,

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
Sakuma showed up
at the hospital.

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
He immediately proposed
that we enroll you

00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
in an experimental treatment
program using BES.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
Miguel's sickness had taken
a turn for the worse,

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
and I had no idea
how long it would be

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
before you woke up.

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
But you made the right decision.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for you and ROSCO,

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
even if I lived, I'd have spent
the rest of my life bedridden.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
You had a chance
of fully recovering.

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
It would be a long road,
but with enough rehab,

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
you might have regained
the ability to walk.

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
I knew there was some
chance that you'd be able

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
to move on your own again,

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
but I let them put that damn
chip in your brain instead.

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
Maya, why would you do that?

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
When Sakuma told me he
had a donor lined up...

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
...I felt like I had no
choice but to sign,

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
or Miguel might never
get his operation.

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.027 position:50% align:center
He didn't fix my body.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
That bastard used
me as a lab rat.

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
[MAYA] I was so scared I would
lose you both, and I just...

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
You are the real deal.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
You stand exactly
where Joe stood then.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
Stick with me and we can
dream together again.

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] I thought this
might be about that.

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
Pure speculation from
some middling academic.

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
We've already asked
for a formal--

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
Everything's happening
like he said it would.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
It's the truth.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
I've known for a while that
something's going on with me.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
I've been lying about
it to my family.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
But I couldn't have guessed
that Maya had been lying to me.

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.123 position:50% align:center
We finally reached
the breaking point.

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
She told me the whole
story before I came here.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
The arrangement you made,

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
offering to save my son's life
in exchange for my body.

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:56.928 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I wasn't expecting her

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
to keep up the act
for nearly this long.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:03.810 position:50% align:center
Marriage is a
partnership, right?

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
What's with all the secrets?
Seems kinda weird.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
Maybe part of me wanted
to think you both understood

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
that you'd gotten
involved in something

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
bigger than yourselves.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
I was hoping we were
after the same goal.

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
Damn. Setting my expectations
too high again.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
Is a life worth nothing to you?

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
From the start, I knew we could
make BES work, and I was right!

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.546 position:50% align:center
You're on top of the
Megaloboxing world--

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
hero to millions!

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:35.550 position:50% align:center
What is that worth?

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
You could never have achieved
all this as the man you were.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
And you know it. Am I wrong?

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
The "hero" is a lie. I'm not
your goddamn corporate mascot!

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
He's not a lie, because
you've made him real!

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
I had never anticipated
anything like Mac Time.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
That miracle happened
because of you!

00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:00.784 position:50% align:center
It's slowly killing me and
you're calling it a miracle?

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:03.286 position:50% align:center
What about Miguel then?

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
He's got a long life
ahead of him

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
thanks to you being
a part of this program.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
You've said it yourself:
He's a miracle child!

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
Maya made her choice
because she believed

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center
in a future brimming with hope.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
And I still believe in BES.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
Once we get this
product to market,

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
it will save millions of lives.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
Because of you, the future's
within our grasp.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] You're not the nobody
looking up at the legend

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
on the big screen anymore.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
Now you're the one
we look up to.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
[MAC]
"Sizzle, sizzle.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
The cracked ground began
to bake as the searing sun

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center
rose into the sky, and as the
exhausted Nomad trudged onward,

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
the little hummingbird
appeared before him again.

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
'Nomad,' it said.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
'I beg you, please listen
to my song just once more.'"

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
Don't stop moving!

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
[MAC] "Try as he might
to shoo the bird away,

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
it refused to leave
the nomad's side."

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
[MAC] "'I will offer
the same bet as before.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
If I can get you to lie,
you have to listen

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
to my song to the end.'

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
'And I will say what
I said before.

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
I've come on this journey in
search of somewhere to die,

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
so why would I have to lie now?'

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.045 position:50% align:center
But he had no doubt
he would win this time.

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center
So in his frustration,

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
the Nomad took the
hummingbird's bet once again.

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
'Why have you come on this
journey to die?' it asked.

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50% align:center
'As you said, I still
have eyes to see you,

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
ears to listen to your song,

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
and a mouth to answer
your questions,

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
but nothing else.

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:54.939 position:50% align:center
These are all I have
left in this world.'"

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:58.401 position:50% align:center
[MAC] "But the hummingbird
quickly answered,

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:02.947 position:50% align:center
'You lied again. You have hands
with which to shoo me away,

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
and of course,
you still have the legs

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
that carry you on your journey.'

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
'True. I have all of these.
You've beaten me again.'

00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:17.420 position:50% align:center
And so, as before,
the Nomad stopped

00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:20.256 position:50% align:center
and listened to the
hummingbird as it sang.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.885 position:50% align:center
But its song this time was even
more beautiful than the first,

00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:28.932 position:50% align:center
and as he listened, a sense of
solace filled his aching heart.

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:31.142 position:50% align:center
Finally, the last note was sung,

00:22:31.226 --> 00:22:33.269 position:50% align:center
and satisfied with
its performance,

00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:37.399 position:50% align:center
the hummingbird flew away
into the desert wind."
