[BONJIRI]
C'mon!

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
Bonjiri?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
It's you, right?

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
I knew it when I saw you.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
I'll give you a push.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate it.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
[SANTA] Hey, we can throw him a
"welcome back to Nowhere" party.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
"The legendary champion Gearless
Joe comes out of hiding

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:53.673 position:50% align:center
five years after his
loss to Edison Liu."

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of headline
that moves papers.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.428 position:50% align:center
If we could score an
exclusive interview,

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.846 position:50% align:center
we'd make some bank.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.265 position:50% align:center
You're not being serious,
are you, Santa?

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
You wanna throw a party for
a guy who abandoned us?

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
I know that's how
you two see it,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
but I honestly don't agree.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:12.442 position:50% align:center
You think that's what
being a reporter means?

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
Skulking around the ring
like some kinda stray dog

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.447 position:50% align:center
hoping the scraps
will fall near you?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
So I'm a stray dog, am I?

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
If you ask me,
it's still a better gig

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
than being Fujimaki's lapdog.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
If you got a problem with that,
get yourself a real match.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
And I'll promise to give
you a nice write-up.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
Can't you give it a rest, guys?

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
Gyoza and a couple beers.

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.050 position:50% align:center
Hey, punks, some service?

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
The owner's out on
a delivery right now.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
A delivery?

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
Here. You can get started
on your beer while you wait.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
That sounds real nice.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
And some company
would be nice, too.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's not that kinda shop!

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
But you're just my kinda girl.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Let her go!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
Heh. Is she yours, kid?

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
She's no one's. Hands off.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
That's enough, Kunimura.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
[KUNIMURA]
Hm?

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
I recognized you as
soon as I walked in.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
You're one of the boxers
from the Drunk Monk, right?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
Say what you're gonna say.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
[HASHIMOTO] I'd rather we kept
any violence inside the ring.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
Hashimoto, are you sayin'
this runt is a Megaloboxer?

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center
Just look at him!

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
He's stuck treading water
on the underground circuit,

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
but they say he insists
on fighting clean.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.109 position:50% align:center
Though even if he was willing,

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
it's hard to fix a match with a
guy who's no threat to anybody.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
[KUNIMURA laughs]

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
Then I guess everybody
wins but you, kid! Heh.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
I'm back. Oh.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
'Bout time!

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
What kinda place is this, makin'
us wait like that? Christ.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
Sorry, uh...

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50% align:center
[KUNIMURA]
Gyoza, tubbs. Two full orders.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
Right away, sir!

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
Also, could you comp us
the beer for the long wait?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure. No problem.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
[KUNIMURA grunts]

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.886 position:50% align:center
[KUNIMURA] Honestly,
you oughta be payin' us

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
for classin' up your
little hole in the wall.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
So, anyway, what's
the game plan tonight?

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
Sachio, don't do it!

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
Do what?

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
It's on me. You can have
one, too, if you like.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
[HASHIMOTO]
You'll pay for that, punk!

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
This is real bad, Sachio.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
It won't be your shop anymore if
you let those scumbags run it.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
You know, you were out
on that delivery

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
a lot longer than I expected.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
Huh? I didn't notice.
I guess time got away from me.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.935 position:50% align:center
Really? That's what happened?

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
I know you think I went down
to the riverbed or somethin'.

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
And you know I'm right.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
I see why it's been
givin' you so much trouble.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
Problem is, it's the wrong bolt.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
Let's take a break.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
You really oughta quit that.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
Even knowin' it's gonna kill us,

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
it's easier to enjoy the taste
and ignore the future.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
Sorry to say, but people
just aren't all that bright.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.330 position:50% align:center
Bright enough to make excuses.

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] But all you wanna do
is run away to the ring!

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Look, Sachio. I just--

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] We're not a team
anymore. It's over!

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
Sachio!

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
Hold on. It's not
really over, is it?

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
I get why he took the match.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:39.209 position:50% align:center
I don't hold it against him.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
But then he just
walked away from us.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
I can't forgive that.

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
[OICHO] If he'd stayed,
maybe Sachio wouldn't be...

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
[CROWD yelling]

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.303 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
Why'd you come back anyway?

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
Oh. Welcome back, sirs.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
[engine roars]

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
Sachio!

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
Joe.

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
The guy Sachio busted open

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
was some small-time
Megaloboxer goin' on tour.

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
He said he was taking the deed
to my shop as his compensation.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Where's Sachio?

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50% align:center
He thinks this is his fault

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
and that he should be
the one to fix it.

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center
I tried to stop him.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
Is this true, kid?

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.936 position:50% align:center
You never brought
in a damn bit of dough,

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
now you're tryin'a
bleed it out of me?

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
How are you gonna fix this?

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
I'll take this fight and hand
my cut over to you guys.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
Heh. These bandages alone
cost more than your cut.

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who hit you!
Give back the deed!

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
You know how to ask
nicely, don't ya?

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
Will you please give it back?

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
You have to give us
something in return.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
If you win tonight's match,

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
we'll hand your friend's
deed over to ya,

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
and that'll be the
last we speak of it.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ushiyama.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.527 position:50% align:center
I got hurt, so tonight you'll be
fightin' this kid instead.

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
Hey, you get to be
in a real match!

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
Have fun with that, kiddo.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
After all those years
of wandering aimlessly,

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.971 position:50% align:center
you're back here,

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
a stray dog digging through the
junkyard where you came up.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
You slipped out of your collar
at last, but in the end,

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
you're never going to be
able to break your chain.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center
You're here to dig up something
you threw away, aren't you?

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
Sorry to tell ya this,

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.993 position:50% align:center
but he's not the kid he was
when you left, Joe.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
That's fine.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
[FUJIMAKI]
Hm?

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
I know that I can't get
back what I've given up.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
But I want to protect
what's here now.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
They're gonna be moppin'
this kid off the ring.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
I won't even have fun
doin' it to him.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it's an easy paycheck.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
And we can take you
out for Chinese after!

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
[USHIYAMA, HASHIMOTO laughing]

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the short notice,
but we're changing this card.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
That looks like--

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Why the hell are you here?

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
It has nothing to do with you!

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
Tell me what's going on!

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center

be even worse?
