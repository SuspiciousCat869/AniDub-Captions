Mom!

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mom, the fight's
about to start!

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A] The air is
sizzling with excitement

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
in the final moments before
this clash of champions begins!

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
Not since the first
Megalonia tournament

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.446 position:50% align:center
has the arena seen
this level of energy!

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
The mood's electric!

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
It looks like the fighters
are entering the ring.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
And the crowd erupts!

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
Hm? Wait, is that?

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A]
As his camp announced,

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.249 position:50% align:center
Joe is using a Gear
for the first time

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
in his professional career.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
Indeed.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
He built his reputation
fighting Gearless.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
We can only guess what the
former champ has in store.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
He's wearing Chief's Gear.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
He really is using it.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.846 position:50% align:center
[RING ANNOUNCER A]
In the west corner,

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
representing Team Nowhere,

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
the inaugural
Megalonia Champion!

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
A living legend returns
to the ring tonight!

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.191 position:50% align:center
The Real Deal: Joe!

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare lose, Joe!

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.747 position:50% align:center
And in the east corner,
standing atop the IMA Rankings,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50% align:center
your world champion,
representing Sons of ROSCO!

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center
The Public Hero: Mac Rosario!

[CROWD cheering]

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:39.182 position:50% align:center
Nobody's stronger
than you are, Daddy!

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
All right. You got this.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.525 position:50% align:center
And we're behind
you all the way.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.068 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A]
This arena, built to host

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.278 position:50% align:center
the Megalonia tournament,
has since been home

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
to some of this sport's
most iconic bouts.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
And tonight, history will
be made here once more!

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.911 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] I've really
been looking forward

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:01.538 position:50% align:center
to this fight, you know.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.290 position:50% align:center
I don't appreciate
the interruption.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:12.590 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] So, am I the one
who's changed? Or is it you?

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.260 position:50% align:center
We've each turned a blind eye

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
to some inconvenient
truths about the other,

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.725 position:50% align:center
and we refused to consider the
consequences that would invite.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.310 position:50% align:center
So now you believe you
made the wrong choice.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:25.854 position:50% align:center
I made several.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
I thought I was a good
judge of character

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
and I clung to that notion
for far too long.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A] In the final
seconds before the opening bell,

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.658 position:50% align:center
the two fighters
meet at center ring.

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
[MAC] It's so strange,
Maya. How calm I feel.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
That hummingbird there
on your shoulder,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:54.090 position:50% align:center
it helps wayward travelers
find their way home.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:58.928 position:50% align:center
This Gear was the heart and soul
of a man who lived his dream.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center
His dream must've led
him across the sea.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
Joe is showing us that he's
right at home in that Gear!

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
His constant, subtle
changes in positioning

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
make for an effective defense.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
He's splitting off a lot of
the impact of Mac's punches.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.184 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A]
A dizzying back-and-forth

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
in the first round as
these titans collide.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B] These are
two excellent out-boxers,

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
very comfortable at this range.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
Although there's
a clear difference.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50% align:center
The champ can turn the toughest
situation around in an instant

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
with the phenomenon
they call "Mac Time."

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Mac is cut! A glancing right
draws first blood for Joe!

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
Viewers may remember when
Mac received a similar cut

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
in his title match with Liu.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA]
Stay cool, Mac!

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
[HAKEEM]
Keep moving!

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
Don't let him get around you!

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIMURA] This is
Mac's undisclosed data,

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.935 position:50% align:center
without the alterations
I made before.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
Working under
Sakuma's direction,

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
she doctored Mac's numbers
to hide BES's malfunctions,

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center
but then, she defied his orders
and sent me these files.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.698 position:50% align:center
BES places a heavy
burden on his brain,

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
causing major side effects.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
And you had been concealing
this information from us.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
[MIKIO]
It's true that she shares

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center
part of the blame for this.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
But now she's found the courage
to come forward with the truth.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
It's so sad that she'd resort

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
to telling you a lie like that

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
just to get out from under
the weight of her sins.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
In fact, there's a chance
she was lying to you

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
without even realizing
it herself.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.691 position:50% align:center
Are you denying your
involvement, then?

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
It's only natural.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
You decided what conclusion
you wanted to reach,

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:47.532 position:50% align:center
and when the data didn't fit,
you recalculated it till it did.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
It's what brilliant minds do

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
when they get so
committed to a theory

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
that they're willing to
ignore contravening truths.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
Brilliant minds such as yours?

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
Pardon?

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO] You were so
committed to launching BES

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
that you'd sooner recalculate
the value of a life

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
than push it back.

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but what?

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI]
Mac's fighting cautious.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
I don't see him tryin'
to close the distance.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
Yeah, then he might be
worried about the counter.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Joe.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:24.277 position:50% align:center
In this round can you try
getting inside on him?

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Think I can do that.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
Try catching him with
a hook when he goes low.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
More blood flow will
interfere with his vision.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
Any nausea?

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
I'm okay.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
All right. But remember,
if it comes back...

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA]
The cut's not a problem,

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
but don't let him make it one.

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
You know he's gonna
be targeting it now.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Got it.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
Get those hands up.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.052 position:50% align:center
Don't let your time
with Joe end early

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
over a little bitty scrape.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO]
Mac and Maya will be arriving

00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
for our meeting very soon.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
What would you like
to do, Ms. Yoshimura?

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'd like to
sit in, if I may.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO]
Please do.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50% align:center
My deepest apologies.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
There are some things
I need to tell you,

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
though you may already know.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I even have the
right to ask this of you now,

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
after we hid the truth
from you before.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
But I can't keep making
my family suffer.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
This is the only way
we can move on.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
We're gonna need your help.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
[MAC]
Ms. Yoshimura.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
Ms. Asamoto already explained
everything to me.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center
I hate to ask, but I'm going
to need your help, too.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
You're the only person who's
watched my performance

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
closely enough to do this.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
Brain activity levels are safe.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
And if it looks like you're
slipping into Mac Time,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
I'll have the fight
stopped immediately.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO]
I've spoken with Mac and Maya.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
They told me all
about how you met,

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center
and the offer you made them.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] Are you gonna tell me
I've committed some terrible sin

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
and now I need to make it right?

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you the opposite.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
The time to make it
right is long past.

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
You need to live with
the consequences.

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
Do I now?

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
And who better than you
to preach at me about that!

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.878 position:50% align:center
The whole project
was a joint venture,

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
so we can both live with it.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A]
It's a back-and-forth battle.

00:09:56.888 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
Both fighters are still
holding their own!

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
Once again, there's blood
dripping down Mac's face!

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B] It looks like
the same cut has reopened.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A]
Has the living legend

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
got the champ in a corner?

[SAKUMA] You're gonna
tell the whole truth?

Easy enough to say,

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
but you understand how
that would end up for you.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO]
Yes. And I've accepted it.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
It is exactly as you said.
We had a partnership.

People can't move forward
without something to hope for.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
We believed BES could
give people that hope,

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
and that's what
brought us together!

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
And now you're ready
to throw that all away

moral qualms?

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center

hope, and you'll destroy it!

belongs to humankind, Sakuma.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:01.304 position:50% align:center
you've no right to
lecture to me on hope.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center

lies with you, not BES.

we must put the results of
our work so far to good use.

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
BES still contains a fatal flaw,

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
but it's granted us some
valuable knowledge.

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
We now share that knowledge
with the world.

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center

Hey, I'll give you
a nice write-up

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
once you climb to the top
of the engineering world.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] Assuming you're
still a reporter by then.

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
You good with this?
Letting Sachio run off again?

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:20.428 position:50% align:center
She's right. What if we
get split up like before?

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
You can find your way back

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
because you'll always
know where home is.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
There will be a place for
you here. Right, guys?

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
[SANTA] Joe you're
takin' off too, right?

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
You're rolling out with Sachio?

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.901 position:50% align:center
Only partway.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
I need to pay Chief's
grave a visit.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.198 position:50% align:center
I'll come right back.

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
Did you really think I
was worried about that?

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS laughing]

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
[horn honking]

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
Have you all been
good boys and girls?

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
It's been too long.

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
Welcome back, you guys.

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
Who said you could
get so big, huh?

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Sorry.

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
This must've been a hassle.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.849 position:50% align:center
When we left, they kept saying

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
they wanted to go
back to our facility.

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
But they saw their home and
that changed in an instant.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
[MARA]
Welcome to Casa.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
It's so good to see you here!

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.335 position:50% align:center
Wait here for a second, okay?

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
I'll try and make
you all some space.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
Mio?

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL]
What is that?

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.519 position:50% align:center
Back in my home country,
we call this <i>braai</i> .

00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:53.563 position:50% align:center
It's how we do barbecue.

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL]
<i>Braai</i> ?

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
[HASEEM] And we enjoy it
around the fire with friends.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.401 position:50% align:center
That's what <i>braai</i> 's about.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL]
<i>Braai</i> !

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA]
Wait, what's a <i>braai</i> ?

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
This electronic signal
from the brain chip

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.585 position:50% align:center
then propagates
through each section.

00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:16.961 position:50% align:center
And the subject's memory code

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:19.881 position:50% align:center
has an important role to
play in this interaction.

00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:24.344 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
Take this.

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.598 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:30.266 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI]
Take care out there, Sachio.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.518 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI]
Come back any time.

00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:34.187 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Bye!

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.189 position:50% align:center
Later, guys!

00:23:03.216 --> 00:23:04.634 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Take good care of her.

00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:06.094 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
I will.

00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:10.765 position:50% align:center
'Kay, Joe. See ya.

00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:12.392 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:26.865 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
Gonna be lonely around here.

00:23:26.948 --> 00:23:28.241 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:34.581 position:50% align:center
It's okay.
