[COMMENTATOR A]
Mac is facing the champ tonight

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
with the help of a custom
Gear that interfaces directly

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50% align:center
with the cutting-edge
ROSCO control chip

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
implanted in his brain.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Liu seems
to have taken

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
the exact opposite approach,

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50% align:center
fighting in his most
stripped-down Gear to date.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
It favors a wide range
of motion over raw power,

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
allowing access to a broader
arsenal of offensive techniques.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
But the reduced mass also
means the champ's guard

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
won't be as strong.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
If Liu can get his
offense going,

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
the choice could
pay off for him.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
But if round one was
anything to go by,

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
his team might've picked
the wrong strategy.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center

find out in round two.

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
you either walk out
a winner or a loser.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
Those are the options.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
It's that simple.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:57.754 position:50% align:center
I thought that's what it meant
to be a fighter. It's our fate.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
Back at Megalonia,

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
I had my Gear removed
for my fight against you

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
because I believed
it was fate's demand.

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
And I lost.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
That was the time to walk
away, but I didn't.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
After that, the dreams
I hadn't fulfilled,

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
I pinned on Liu.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
And this is the way it ended.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Nothing's ended yet.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
Liu and I had a promise.

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
After his fight against Mac,
he would fight me.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
I'm sorry, but I don't think

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
he'll be able to
keep that promise.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
He's not ready to give up
this fight just yet.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
It's too early to throw
in the towel.

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
[YURI] You're holding on
to an illusion of hope,

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
and I think you understand
better than anyone

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.595 position:50% align:center
how badly that can end.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
Five years ago, you were
wanting a last hurrah

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
before you left the sport,
and I could see that.

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:57.063 position:50% align:center
I should've stopped that match.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
It's like watching you in the
early days all over again, Yuri.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
No.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
He's better.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.999 position:50% align:center
He's got more potential
than I ever had.

Edison Liu!

[COMMENTATOR A]
This was the grand prize

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.195 position:50% align:center
that Yuri wasn't able
to reach in his prime,

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
but his star pupil has now
done what he could not!

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
[YURI] You were the one
who brought me back.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
My reason to return
to Megaloboxing.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center

But all of that is over now.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.141 position:50% align:center
[MAC laughs]

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
[MAC] Whoa, easy.
You're really strong, Miguel.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL] Don't call me
Miguel! I'm Mac, okay?

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
[MAC]
Heh. My bad.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL]
Now it's Mac Time!

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
I have to use my
secret technique!

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
Ha! Secret technique!

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL] Daddy, cut it out!
No fair! Tickling!

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm calling the
match early, boys!

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
[MAYA] Come on, Miguel,
Daddy's learned his lesson.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
Now let's sit down and eat.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
Stop, Daddy,
that's mine! Give it!

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
[MAYA] Daddy is just really
hungry and really tired

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
after his big match,
okay, sweetheart?

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL]
Mommy!

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:23.168 position:50% align:center
[MAYA] Sometimes it's like
he's a toddler again.

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
He gets fixated on food or toys,
and it's terrifying for Miguel.

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
Then after a while, he goes
right back to being my husband.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:34.596 position:50% align:center
Suddenly it's like
nothing ever happened,

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
and Mac never remembers
any of it, himself.

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
And now, it feels
like the episodes

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
have been getting worse.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
Uh... Huh...

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
It might be best if I took
him to a hospital, right?

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
Except his most recent physical
and post-match examination

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
came back clean.

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
It may simply be stress.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
He's done miraculous things
in the Megaloboxing ring.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
That has to take a big toll--
physically and mentally.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
He's quite fortunate to have
you in his life, Maya.

ready for the meeting.

a very busy man.

If my hypothesis is correct,

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
there's a fatal issue
in BES's design.

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
Mac is in a very
precarious state right now.

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
Please slow down.
I need you to explain.

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
ROSCO has provided us
with their data,

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
and we've seen no indication
of such an issue.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
[MIKIO] Yes, I'm quite
familiar with that data.

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center
Then how?

00:19:58.073 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
[MIKIO] As a scientist,
I mustn't dismiss

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
even the smallest anomaly
without investigating.

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center

But with all due
respect, brother,

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
you shouldn't be surprised

of me that would be,
