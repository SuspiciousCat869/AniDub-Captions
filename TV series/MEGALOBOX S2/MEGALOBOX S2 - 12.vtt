00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center

a defensive drill.

[YURI] A strong enough defense
can break down an opponent.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
Quite the impressive
piece of work here.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
[OICHO] The heavy leather on
the outside acts like armor,

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
soaking up a lot of the force
of the opponent's punches.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.524 position:50% align:center
It was designed really
well for that.

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
True, it does make
for a strong guard,

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
but there's a tradeoff.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
The arms are ridiculously stiff.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
That tough cowhide's a bit
of a double-edged sword.

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
The other guy's
shots bounce off,

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
but you can barely throw back.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't be a big
problem for Chief

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
since he was built like a bear,

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center
but I'm thinking Joe
would struggle with it.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
Makes sense to me.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
So what'll we do?

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] We'll strip
it down and rebuild it.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
With an expanded range
of motion in the arms.

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
And I think this'll
help with that.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
Deerskin, eh?

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
Tough, but more
flexible than cowhide.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
It can keep up with Joe's
moves while keeping him safe.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
That settles it.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
Looks like the kid got
somethin' out of his time

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
in the ring after all, huh?

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
And there's nobody alive

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
who understands the way Joe
fights better than Sachio.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
[MIKIO] If you realize
you made a mistake

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
and stop to change course,

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
isn't that a step
toward the future?

What's that nonsense?

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
If you expect a better future,

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
you should be willing
to stick around

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
and help make it a reality.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
Is it so wrong
to expect better?

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
To believe that you can
reach a brighter future

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
by keeping a positive
attitude and working hard?

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
Oh, God.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
You weren't thinking about
jumping yourself, were you?

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
No, sir, just
gathering my thoughts

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:24.027 position:50% align:center
so I could prepare a response
to Professor Shirato.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
Right. Yeah, good thinking.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center

that ignorant ass

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
exactly what he's dealing with.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
The march of progress
won't stop.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
Not for his outmoded ethics,
not for anything.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
Question, sir... Do you think
Mac will come back here?

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:48.343 position:50% align:center
Heh. People are driven
by one of two things:

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
Pleasure or fear.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
Mac lost everything once,

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
and now, he has so
much more to lose.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
Think he's brave enough
to risk it again?

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.501 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL]
Daddy's gonna come home.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center

'cause the hummingbird's

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
Now, here. Time to
get you to bed.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50% align:center

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
[gasps] And where's this coming
from all of a sudden?

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
Sakuma's done a lot for me.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
He's the only reason
I can still move.

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
Even got me back
into Megaloboxing.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
But on my own, I'm a
body stuck in a bed.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
I'm powerless to do
anything myself,

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
even take a drink of water.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
He may have done a lot for me,
but you keep me alive.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
Doing all right there, friend?

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
Mind telling me why
you parked here?

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
I'm not in the mood to talk.
Just lemme sleep.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
So is this your car?
License and proof of insurance.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA]
That was an order, sir.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
Out of the car now!
That was an order!

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
[HAKEEM] Easy! Don't be one
of those cops, Tanaka.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
Sir, he's a
noncompliant suspect.

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
What do you suspect him of?

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
Parking his fancy car in
a really sketchy place?

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
Strange move, but there's
nothin' criminal about that.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
Is there?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait, Mac?

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
What? Bro, it's Hakeem!
What the hell?

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
[MAC]
Partner?

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
Hey, thanks, rookie.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA] Um, I'm really
sorry about before, sir.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
I didn't recognize you.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
Nah, kid. You're fine.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
I just got a whole lot
goin' on right now.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50% align:center
Tanaka here is a
fellow Megaloboxer,

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
hopin' to be our next superstar.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
Hey, good on ya.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA]
I saw the title match.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
Sir, you were a beast.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
Who woulda thought, right?

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
Back when you started
showin' up at the gym,

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
I thought it was cool, gettin'
to practice with a former pro.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
I never knew you were
the future champ!

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50% align:center
You know what punk-asses
the kids were around here.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
Mouthin' off to the cops

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
