00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center

You're not gonna stop me, man.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
Didn't plan to.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
But if you run away now,
you're gonna regret it.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
You know this is your fault.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
It happened 'cause
you showed up.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should blame the kid
who ran off with my bike.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.849 position:50% align:center
You wanna know how
it ends, don't you?

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
Man, it's already over.
It's been over.

Hey, Carlo.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
I hope you're being
good for your mother.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd figured out
the way to move forward,

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
but now, I don't know if leaving
the old country with you

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
was the right move,

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
and maybe I'm a fool for still
trying to make my home here.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.384 position:50% align:center
Carlo.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
Your old man kept me alive,
the way you did for him,

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
so thanks.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
I told you to wait in the car.

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
[JOE] This is the time
for me to pick you up.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center

You're feeling weak
in the knees,

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
but we're still in the fight.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
And it's not just
you and me now.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:38.755 position:50% align:center

C'mon, guys, we gotta go.

What is that?

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
You always do it
before your fights.

Something from the old country.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center
That was my way of telling them
I wanna make it back safe.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
and they up and try
to set it on fire.

them out is best for us both.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center

agreed to, after all.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
Assuming they're gone.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
No need to worry yourself.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
You should come out
to the fight tonight

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
and watch my boy Mamiya
destroy that bum.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
[MASUDA] Either way,
I've got nothing to worry about.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
