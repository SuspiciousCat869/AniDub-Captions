[COMMENTATOR A]
Fresh off his historic victory

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:10.969 position:50% align:center
in the match of the century,

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.513 position:50% align:center
newly crowned world
champion Mac Rosario

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.850 position:50% align:center
shocked the Megaloboxing world
once again this morning!

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.768 position:50% align:center
ROSCO representatives
confirm that Mac's team

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
has chosen his opponent for
his first match as champion,

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
calling out none other than the
living legend, Gearless Joe!

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
"Shocked" is right.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.570 position:50% align:center
Especially considering
that Joe's appearance

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
in the front row at
the championship bout

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
was the first the public
has seen him in five years.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A]
The announcement indicates

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
that no official offer
has been made,

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
but the question remains:

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
What does the champion
stand to gain

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.918 position:50% align:center
from a match with Gearless Joe
at this point in his career?

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
If you ask Mac,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
or really, anyone who calls
themselves a Megaloboxing fan,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
Gearless Joe holds a
special place in this sport.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
He's a legend,
and Mac's greatest wish

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
was to stand in the
ring with him one day.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
Making that happen is the
least I could do to repay him.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
And of course, it'd be
a hell of a fight.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
I think we all agree.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR A]
A tough point to argue.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
If this dream match
comes together,

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
it would represent
two eras colliding.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
The reigning champ and
a legend from the past.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.828 position:50% align:center
[SANTA] You hearin' this, Joe?
You're gonna do it, right?

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:23.041 position:50% align:center
Lemme know when the offer comes
in. I gotta get an interview!

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
I think some wires got crossed.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
What? This is
straight from ROSCO.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.466 position:50% align:center
You think they're gonna fire up
a whole PR campaign by accident?

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.220 position:50% align:center
Whether it happens or not
is all up to you. So...

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:38.098 position:50% align:center
You know fixing this place up
won't bring back Team Nowhere.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
Only you getting back
in the ring will do that.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:47.315 position:50% align:center
Well, you could be right.
It is out of nowhere.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.025 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Sorry.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
Don't be. It's your decision.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.363 position:50% align:center
But hey, if you
change your mind,

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
I wanna be the first
to hear about it,

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.701 position:50% align:center
so give me a call, all right?

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
We owe Sakuma
quite a bit of gratitude.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.991 position:50% align:center
He can think on his feet,
and certainly has a talent

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center
for directing the
public's attention.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
He may have been the only
thing preventing this thesis

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
from doing more
damage than it did.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
But the thesis raises issues

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
that demand a thorough
investigation.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it's a hit piece--

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
nothing but malicious
rumors and conjecture.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
ROSCO allowed us access
to their field data

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.553 position:50% align:center
and we've found no
issues with it, correct?

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
True.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
They've complied
with our requests,

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
but they left it up
to us to discover

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
their military
ambitions for BES.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
And in light of this,

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
I suggest we reconsider the
Shirato Group's involvement.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
Care to elaborate?

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE D]
What?

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:39.612 position:50% align:center
Ms. Asamoto and I are of
the same mind on this.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
Through our work on BES,

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Shirato was attempting
to shift into medicine.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center
Returning to arms development
undermines that goal.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
Do you mean to suggest
the Shirato Group

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
should withdraw from our deal?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO]
I do.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
That's absurd.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE A]
Without ROSCO,

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
the company's valuation
is cut in half overnight.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVES murmuring]

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
There would be short-term
consequences to endure. But we--

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE A]
Madam President.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
You made the decision
to terminate

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
the development of Gears
for military use,

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
and losing those contracts
threw the Shirato Group

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
into a tailspin.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
And we were only able to
endure the consequences

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
of that decision
thanks to ROSCO.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
Surely you don't need
to be reminded of this.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO]
We got the response we expected.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
[ASAMOTO]
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
Though the fact that Sakuma
is using Joe for this campaign

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
might indicate that the
publication of the thesis

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
has him at least a bit shaken.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
Even if our information is good,

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
we're not able to
make anything of it.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
We need hard data supporting
Mikio's conclusions

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
to force the issue.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
It's so tough to
breathe in this room.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
Madam President.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
Shall we get a bite to eat?

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
Fresh air would
be good right now.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
It might help the ideas
flow more easily.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO]
Perhaps so.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
[MIKIO] Your reports
are due by the weekend.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
You will receive no credit
for work turned in late.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIMURA] I was hoping
to discuss the publication

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50% align:center
of your recent work regarding
BES, Professor Shirato.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
Specifically, your speculative
fiction about our product,

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
being presented to
the world as science.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
We request that you
immediately and publicly

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
retract your claims.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
And if I refuse?

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:43.069 position:50% align:center
Then we'll be forced
to take legal action

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
That doesn't sound like fun.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIMURA] ROSCO has
provided this institution

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
with generous financial support,

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.578 position:50% align:center
along with valuable
internships for students,

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
and it would be extremely
regrettable to lose

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
such a fruitful relationship
over an issue so trivial.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
Has it really been five years?

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
Yes. I recall it was in your
Gear engineering outline.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
"Every machine
will break someday.

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
Part of a developer's work
is to account for what happens

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
after it breaks."

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
And if every machine
will break, so will BES.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIMURA] I'm honestly
shocked you remembered

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.528 position:50% align:center
who I was, professor.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
[MIKIO]
It's only natural.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
That was the first lecture
I gave at this school.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIMURA]
I was young.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
I didn't understand
the real world.

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIMURA] You can't build
a better tomorrow

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
with your mind on yesterday.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
We must face toward the future
we want and walk onward,

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
daring ourselves to
take a step farther.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
Even realizing that
it could be our last?

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
But it won't. I believe the best
is yet to come for us all.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
I sincerely hope you'll keep
this conversation in mind.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
Now please excuse me.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
If you realize you
made a mistake

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
and stop to change course,

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.281 position:50% align:center
isn't that a step
toward the future?

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
[MAYA]
Sorry to impose.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
I was worried. Thought
I'd come pay Liu a visit.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
Glad he let us in.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
It was a clean fight,
and you won.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
No need to feel guilty about it.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.985 position:50% align:center
I understand that in my head.
The problem is in here.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
This is my wife, Maya.
He's my little boy, Miguel.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
He's a bit of a miracle himself.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
He was born with
a serious disease,

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
but he fought through it
like a real warrior.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
[MAC] Getting to see him
smile was the reason

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center
I stepped back into the ring.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.508 position:50% align:center
Why'd you pick me?

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
Because in my eyes,
you'll always be the champion.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
Now I'm living my dream.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
A dream I couldn't have had
if you weren't there

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
to show it to me.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.946 position:50% align:center
[MAC] I hope to hear a
favorable answer soon.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
[LIU]
Turns out he's just like me.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
He's chasing the
same dream I am,

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
tryin' to prove he's earned
his place in the ring

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:43.458 position:50% align:center
by facing off with Gearless Joe.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.586 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Not sure if I'll accept.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
You damn well better.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna duck Mac
then turn around and fight me.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
It'd be a slap in the face.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
The fight--I knew Mac Time was
coming, but I couldn't stop it.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
[LIU]
Be careful in there, Joe.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
Mac is a different breed.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
Guess tomorrow's the big day.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Yeah.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
So what's the matter?
You're lookin' beat down, Joe.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
Everything is fine.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
[NANBU grunts]

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
The kids may not get it,
but they'll understand one day.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:56.114 position:50% align:center
Never forget, Joe. Your time
on this earth is yours alone.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
No one can take it away.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
That's how it'll be
till the end of it all.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
Keep fightin' and don't
stop until it's over.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
I've always got
your back. Always.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
I don't have any other choice.
I made him a promise.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
I'm not done yet!

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
No. It can't end like this!
Please. Not like this!

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
Tell the truth.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
It was never about
the prize money for you.

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
You weren't tryin' to pay
for Coach's treatment.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong?

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I was trying to show them
all it didn't have to be over.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
That I'd keep the light
of hope burning for them

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
when Pops was gone.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
I wanted to believe it.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
And how'd that work out for ya?

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
It's your fault
everything fell apart!

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] Nowhere Gym died the
day you walked out that door!

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
After Pops died,

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
I thought the best thing
to do was disappear.

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
The kids would have an
easier time moving on

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.481 position:50% align:center
without me around.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
I really screwed up.

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
I should've stayed. I shouldn't
have left here for anything.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
And if you think you can
reignite the light of hope now

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
by jumping into the
ring against Mac,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
that's just an empty dream.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
You wanna repeat your screw-up
from five years ago?

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
There was this guy I met...

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50% align:center
And don't forget,
you'll always be our champion.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
You're the one who got me
chasin' this dream, Joe,

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
and I'm going to keep dreamin'
it for as long as I can.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
[JOE] He's the only reason I was
able to make it home alive.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
And something about Mac...
felt just like him.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
There's one more thing--

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.576 position:50% align:center
the last loose end
I need to tie up.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
I won't repeat my mistake.
I know what matters.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
Joe!

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
It's here! For real!

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
What's here?

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
It's an official contract.
ROSCO sent the offer.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm the
acting representative

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
for Team Nowhere as of today,

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
because the ROSCO team
reached out to me

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
and asked if you would
have any interest

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
in taking on Mac
in an exhibition.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
Fight night would be
two months from now.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Don't do this.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
You've seen Mac fight.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
You know what he
would do to you.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center
Are you hoping to avenge Liu?

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
You're trying to play the hero,

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
but it's nothing
more than vanity.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
Easy, Yuri.

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
You got me wrong.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hm?

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
I don't fight for
anybody but me.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
I never have and I never will.

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
Then do as you please.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI] Joe got offered
a fight with the champ.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
There's no way he doesn't
take it, right?

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
Well, he hasn't signed anything
yet, but we all know he will.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
Hey, you think there's anything

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
the rest of us can do
to help him out?

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
Like the good old days?

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
[OICHO] Does Sachio know
anything about this?

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
[LIU]
He's gonna do it.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
Joe is fighting Mac.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
So please, Yuri,
go be in his corner.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine here.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
Since I beat him before,
he's been going through hell,

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
and he's been
doing it all alone.

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
The only person who can save
him from that curse is you.

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.918 position:50% align:center
Joe is not my concern.

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
I came back to Megaloboxing
for your sake.

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
You are all that matters.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.509 position:50% align:center
[LIU] So you'll always
feel responsible for me

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
being in this bed, is that it?

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
Get that out of your head.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
It's nobody's fault.
This is the path I took.

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
I think you might have
forgotten something.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
You didn't choose me, Yuri.
I was the one who chose you.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
[LIU]
I wanna reach a new level.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
Past you. Past Joe.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
So help me find the way.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
Show me the path to
true Megaloboxing.

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
You say it's more than a brawl?

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.340 position:50% align:center
Then enlighten me, tough guy.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:09.469 position:50% align:center
You show me what true
Megaloboxing's about.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
Please help him.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
He's in a hard fight,
and he needs you at his side.

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
So how long have you
been doing this again?

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Six months.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can
manage to win a few?

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
Put me in the ring
and I'll show you!

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to take on
whoever you throw at me!

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
[FUJIMAKI] Yeah? And why
are you so eager to fight?

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
What is this bullshit?

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.848 position:50% align:center
You know damn well I'm
doing it for the money!

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
So how much?

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
I'll have it delivered in cash.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.480 position:50% align:center
In return, you can keep
working my ring,

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
taking fixed fights till
the day you drop dead.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
If that's really how
you wanna do this,

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
say the word and it'll be done.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.543 position:50% align:center
What the hell do you want?!

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
Sachio, wait. Let's talk.

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Screw you.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
I wanna fight Mac.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
[JOE] And when I do,
I want you there with me.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
And you think I care?
You're not my problem anymore.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
[ARAGAKI] Sachio, you asked me
to teach you Megaloboxing,

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
and I did.

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:53.031 position:50% align:center
I never asked you why.

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
I didn't need to know.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
If it could help you cope,

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
I figured that was
all that mattered.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
But you have to
understand something.

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
You can't follow Joe's
path. You're not him.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.921 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to find
a way for yourself.

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
I've already found my way.
This is what I chose.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
[FUJIMAKI]
Then get your Gear on.

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
You'll settle it in the ring.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
And while you're at it,

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
you can settle the rest
of your differences.

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Our home.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
If you win, I leave
it all to you.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
You won't hear from me again.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
And if I win,
you leave the ring.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
Fine, I accept.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO grunting]

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:47.395 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Sachio. Let's stop this.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Piss off with that.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
I'm not ready to let
you off the hook.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
You hear me, you goddamn
selfish bastard?!

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:03.870 position:50% align:center
That is what I am.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
The one who made
everything fall apart.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I'm the one who accepted
that fight with Liu.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I'm the one who abandoned
everyone who mattered to me.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
So stop blaming yourself!

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Damn it to hell.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
This is for his dream.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
That's why we put it
all on the line.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
It's how we all became a family.

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
He's just like you.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
All he really wants is
to protect his family.

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] You're not part
of this family anymore.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
