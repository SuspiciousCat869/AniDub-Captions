[MAN A]
Look, everyone knows

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.977 position:50% align:center
Liu's had a stronger
career on paper,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center

can keep up with Liu?

The champ's on another level,

[REPORTER A] After his win over
Gearless Joe five years ago,

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.005 position:50% align:center
Liu went on to conquer the
second Megalonia Tournament.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
They call him "King of Kings,"
and it's hard to argue.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
[JIMMY]
He wouldn't agree.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.888 position:50% align:center
He'd say he's still falling
short of Yuri's legacy.

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
We could chalk that
up to modesty.

No losses in his pro career.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
He walked straight
through Yuri's record

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center
for title defenses.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center

to think who it would be.

[SANTA]
So, in other words,

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:14.824 position:50% align:center
Liu's entire focus has been
on surpassing his mentor,

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
and Mac is barely on his radar.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.413 position:50% align:center

How do you two plan to overcome
the "Mac Time" phenomenon?

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:34.928 position:50% align:center

watch the match and see.

[YURI]
There's no need.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
You already have
a sparring partner.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
[LIU] Please. I wanna
fight Joe one more time.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
[YURI] You've beaten him.
That's what matters.

[LIU]
Please wait!

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
The man I fought wasn't the same
as who you faced at Megalonia.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
That's the plain truth,

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
and you know it better
than anyone else.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
What I've heard is he's been
fighting underground ever since.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
Now he's here.
This is my chance.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:55.276 position:50% align:center
I can live with being
disappointed.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.279 position:50% align:center
Just one sparring session
is all that I want!

00:03:58.363 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
Easy, Liu.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.700 position:50% align:center
You're speaking to a man
who came out of retirement

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
and returned to the
world of Megaloboxing

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
for the chance to help
you grow as a fighter.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.581 position:50% align:center
Try not to lose
sight of that fact.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
[YURI] In all the years
I've been coaching him,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
this is the first time he's
asked me for anything.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
The thing that got him
so deep into this sport,

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
what hooked him, was that
match between you and Joe.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
He's not gonna slow
down and wait for it,

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
but the fight Liu really wants
is the one he saw back then.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
The Joe Liu fought was
not the man who beat me.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
He's right, I can't deny it.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50% align:center
But every fight has its
circumstances, and in the end,

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
one man wins,
and the other loses.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
Liu's forgotten how easily he
could have lost that match.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
It's arrogance.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
He's getting hung up
on his foolish pride.

what's goin' on?

The further you go down
the path to glory,

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
the more you worry
someone's gonna show up

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
and knock you off course.

Trying to keep up the longest
title defense streak

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
in the history of the sport,
the pressure must be huge.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
You're saying it's about
his anxiety towards Mac?

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
Way back, you and I talked
about your match at Megalonia.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
You took off your Gear to
fight Joe on even terms,

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
and it's hard to argue that
didn't affect the outcome,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
but you said you had no regrets.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
None.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
Liu is looking for that
same satisfaction,

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
and he thinks the way to get it
is by going all-out with Joe--

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
the same way he saw
you do at Megalonia.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
Or at least, it sounded
to me like that's

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
what he was trying
to say just now.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
Hey there, champ.
Long time no see.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
So you gave up fighting
to become a carpenter?

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
That can't be right.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
No way. You're trying
to rebuild this place?

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center

reason you agreed

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
to take that match with me?

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
Tch. So you want another shot?

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:47.532 position:50% align:center
Does Yuri know you're here?

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
It's got nothing to do with him.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
Meaning this is strictly
between you and me.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
I'm here for what you owe me.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center

enough about our match

to get in fighting shape for it.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
Our rankings weren't
on the line,

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center

living in your shadow.

the same thing

I'm not delusional;
I know I can't turn back time.

from your carpentry job.

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
Recovering from
memory disorders.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
Every time we figure
something out in the lab,

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50% align:center
the first question
we ask ourselves is,

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
"What can we heal with this?"

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
So when we heard Mac's story,

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
ROSCO turned the
knowledge we'd gathered

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
at the bleeding edge of science
into a way to heal him.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
The Brain Encoding System.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center line:10%
Though to her friends,
it's "BES."

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
We implanted a tiny control
chip in Mac's brain,

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
which carries nervous
impulses to a network

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
of Assisting Gears through
an artificial nerve tract,

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
granting full
freedom of movement.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
Of course, we had some help
with the BES project.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
Namely, from the Shirato Group's
CEO, Ms. Yukiko Shirato.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.055 position:50% align:center
[TV NARRATOR A] Ms. Shirato
was an early supporter

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
of Sakuma's efforts,

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
contributing to the creation
of the Assisting Gears

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
while the brain chip was
still being designed,

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
and offering the use of the
Shirato Group's own technology.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
And Mac was having
big ideas, too.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center line:10%
It was a miracle just
getting my body back again.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center line:10%
That alone was more
than I could ask for.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
But then I started getting
used to moving it again

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
and I guess I got greedy.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
And then suddenly,
Sakuma came up and asked me,

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
"Have you thought about taking
another shot at Megaloboxing?"

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:15.342 position:50% align:center
[TV NARRATOR A] Returning to the
ring under ROSCO's sponsorship,

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
Mac was a fighter reborn.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
Once an untamed beast,
now calm and disciplined.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:25.643 position:50% align:center
He tore through the ranks.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
And though there are moments

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
when he finds himself
on the back foot,

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
he always pulls through.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
A phenomenon that
fans call "Mac Time."

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center line:10%
When things started goin' south,

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center line:10%
I used to just start
swinging like a madman.

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center line:10%
I got scared of losing
and my brain shut down.

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center line:10%
That isn't a problem
for me anymore.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.456 position:50% align:center
Now when I get rocked,
my mind slips into the zone.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
I do what comes
naturally, and soon,

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
the other guy's on the canvas.

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
I was worried about my family,
and not having time for them.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
But then, I thought of my son

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
never knowing about
my life as a fighter.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
I had no grand ambition.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
I wasn't thinking
about a championship.

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was to
give him the chance

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
to see his father
stand in that ring.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
[DIRECTOR A] I see. How did
you feel about this, Maya?

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
Did it make you nervous?

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
I wasn't nervous,

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
but for all he's given
and all he's been through,

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center
I wanted to respect his wishes.

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
[DIRECTOR A] And soon,
he'll be fighting for the title.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
[MAC]
I couldn't be more grateful.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
For my beautiful wife,
and my friend, Sakuma.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
And that's why... I owe
it to them to win this.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
I have to.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
The only way I can repay them
is to bring home the belt.

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
He doesn't need to repay me.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
I told him that.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
I don't think he
understands how much

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
he's helped me grow as a person.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
"People who reach
their potential glow."

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
You said that, remember?

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
I'll take your word for it.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO] Of course, they spill
blood, sweat, and tears

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
in the dark to get there.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
In Yuri's Megaloboxing days,

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center
did you ever go sit in
on his training sessions?

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
I didn't.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
He always preferred to be
alone when he trained.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.849 position:50% align:center
So, who are you rooting
for in the title fight?

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:31.561 position:50% align:center
Hard to choose with Liu
being Yuri's star pupil.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the match is barely a
concern for you at this point.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
Not financially.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
Our company has divested
from the Megaloboxing world,

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
but we're still strong believers
in the potential of Gears.

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
Especially in the medical field.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
That's my concern.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
I want to show BES's true
potential to the world.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
For that reason,
I have to root for Mac.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
Mhm.

00:13:56.753 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
All people need hope,
or they can't move forward.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
And Mac is a beacon of hope.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
There are so many people

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
still struggling in the dark,
and BES could be their light.

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
Together, we can give
them all hope, Yukiko.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:21.986 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO]
Yes.

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center
[LIU grunting]

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to have you here,
Mr. Joe. Bring it in!

00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
It's an honor to be here.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
[JOE chuckles]

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
Good to see you too, old timer.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
[JIMMY chuckles]

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
[YURI] You'll find what
you need in the back.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
You don't look like
you've aged a day.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.988 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuri.

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:17.459 position:50% align:center
You feeling good and
warmed up in there, Joe?

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm just
waiting for the bell.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
It looks like ol' Joe is
hunting for the counter.

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
Liu. Don't hold back on him!

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50% align:center
You're making too much noise!

00:15:56.998 --> 00:16:00.919 position:50% align:center
Come on. This is exactly
why I didn't want you here.

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
But--

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
I get it.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
You don't wanna
see Joe get hurt.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI] They just barely got
started sparring though!

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
Life can be like that.
It gets ugly.

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
That's enough, Jimmy. Call it.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center
This won't help him.

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.612 position:50% align:center
[JIMMY]
Wait, Yuri.

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
Do you not see the
look in Joe's eyes?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hm?

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:36.746 position:50% align:center
[LIU]
All you are...

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
...is an illusion I
made inside my head.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
Now you can see it.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
Those aren't the eyes of a man

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.561 position:50% align:center
whose fighting spirit
has burned out.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
[thudding]

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
This was the fight you wanted.
Now don't pass it up.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
--[thud]

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
[SANTA groans]

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
Hey, we were just leaving.
Thanks for the show, guys!

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
This way!

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50% align:center
What were they doing out here?

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
Sorry about them.
Just some old friends of mine.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center
If not for him, I wouldn't have
gotten to fight you like this.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
They got away clean.

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
[JIMMY] Seems like Liu's
gotten over his funk.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Yeah.

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center
No matter what happens
in my fight with Mac,

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
you're gonna be next.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
Hah. That's generous.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
Do you think I'm joking?

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
I would be honored, but I
have things to take care of.

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
Meet me in the ring once
your business is dealt with.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
I'll be ready.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
"From the first bell,

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
the champ seemed to
dominate the older fighter.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
Until Joe landed a
counter as immaculate

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center
as any he's ever thrown.

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
Could this be a sign that Joe
is coming out of retirement?"

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
Don't you feel bad about
writing this bullshit?

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
[SANTA chuckles]

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
So I embellished a little,
but I never lied, did I?

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
It was awesome.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
Man, once he got
into the groove,

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
it was like watching the
Joe we knew from before.

[OICHO]
Enough of your crap!

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
You said you were
gonna show the world

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
how much of a useless
deadbeat he was,

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
so what the hell?!

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm not taking sides.
I go where the story takes me.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
"Today's friend is
tomorrow's foe," ya know?

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
That's a cute line.

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
It sounds a lot better than,

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
"I'd stab you all in the back
if the price was right."

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
[SANTA]
You chased Joe off for free

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
and kept it to yourself
for years. Oh!

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
Here's one! "There's no enemy
more dangerous than"-- Ah!

--[BONJIRI] Are you kidding?

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
--Hey, hey! Hang on, Sachio!
--Jeez! Santa?

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
What? It's not like
I punched him.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL humming]

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
Huh? Daddy? Why are you smiling?

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI] Man, guess Sachio and
Oicho didn't show up after all.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
[SANTA] You got free ringside
seats at the world championship

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
and they wanna sit up
on their high horses.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
Heh. You know, you two don't
owe it to me to be here either.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
Nobody is twisting my arm.

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
[JOE chuckles]

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
Hm?

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I didn't come out here
for sentimental reasons.

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
I'm try'na to make money off you

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
and I don't give
a damn if you know.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
Ha. Sure.

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
Madam President.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:14.941 position:50% align:center
It's you, brother.

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
It's been some time, Yukiko.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
It feels like a dream.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
I'm actually here.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] It is, in a way,
and you're sharing it with us.

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
Not just with me now,
but with all humanity.

in and out of the ring,

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.337 position:50% align:center
he's here fighting
for the title!

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.214 position:50% align:center
Can the champion prevail,

00:22:19.297 --> 00:22:23.426 position:50% align:center
or will "Mac Time"
claim another victim?

00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:32.977 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Hey, Joe.
He's staring over here.
