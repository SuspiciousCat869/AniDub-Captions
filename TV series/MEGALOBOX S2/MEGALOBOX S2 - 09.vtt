[SANTA]
Easy. Easy!

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI]
I am going easy!

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.733 position:50% align:center
Thanks, you guys. I know that
today was your day off.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
Okay. My body is
saying it's done.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center
You can go if you want to,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
but have your back rent
ready when I get home.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
All right, I get it. "If a man
is unwilling to work"...

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
..."neither shall he eat!"

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
Oicho couldn't make it out here.
She told me she was busy.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
Hey, Joe.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Yeah?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
It would be great to get
an interview with Liu.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
Any way you could
make that happen?

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
He's turned everyone else down,

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
and for a freelancer like me,
it would be a huge score.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
Come on, man.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
I understand that you're just
trying to do your job, but no.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
[SANTA] Ah, I get it. Looking
out for a fellow boxer, right?

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:10.570 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I'm not a boxer anymore.
I left all that behind.

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:11.863 position:50% align:center
You coulda fooled me,

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
the way you went at it
in that sparring session.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.784 position:50% align:center
"Like the Joe we knew before."

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.453 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that was
the way you put it, right?

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:21.498 position:50% align:center
Well, I never said he should
come out of retirement.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.708 position:50% align:center
I mean, just because
it'd make me happy,

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.628 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean I'd actually
ask him to do it.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI] I'm certainly not
complaining about the work,

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center
but it'd be nice if it weren't
always feast or famine.

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
Yeah, things were
pretty dead last month.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:25.246 position:50% align:center
Now it's time to dive
into the busy season.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI]
Thank you.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
Um, for what?

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
My work's not
anything that unique,

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
but I figured this shop
would die with me,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
seein' as I'd never passed
on the craft to anybody,

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
and I'd come to terms with that.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
But then, you came along
and offered to help me out.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
Well, I always did
like tinkering.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.229 position:50% align:center
Sachio and I would mess
with machines for fun

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
back when we were little.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
[ABUHACHI] It feels good
knowin' there's someone

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
to carry on my legacy,
and you can pass it on, too.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
Not that I'll be around long
enough to see that part.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
I'm gettin' up there in years.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
[OICHO] We don't need
to look that far ahead yet.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
I've still got a lot to learn

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
before I can fill
your shoes, boss.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
Don't be trying
to check out early.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
[RADIO ANNOUNCER A] And now,
an update on the typhoon.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
As it gradually
approaches the coast,

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
the storm continues to grow
in size and intensity.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
Those residing in areas falling
under the storm warning

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
should be prepared for strong
winds and heavy rain

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
from late tonight
on into the morning.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
[ASAMOTO]
As expected,

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
ROSCO is planning to sell
BES to the military.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
I apologize for
the short notice.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center
These things happen when
you're chasing your dream.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
There's always someone
waiting in the wings

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
for a chance to trip you up.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
Then I take it you know
why we're here.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
A data set on BES's performance

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
collected under
battlefield conditions

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
could get us to market
exponentially faster.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO] The Shirato Group
didn't offer ROSCO

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
its technology for the purpose
of weapons development.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
It's important that
you recognize that.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] I do, and for
what it's worth, Yukiko,

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
I understand your concern.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
But war is a sad reality
of the human condition,

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
and it doesn't seem like that
will change anytime soon.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
If my company can at least
help keep the peace--

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
"Help keep the peace" by
implanting your control chips

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
into the brains of
injured soldiers,

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
allowing them to fight
through their mental

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
and physical wounds.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
That was your proposal to
the military as I heard it.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say that.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
No need to make it
sound so sinister.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
The appeal is obvious.

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
They can recycle hurt soldiers
instead of training new ones

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
at a reduced price.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
Odd that you would
say "recycle."

00:05:57.232 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50% align:center
We're discussing
people, not tools.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
That isn't like you, Yukiko.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
Many of the soldiers who are
forced to leave the services

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
due to injuries sustained
in combat want nothing more

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
than a chance to
return to the field

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
and defend their country again.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
My sincere desire is to
help grant them their wish.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong to want that?

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
And if these soldiers
should be killed in battle,

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
you can claim it was by choice.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] I never said
that, but right now,

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
going back to the battlefield
isn't a choice for them at all.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
Mac lit the torch of hope
for lots of people,

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
and I'm not ready
to see it go out.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
I hear your concerns,
and I understand they're valid,

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:39.691 position:50% align:center
but I still urge you
to consider the option.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
And would you be
willing to share

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
all of your undisclosed
data on Mac?

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
So you suspect Mac Time
is a side effect

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
of the chip malfunctioning.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
Your brother, Mikio,

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
it would seem he's
rather skeptical

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
regarding the BES project.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
My brother's not involved.
This demands an investigation.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
Now hold on! You're not
gonna cut off our funds!

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.673 position:50% align:center
I'm not.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
We simply can't afford to
be sloppy on this project,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
and we must always keep
Mac's safety in mind.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
Jeez. I think I was two seconds
away from a heart attack.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] I'll get you the data
as soon as I reach the office.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
I would appreciate it.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
If you could, try to be
an impartial reporter.

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
Much obliged.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
[ASAMOTO]
Madam President.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
[YUKIKO] Cutting ties with
ROSCO at this point

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
would be a massive financial
blow to the Shirato Group.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
This isn't a decision I
can afford to make rashly.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
There's far more than
my own ideals at stake.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
Seems like his
last exam went well.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
The doctors were sayin' he
might be able to start rehab

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.777 position:50% align:center
sooner than they expected.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
I see.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
[JIMMY]
Liu is gonna be okay.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
He'll get through this.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
So quit beating yourself up
over it, all right, Yuri?

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Since he woke up,

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
he hasn't expressed a moment's
doubt about the future,

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
and he hasn't spoken
a word of complaint.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
He dreamed of a match like
the one I had with Joe,

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
but that's off the table now.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
His career was cut short
before it could happen.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
I heard them when I
woke up. It was brutal.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
Said I'd be partially paralyzed,
even after rehab.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.900 position:50% align:center
I spent the whole night
just bawling.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not fair.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
Megaloboxing is my whole life,
and they wanna take that away?

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
Is there at least a chance?

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:54.993 position:50% align:center
[LIU]
Zero.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
According to the docs, at least,

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.789 position:50% align:center
but I'm not ready
to accept that.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
I started out as some
kid off the streets

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:05.670 position:50% align:center
and ended up a world champion.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
Yuri was the only
one crazy enough

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
to share that dream with me.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
And I'm betting
he doesn't want me

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
getting in the ring
anymore after this,

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.306 position:50% align:center
so now I'm chasin' the
dream all by myself.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
I guess that's the way
things are gonna be,

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
because there's no way in hell
I'm giving up on my dream.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
If I did, I don't think I'd
be able to look at myself

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
in the mirror anymore.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
I'll keep believing
in you, as well.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm glad to hear that,

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
'cause you're gonna need to hold
out a while before our match.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center

[MAN A] Hell yeah, Sachio,
make me some money!

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50% align:center
[MAN B] Why ya gotta wait till I
bet against you to win a fight?

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
[MAN C]
Now keep doin' it!

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] I told you before,
I don't want it.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
I just thought maybe your
mind had changed by now.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
You and Abuhachi both need
to mind your own business.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50% align:center
I'm not leaving the ring,
so stop asking.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
So you been back
to the gym recently?

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
Looks like Joe's serious
about fixing it up.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
I was shocked.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
When he first came back,
I figured he would bail halfway.

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
It seems I was wrong about that.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
And your friends are
helping him out, too.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
Santa and Bonjiri are on board.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
He's only doing it

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
'cause he wants
me to forgive him.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
It's not happening.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
I won't give him the
attention he's looking for.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
You could be right.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
But still, seeing him
made me remember

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
that we've all gotta
make our own decisions.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
You, too.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.607 position:50% align:center
You should be doing the
thing you wanna do.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
I am.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] Why would you
bother coming here now?

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I know I should've been
there for you more back then.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO chuckles]

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I was scared.
Things just got too heavy.

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
I had no idea how
to deal with it all,

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:37.405 position:50% align:center
and in the end, I tried to do
what was best for every--

00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
Don't even try to
give me that crap!

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
It's your fault
everything fell apart!

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] You really think
patching up that old building

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
is enough to make it all right?

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
Nowhere Gym died the day
you walked out that door!

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
[JOE] All I want...
is to see the lights in there

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
go on again one more time.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
[NANBU groans]

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
Pops!

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
I'm okay.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
The pain never lasts. It's fine.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.249 position:50% align:center
Not a word to Joe, all right?

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
He's not as tough as
he makes you think.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
Shakin' him up before the
match won't help anyone.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
You're so selfish.
You and Joe both are.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
[NANBU]
Yeah.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
He and I chose
to take the fight,

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50% align:center
and we never asked
you runts about it.

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO] He would call it off
if you could just ask him.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
This is for his dream.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
That's why we put it
all on the line.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
It's how we all became a family.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
What scares Joe more than
anything is thinkin'

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
the light is gonna go out.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
What light?

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
The one we both believed in.
Back home, before all this.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
It's that light that
keeps him goin',

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
and now he's scared
it's gonna die with me.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
He's just like you.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
All he really wants is
to protect his family.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
[SACHIO]
I don't get it.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center
None of that makes sense to me.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.615 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL] Is it okay to
set it here, Mommy?

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
Yes! Thank you, dear.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
[MIGUEL]
Why do you keep watching

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
the same part over, Daddy?

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
It's because figuring out
how to beat a tough opponent

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
takes a lot of research.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
In this part,
you look really scary.

00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
Welp. Off to bed
now, little man.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
Read this to me first!

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.354 position:50% align:center

Daddy's very tired, Miguel.

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center

It's fine.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
Just don't fall asleep
before I get to the end

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center

journey through the wastes.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.538 position:50% align:center
As a gust of wind
swirled by his head,

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
a little hummingbird
appeared before his eyes.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
'Nomad. Before you
walk on into the desert,

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center

But the hummingbird wouldn't
take no for an answer,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
and it kept following
him through the desert.

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
'I beg of you. I must share
my song with somebody.'

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
'What a selfish thing
to ask of me.

Now let me be.'

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center

the hummingbird refused.

'How about this?

If I can get you to
lie about something,

you have to listen to my
song all the way through.

speak another word to you.'

I guess Sachio never did show.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI] Probably worn
out from his match.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
[SANTA] I dunno why
he still keeps fighting.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
What's he getting out
of letting nobodies

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
smack him around all the time?

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
Seems like he's fine

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
with the way things
are goin' for him.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
Back when he was a kid,
he wanted to become an engineer.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:57.392 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
He always said he wanted the
same job Pops used to have.

Even after you left,
he and Oicho

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.066 position:50% align:center
were always helping
Abuhachi out at his shop.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
[OICHO]
Until we lost this place.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
[BONJIRI] We all had our own
stuff to worry about back then.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
None of us realized at first

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
that Sachio was training
in Megaloboxing.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
But when we'd see him,

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.330 position:50% align:center
it wasn't hard to tell that
something in was changing.

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
And that got Abuhachi
worried about him,

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
so he talked to a buddy
in the engineers' union

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
and got a letter of
recommendation written up.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
The kid keeps on
refusin' to take it.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
Aragaki and the boss have
been looking out for us all

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
since you left.

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
Do you know why?
Why he keeps fighting?

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
He wanted to
protect this place.

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
After you were gone,

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
Sachio wanted to
keep the gym going.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
He thought that would get
things back to normal,

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
like seeing it here would
draw us all together.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
He wanted us under
the same roof again,

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
just like when Pops was alive.

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
He'll never admit it to you,

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
but he blamed himself
for running you off.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
He was afraid.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:04.084 position:50% align:center
He didn't wanna lose the
rest of his family, too.

00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
[OICHO] That's why he started
trying to be more like you,

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
the one who'd held us together.

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA yawns]

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.270 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] He's blocking
the path to the future

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
over his petty morality.

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
His sister seems to
be doing the same.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
You think it's genetic?

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
While I'm sure there's
a genetic element to it,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.905 position:50% align:center
as with any behavior,

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
I suspect their shared
upbringing has more to do--

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] Relax, I'm joking.
Quit being so literal.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIMURA]
I apologize, sir.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
Well, in any case,

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
ROSCO's brand image
leans heavily on Mac.

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
It'll take a huge blow
if this thesis gets around,

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
as will our stock.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:55.468 position:50% align:center
Mikio Shirato is a faculty
member at your university,

00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
and a lot of their
endowment comes from us.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
He's devaluing our investment.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
As the head of our
development department,

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
I'm going to have to ask you
to set him straight on this.

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
And also...

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
...send Mac's undisclosed
data to the Shirato Group.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
Make the usual
adjustments first.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, sir.

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
We have to make the first move,
and I do not care for that.

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA] And how long has
this insomnia been going on?

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
[MAC]
It's not a consistent deal.

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
These days, it's usually just
when I'm coming off a match.

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
And I feel like my memory's
been getting fuzzier.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I can
hardly remember anything

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
about my last fight.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
Well, your brain was
running on overdrive.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
You pulled off the
victory of a lifetime.

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
[MAC]
I'm afraid of myself.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50% align:center
I hurt him that bad,

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
and I didn't even realize
until I saw it on tape.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
This is a tough sport,
and you're the champion.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
We're just getting started.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
I decided to come
out of retirement

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
so my boy could see his old
man standing in the ring.

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
Everything else was
just the cherry on top.

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
I've got nothing left to prove.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I have a real
reason to keep doing this.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
Do you remember when I asked you

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
if you wanted to get
back into the ring?

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
I also asked you
why you had retired.

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
Remember your answer?

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
'Cause I remember it.

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
You saw Gearless Joe
rise up out of nowhere

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
to take on the world
champion, Yuri,

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
in the final match of
the first Megalonia.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
And witnessing him shine in
the ring like that shook you.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
That's when you understood
what the real deal looks like.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
It wasn't jealousy.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
Joe had stirred
something inside you.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
He showed you what it meant

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
to stand in the
championship ring,

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
and you realized that was
a level you'd never reach.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
Seeing that fight
opened my eyes.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't,
I might've just kept

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
treading water in the rankings.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
[SAKUMA]
But that's what you're missing.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
You are the real deal.

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
You stand exactly
where Joe stood then.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
Stick with me and we can
dream together again.

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
[MAC]
"'Fine, then. You win, I lose.'

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
By now, the Nomad
was tired of arguing,

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
so as promised,
he stopped in the desert

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:04.574 position:50% align:center
and listened to the
little bird's song.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:08.661 position:50% align:center
For just a moment, as he
listened, the Nomad's heart,

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
which had held nothing but
the pain of all he'd lost,

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
was suddenly flooded
with a gentle warmth."

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.423 position:50% align:center
[MAC] "Then, once it
finished its song,

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:23.718 position:50% align:center
the hummingbird flew off toward
a single ray of sunlight

00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:26.680 position:50% align:center
peeking through
the distant clouds."
