1
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,958
- ( Ichi whimpering )

2
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,750
- YOU HEAR THAT, DON'T YOU?
SEEMS LIKE THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.

3
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,750
- YEAH, I HOPE I CAN
GET TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

4
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,083
- MAYBE IT'S JUST THE WIND.
- THAT'S NOT WIND.

5
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,791
- NO WAY ABOUT IT. I'M STICKING
CLOSE TO THE FIRE TONIGHT.

6
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,375
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.

7
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,041
- AFTER CERTAIN BATTLES,
THE SOULS OF THOSE WHO DIED

8
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,666
WITH REGRETS WILL LINGER,
UNABLE TO TRAVEL ON.

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,125
MOUNT AZUCHI IS HAUNTED
BY THE GHOSTS OF COURAGEOUS MEN,

10
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,791
WHO EVEN NOW DON'T REALIZE
THEY'VE PERISHED.

11
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:57,666
THEY'RE MIRED IN THE SUFFERING
AND PAIN OF A LIFE THAT ENDED.

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,208
HOW AWFUL THAT WOULD BE.

13
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,791
THE VILLAGERS AVOID THAT PLACE.

14
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,666
IT'S RUMORED THE SHADE
OF LADY O-ICHI,

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,458
YOUNGER SISTER
TO THE EVIL ODA,

16
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,291
SITS IN THE RUINS, WEEPING IN
THE DARK, ABANDONED TO HER FATE.

17
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,041
SHE CRIES OVER THE DESTRUCTION
OF HER CLAN

18
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,750
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT
UNTIL DAYBREAK.

19
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:29,791
- I SAW HER DIE.
IT'S HER.  LADY O-ICHI.

20
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,291
HOW ANGUISHED SHE SOUNDS.

21
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,333
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,000
- ( laughs )
- ( gasps )

23
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,416
- AH, WHO BETTER TO STALK THESE
HALLS THAN THE YOUNG TIGER?

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,666
TRULY, IT IS AN HONOR
TO MEET YOU AGAIN.

25
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,791
- ( gasps ) THAT VOICE.

26
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,125
YOU'RE MATSUNAGA HISAHIDE!

27
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,541
WHY ARE YOU HERE,
VILLAIN OF THE WARRING STATES?

28
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,041
- IT CAUGHT YOUR EAR,
DID IT NOT?

29
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,125
THE DEPTHS OF HER LAMENTATION,

30
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,000
WRINGING HER DRY.

31
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,375
- LADY O-ICHI.

32
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,250
- ODA'S UNLUCKY SISTER.

33
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,250
WIDOWED BY HIS TREACHERY,
SO THEY SAY.  A PITY.

34
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,333
CAUGHT BETWEEN THIS WORLD
AND THE NEXT.

35
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:42,166
POSSESSION OF HER SOUL AS
DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO REALMS

36
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,666
AS HER ALLEGIANCE WAS
WHEN SHE STILL LIVED.

37
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,000
STRANGE.

38
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,250
THE ODA CLAN ALMOST TOOK THIS
COUNTRY FOR THEIR OWN

39
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,791
AND NOW THIS LACHRYMAL SHADE IS
ALL THAT REMAINS OF THEM.

40
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,416
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

41
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,458
- OH, NO, I'M VERY MUCH ALIVE.

42
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,708
- BUT HOW CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE?

43
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,208
WHEN WE FOUGHT
AT THE GREAT TEMPLE,

44
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,875
THERE WERE ALL THOSE EXPLOSIONS.

45
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,875
- YOU DON'T GET TO BE MY AGE
BY ACTING RASHLY.

46
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:17,833
NAIVE BOY, SUFFICE IT TO SAY,
I HAD ESCAPE ROUTES FIRMLY

47
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,208
IN PLACE BEFORE YOU'D EVEN
LEFT YOUR MASTER'S SIDE.

48
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,416
THE CRIES OF THE DEVIL
KING'S SISTER DRIFT OUT

49
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,791
OF THESE RUINED STONES
AND TIMBERS.

50
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,625
WITH GOOD REASON
DO ALL MEN ESCHEW THIS PLACE.

51
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:34,375
IT HAS BEEN MY HERMITAGE,
WHERE I WATCH AND WAIT.

52
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,666
- THAT THING IN YOUR HAND CAN'T
BE WHAT I THINK IT IS.

53
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,750
- THE LATE NOBUNAGA USED
THE SKULLS OF GENERALS

54
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,041
HE'D MURDERED
TO DRINK HIS SAKE.

55
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,291
NOW THAT THE WHEEL OF KARMA
HAS LAID HIM LOW,

56
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,666
I THINK MY SIPPING
FROM HIS SKULL WOULD BE WELL

57
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,958
WITHIN MY RIGHTS.
THE IRONY IS DELICIOUS, NO?

58
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,666
THINK OF THE THOUSANDS
OF LIVES HE CUT SHORT,

59
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,375
DYING IN AGONY ALL SO HE COULD
POSSESS THE LAND

60
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,916
OF THE RISING SUN.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,458
I WOULD HONOR THEIR MEMORY
TO TOAST THEM THUS.

62
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,666
- YOU ARE NO MAN, MATSUNAGA.
YOU'RE A GRAVE ROBBER.

63
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,708
HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE DEVIL KING
OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN,

64
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,666
BUT HE WAS A PEERLESS WARRIOR,
SECOND TO NONE.

65
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,750
AND NOW THAT HIS SOUL HAS GONE
ON TO THE LAND OF THE DEAD,

66
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,125
NOW YOU RANSACK THE CASTLE
THAT'S BECOME HIS GRAVE.

67
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,250
AND WORSE, YOU TRY
TO STEAL HIS REMAINS.

68
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,208
YOU DARE SPEAK OF HONORING
THE DEAD, YOU GHOUL.

69
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,500
- FAIR ENOUGH, BUT DIDN'T
YOU SLAY LORD NOBUNAGA?

70
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,875
YOU AND DATE BOTH?

71
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,250
YES, KILLED HIM
IN HIS OWN FORTRESS, DIDN'T YOU?

72
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,666
IS IT THE WAY OF RIGHTEOUS YOUNG
MEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE

73
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,791
TO CHAMPION THE CAUSE
OF THOSE THEY HAVE MURDERED?

74
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,916
OR HAVE YOU PAINTED THE DEED
IN RATIONALIZATIONS,

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,250
SO AS TO HIDE THE BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS?

76
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,500
YOU CUT THE MAN DOWN
IN HIS PRIME,

77
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:51,250
AND YOU BEGRUDGE ME THIS BIT
OF BONE, THIS MERE THING.

78
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,166
SUCH LOGIC.  HOW IT STUMPS
THIS OLD BRAIN OF MINE,

79
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,541
BUT IT STRIKES A CHORD
WITH ME, THIS LOGIC OF YOURS.

80
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,500
CONTRARY THOUGH IT MAY BE.

81
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,666
SPEAKING OF CONTRARY, I'VE NEWS
OF YOUR PARTNER IN CRIME.

82
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,041
YES, DATE MASAMUNE,

83
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,333
WITH WHOM YOU RALLIED
THE WARLORDS TO FIGHT ODA.

84
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,875
ONE OF MY MESSENGERS
JUST INFORMED ME

85
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,375
IT SEEMS DATE MET HIS END
IN THE COURSE

86
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,833
OF TOYOTOMI'S
CLANDESTINE INVASION.

87
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,000
- LORD MASAMUNE'S DEAD?

88
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,666
HE WAS CORNERED
IN HIS OWN LAND OF OSHU,

89
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,833
WHICH HE ONCE FIRMLY RULED.

90
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,333
THE SAME GAMBIT
WITH WHICH ODA WAS TOPPLED.

91
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,750
"WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH,
THAT SHALL HE REAP."

92
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,541
THEY SAY DATE WAS BLOODIED
FROM HEAD TO FOOT,

93
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,375
WHEN TOYOTOMI ARRIVED
TO PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY.

94
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,000
IT'S SUCH A SHAME.

95
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,666
HIS SIX DRAGON SWORDS
ARE LOST TO ME FOREVER,

96
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,916
PROBABLY NOTHING MORE
THAN BROKEN SHARDS OF STEEL,

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,375
SCATTERED AMIDST DATE'S
FAITHFUL, SLAIN AT SURIAGEHARA.

98
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,375
- ( sobbing )
- OSHU LIES THAT DIRECTION.

99
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,458
SO RECITE A SUTRA THAT HIS SOUL
MAY LEAVE THIS WORLD IN PEACE.

100
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,708
THEN SEE THAT THE TIGER OF KAI
DOES NOT EARN A SIMILAR FATE

101
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,208
AS THE VANQUISHED
ONE-EYED DRAGON.

102
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,375
AND NOW I BID THEE FAREWELL.

103
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,166
- DAMN YOU.  HALT!

104
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,125
I CAN SEE THROUGH YOUR LIES.
LORD DATE MASAMUNE

105
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,166
IS A WARRIOR WHO WOULD
NEVER ACCEPT DEFEAT,

106
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,000
NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE
THE ODDS HE MAY FACE.

107
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,708
KAI FEARS NO ENEMY.

108
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,000
SO LONG AS MY LORD DRAWS BREATH,
HIS STRENGTH INSPIRES US.

109
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,625
RETURN THAT SKULL TO WHERE YOU
FOUND IT THIS INSTANT.

110
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,458
ODA NOBUNAGA WAS A FIEND.

111
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,833
HE COMMITTED ALL SORTS OF EVIL
AGAINST HIS FELLOW MAN,

112
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,916
BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST
HE WAS A WARRIOR.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,750
HIS SOUL MAY BE IN HELL
FOR ALL I KNOW,

114
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,958
BUT I WON'T LET YOU
DESECRATE HIS REMAINS.

115
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,916
AS ONE OF THE LAST
TO ENGAGE THE DEVIL KING

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,666
OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN
IN COMBAT,

117
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,333
I VOW YOU LEAVE HERE WITHOUT
THAT SKULL OR NOT AT ALL!

118
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,375
- HONOR IS AN ILLUSION,

119
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,833
A FICKLE MIRAGE HOLDING MEN
IN THRALL TO FOOLISH IDEAS.

120
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,416
THE DEVIL KING WAS A BEAST.

121
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,708
YOU SAW FOR YOURSELF THE FOUL
INEQUITIES HE RAINED DOWN

122
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,708
UPON THE PEOPLE OF THIS LAND,
FOE AND FRIEND ALIKE.

123
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,583
AND YET, YOU WOULD REMEMBER
NOTHING OF HIM,

124
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,708
SAVE HIS PROWESS IN BATTLE.

125
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,458
HOW HARD YOU'VE SCRUBBED
HIS BLOODSTAINED MEMORY.

126
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,750
IN TIME, YOU WILL
GLORIFY THE BUTCHER

127
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,416
BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE
FORGOTTEN THE TRUTH.

128
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,083
LOOK AT YOU, TREKKING TO KYOTO
IN THESE DARK TIMES.

129
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,583
WHAT IS A GENERAL
BUT AN AGENT OF CARNAGE,

130
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:32,666
WHO CLINGS TO HONOR AS
A JUSTIFICATION FOR VIOLENCE?

131
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,458
PEACE, GOOD YUKIMURA,
I MEANT NO OFFENSE.

132
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,541
I OFFER NO JUDGMENT
OF YOUR ACTIONS.

133
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,166
I'M MERELY POINTING OUT A FACT.

134
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,666
WHY DO YOU BURN
WITH SUCH INTENSITY?

135
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,916
YOUR HEROICS
ARE ALL FOR NAUGHT.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,833
CONFLICT, DRAWING A SWORD,

137
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,750
WAR AGAINST ONE'S FELLOW MAN.

138
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,166
THEY'RE ALL A PART
OF OUR NATURE,

139
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,583
BUT OUR BATTLES, OUR BRAVE
WORDS, OUR PROFOUND THOUGHTS,

140
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,666
THEY'RE MERELY PANTOMIME
IN A PUPPET SHOW.

141
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,083
NO MATTER HOW EPIC OUR TALE
IS WHILE WE STAND IN THE LIGHT,

142
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,416
WE ARE DESTINED FOR DUST.

143
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,583
EVERY ONE OF US,
PEASANT AND LORD ALIKE.

144
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,291
WE ARE ALL BETROTHED
TO ENTROPY, EVERY MOTHER'S SON.

145
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,333
EVEN YOU AND I ARE LOCKED
INTO THIS MELANCHOLY FATE,

146
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,000
AS WAS THE ONE-EYED DRAGON.

147
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,000
THINK OF IT AS THOUGH HE HAS
REACHED A SHARED DESTINATION

148
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,750
AHEAD OF YOU, IF YOU LIKE.

149
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,208
I TRUST THAT SHOULD MITIGATE
YOUR GRIEF AT HIS PASSING

150
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:26,666
TO A MANAGEABLE LEVEL.
- YOU'RE WRONG.

151
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,791
DAMN YOU.
WE'RE MORE THAN JUST OBJECTS.

152
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,791
A SOUL FILLED
WITH PASSION NEVER DIES,

153
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,458
AND THE FRAME IT INHABITS
DESERVES TO BE HONORED.

154
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,625
WHETHER A SWORD OR ARMOR
OR PIECE OF BONE,

155
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,625
IF PAID PROPER HOMAGE,
A SOUL CAN RESIDE THERE.

156
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,583
- I MUST ADMIT YOUR OUTBURST
EVOKES IN ME

157
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,583
A CERTAIN SENSE OF NOSTALGIA,

158
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,083
THOUGH I WAS NEVER QUITE
THAT FOOLISH EVEN AS A BOY.

159
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,958
YOU DRAW YOUR SPEARS
AS THOUGH TO SLAY A PHILOSOPHY.

160
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,208
IN A SENSE, YOUR FATE'S MORE
UNFORTUNATE THAN NOBUNAGA'S.

161
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,125
PERHAPS MORE THAN A PHANTOM'S
TEARS LURED YOU HENCE.

162
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,333
- NOW GUARD THIS PLACE IN DEATH,

163
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,166
YOUNG FOOL AND THE DEVIL'S
SOBBING SISTER, BOTH.

164
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,708
- ( bird screeches )

165
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,875
- ( sobbing )
- ( Sanada coughs )

166
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,041
- Ichi: GIVE IT BACK.

167
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,166
GIVE IT BACK.
THAT BELONGS TO MY BROTHER.

168
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,833
- LADY O-ICHI.

169
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,291
- GIVE IT BACK.

170
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,416
GIVE IT BACK!

171
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,958
- ( grunting )

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,416
- I WATCHED HIM DIE.

173
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,833
I DIDN'T DO A THING.

174
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,541
I JUST STOOD AND WATCHED.

175
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,875
- ( shouts )

176
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,208
- MY LOVE.

177
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,000
I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO AGAIN.

178
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,083
EVER.
- LADY O-ICHI. ( gasps )

179
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,750
THIS ENERGY,

180
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,125
THIS OUTPOURING OF EVIL,
IT'S NOT COMING FROM HER.

181
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,500
SOMETHING HAS POSSESSED HER.

182
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,916
- NOW, MY LOVE.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,375
LET'S SLEEP EVERMORE.
( groans )

184
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,458
- ( sobs )

185
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,708
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

186
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,208
WHATEVER OR WHOEVER THIS IS,

187
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,833
SHE'S TRYING
TO HOLD IT AT BAY.

188
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,833
WHAT DO I DO?

189
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,666
EVEN NOW, I CANNOT
STRIKE LADY O-ICHI DOWN.

190
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,458
- I WILL REND THE FLESH
FROM YOUR BONES, YOUNG MURDERER.

191
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,833
- I HAVE NO CHOICE.

192
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,000
- I WILL BE THE ARCHITECT
OF YOUR DOOM.

193
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,666
- ( screaming )

194
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,166
- LADY O-ICHI,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

195
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,583
BLAZING WHEEL!

196
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,916
- ( screaming )

197
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,666
- NO, IT CAN'T BE.

198
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,083
( gasps )

199
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,833
- BIG BOSS, YOU'RE AWAKE.

200
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,041
- GUESS I'M ALIVE.
DID I JUST IMAGINE HIM?

201
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,416
- NO, THAT HAPPENED

202
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,125
AND YOU WERE ALREADY DEAD
ON YOUR FEET

203
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,416
WHEN TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI
GOT THERE.

204
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,708
- GOT MY ASS KICKED.

205
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,375
HOW COME HE DIDN'T FINISH ME?

206
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,625
- WELL, BOSS, WE WERE
GETTING BEAT UP PRETTY BADLY.

207
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,875
- ( shouting )

208
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,083
( shouts )

209
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,833
- OH!

210
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,750
- ( groaning )

211
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,583
- All: BIG BOSS!

212
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,875
AND THEN FOR SOME REASON,
HE JUST STOPPED.

213
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,958
WE FLED, HOPING HE WOULDN'T
CHANGE HIS MIND.

214
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,041
- YOU'RE OUR BOSS.  WE ALL WOULD
HAVE DIED TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

215
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,333
- AND WHAT WOULD BOSS KATAKURA
THINK OF US

216
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,083
IF SOMEONE TOLD HIM

217
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,166
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE YOUR BACK?

218
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,833
- WHEN WE RAN, DID ANYONE
IN THE REAR GET PICKED OFF?

219
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,833
- NO, EVERY MAN WHO LIVED
THROUGH THE BATTLE MADE IT HOME.

220
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,000
- GO TEAM.

221
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,375
- THANKS, BOYS.
- HUH?

222
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:56,375
- BOSS, YOU SHOULDN'T
GET UP YET.

223
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,833
- BUNSHICHI, MAGOBEI.

224
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,416
THERE ANYTHING
TO EAT AROUND HERE?

225
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,750
- Both: YEAH.

226
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,958
- DIDN'T HAVE THE STONES.

227
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:12,083
GENERAL MUTTONCHOPS AND THAT
MASK-WEARING LACKEY OF HIS BOTH.

228
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,833
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN ME OUT
WHEN THEY HAD THE CHANCE.

229
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,791
- Keiji: NO, I'M BEGGING YOU.
SHOW HIM MERCY.

230
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,583
YOU WON, OKAY?
SO PLEASE, JUST LET IT GO.

231
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,333
LOOK, I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
DON'T KILL HIM.

232
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,958
LET HIDEYOSHI LIVE.

233
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,583
HE'S MY--
HE'S MY FRIEND.

234
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,083
SO, YEAH,
LET'S NOT DO THAT AGAIN.

235
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,291
- TO THINK THAT I
OF ALL PEOPLE

236
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,708
COULDN'T KILL
ONE INSIGNIFICANT SNAKE

237
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,916
- ( music over dialogue )

238
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,541
- ( chitters )
- UH-HUH.

239
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,083
WE'RE HEADING STRAIGHT
TO OSAKA.

240
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,625
I'M GONNA TRY TO TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

241
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,000
HEY, I GOTTA TRY, RIGHT?

242
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,500
HYAH!

243
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,958
- ( horse whinnies )

244
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,083
- O-ICHI.  IS SHE?

245
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,500
THE THING YOU WERE STRUGGLING
SO HARD TO LOCK INSIDE,

246
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,875
IT WAS--

247
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,625
- IT'S LADY O-ICHI.
- THANK THE HEAVENS.

248
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,041
SHE IS REALLY HERE.

249
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,583
- TO THINK THAT SHE SURVIVED
THIS LONG.

250
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,500
- YOU THREE ARE ODA SOLDIERS WHO
SURVIVED THE BATTLE, AREN'T YOU?

251
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,250
- SPEARS AND THAT RED ATTIRE,
COULD IT BE?

252
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,458
- YOU'RE SANADA YUKIMURA.

253
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,166
- WE WILL AVENGE
OUR LORD NOBUNAGA.

254
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,333
- LISTEN, YOU.
LADY O-ICHI'S COMING WITH US.

255
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,291
WE'RE GOING TO
REBUILD THE ODA ARMY.

256
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,041
AND ONCE WE DO,
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE I FIND YOU

257
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,333
ON THE BATTLEFIELD SOMEDAY.

258
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,791
- Oyamada: THEY MUST HAVE HEARD
THE RUMORS ABOUT LADY O-ICHI

259
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,583
AND BANDED TOGETHER
TO INVESTIGATE.

260
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,375
ODA'S FORCES WILL NEVER BE MORE
THAN A DIM SHADOW

261
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,750
OF THEIR FORMER SELVES.
THERE ARE SO FEW LEFT.

262
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,166
WE MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE
THEM ALONE.

263
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,000
- MASTER OYAMADA,

264
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,416
I LEFT THE CAMP WITHOUT LETTING
YOU KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING.

265
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,000
YOU HAVE MY APOLOGIES.
- PLEASE, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

266
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,166
LORD TAKEDA TOLD ME
TO GIVE YOU MY SUPPORT

267
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,291
IN ALL THINGS DURING
THE COURSE OF THIS MISSION.

268
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,916
HIS FAITH IN YOU IS GREAT.

269
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,750
- THIS WAS INEVITABLE.

270
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,250
- WISE CHOICE.  THE WESTERN
LANDS WILL KNOW TRUE SAFETY.

271
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,708
- I HEAR WHISPERS OF
A MYSTERIOUS FORCE IN SATSUMA.

272
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,166
AN ARMY THAT HAS REBUFFED
TOYOTOMI'S EVERY ADVANCE.

273
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,125
- YOU SPEAK OF THE PAST,
MY DEAR MOTONARI.

274
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,541
NOW THAT YOU HAVE ABANDONED
YOUR ISOLATIONIST TENDENCIES

275
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,708
AND JOINED WITH US, I CAN SEE
THEIR RUIN ON THE HORIZON.

276
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,625
- WHY THE SUDDEN HUNGER
FOR CONQUEST?

277
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,375
YOU SPRUNG A SNEAK ATTACK
ON KAWANAKAJIMA ONLY RECENTLY,

278
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:48,666
AND WHEN DATE RETREATED,
YOU PURSUED HIM TO OSHU ITSELF.

279
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,583
YOU EVEN NABBED HIS STRATEGIST
KATAKURA KOJURO,

280
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,416
AND AFTER ALL
OF YOUR CLANDESTINE EFFORTS--

281
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,125
- WE ACT, BECAUSE THE STARS
HAVE BEGUN TO ALIGN.

282
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,708
YOU ARE WISE
TO FORM THIS PARTNERSHIP.

283
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,958
WHILE WE AWAITED ODA'S DOWNFALL,

284
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,250
WE PUT OUR ENERGIES INTO
DISCREETLY TRAINING AN ARMY

285
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,958
OF FIGHTING ELITE.
BETTER FRIEND THAN FOE, YES?

286
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,916
WE BOTH KNOW YOU'VE JUST
BEEN WAITING FOR A MOMENT

287
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,083
LIKE THIS ONE.

288
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,666
STEP ONE.

289
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,958
WE CAPTURE
THE INDOMITABLE FUGAKU,

290
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:22,458
CHOSOKABE'S FLOATING FORTRESS
THAT HAS LONG VEXED YOU.

291
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,208
WE WILL SEND THOSE PIRATES
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE INLAND SEA

292
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,625
OF SETO.

293
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,916
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

294
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,416
- Uesugi: OH TEMPESTUOUS DRAGON,
NOW TWICE ROBBED

295
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,750
OF YOUR RIGHT EYE, THE DEVOTED
AND FEARLESS KATAKURA.

296
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,791
REKINDLE YOUR PASSION,
UNRELENTING DATE.

297
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,250
STEEL YOUR SOUL FOR
THE RIGORS OF BATTLE

298
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,583
AND YOUR NAME SHALL
RESOUND FOR ALL TIME.
