1
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,000
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

2
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,041
- TOSHIIE, MATSU,
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

3
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,166
GOING TO WAR AGAINST KENSHIN?
HYAH!

4
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,875
- ( horse whinnies )

5
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,000
- Kasuga:
MY LORD KENSHIN,

6
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,416
THE MAEDA ARMY, LED BY LORD
TOSHIIE AND HIS WIFE MATSU

7
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,958
IS APPROACHING THE BORDER
OF OUR TERRITORIES.

8
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,583
THEIR NUMBERS AND CONFIGURATION
ARE AS WE ESTIMATED.

9
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,750
IT APPEARS THEY INTEND
TO BRING THEIR ENTIRE ARMY

10
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:43,416
TO BEAR AGAINST US,
INCLUDING THEIR ARQUEBUS CORPS.

11
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,666
- LORD TOSHIIE REMAINS
AS FORTHRIGHT AS EVER.

12
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,500
WHERE HAS KEIJI GONE?

13
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,625
- IT SEEMS HE IS RIDING OUT
TO MEET WITH THE MAEDA FORCES,

14
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:56,125
AND KNOWING WHAT I DO OF HIM,
I ASSUME KEIJI BELIEVES HE'S

15
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,208
ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM
TO HALT THEIR INVASION.

16
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,625
- HE WOULD TRY.

17
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,666
ALTHOUGH IT PAINS ME TO DO SO,

18
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,458
WE SHALL PROCEED.
- MILORD.

19
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,041
- MAY BISHAMONTEN'S DIVINE
PROTECTION GO WITH YOU.

20
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,416
- WHOA!

21
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,583
HYAH!

22
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,041
TOSHIIE, MATSU,
WAIT, LISTEN TO ME.

23
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,083
- MY LORD INUCHIYO,
IT'S KEIJI.

24
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,250
- WE WILL NOT BE
STOPPING, MATSU.

25
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,333
- WHAT?
- WE WILL PRESS ON.

26
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,875
- AS YOU WISH, MY LORD HUSBAND.

27
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,833
- TOSHIIE, MATSU, PLEASE STOP.

28
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,375
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO WHAT I--

29
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,333
- TOSHIIE, MATSU!

30
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,083
SO MUCH FOR BEING RATIONAL.

31
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,583
- Kasuga: LEAVE IT
TO LORD KENSHIN FROM HERE.

32
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,458
- KASUGA.

33
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,916
- GO WHEREVER THIS ROAD
MAY TAKE YOU

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,375
WITNESSING THIS WAR WILL
ONLY BRING YOU MORE PAIN,

35
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,166
AND YOU WILL MOST CERTAINLY
ONLY BE IN OUR WAY.

36
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,458
BUT MY LORD WISHES TO ASSURE YOU
THAT HE WILL DO EVERYTHING

37
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,291
IN HIS POWER.

38
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,250
- LORD UESUGI KENSHIN,
WAR GOD OF ECHIGO, I PRESUME.

39
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:16,375
I AM LORD MAEDA TOSHIIE,
PROTECTOR OF THE LAND OF KAGA.

40
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,458
- AND I AM HIS WIFE
LADY MATSU.

41
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,000
- I'VE HEARD MUCH
ABOUT YOU BOTH.

42
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,750
- YOU HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN
MY NEPHEW KEIJI KINDNESS.

43
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:29,000
- MY LORD HUSBAND, THIS MAN
IS NOW OUR OPPONENT IN WAR.

44
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:33,041
- LORD UESUGI, SURELY YOU DO
NOT INTEND TO ENGAGE US

45
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,875
WITH SUCH A PALTRY FORCE
AT YOUR BACK.

46
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,958
I KNOW YOUR REPUTATION
AS A WAR GOD, BUT--

47
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,791
- THESE BLESSED FIELDS
OF ECHIGO,

48
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:44,333
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF STAINING
THEM WITH THE BLOOD OF WAR.

49
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,458
LORD TOSHIIE, LADY MATSU,

50
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,291
WITHDRAW IMMEDIATELY.

51
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:54,208
I HAVE DISPATCHED THE ENTIRETY
OF THE UESUGI ARMY TO KAGA.

52
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,541
- YOU FIEND.

53
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,958
- IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT
YOUR CASTLE WILL FALL,

54
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,291
BUT IT IS ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE INNOCENTS BEGIN

55
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,625
TO SUFFER AS WELL.
THAT IS THE PRICE YOU PAY

56
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,583
FOR ALLYING WITH THE TOYOTOMI

57
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,250
AND ATTEMPTING
TO INVADE MY LANDS.

58
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,625
SHOULD YOU STRIKE ME DOWN HERE
AND NOW,

59
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,708
MY BELOVED ECHIGO WILL BE YOURS,

60
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,166
BUT YOUR VICTORY WILL MOST
CERTAINLY COME AT THE COST

61
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,750
OF YOUR OWN KAGA.

62
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,750
- ARE YOU CLAIMING YOU SENT
YOUR TROOPS TO KAGA

63
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,958
WHILE WE MADE OUR WAY HERE?
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.

64
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,083
- AS WOULD I.

65
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,291
ALTHOUGH I IMAGINE YOUR SCOUTS

66
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,416
WILL SOON COME RUNNING
BEARING URGENT NEWS,

67
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,125
HOWEVER, BY THEN IT WILL BE
TOO LATE TO ACT.

68
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,041
- MY LORD INUCHIYO.

69
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,041
- WE CANNOT WITHDRAW.

70
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,041
LORD HIDEYOSHI AND LORD HANBEI
HAVE PLACED THEIR FAITH IN US.

71
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,458
THEY HAVE ENTRUSTED US
WITH THE SUBJUGATION OF UESUGI.

72
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,625
FOR THE SAKE OF BUILDING
A STRONGER COUNTRY.

73
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,708
- Matsu: BUT THE PEOPLE OF KAGA
WILL BE HELD HOSTAGE.

74
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,500
- WE WILL NOT ABANDON
OUR PEOPLE.

75
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,458
WE WILL DEFEAT UESUGI, THEN
HASTEN BACK TO OUR HOMELAND.

76
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,458
- WE FACE THE WAR GOD OF ECHIGO.

77
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,625
THIS IS THE ONLY MAN LORD TAKEDA
SHINGEN, THE TIGER OF KAI,

78
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,416
RECOGNIZES
AS A WORTHY OPPONENT.

79
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,375
EVEN WITH INUCHIYO'S
PEERLESS SKILLS WITH THE SPEAR,

80
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,791
THIS WILL BY NO MEANS BE EASY.

81
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,750
I, MATSU,
WILL UNDERTAKE THIS TASK.

82
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,291
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

83
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,666
- MY LORD HUSBAND,
PLEASE HURRY BACK TO KAGA.

84
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,125
- DO NOT BE A FOOL.

85
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,625
- YOUR CONCERN FOR ME
IS UNNECESSARY.

86
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,375
HAVING DEFEATED DATE,
ARMIES FROM ASHINA, NANBU

87
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,166
AND TSUGARU WILL BE SURE
TO ARRIVE HERE SOON.

88
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,333
- YES, BUT--

89
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,375
- SO MY OPPONENT IS TO BE YOUR
WIFE THEN, LORD TOSHIIE?

90
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,291
- IT IS.

91
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,750
PLEASE, MY LORD HUSBAND,
YOU MUST MAKE HASTE.

92
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,291
EXPOSING THE INNOCENT PEOPLE
OF KAGA TO SUCH DANGER

93
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,291
MUST NOT COME TO PASS.

94
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,333
- PREPARE YOURSELF.

95
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,708
- READY WHEN YOU ARE.

96
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,833
- MATSU.

97
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,666
WE WILL RETURN HOME.

98
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,416
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO FIGHT THEM.

99
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,333
- RIGHT.

100
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,041
- WE'VE BEEN SURROUNDED.

101
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,625
- MY LORD HUSBAND,

102
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,416
IS IT POSSIBLE LORD UESUGI

103
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,208
HOPES TO FORCE OUR SURRENDER
WITHOUT BLOODSHED?

104
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,416
- INDEED.

105
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,583
LORD UESUGI KENSHIN,

106
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,500
HE IS A COMPASSIONATE WARRIOR,

107
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,416
JUST AS WE'D HEARD FROM KEIJI.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,458
BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY.

109
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:41,333
I CANNOT, WILL NOT
LAY DOWN MY SPEAR NOW.

110
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,708
DESTROY THE UESUGI ARMY!

111
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,250
- ( shouting )

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,416
- I AM THE INVINCIBLE
PROTAGONIST.

113
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,333
I SPENT A YEAR EARNING
MY REPUTATION.

114
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,166
UESUGI'S FIRST UNIT.
NAOE KANETSUGU!

115
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,833
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF LOSING
TO THE LIKES OF--

116
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,125
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING
TO ME?

117
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,416
- ( shouting )

118
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,166
- KEIJI.

119
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,708
YOUR DEMEANOR TELLS ME THAT
YOU HAVE NOT COME TO OUR AID.

120
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,041
SORRY, YOU MADE
YOUR POSITION CLEAR.

121
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:04,041
I'LL HAVE TO SPEAK WITH LANGUAGE
YOU UNDERSTAND.

122
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,833
- KEIJI.

123
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,833
- A WIN FOR MAEDA IS
A WIN FOR TOYOTOMI.

124
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,500
AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING
I CAN ABIDE.

125
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:15,291
I WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY
AND LET IT HAPPEN.

126
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,333
- SO BE IT.

127
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,750
- MY LORD HUSBAND, NO.

128
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,083
- BETTER DO THIS FOR REAL,
TOSHIIE.

129
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,625
- DON'T WORRY,
I NEVER HOLD BACK.

130
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,500
( screaming )

131
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,541
- EVEN IF YOU MANAGE
TO SUBDUE YOUR OPPONENT,

132
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,208
SOMEDAY, SOMEONE ELSE WILL
ALWAYS COME TO SUBDUE YOU.

133
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,916
WHY CAN'T YOU SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND THAT?

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,958
- BUT I DO UNDERSTAND.

135
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,416
I WANT TO END VIOLENCE COMMITTED
IN THE NAME OF UNJUST DEEDS.

136
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,625
THAT IS WHY I FIGHT.
SO THAT NO ONE ELSE EVER HAS TO.

137
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,958
- KEIJI.  MY LORD INUCHIYO.

138
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,916
PLEASE STOP THIS.

139
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,833
WHY MUST YOU TWO CROSS SWORDS?
- ( explosion )

140
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,458
( men screaming )

141
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,291
- TOYOTOMI IS TRYING
TO BUILD A STRONG COUNTRY.

142
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,375
ONCE HE COMES TO POWER,
WE WILL ALL KNOW PEACE AT LAST.

143
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,041
- DAMN IT, TOSHIIE.

144
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,375
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO CREATE ISN'T
THE KIND OF WORLD YOU WANT.

145
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

146
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:33,625
- I CANNOT YIELD.
( grunting )

147
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,333
- KEIJI.

148
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,541
- MY LORD INUCHIYOU.

149
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,416
- MY LORD INUCHIYO!

150
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,541
- HIDEYOSHI!

151
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:51,166
- I CANNOT YIELD.

152
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,125
- TOSHIIE.

153
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,125
I'M SO SORRY.

154
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,333
- ( screaming )

155
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,500
- DEFEND YOURSELF, KEIJI.

156
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,791
- Uesugi:
WITHDRAW, LADY MATSU.

157
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,833
THE MAEDA GENERAL
HAS BEEN GRAVELY INJURED.

158
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,333
- BUT, LORD UESUGI, I--

159
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,208
- FOR THE SAKE OF LOVED ONES,
FOR THEIR FUTURES,

160
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,000
THERE ARE THOSE WHO
TAKE UP THE SWORD

161
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,166
AND THOSE WHO DO NOT
AND BOTH ARE RIGHT.

162
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,916
YOUR NEPHEW HAS CHOSEN
THE PATH OF LOVE,

163
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,375
WHILE HIS FORMER FRIEND
HAS CHOSEN THE SWORD,

164
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,666
AS HAS YOUR HUSBAND.

165
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,083
BUT IN TRUTH, LORD TOSHIIE
AND KEIJI ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT.

166
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:33,500
BOTH WANT THE SAME THING.
PEACEFUL UNITY FOR ALL.

167
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:37,458
IT IS A BITTER IRONY.
- OH.

168
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,416
- WAKE ON UP, BOYS.

169
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,041
I SAID, WAKE UP!

170
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
- BIG BOSS.
- BIG BOSS.

171
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,875
- BIG BOSS.
- BIG BOSS.

172
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,666
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

173
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,875
YOU DID A GOOD JOB,
SURVIVING THAT ONE,

174
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,625
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN BACK OSHU
FOR THE TIME BEING.

175
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,375
- All: RIGHT.

176
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,875
- SON OF A--

177
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,333
- DAMN IT.

178
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,791
ONLY MASTER KATAKURA CAN KEEP
BIG BOSS'S BACK PROTECTED.

179
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,583
- WE'LL GO HOME AND PREPARE FOR
WAR, THEN WE'LL HEAD FOR OSAKA.

180
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,041
WE'LL CRUSH TOYOTOMI,

181
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,833
BUT WE'RE GOING TO
GET KOJURO BACK.

182
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,583
- RIGHT.

183
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,791
- OH!
- NO WAY.

184
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,625
THAT LOOKS LIKE.
- TO-- TOYO--

185
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,416
- TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI.

186
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,708
YOU DEFINITELY GOT BALLS
OF STEEL,

187
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,041
COMING HERE TO GREET ME
IN PERSON.

188
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,583
I SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR SAVING ME THE TROUBLE

189
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,416
OF GOING ALL THE WAY
TO OSAKA.

190
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,416
- SNAKES ARE MORE TENACIOUS
THAN ONE MIGHT EXPECT,

191
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,333
NO MATTER HOW HARMLESS
THEY APPEAR.

192
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:05,000
- HA!  SURE YOU SAY THAT, BUT
YOU DON'T SEEM TOO CONFIDENT,

193
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,333
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE
OF YOUR SIZE.

194
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,958
YOU'RE UNEASY,

195
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,166
LEFT THE EXTERMINATION
OF A SNAKE TO THE B-TEAM,

196
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,541
YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
TO CHECK UP ON IT FOR YOURSELF.

197
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,500
YOU'RE SHOWING ME
YOUR TRUE COLORS.

198
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:23,250
THOSE EYES SEE ME
FOR THE DRAGON I REALLY AM.

199
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,541
- A MISERABLE RETORT.

200
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:30,208
SO YOU INTEND TO DEFY ME.

201
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,208
EVEN WHEN ALL YOUR SCALES HAVE
BEEN PEELED AWAY

202
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:37,208
AND YOU'VE ALREADY
LOST YOUR RIGHT EYE?

203
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,625
- GUESS I WAS WRONG.

204
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,083
I GAVE YOU TOO MUCH CREDIT
IN THE BRAIN DEPARTMENT.

205
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,250
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
A SNAKE AND A DRAGON

206
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,458
IS IN ITS BITE.

207
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,125
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE.

208
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:51,625
YOU CAN'T TAKE A DRAGON'S SCALES
UNTIL HE'S KICKED THE BUCKET.

209
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,583
NOT A SINGLE DAMN ONE.

210
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,458
I SHALL NOW TEACH YOU A LESSON
IN UTTER DEFEAT.

211
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,791
- ( screaming )

212
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,333
- YUKIMURA, WE SHOULD SEND
A FEW MEN TO FIND A PLACE

213
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,375
TO MAKE CAMP SOON.
- THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

214
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,500
- IS THERE SOMETHING THE MATTER?

215
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,500
- NO, JUST EVER SINCE
WE ENTERED OMI,

216
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,583
IT SEEMS THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE
BEEN LABORING CEASELESSLY,

217
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,458
WORKING TO THE BONE,
MORNING, DAY AND NIGHT.

218
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,458
AND LOOK AT THEM.  THEY'RE
ALL WOMEN OR THE ELDERLY,

219
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,458
OR THOSE STILL
OF TENDER YEARS.

220
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:04,375
- IT IS MOST LIKELY DUE
TO TOYOTOMI'S CONSCRIPTION.

221
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,208
THEY SAY THAT ALL THE SOLDIERS
UNDER HIS COMMAND

222
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,333
ARE ROUNDED UP IN ONE PLACE

223
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,416
AND PUT THROUGH UNIMAGINABLY
RIGOROUS MILITARY TRAINING.

224
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,625
- I HAD HEARD TALE OF THIS
FROM SASUKE AS WELL, BUT...

225
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,958
( gasps )

226
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,291
I MUSTN'T.  RIGHT NOW,
I MUST TAKE THE TROOPS

227
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,916
MY LORD ENTRUSTED TO ME
AND VENTURE STRAIGHT TO SATSUMA

228
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,750
TO FOIL TOYOTOMI'S
SINISTER DESIGNS.

229
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,708
IF I CONCERNED MYSELF WITH
EVERY PERSON I CAME ACROSS...

230
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:48,125
MASTER OYAMADA,
I SHALL BE BACK IN A MOMENT.

231
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,833
- ( Ichi whimpering )

232
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:14,291
I-- I AM SO SORRY.

233
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,833
- THAT VOICE.
IT CANNOT BE.

234
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,375
- THIS--

235
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:29,125
THIS IS ALL

236
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,125
MY FAULT.

237
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,041
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

238
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,000
- Ichi: THIS CASTLE,

239
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,458
IT IS MY BROTHER'S
GRAVE MARKER.

240
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:12,125
I BEG OF YOU,
PLEASE LET HIM REST IN PEACE.

241
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,708
WHEN WE RETURN,

242
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,791
IT WILL BE ALL MY FAULT AGAIN.
