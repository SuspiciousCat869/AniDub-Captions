1
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,083
- ( gasping )

2
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,916
- ( chuckling )

3
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,458
- ( grunting )

4
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,041
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

5
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,875
- Akechi: I WISH I HAD
MORE TIME TO SAVOR IT.

6
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:53,291
BUT THE SENSATION WAS MOST
EXQUISITE, TIGER OF KAI.

7
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,166
- AKECHI MITSUHIDE!

8
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,958
- SICK FREAK.

9
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,375
YOU WILL NOT BE WALKIN'
AWAY FROM HERE.

10
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,958
- ( theme song playing )

11
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,583
- SO, YOU LIVE AFTER ALL,
ONE-EYED DRAGON.

12
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,166
DATE MASAMUNE.

13
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,291
NEVER TIME TO INDULGE
IN THE AFTERGLOW OF A KILL.

14
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,583
- HIS EYES WERE LIKE
THAT WHEN HE KILLED AZAI.

15
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,208
HE'S OUT OF HIS FREAKIN' MIND.

16
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,416
- ( horse neighing )

17
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,458
- BIG BOSS!
BOSS KATAKURA!

18
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,666
- ( grunting )

19
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,541
- QUICKLY, MOVE DOWNSTREAM
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.

20
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,000
- SIR!

21
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,041
- KOJURO, WE AIN'T
HOLDIN' BACK THIS TIME.

22
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,000
- GOT IT. LET'S PUT
THIS RABID DOG DOWN.

23
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,000
- ( both scream )

24
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,250
- DEATH FANG!

25
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,000
- ( Akechi chuckles )

26
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,791
MAGNIFICENT!

27
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,125
I DOUBT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY
FORTUNATE ENOUGH,

28
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,625
TO TASTE THE SWORDS OF BOTH
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON

29
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,625
AND HIS RIGHT EYE.

30
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,750
- AH, SHIT!

31
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,875
- I'VE JUST ENJOYED A TREAT
CALLED THE TIGER OF KAI,

32
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,708
AND OVEREATING IS NOT HEALTHY.

33
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,958
PLUS, YOU STILL HAVE A MOST
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY.

34
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,583
- I HAVE A WHAT?

35
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,041
- ( Akechi chuckling )

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,458
- ( Sarutobi groaning )

37
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,666
I THINK THAT WAS MY BAD.
HEY, YOU OKAY?

38
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,000
NO, DON'T TELL ME.

39
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,458
- MY LORD HAS BEEN...

40
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,666
THOUGH HE MANAGED TO
NARROWLY ESCAPE DEATH,

41
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,083
HE CAN NO LONGER TAKE
TO THE BATTLEFIELD.

42
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,208
- GO TO KAI.

43
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,375
- MY LORD, I COULD NOT POSSIBLY
LEAVE YOUR SIDE NOW.

44
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,833
- THE TIGER OF KAI
MAY BE IN DANGER.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,375
MAKE HASTE. GO AND WARN THEM.

46
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,458
- MY LORD KENSHIN.

47
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,083
- ODA'S VISION,
AS HE WOULD HAVE IT,

48
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,166
A WORLD UNDER WARRIOR RULE.

49
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,500
WE CANNOT PERMIT SUCH
HOPELESS DARKNESS.

50
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,666
ONLY YOU CAN CARRY THIS
MESSAGE IN TIME.

51
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,000
MY FATE IS UNCERTAIN,
BUT BY NO MEANS,

52
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,458
WOULD I EVER...

53
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,625
- ( crying )

54
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,416
- I AM COUNTING ON YOU,
AS ALWAYS,

55
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,541
MY MOST BEAUTIFUL BLADE.

56
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,250
- MY LORD KENSHIN.

57
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,000
- THE MEN I'D SENT TO ECHIGO,

58
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,250
I FOUND SLAUGHTERED
AT THE KOZUKE BORDER.

59
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,250
I'M SORRY.

60
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,583
THE TAKEDA CREST I GAVE
THEM PROVED A DETRIMENT...

61
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,291
- IT WAS ME! I FAILED TO
SEE THROUGH HER DISGUISE!

62
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,666
IT WAS MY FAULT.

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,166
I DIDN'T PROTECT HIM!

64
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,250
YOUR LORD IS IN DANGER AS
WELL. YOU SHOULD GET BACK.

65
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,958
- YEAH WELL, HE'S GOT DATE,

66
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,958
KATAKURA AND MASTER
SANADA LOOKIN' AFTER HIM.

67
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,958
I THINK HE'LL BE JUST FINE.

68
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,416
BUT THEN, YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW.

69
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,625
- I HAVE DELIVERED THE MESSAGE.

70
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,125
- KASUGA! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

71
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,583
- WHERE DO YOU THINK I'M GOING?

72
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,833
I AM RETURNING TO ECHIGO.

73
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,333
- AND YOU'RE SURE THAT
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING

74
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,416
SOME IDIOTIC SOLO MISSION?

75
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,125
FORGET ABOUT IT!

76
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,291
WHEN YOU LET YOUR PERSONAL
FEELINGS SWAY YOUR ACTIONS,

77
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,666
YOU STOP BEING A NINJA.

78
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,500
YOU'LL GET YOURSELF
KILLED FOR NOTHING.

79
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,208
- I WILL NOT FAIL A SECOND TIME!

80
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,541
- ODA IS NO JOKE.

81
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,500
IN THE STATE OF
MIND YOU'RE IN,

82
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,291
YOU WON'T EVEN MAKE IT
PAST THE OWARI BORDER,

83
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,083
MUCH LESS GET CLOSE TO HIM.

84
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,583
- I AM MY LORD'S BLADE.
FOR HIM, I WILL TAKE NOBUNAGA.

85
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,333
AND THE ENTIRE ODA FACTION!

86
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,791
IF I AM TO DIE, SO BE IT!

87
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,291
- BUT BEFORE I DO, I SWEAR...
- ( slapping )

88
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,791
- THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS?
KASUGA, THINK.

89
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:04,500
THIS MAN YOU HOLD SO DEAR IN
YOUR HEART, HE WANTS REVENGE?

90
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,250
HE WOULD SEND YOU OFF
TO YOUR DEATH?

91
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,416
- BUT, I DID STILL FAIL HIM,

92
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,500
WHEN I SWORE THAT I WOULD
PROTECT HIM WITH MY LIFE.

93
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,791
( sobs ) WHY?

94
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,041
WHY DID HE SAVE
SOMEONE LIKE ME?

95
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,958
- SHAME SO GREAT,
YOU WANNA DIE.

96
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,916
HAPPINESS SO GREAT,
YOU COULD DIE.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,041
IN A SENSE, THINGS
DON'T GET MUCH WORSE.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,375
JUST DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

99
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,375
- WHAT IS THIS?

100
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,250
- WHEN YOU'RE IN A JAM,
USE IT, IT COULD HELP.

101
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,875
- I HAVE ENOUGH NINJA TOOLS.

102
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,541
- JUST HUMOR ME
FOR ONCE. TAKE IT.

103
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,250
- SASUKE.

104
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,708
- OVER HERE!

105
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,875
- IT IS OUR LORD! WE'VE FOUND
LORD TAKEDA! YOUR LORDSHIP!

106
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,958
- MASTER YUKIMURA IS WITH HIM!
- LOOK, MASTER YUKIMURA'S AWAKE!

107
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,416
- ( coughing )

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,500
YOUR LORDSHIP!
YOUR LORDSHIP!

109
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,500
YOUR LORDSHIP!

110
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,916
PLEASE, OPEN YOUR EYES!
LISTEN TO ME!

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,541
YOUR LORDSHIP!
DON'T DO THIS TO ME!

112
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,958
( screams ) YOUR LORDSHIP!

113
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,000
- ( thunder rumbling )

114
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,958
- I WELCOME YOU BACK,
MY LORD BROTHER.

115
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,708
- ICHI, I AM CURIOUS.

116
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,833
HOW LONG DO YOU
INTEND TO REMAIN HERE

117
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,458
WITHOUT SERVING IN ANY CAPACITY?

118
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,750
- MY APOLOGIES.

119
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,416
- YOU ARE A SIMPERING FOOL
WHO KNOWS ONLY HOW TO

120
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,666
APOLOGIZE AND LAMENT.

121
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,166
- MY LORD BROTHER.

122
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,583
NOBUNAGA. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

123
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,625
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.

124
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,333
IF YOU KILL EVERYONE,
AND BURN EVERYTHING DOWN,

125
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,916
IF YOU UTTERLY DESTROY
ALL THERE IS,

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,083
THERE WILL BE NOTHING
LEFT FOR YOU TO RULE.

127
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,166
ONCE YOU BLANKET THE
WORLD IN DARKNESS, TELL ME,

128
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,625
LORD BROTHER, WHAT THEN?

129
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,666
- ( gasps )

130
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,708
- MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL TO ME,

131
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,625
OR DIE HERE AND NOW.

132
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,916
THE CHOICE IS YOURS TO MAKE.

133
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:12,083
- ( chuckles ) YOU ARE
A TRULY HEARTLESS MAN.

134
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,250
I FIND IT ENTHRALLING,
AS ALWAYS, LORD NOBUNAGA.

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,125
- MITSUHIDE.

136
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,208
- YOUR GRAND CAMPAIGN IN
KYUSHU SHOWED THE WORLD ANEW,

137
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,333
WHY YOU ARE CALLED
THE DEVIL KING.

138
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,000
I WISH I COULD HAVE
ACCOMPANIED YOU AS WELL.

139
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,583
WIPING OUT YOUR OPPONENTS
TO THE LAST MAN,

140
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,458
EVEN AFTER THEY
HAD SURRENDERED.

141
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,750
STRIKING DOWN FLEEING WOMEN
AND CHILDREN WITHOUT MERCY,

142
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,458
LEAVING NOT EVEN
AN INSECT ALIVE.

143
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,791
THE ONLY THING LEFT
STIRRING WAS THE ASH

144
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,541
DANCING IN THE
DEATH-SCENTED BREEZE.

145
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,666
AND NOW, EVEN IN YOUR DEALINGS
WITH YOUR BLOOD SISTER,

146
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,875
NOT A SHRED OF
COMPASSION TO BE SEEN.

147
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,625
I CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL A MOST
PROFOUND ADMIRATION, MY LORD.

148
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,333
- FLATTERY DOES NOT SUIT YOU.
- MY LORD.

149
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,000
- TELL ME ABOUT THE WORK
YOU HAVE BEEN DOING.

150
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,708
- SIR.

151
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,708
I PURGED TOKUGAWA
IEYASU OF MIKAWA

152
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,541
FOR BREAKING THE ALLIANCE.

153
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,166
AFTER WHICH I
INVADED ENEMY SOIL

154
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,041
AND KILLED THE TIGER OF KAI,
TAKEDA SHINGEN,

155
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,958
WHO LED GENERALS
OF VARIOUS LANDS,

156
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,250
IN AN ATTEMPT TO SURROUND US.

157
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,916
FURTHERMORE,
I IMAGINE BY NOW,

158
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,083
KICHO AND RANMARU HAVE SUCCEEDED

159
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,833
IN SLAYING UESUGI OF ETCHIGO.

160
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,875
HAVING LOST THEIR GENERALS
AND WITH THEIR WILL

161
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,125
TO FIGHT CRIPPLED,
THOSE REMAINING ARE

162
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:27,375
IN NO POSITION TO HAVE
ALLIES IN OTHER LANDS.

163
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,250
NOR IS THERE A
GENERAL LEFT ALIVE,

164
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,500
CAPABLE OF UNITING
AND LEADING THEM.

165
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,583
- THE ONE-EYED DRAGON, DATE.

166
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,458
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON
STILL REMAINS.

167
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,916
- TRUE. THOUGH INJURED
AT NAGASHINO,

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,166
DATE MASAMUNE SOUGHT
TEMPORARY SHELTER

169
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,708
WITH TAKEDA AND IS STILL ALIVE.

170
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,166
BUT IN THE END,

171
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,875
HE IS A YOUNG WARRIOR
WITH NOTHING BUT HIS DRIVE.

172
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,291
AND HE IS STILL BED-RIDDEN,

173
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,166
RECOVERING FROM
HIS BULLET WOUND.

174
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,708
AS SUCH, I SHALL LEAD AN ARMY
TO SUBJUGATE TAKEDA,

175
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,750
UESUGI, AND DATE SEPARATELY.

176
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,166
OSHU WILL BE THE FIRST. WITH OUR
FORCES POSITIONED IN ADVANCE,

177
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:28,166
HOWEVER, IT WILL BE A RATHER
EXHAUSTING CAMPAIGN.

178
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,583
SO I HUMBLY ASK MY LORD,

179
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,791
TO ALLOCATE AN APPROPRIATE
NUMBER OF TROOPS.

180
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,166
- VERY WELL, THEN.
YOU HAD BEST GET TO IT.

181
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,250
- MY UTMOST GRATITUDE.

182
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,208
- Sarutobi: ONE OF MY NINJAS HAS
JUST RETURNED WITH INFORMATION.

183
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,625
IT SEEMS THE DEVIL KING
IS HEADED FOR YAMASHIRO.

184
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,583
HONNOJI IS OUT OF THE WAY.

185
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,500
HE MAY BE GOING HOME BEFORE
HIS INVASION OF THE INLAND SEA.

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,375
- MOST LIKELY, IT IS A TRAP.

187
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,000
MORI AND CHOSOKABE SHOULD NOT
BE OF IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO ODA,

188
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,666
AS THEY HAVE LONG MAINTAINED
A LOCAL EQUILIBRIUM.

189
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,458
BUT WE, THE EASTERN FORCES,

190
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,583
WHO HAVE CLEARLY
DEMONSTRATED OUR HOSTILITY,

191
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,166
SHOULD BE HIS TARGET.
I IMAGINE THE DEVIL KING

192
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,708
ONLY INVADED KYUSHU
WHEN HE DID BECAUSE,

193
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,500
HE KNEW WE WERE UNABLE
TO MOBILIZE FOLLOWING

194
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,208
THE BATTLE AT NAGASHINO.

195
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,916
HOWEVER, ODA'S SURPRISE
ATTACK AGAINST THE SOUTH

196
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,666
MUST HAVE TESTED
THEIR METTLE

197
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,041
AND CERTAINLY SENT
A CLEAR MESSAGE

198
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,000
THAT THE TWO GIANTS
OF THE INLAND SEA

199
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,666
WILL INEVITABLY BE
TRAMPLED BY HIM.

200
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,708
- SO THEN, EVEN IF
THAT MAEDA VAGABOND

201
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,416
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO MAKE
ANY HEADWAY WITH THEM,

202
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,541
IT'S MOST LIKELY
ALREADY FAR TOO LATE.

203
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,833
- FOR ALL INTENTS,
THE INLAND SEA IS ODA'S NOW.

204
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,375
HE CAN SIMPLY ATTACK
THEM WHENEVER

205
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,666
IT IS CONVENIENT FOR HIM.
BUT WITH THE TIGER OF KAI

206
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,958
AND THE WAR GOD OF
ECHIGO OUT OF THE WAY,

207
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,208
THE FAR BETTER
OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM NOW,

208
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,875
WOULD BE TO WIPE US OUT.

209
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,875
- MAKES SENSE. SO, HE'S
GONE TO YAMASHIRO

210
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,416
TO SHOW HIS BACK TO US
AND LURE US ALL IN.

211
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,583
IT'S WORTH MENTIONING,

212
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,875
THE REMNANTS OF
TOKUGAWA AND AZAI'S FORCES

213
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,541
BOTH WISH TO AVENGE
THEIR LORDS.

214
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,916
THEY'RE PREPARED
TO DIE IN BATTLE,

215
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,916
LONG AS IT MEANS
A SHOT AT ODA.

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,833
THAT SENTIMENT IS BOUND
TO GROW IN THE UESUGI CAMP,

217
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,750
AND OF COURSE,
THE TAKEDA CAMP AS WELL.

218
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,791
- CRUSH EVERYONE RUSHING IN,
BENT ON REVENGE,

219
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,583
IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

220
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,375
A VALID STRATEGY, BUT

221
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,000
WHETHER THROUGH FRONTAL
ASSAULTS OR SURPRISE ATTACKS,

222
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,333
WITHOUT EXCEPTION,

223
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,916
ODA CRUSHES HIS OPPONENTS
IN A SINGLE ONSLAUGHT.

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,583
SO, WHY THIS PLOT TO ASSASSINATE
THE OTHER GENERALS?

225
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,958
- MAYBE AFTER NAGASHINO,

226
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,083
HE DECIDED OUR ALLIANCE WAS
TROUBLESOME, AFTER ALL.

227
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,666
- THAT COULD BE PART OF IT,

228
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,750
BUT MORE SO,
IN THIS METHOD I SENSE,

229
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,625
A DESIRE TO MAKE SPORT OF
WAR AND OF PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

230
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,041
MOCKING THE ASPIRATIONS OF
INNOCENTS AND TRAMPLING THEM

231
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,000
TO SEIZE THEIR LAND UNTIL
THEY HAVE NOTHING LEFT,

232
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,250
BUT THE UNQUENCHABLE
THIRST FOR REVENGE.

233
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,083
THIS OBSCENITY IS NOT
OF THE DEVIL KING.

234
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,916
- IT IS MOST LIKELY...
- Date: KOJURO!

235
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,125
I WANNA FALL INTO THEIR TRAP.

236
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,583
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT...

237
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,875
- DOESN'T MATTER WHO CAME
UP WITH THEIR CRAPPY PLAN.

238
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,500
EVEN IF IT WAS THAT SON OF A
BITCH AKECHI, ODA WILL BE THERE.

239
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,666
I GET WHAT THAT
BASTARD MEANT NOW.

240
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,333
I'VE BEEN CHOSEN AS THE
SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE FORCE

241
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,583
HE PLANS TO DEFEAT
IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

242
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,666
SCREW THAT!

243
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,041
HE'S PLAYED ME FOR A FOOL
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

244
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,083
AKECHI ONCE HELD THE POWER
OF LIFE AND DEATH OVER ME.

245
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,916
I GOTTA MAKE HIM
PAY FOR THAT, TOO.

246
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,958
- MASAMUNE! ODA WILL
SOON LOSE PATIENCE,

247
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,708
AND START ATTACKING
US SEPARATELY.

248
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,208
WE NEED THIS TIME TO FULLY
PREPARE OURSELVES.

249
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,083
IF WE DO SO, DEPENDING
ON THE SUCCESS OF MAEDA KEIJI

250
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,916
AT THE INLAND SEA, WE MAY
BE ABLE TO ENCIRCLE ODA.

251
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,875
- ODA ALREADY KNOWS WHAT TAKEDA

252
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,791
AND THE MONKEY
BOY WERE PLOTTING,

253
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,791
SO IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A PLAN NOW.

254
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,083
THROWING AWAY MEN TO
ENCIRCLE AN ENEMY

255
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,250
WHO'S ONTO WHAT WE'RE DOING,
AIN'T GONNA GET US ANYWHERE.

256
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,791
- BUT OUR OPPONENT
IS TOO GREAT

257
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,291
TO JUST RUSH HEADLONG
INTO THEIR MIDST.

258
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,833
WE MUST BE CAUTIOUS.

259
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,916
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, KOJURO?
THIS IS HOW WE'VE ALWAYS ROLLED,

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,083
SINCE BEFORE WE TOOK
CONTROL OF OSHU.

261
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,291
LISTEN, I'M GETTING THE FEELING

262
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,708
YOU THINK YOU ARE
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE,

263
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,416
FOR THE BULLET I TOOK
IN MY GUT AT NAGASHINO.

264
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,958
BUT WHAT YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF
GUARDING IS MY BACK. GOT IT?

265
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,250
- MASAMUNE, YOU'RE NOT...

266
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,333
- SO, SANADA YUKIMURA,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

267
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,625
FIGURED YOU'D
BE THE FIRST ONE

268
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,125
TO GO CHARGING OUT
THERE SPEARS SWINGIN'.

269
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,708
- YOUR LORDSHIP, I...
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

270
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,250
WHEN AKECHI MITSUHIDE
LAUNCHED HIS SURPRISE ATTACK,

271
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,958
- I WAS UNABLE TO...
- MASTER SANADA,

272
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,041
THE ENEMY WILL ALWAYS COME
AFTER WHAT YOU CHERISH MOST.

273
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,875
THAT'S HOW THE TAKEDA
AND THE DATE, BOTH,

274
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,833
HAVE RISEN TO POWER IN
THESE TURBULENT TIMES.

275
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,875
IT GOES BOTH WAYS.
YOU MUST KNOW THAT.

276
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,041
- I HAVE NEVER
STRUCK DOWN A FOE,

277
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,791
EXCEPT ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE.

278
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,333
NOR HAVE I EVER CONSIDERED
ACTIONS THAT WOULD INVOLVE

279
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,666
UNARMED COMMONERS.

280
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,416
- THEN GET ANGRY ABOUT IT!

281
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
OR DO YOU PLAN TO JUST HANG
YOUR HEAD BY OUR LORD'S BEDSIDE

282
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,041
AND WAIT FOR ODA
TO CRUSH US?

283
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,083
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO FEELS LIKE DOING SOMETHING?

284
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,500
- I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM
SUPPOSED TO DO. I FEEL HELPLESS.

285
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,875
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SCARED.

286
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,416
- ( thunder rumbling )

287
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,125
- I ALMOST ENVY THE GUY.

288
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,083
- HEY, BOSS-MAN!
- WE PREPPIN' FOR BATTLE?

289
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,375
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

290
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,916
- IT'S ALL OVER,
BOYS, BREAK IT UP.

291
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
AS OF THIS MOMENT, THE DATE
ARMY OF OSHU IS NO MORE!

292
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,125
- ( all gasping)

293
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,208
- LORD MASAMUNE?

294
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,416
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
ONE-EYED DRAGON?

295
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,875
- TO HONNOJI,
WHERE DO YOU THINK?

296
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,416
AND I SWEAR I'M NOT GONNA REST

297
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,875
UNTIL I TAKE THE DEVIL
KING'S HEAD MYSELF.

298
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,208
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
- BUT, BIG BOSS.

299
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,583
- WE'LL COME WITH YOU.

300
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,833
- SORRY, BOYS, THIS JUST
AIN'T THAT KINDA PARTY.

301
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:57,958
- BIG BOSS, WHY?

302
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,083
- LORD MASAMUNE.

303
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THESE MEN LIVE FOR YOUR SAKE.

304
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,375
THEY SWORE THEY WOULD NOT
DIE, UNTIL THEY HAD SEIZED

305
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,708
THE LAND WITH YOU.

306
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,541
EVEN WHEN THEY WERE
BURIED UNDER THAT TEMPLE,

307
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,250
THEY SURVIVED BY SHEER FORCE
OF WILL. THEY ARE INVALUABLE.

308
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,041
- OH, SO THAT'S THE
ARGUMENT YOU'RE GOING WITH?

309
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,166
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S WILLIN'
TO GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT.

310
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,208
THESE COINS YOU WEAR, GUESS
THEY'RE JUST FOR DECORATION.

311
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,875
READY PAYMENT TO CROSS
THE RIVER OF HELL.

312
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,750
FIRST TIME I MET YOU, THAT'S
WHAT I FIGURED THESE MEANT.

313
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,833
BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
I GUESS I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU.

314
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,458
- BIG BOSS!

315
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,291
- Katakura: LET HIM GO!

316
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,666
- BOSS KATAKURA.

317
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,541
- THIS IS MASAMUNE'S DECISION.

318
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,750
ODA HAS COME AT US WITH
MURDER AND CHEAP TRICKS.

319
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,250
A FAR CRY FROM HOW WARRIORS
ARE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT.

320
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,500
HE HAS MADE A MOCKERY
OF THE PRIDE AND DIGNITY

321
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,375
OF ALL GENERALS EVERYWHERE.

322
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,166
AND AS A GENERAL, HE CAN
NO LONGER LET THE DEVIL KING

323
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,000
AND HIS HENCHMEN
GET AWAY WITH IT.

324
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,500
- BUT HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO GO ALONE.

325
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,166
- YOUR THOUGHTS,
SANADA YUKIMURA?

326
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,000
- NEEDLESS TO SAY, I SHARE
IN LORD DATE'S SENTIMENTS.

327
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,291
BUT FOR ME, PERSONALLY,

328
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,125
MY LORD MEANS
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

329
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:15,291
A FUTURE WITHOUT HIS LORDSHIP,
IT HOLDS NO MEANING FOR ME.

330
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,291
IF I WERE TO LEAVE
HIS SIDE NOW,

331
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,000
AND WHILE I AM GONE,
IF THE WORST SHOULD HAPPEN...

332
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,166
- Katakura: YOU SHOULD NOT
UNDERESTIMATE THE TIGER OF KAI.

333
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,291
FORGIVE ME, LORD.

334
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,500
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN AT TAKEDA'S SIDE?

335
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,708
HE WOULD NEVER SUCCUMB
TO AN INJURY SUCH AS THIS.

336
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,333
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN ANYONE,

337
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,166
SANADA YUKIMURA.

338
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,291
- YOUR LORDSHIP.

339
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,625
YOUR LORDSHIP!

340
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,125
ONE-EYED DRAGON,
WAIT FOR ME!

341
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,208
I SHALL KEEP YOU
COMPANY, MY LORD.

342
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,083
- ALL RIGHT.

343
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,541
- ( grunting )

344
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:35,375
- SANADA YUKIMOORA,
TIME TO BARE YOUR FANGS.

345
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,250
YOU'VE HONED 'EM WITH
THE TIGER OF KAI,

346
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,416
NOW SINK 'EM INTO THE
THROATS OF YOUR FOES.

347
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,916
- MY FANGS ARE SHARP. THEY
ARE THE KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM

348
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,708
OF MY LORD'S TEACHINGS
HELD STRONG IN MY HEART.

349
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,333
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

350
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,458
IT'S THE LAST PARTY,
AND IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

351
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,250
LET'S GO ENJOY OURSELVES.

352
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,041
- I COULD ASK NO MORE.

353
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,875
WITHOUT FAIL, TOGETHER,

354
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,375
YOU AND I WILL TAKE
THE DEVIL KING'S HEAD.

355
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,833
- Both: THE ENEMY,
IS AT HONNOJI!

356
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,166
- ( theme song playing )

357
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:55,041
- Akechi: ( chuckles ) I HAVE
BEEN LONGING FOR THIS MOMENT.

358
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,958
FINALLY, I WILL BE ABLE TO
THOROUGHLY SAVOR THE SIGHT

359
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,916
OF YOU SCREAMING AND
BEGGING FOR YOUR LIFE

360
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,208
I CAN HARDLY WAIT UNTIL
NEXT TIME, LORD NOBUNAGA.
