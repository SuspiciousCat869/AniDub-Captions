1
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,875
- ( bird squawking )

2
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,250
- DO I BIDE MY TIME?
OR GO ON THE OFFENSIVE?

3
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,666
IT'S HIGH TIME
I FOUND MY RESOLVE ANYWAY.

4
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,875
- Bekunosuke: CAPTAIN!

5
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,375
- Shige: THERE'S TROUBLE!

6
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,000
- SHIGE, BEKUNOSUKE. WHAT'S UP?

7
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,666
- A REPORT FROM ZENNOJI.

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,458
- A BOAT CARRYING
TWO STRANGERS WAS SPOTTED.

9
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,000
AND THEY'VE JUST COME ASHORE.

10
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,416
- A PLEASURE TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,291
I AM THE PROTECTOR OF KAGA,
MAEDA MATAZAEMON TOSHIIE.

12
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:22,083
I OFFER YOU MY GRATITUDE IN
GRANTING US THIS AUDIENCE TODAY.

13
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:26,125
- AND I AM LORD TOSHIIE'S WIFE,
I AM KNOWN AS MATSU.

14
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,083
- I'M CHOSOKABE MOTOCHIKA.

15
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,333
CAN'T SAY I'M HAPPY
TO SEE YOU HERE.

16
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,458
SORRY, THAT'S RUDE OF ME.

17
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,000
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE HERE TO MAKE WAR.

18
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,333
SO, WHAT CAN THE OGRE OF
THE WESTERN SEA DO FOR YOU?

19
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,666
WHAT BRINGS YOU TWO
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

20
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,666
- A MESSAGE,

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,583
WE ASK THAT YOU CEDE
SANUKI AND IYO.

22
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,000
- ( men gasp )

23
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,458
- OUR LORD ODA NOBUNAGA,
WHOM WE SERVE,

24
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:56,125
STATES THAT IF YOU WILL FORGO
ALL LANDS SAVE FOR TOSA AND AWA,

25
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,375
HE WILL GUARANTEE THE SECURITY
OF YOUR REMAINING HOLDINGS.

26
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,958
- ( men grunting )

27
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,458
- PIPE DOWN, YOU DOGS!

28
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,416
- ( scoffs ) HE EXPECTS
ME TO JUST HAND OVER

29
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
MY INLAND COASTLINE?

30
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,875
HE TALKS LIKE HE'S
ALREADY BECOME

31
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,666
SUPREME RULER OF THIS WORLD.

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,541
HEY, I GOT A MESSAGE
YOU CAN TAKE BACK TO HIM.

33
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,666
"WATCH YOUR BACK, DEVIL KING,
OR YOU MAY FIND A BLADE IN IT".

34
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,416
- LORD CHOSOKABE,
OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA,

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,166
THIS IS TO PREVENT
THE WHOLE OF SHIKOKU

36
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,791
FROM BEING RAZED TO THE GROUND.

37
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,166
I BEG OF YOU, PLEASE ACQUIESCE.

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,458
- WHAT IF I SAY NO?

39
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,916
- MATSU!

40
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,125
WE WERE PREPARED
FOR THAT ANSWER.

41
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,958
LORD CHOSOKABE, I ASK THAT
YOU HONOR ME WITH A DUEL,

42
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,791
UPON WHICH...

43
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,208
- ( scoffs )

44
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,208
I'VE HEARD MANY TALES OF YOU,
MATAZA OF THE SPEAR.

45
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,666
AND I'VE LONG WISHED
FOR A CHANCE TO FACE YOU.

46
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,708
BUT LET'S HOLD UP A SEC.

47
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,333
LIFE CAN BE A REAL BITCH WHEN
YOU CHOOSE THE WRONG MASTER.

48
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,875
IT'S TRUE IN ANY ERA,

49
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,458
AND WHETHER YOU'RE
ON LAND OR AT SEA.

50
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,833
EVERY ORDER IS TO BURN
THIS OR MASSACRE THAT.

51
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,500
ACTS OF INJUSTICE
THAT BETRAY YOUR MORAL COMPASS.

52
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,000
UNTIL YOU CAN NO LONGER BEAR IT.

53
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,541
YOU PETITION THE DEVIL KING,

54
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,750
AND HE RESPONDS
WITH AN ULTIMATUM.

55
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,958
WIN ME OVER,
THE MAN WHO CONQUERED SHIKOKU,

56
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,708
OR HE WILL DESTROY KAGA
IF YOU FAIL.

57
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,333
THAT PRETTY CLOSE?

58
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:35,708
MY SCOUTS TOLD ME OF
HOW HE TREATED POOR AZAI OF OMI.

59
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,208
- Toshiie: OUR PLIGHT WAS
THAT TRANSPARENT?

60
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,583
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

61
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,541
I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL LOVED
BY YOUR GOOD PEOPLE.

62
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,708
YOUR WIFE'S GOT
A LOT OF NERVE, THOUGH.

63
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,000
JUST LIKE THAT BASTARD
SAID SHE WOULD.

64
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,333
- WHAT BASTARD?

65
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,625
- ( sneezing )

66
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,666
( coughs )

67
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,875
- ( gasps )

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,333
- Man 1: LORD MORI.

69
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,750
- Man 2: WE WOULD NEVER EXPECT
YOU MIGHT COME IN PERSON

70
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,750
TO SUCH A PLACE.

71
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,291
- Mori: STAND DOWN
FOR THE MOMENT.

72
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,333
- Men: MY LORD.

73
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,666
- ( monkey screeching )

74
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,916
- OH, GOOD WORK, BOY.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,875
- THE NEXT TIME YOU ALLOW THAT
FILTHY THING NEAR MY PERSON,

76
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,208
I WILL CUT IT DOWN
WITHOUT HESITATION.

77
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,958
- YOU'RE STARTING TO THINK
MY PLAN'S NOT SUCH A CRAZY IDEA,

78
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,375
AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAME
DOWN HERE WITH YUMEKICHI.

79
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,166
IS THAT WHAT YOU CAME TO SAY,
MORI, MY MAN?

80
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,083
- BEFORE YOU QUESTION ME,
TELL ME WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

81
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,541
- WE'VE ALREADY BEEN
THROUGH ALL THIS. MY NAME IS...

82
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,875
- IF YOU ARE THE VAGABOND
OF THE MAEDA,

83
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,208
YOU WOULD NEVER ASK
THE CHOSOKABE AND THE MORI

84
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,083
TO COLLUDE IN AN
ALLIANCE AGAINST ODA.

85
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,250
AS A MEMBER OF
THE MAEDA FAMILY OF KAGA,

86
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,083
WHICH SERVES ODA,
IT SIMPLY MAKES NO SENSE.

87
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,291
- THAT'S WHERE, YOU KNOW,

88
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,583
I'M DOING WHAT
I THINK IS FOR THE BEST.

89
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,500
- RIGHT, LITTLE BUDDY?
- ( monkey screeching )

90
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,791
- SO YOU ONLY HAVE THE MONKEY
TO VOUCH FOR YOU.

91
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,416
IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR HEAD...

92
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,791
- NEVER MIND THAT,
THOSE SPIES YOU SENT TO SHIKOKU,

93
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,375
THEY HAVEN'T RETURNED YET,
HAVE THEY?

94
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,833
CHOSOKABE HAS THEM.

95
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,708
I CAUGHT THEM MYSELF
AND GAVE THEM TO HIM AS A GIFT.

96
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,625
YEAH, OKAY, I'M NOT SURE
I'D BELIEVE ME EITHER.

97
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,166
- ( Chosokabe grunts )

98
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,375
- ( Keiji grunts )

99
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,583
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG,

100
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,583
LIKE YOU, HE WAS NO PUSHOVER,

101
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,958
BUT ONCE I MANAGED
TO DUEL HIM TO A DRAW,

102
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,375
HE FINALLY GAVE ME THE CHANCE
TO SIT DOWN AND TALK.

103
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,708
- ( Chosokabe scoffs )

104
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,708
- THE OGRE OF THE
WESTERN SEA IS ON BOARD.

105
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,333
THE NEXT MOVE IS UP TO YOU.

106
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,333
WHETHER I AM WHO I SAY
ISN'T THE ISSUE.

107
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,250
THE POINT IS
TO GET YOU TWO TO AGREE

108
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,958
TO JUST ONE MEETING
WITHOUT TRADING BLOWS.

109
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,791
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

110
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,791
FORTUNATELY, AFTER
BEING HELD HERE,

111
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,291
I'VE DISCOVERED CHOSOKABE'S
SPIES ARE, WELL, SAFE.

112
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,833
WHICH IS GREAT.

113
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,500
YOU CAN EXCHANGE YOUR HOSTAGES
ON THE INLAND SEA OF SETO.

114
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,708
AND WHILE YOU'RE BOTH THERE,

115
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,000
YOU CAN DISCUSS JOINING
FORCES AGAINST ODA.

116
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,791
- Mori: AND YOU THINK
I WOULD AGREE TO THAT?

117
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,666
- ( sighs )

118
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,791
I'M KINDA GONNA MAKE YOU.

119
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,208
- REALLY?

120
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,875
- IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
WHAT YOU SET OUT TO DO,

121
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,000
BUT HAVING
TURNED THE TABLES

122
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,666
ON EVERY FOE WHO'S
TRIED TO INVADE AKI,

123
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,416
YOU NOW FIND
YOURSELF THE RULER

124
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,000
OF THE ENTIRE
SURROUNDING REGION.

125
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,541
UNTIL RECENTLY,

126
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,708
YOU PRETTY MUCH JUST HAD TO
KEEP YOUR EYE ON CHOSOKABE,

127
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,250
WHO CONQUERED ALL OF SHIKOKU.

128
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,625
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE
AT THE POINT WHERE

129
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,625
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE INVASION
BY THE DEVIL KING,

130
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,000
YOU'RE PLOTTING
TO GET YOUR HANDS

131
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,166
ON THE NEW WEAPON
CHOSOKABE'S SUPPOSEDLY MAKING.

132
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,125
MOTOCHIKA HAS EMBRACED
THE CRAFTSMANSHIP

133
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,708
OF MECHANICAL WEAPONRY.

134
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:40,458
AND THE FLOATING FORTRESS FUGAKU
IS REALLY THE PINNACLE OF THAT.

135
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,583
IN THE FIGHT FOR SUPREMACY
OVER THE INLAND SEA OF SETO,

136
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,750
IT'S AN ABOMINATION THAT
THREATENS THE BALANCE OF POWER.

137
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,958
SO, OBVIOUSLY, I CAN
ONLY ASSUME YOU WERE

138
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,375
PLANNING ON DESTROYING
IT OR STEALING IT.

139
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,041
TOO BAD FOR YOU,
IT'S ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED,

140
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,791
AND IS SET TO SAIL
FOR AKI AT ANY TIME.

141
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,125
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?

142
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,083
- I'M DYING IF I'M LYING, RIGHT?

143
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,041
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.

144
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,416
THE MAIN CANNON
ON THIS THING IS JUST HUGE!

145
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,958
FOR REAL! IT'S A MONSTROSITY,

146
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,875
LIKE SOME GIGANTIC
ARMORED SEA TURTLE.

147
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,916
- YOU ARE CERTAIN
CHOSOKABE AND HIS PIRATES

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,166
WILL BE APPEARING
ABOARD THIS FUGAKU?

149
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,833
- YEAH. MOTOCHIKA IS A PIRATE
WHO KEEPS TO HIS WORD,

150
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,458
AND HE'S GUARANTEEING
THE SAFETY OF YOUR MEN.

151
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,916
BUT IF YOU DON'T MEET HIM
OUT THERE ON THE OPEN SEA,

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,750
HE'LL THINK I'M TRYING
TO DOUBLE CROSS HIM

153
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,500
AND I'LL END UP FODDER
FOR HIS GIGANTIC CANNON.

154
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,000
- OF ALL THINGS, YOU ARE USING
STRATEGY TO FORCE MY COMPLIANCE.

155
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,041
- ( scoffs )

156
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,125
- VERY WELL,

157
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,083
I SHALL AGREE, AT LEAST,
TO EXCHANGE OUR PRECIOUS MEN.

158
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,125
- ( scoffs )

159
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,583
- ENCIRCLE ODA?

160
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,083
- Matsu: OUR KEIJI?
ARE YOU SURE?

161
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,625
- OH, YES. BY THIS POINT,

162
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,208
HE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIS WAY
TO THE HEART OF MORI'S CAMP.

163
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,500
THE MEN I SENT TO OBSERVE ENEMY
MOVEMENTS HAVEN'T RETURNED,

164
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,000
AND I HAVE MORI'S SPIES THAT
KEIJI BROUGHT ME AS A GIFT.

165
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,333
PLAN IS TO EXCHANGE
HOSTAGES AT SEA,

166
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,708
THEN CALL A BRIEF TRUCE

167
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,000
AND JOIN FORCES
TO KNOCK OUT THE DEVIL KING.

168
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,583
- HE'S OUT OF HIS MIND!

169
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,333
- I HAVE HEARD LORD MORI
MOTONARI IS NOT A GENERAL

170
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,750
WHO INVADES OTHER LANDS
ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE.

171
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,333
- TO WALK INTO HIS
CAMP AND URGE HIM

172
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,833
TO TAKE UP ARMS
AGAINST ODA IS...

173
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,375
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

174
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,125
KEIJI'S GOT HIS WORK CUT OUT
IF HE WANTS TO WIN HIM OVER.

175
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,208
BUT IF THE REST OF KYUSHU
FALLS THE SAME WAY

176
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,375
THAT OLD GOAT SHIMAZU WENT DOWN,

177
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,666
EVEN MORI WILL HAVE TO
GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT,

178
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,708
BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG,

179
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,833
I'D RATHER NOT JOIN
FORCES EITHER,

180
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,458
BUT, GIVEN THE SITUATION,
I WILL DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

181
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:41,041
SO, THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOU
TO FIND YOUR RESOLVE, AS WELL.

182
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,916
KEIJI HATCHED THIS
OUTRAGEOUS PLAN,

183
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,375
AND THE ONLY REASON HE'S
EVEN TRYING TO PULL IT OFF

184
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,541
IS FOR YOUR SAKE, FOR THE
HONOR OF THE MAEDA.

185
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,541
- Matsu: AND HERE I THOUGHT
HE SPENT ALL THIS TIME

186
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,833
PLAYING AROUND.

187
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,833
- Toshiie: WE DO SERVE
LORD NOBUNAGA.

188
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,041
IT'S NO SURPRISE
HE COULDN'T TELL US.

189
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,666
- Matsu: WHY DO
I GET THE FEELING

190
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,833
YOU KNEW WHAT HE WAS PLANNING?

191
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,125
- THAT'S JUST
THE KIND OF MAN KEIJI IS.

192
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,458
BESIDES, EVEN IF CHOSOKABE
HAD AGREED TO CEDE HIS LANDS,

193
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,458
ODA WOULD HAVE SIMPLY USED
IYO AND SANUKI AS A FOOTHOLD

194
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,166
TO CONQUER THE REST OF THE LANDS
ON THE INLAND SEA.

195
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,583
- PERHAPS.

196
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,208
NO, I'M FOOLING MYSELF.
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

197
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,916
I, MATSU, HAVE FOUND MY RESOLVE.

198
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,250
- WHAT IS THAT?

199
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,708
- I WROTE THIS
BEFORE WE LEFT KAGA,

200
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,416
FOR LORD NOBUNAGA,

201
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,750
TO RELATE OUR INTENT
TO SECEDE FROM ODA.

202
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:29,833
- MATSU.

203
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,166
- MY LORD INUCHIYO, HEAR ME OUT.

204
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,291
WHILE HE HAS SHOWN
US GREAT FAVOR,

205
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,458
LORD NOBUNAGA'S ACTIONS
NO LONGER CONTAIN

206
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,916
ONE SHRED OF HONOR.

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,625
- BUT I HAVE GIVEN MY WORD.

208
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,958
- THIS HAS TROUBLED
YOU FOR SOME TIME.

209
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,708
YOU WISH TO HONOR THE SANCTITY
OF ALL LIFE, EVEN OUR FOES.

210
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,500
FOR ALL MEN HAVE GIFTS
AND TALENTS THAT

211
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,208
SHOULD NOT BE SQUANDERED.

212
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,166
SO YOU SEARCH FOR ANOTHER WAY,

213
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,291
WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT THOSE
WHO MIGHT UNITE US AND LEAD US.

214
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,875
YOU SPOKE OF THIS
WITH EVERY BATTLE.

215
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,000
NOW KEIJI'S PRANK WITH THE COLD
BATHWATER MAKES SENSE.

216
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,958
HE COULDN'T STAND
SEEING YOU LIKE THAT,

217
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,041
SO HE TRIED TO LIVEN THINGS UP
IN THE HOUSE A LITTLE.

218
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:09,083
WHICH MEANS, THE REASON YOU TOLD
ME TO LET KEIJI GO AT THE TIME,

219
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,000
MUST HAVE BEEN
BECAUSE IN YOUR HEART,

220
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,708
EVEN THOUGH YOU
COULDN'T TELL HIM,

221
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,541
YOU AGREED WITH WHAT
HE WAS ABOUT TO DO.

222
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,083
- INDEED.

223
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,416
- ( bird squawking )

224
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,875
- ALL RIGHT, YOU DOGS,
IT'S THE FUGAKU'S MAIDEN VOYAGE.

225
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,750
LET'S GIVE HER ALL WE'VE GOT!

226
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,958
- Men: AYE!

227
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,875
- ( rumbling )

228
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,375
- ( cawing )

229
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,333
- ( monkey chattering
nervously )

230
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,083
- WHAT'S WRONG, BUDDY?

231
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,000
JUST HANG IN THERE
A LITTLE LONGER, YUMEKICHI,

232
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,000
AND WE'LL GET YOU GUYS
BACK TO MOTOCHIKA SOON, TOO.

233
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,750
- WE APPRECIATE IT,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

234
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,291
- Keiji: WELL, IT WAS MY BAD.

235
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,458
SORRY I BLABBED
ABOUT THE FUGAKU.

236
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,416
- Man 1: NAH, AS LONG AS
EVERYTHING WORKS OUT.

237
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,458
- Man 2: BUT THE
FUGAKU'S MAIN CANNON,

238
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,041
- IT'S STILL NOT...
- SHH!

239
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,791
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETED,

240
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,916
AS LONG AS MORI DOESN'T
CALL YOUR CAPTAIN'S BLUFF.

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,375
HEY! MORI, MY MAN.

242
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,166
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY AMBITIONS
OF CONQUERING THE WORLD?

243
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,708
- I'VE NO USE FOR THE WORLD.

244
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,916
THE SUN HOLDS MY AMBITIONS.

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,958
- OH? IS THAT RIGHT?

246
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,958
WELL, IN THAT CASE, WE NEED
YOU AS PART OF OUR ALLIANCE,

247
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,208
SINCE THE DEVIL KING HOPES
TO BLANKET THE SUN

248
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,458
WITH HIS OMINOUS CLOUD.

249
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,166
- I SAID, I WOULD THINK ON IT.

250
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,500
- ( sighs )

251
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,041
( chuckles )

252
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,875
ALL RIGHT, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

253
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,416
BUT, YOU KNOW, THESE FOLKS
SURE ACT LIKE

254
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,750
THEY'RE AT A NEVER
ENDING FUNERAL.

255
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,166
- Chosokabe: YOU DOGS GET
YOUR FILL? YOU READY TO FIGHT?

256
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,708
- Men: AYE!

257
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,291
- FATE WILL SOME DAY GRANT US
GLORIOUS BATTLE WITH MORI,

258
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,875
BUT TODAY, WE RETURN
THEIR SPIES UNHARMED,

259
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,541
WITH HONOR AND RESPECT.

260
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,625
THOUGH TREASURES
IN THIS WORLD ABOUND,

261
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,791
NONE ARE AS PRECIOUS AS THIS SEA
WE SAIL AND THE LANDS WE SOW.

262
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,958
IF THE DEVIL KING
WANTS TO BURN IT ALL,

263
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,458
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SAVE IT
BEFORE WE FIGHT OVER IT.

264
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,625
- All: AYE!

265
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,250
- BUT IT IS STILL
MORI MOTONARI WE FACE!

266
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,333
- DO NOT LET YOUR GUARDS DOWN!
- All: AYE!

267
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,625
- PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,

268
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,541
WE TAKE THE FUGAKU STRAIGHT
TO AKI AND UNLOAD.

269
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,083
AND AS THE SOLE COMMANDER
OF THE INLAND SEA OF SETO,

270
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,666
THE OGRE OF THE WESTERN
SEA WILL DEFEAT ODA!

271
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,583
- All: AYE!

272
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,875
- Mori's spy: SO, THIS IS IT!

273
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,583
LADY MATSU OF MAEDA'S
VAUNTED HOME COOKING.

274
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
- DID KEIJI SAY SOMETHING?

275
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:46,208
- YES, HE SAID, "MATSU'S COOKING
IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD."

276
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,583
- AW, BLESS THAT BOY.

277
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,125
- Mori's spy: MASTER KEIJI SAID

278
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,291
HE WANTS EVERYONE TO EAT
GOOD FOOD WITH GOOD PEOPLE,

279
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,291
TO LAUGH AND CRY AND LIVE,

280
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,166
THAT'S THE WORLD HE
WANTS TO HELP BRING ABOUT.

281
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,000
- MOTOCHIKA AND HIS MEN,

282
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,958
THEY'RE GOOD NATURED GUYS, YEAH?

283
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,833
DON'T YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE FUN
TO BE THEIR FRIENDS?

284
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,416
IF PEOPLE WOULD JUST
STOP FOR A MINUTE

285
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,833
AND GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

286
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,791
THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS
BE HURTING EACH OTHER.

287
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,916
- Mori's spy: MASTER KEIJI SAID
HE PREPARED EVERYTHING

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,041
THE WAY YOU ALWAYS DO IT,

289
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,666
BUT, UH, HE MUST NOT HAVE BEEN
PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION.

290
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,333
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE HIM.

291
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,125
- ( all laughing )

292
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,958
- ( gasps )

293
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,125
- Man: WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

294
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,000
- ( gasps )

295
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,625
- NOW THEN, YOUR MOVE.

296
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,375
- TOSHI. MATSU.

297
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,791
- KEIJI.
- KEIJI.

298
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,666
- AHOY, MAEDA KEIJI.
YOU PLAYED THIS OFF PERFECTLY.

299
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,375
HOW GOES, MORI MOTONARI?
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

300
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,291
LOOK HERE, I GOT YOUR SPIES,
SAFE AND SOUND.

301
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,958
- Mori's spy: LORD MORI!

302
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,041
- AND I HAVE SPARED
YOUR MEN'S LIVES.

303
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,708
- ( moaning ) CAPTAIN.

304
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,583
- THAT SON OF A BITCH!

305
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,458
- NOW, CHOSOKABE,
LET US BEGIN THE NEGOTIATIONS.

306
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,458
- Man: CAPTAIN.
THEY'VE GOT US SURROUNDED.

307
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:29,958
- MORI! YOU...

308
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,666
- ALL GOES ACCORDING
TO MY CALCULATIONS,

309
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,750
FORGIVE THE PUN, MAEDA KEIJI,

310
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,625
BUT YOUR MONKEY BUSINESS
WAS ALL PART OF MY PLAN.

311
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,916
- WHAT?

312
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,791
- I WAS AWARE IN ADVANCE
THAT YOU WOULD BE COMING

313
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,208
TO THE INLAND SEA OF SETO,
AND I MADE USE OF THAT.

314
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,166
- SO WE'VE BEEN DANCING
TO YOUR TUNE THIS ENTIRE TIME.

315
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,083
- THERE ARE NONE IN THIS WORLD
WHO CAN THWART MY CUNNING.

316
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,375
CHOSOKABE, LEAVE YOUR
FORTRESS FUGAKU TO ME,

317
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,916
AND FLEE HERE
WITH ALL SWIFTNESS.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,916
I AM A CHILD OF THE SUN.

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,541
IT IS UNTHINKABLE FOR ME TO
CALL A LOWLY PIRATE MY EQUAL.

320
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,458
- Keiji: LISTEN TO ME. YOU TWO
ARE FINALLY FACE TO FACE.

321
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,875
PLEASE, JUST TALK TO HIM.

322
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,791
- LORD MORI, HE IS RIGHT.

323
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,791
WE BEG OF YOU.
PLEASE JOIN IN TAKING DOWN ODA.

324
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,083
- AFTER WHICH,
WE MIGHT FIND A WAY

325
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,250
TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH CHOSOKABE.

326
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,791
- YOU ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED.

327
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,958
- ( gunshot )
- ( gasps )

328
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,000
- ( all gasping )

329
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,583
- ( yells )

330
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,833
- FOOLISHNESS.

331
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,833
MERE SPIES WOULD PRESUME
TO QUESTION MY JUDGMENT?

332
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,916
- HEY, MORI!

333
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,291
- Matsu: MASTER HASHINOSUKE!

334
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,125
OH, GOD. NO.

335
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,083
- Toshiie: WHY SUCH CRUELTY?

336
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,500
- SCALAWAG! ARE YOU INSANE?

337
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:49,000
THESE ARE MEN WHO HAVE RISKED
LIFE AND LIMB IN SERVICE OF YOU.

338
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,750
- ( grunting )

339
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,791
- ( gasps )

340
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,541
- HARUKICHI!
- SUKEROKU!

341
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,791
- Keiji: NO. HARUKICHI. SAHEITA.

342
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,250
THOSE MEN,
THEY HAD FAMILIES BACK HOME.

343
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,291
- THE FIELD OF BATTLE
IS A CHESSBOARD.

344
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,458
AND MY PAWNS ALREADY
HAVE YOU AT CHECKMATE.

345
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,666
AT THIS RANGE, YOU ARE TOO
CLOSE FOR YOUR CANNONS

346
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,250
TO TAKE AIM AT ME.

347
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,000
- DON'T DO THIS!

348
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,291
- DAMN IT, MORI, YOUR OWN MEN?

349
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,250
- PAWNS ARE MADE
TO BE SACRIFICED.

350
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,750
- LORD CHOSOKABE!
- HOLD!

351
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,375
- MOVE IT!
- MORI!

352
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,708
- KEIJI, DON'T!

353
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,291
- ( grunts )

354
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,666
- KEIJI!

355
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,875
KEIJI.

356
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,958
- ( grunts )

357
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,541
ALL RIGHT, YOU DOGS,
THIS IS FOR VENGEANCE.

358
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,458
NOW LET'S GO SHOW THEM WHAT THE
WARRIORS OF TOSA ARE MADE OF!

359
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,291
- All: AYE!

360
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,083
- ( all yelling )

361
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,958
- SEIZE THEIR FORTRESS FUGAKU.

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,416
- LET GO OF ME!
- MATSU!

363
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,125
- KEIJI'S... OH, GOD, HE'S...

364
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,958
- KNOWING HIM, HE'LL BE FINE.

365
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,291
- ( grunts )

366
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,625
- YOU CANNOT OUTWIT ME.
ACCEPT YOUR DEFEAT.

367
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,375
SO, THE MAN WITH NO BRAIN
RELIES ON HIS BRAWN.

368
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,166
THERE IS NO SHAME IN THAT.

369
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,958
THINK OF YOUR DEATH
AT MY HAND AS AN HONOR.

370
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,208
- YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME?

371
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,750
I DARE YOU. TRY IT!

372
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,708
- NONE SHALL BE ALLOWED
TO BLOT OUT THE SUN.

373
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,333
- ( grunting )

374
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,291
- ( yells )

375
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,125
- IT'S TIME TO PAY
FOR YOUR SINS, MORI.

376
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,083
YOUR SHRINE ON ITSUKUSHIMA
ISLAND WILL READ "EVIL GOD".

377
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,458
- THE INLAND SEA OF SETO
IS MINE.

378
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,333
I SHALL BE THE ONE
TO PROTECT IT.

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,625
- ( grunts )

380
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,500
- ( yelling )

381
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,875
- MAEDA. KEIJI!

382
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,541
- SO YOU SURVIVED,
DAMN MONKEY TRAINER.

383
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,583
- MOTOCHIKA, PLEASE CALM DOWN.

384
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,416
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. BUT IF
YOU LET THAT RAGE RULE YOU,

385
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,416
WE'RE RIGHT WHERE WE STARTED.

386
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,458
MORI, MY MAN, I MISJUDGED YOU.

387
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,625
YOU'RE A CRUEL BASTARD.

388
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,458
- OUT OF MY WAY, VAGABOND.

389
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,125
THIS FIGHT STARTED
LONG BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.

390
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,666
- ANY MAN WHO DARES
MOCK ME SHALL BE SLAIN

391
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,375
BY THE POWER OF THE SUN.

392
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,583
- YOU PIGHEADED MORONS!

393
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,666
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
RIGHT NOW IS TO MAKE WAR,

394
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,458
TO KEEP MORE WARS FROM
HAPPENING, ALL RIGHT?

395
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,708
IF YOU NEIGHBORS
CAN'T JOIN FORCES,

396
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,083
JUST FOR THE MOMENT,

397
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,291
THERE WILL BE NO
FUTURE TO FIGHT OVER.

398
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,833
- ( screaming )

399
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,916
( gasps )

400
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,166
- Keiji: KASUGA!

401
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,375
DON'T TELL ME. IT'S TIME.

402
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,458
- THEY'VE BEGUN
THE FINAL ASSAULT?

403
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,958
( grunts )

404
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,333
MORI, WE WILL FINISH THIS LATER.

405
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,041
- Keiji: THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE,
VERY NINJA LIKE TODAY.

406
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,083
- IS THAT DIFFERENT
FROM MY NORMAL FACE?

407
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,625
- I HEARD ABOUT POOR KENSHIN.

408
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,666
I'M SURE HE'LL...

409
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,333
- OF COURSE HE WILL.
THAT IS THE MAN HE IS.

410
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,125
- YEAH, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

411
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,250
THE POWER OF BELIEVING IS
AN INCREDIBLE THING, ISN'T IT?

412
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,875
LONG AS HE HAS YOU,
KENSHIN WILL...

413
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,208
- OH, SHUT UP.

414
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,708
SAVE YOUR SPEECHES
FOR SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY CARES.

415
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,125
- THE SEA OF SETSU, HUH?

416
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,291
THAT OUGHT TO BE
AN EASY ROW FOR MY GUYS!

417
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,666
- Mori: WE WILL HEAD
FOR AZUCHI BY LAND.

418
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,958
WHETHER OR NOT WE BECOME
INVOLVED WITH THE HOSTILITIES

419
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,541
WILL DEPEND.

420
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:17,041
AND JUST MAYBE A SURPRISE ATTACK
ON CHOSOKABE MIGHT BE IN ORDER.

421
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,333
- ( theme song playing )

422
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,666
- Man: CAPTAIN, FUGAKU'S MAIN
CANNON STILL ISN'T COMPLETE.

423
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,375
- Chosokabe: DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

424
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,708
THE EASTERN GENERALS HAVE
GOTTA BE RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS,

425
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,625
'CAUSE NOTHING THEY'VE GOT
CAN GET THROUGH AZUCHI

426
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,458
CASTLE'S WALLS.

427
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,000
JUST KEEP FIRING
AS MUCH AS SHE CAN TAKE.

428
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,208
IF THEY'RE TOO STUPID
TO DODGE A FEW CANNONBALLS,

429
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,875
THEY NEVER HAD A CHANCE AGAINST
THE DEVIL KING TO BEGIN WITH.

430
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,833
- THAT KINDA MAKES SENSE.

431
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,333
- Man: CAPTAIN,
SHE'S AT HER LIMIT.

432
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,791
- Chosokabe: ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
SHE HUNG IN LONG ENOUGH.

433
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,958
I'M SURE AT LEAST
ONE FOUND ITS MARK.

434
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,708
- Narrator: NOW, WITH THE
ADDITIONOF THE TWO GENERALS

435
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,625
OF THE INLAND SEA OF SETO,

436
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:29,750
THE LONG SOUGHT ENCIRCLEMENT
OF ODA WAS ABOUT TO BE REALIZED.

437
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,416
THOUGH WHEN THIS BATTLE ENDS,

438
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,125
THE GENERALS MAY ONCE
AGAIN CROSS SWORDS,

439
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,333
EACH OF THEM HAS A CLEAR
VISION OF THE FUTURE

440
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,500
WHICH THRIVES IN THEIR HEARTS.

441
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,958
- Keiji: THE LAST BIG FIGHT
AGAINST THE DEVIL KING.

442
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,125
THERE'S NO WAY I'M NOT
JOINING IN ON THE FUN.

443
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,958
MAEDA KEIJI,
WILL HAVE HIS WAY!
