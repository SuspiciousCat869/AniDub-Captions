1
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,625
- ( thunder rumbling )

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,250
- Ichi: I HEAR IT.

3
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,208
I FEEL IT.

4
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,250
THE SORROW,

5
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,125
THE PAIN,

6
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,875
THE HATRED, THE CURSES.

7
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,833
THESE ARE THE GIFTS
MY BROTHER HAS GIVEN,

8
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,750
AND THEY ARE ALL MY FAULT.

9
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,416
- Azai: ICHI.

10
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,750
- MY LORD NAGAMASA, HOW...

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,125
- ICHI, HOW LONG WILL
YOU SIT THERE, UNMOVING?

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,500
- MY LOVING HUSBAND,

13
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,000
YOU WOULD MOCK ME
AS MY BROTHER DOES?

14
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,208
- I AM ASKING WHY
YOU DO NOT FOLLOW

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,083
WHAT IS IN YOUR HEART, ICHI.

16
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:06,166
- MY LORD, ALL I WANT IS TO
BE AT YOUR SIDE ONCE AGAIN.

17
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,333
- IF THAT IS WHAT WILL
ASSUAGE YOUR TROUBLED SOUL,

18
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,791
TAKE THE BLADES THE DEVIL
KING LEFT YOU, END YOUR LIFE.

19
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,958
TO CEASE TO THINK
IS THE TRUE EVIL.

20
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,500
WHY DO YOU STAY HERE,

21
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:25,666
WHEN YOU KNOW THE DEVIL
KING WILL BE SO CRUEL TO YOU?

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,208
IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A FEAT
NO WARRIOR CAN ACCOMPLISH.

23
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,125
A FEAT WHICH YOU AND
ONLY YOU ARE CAPABLE OF.

24
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,500
OR AM I MISTAKEN?

25
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,458
LOOK STRAIGHT UPON THIS TASK.

26
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,083
DO NOT FLEE FROM IT.

27
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,458
HAVE FAITH THAT
HIS HUMANITY REMAINS,

28
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,583
FOR YOU ARE THE SOLE PERSON
LEFT WHO MIGHT HELP HIM FIND IT.

29
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,166
- MY LORD NAGAMASA!

30
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,041
STOP MY BROTHER.

31
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,500
I CAN DO THIS, I CAN.

32
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,500
- ( theme song playing )

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,666
- ( urging horses )

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,166
- THIS PARTY IS INVITATION
ONLY, YUKIMURA,

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,500
SO YOU BETTER BE READY
TO KICK SOME SERIOUS ASS.

36
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,125
- MY HEART BURNS BRIGHT
WITH THE PASSION OF BATTLE.

37
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,833
I SHALL FACE WHATEVER AWAITS
AT HONNOJI WITH ALL MY MIGHT.

38
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,625
- OLD MAN TAKEDA,
DON'T KICK OFF JUST YET.

39
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,500
I'M PROTECTIN' THE LAND
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT OVER,

40
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,041
BUT THAT FUN COMES LATER.

41
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,500
- YOUR LORDSHIP,

42
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,333
I INTEND TO REALIZE THE PEACEFUL
WORLD TO WHICH YOU ASPIRE,

43
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:12,083
AND TO DO SO, I HAVE THROWN
IN MY LOT WITH LORD MASAMUNE.

44
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,916
EVEN WITHOUT YOU AT MY BACK,
I ASK THAT YOU WATCH OVER ME

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,375
AS I PUT THE DEVIL
KING TO THE BLADE.

46
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,916
- THE ENEMY IS AT HONNOJI.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,166
LONG HAVE I AWAITED THIS MOMENT.

48
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,250
WITH EVERY BATTLE, MY LORD,

49
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,666
YOU HAVE COMPLETELY
DESTROYED YOUR FOE.

50
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,875
SO, I IMAGINE THERE IS MUCH
YOU HAVE YET TO KNOW OF THEM.

51
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,291
LIKE THE HATRED THOSE LEFT
BEHIND BEAR IN THEIR HEARTS.

52
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,875
PRECISELY BECAUSE YOU
ARE THE INVINCIBLE

53
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,250
AND MERCILESS DEVIL KING,

54
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,083
YOU WOULD BE OBLIVIOUS TO
THE REPRISAL FROM A FOE

55
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,083
DRIVEN BY RAGE AND
HIDDEN STRENGTH.

56
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,375
( laughs ) AM I CORRECT,
LORD NOBUNAGA?

57
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:14,208
HAVE YOU RETIRED FOR
THE DAY? OR ARE YOU MERELY

58
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,666
ENJOYING AN INTIMATE
MOMENT WITH YOUR KICHO?

59
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,125
PLEASE, MY LORD. DO INDULGE
TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT

60
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:25,500
YOUR TIME TOGETHER,
FOR THAT WILL BE YOUR CASKET.

61
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,791
- ( snoring )

62
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,666
- BIG BOSS.

63
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,458
- SO, UM...
- All: HMM.

64
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,958
- OKAY! NOW LISTEN UP, YOU...

65
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,458
- ( footsteps approaching )

66
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,125
- ON YOUR FEET, MEN,
PREPARE FOR BATTLE!

67
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,041
- ( all gasping )

68
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,041
- BOSS KATAKURA.

69
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,875
- WHAT ARE YOU ALL
STILL SITTING THERE FOR?

70
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,125
I GAVE YOU AN ORDER!

71
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,833
- YEAH. BUT, BOSS...

72
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,166
- THE BIG BOSS SAID THE
DATE ARMY WAS DISBANDED.

73
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,583
- Katakura: JUST COME WITH ME.

74
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,416
OH, COME ON, LIKE YOU WERE
NOT GONNA DO IT ANYWAYS?

75
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,583
- ( gasps ) OH.

76
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,833
- HOLY...

77
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,708
- ALL THESE MEN.
WHY ARE THEY HERE?

78
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,250
- Katakura: RIGHT ABOUT
WHEN I'D HOPED,

79
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,166
EVERYONE WHO SHOULD HAVE A
STAKE IN THIS CAME TOGETHER.

80
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,458
EVEN THOSE WHO'VE BEEN
LAYING LOW UNTIL NOW.

81
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,291
AND BOSS MASAMUNE NEVER
SAID WORD ONE ABOUT US

82
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,625
NOT BEING ALLOWED TO BAND
TOGETHER AGAIN. AM I WRONG?

83
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,125
- ( all exclaiming )

84
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,958
- YOU'RE THE BEST, BOSS!

85
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,500
- LET'S GO KICK SOME ASS!

86
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,708
- ( soldiers roaring )

87
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,333
- WE RIDE FOR HONNOJI IN
THE LAND OF YAMASHIRO.

88
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,708
WE SHALL GUARD MASAMUNE
AND SANADA'S REAR.

89
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,083
AND WE WILL ROUT ODA'S FORCES,
TO THE VERY LAST MAN!

90
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,333
- All: YEAH!

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,583
( all cheering )

92
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,000
- ( blows conch shell )

93
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,041
- THERE'S OUR TARGET,
COMING INTO VIEW NOW.

94
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,791
YOU READY FOR THIS?

95
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,666
- THOUGH A HUNDRED ARROWS COME
FLYING AT ME, I SHALL NOT STOP.

96
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,958
- GOOD, GOOD.

97
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,041
WE GOT NO BUSINESS WITH THEM.
WE'RE GOING STRAIGHT IN.

98
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,166
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN!

99
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,875
- ( gasping )

100
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,541
- Date: HERE WE GO!
- ( horse neighs )

101
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,291
- BIG BOSS OF OSHU,
DATE MASAMUNE!

102
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,583
I'M HERE FOR THE
DEVIL KING'S HEAD!

103
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:58,291
- I AM TAKEDA GENERAL,
SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA!

104
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,458
COME FORTH, ODA NOBUNAGA,

105
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,750
AND YOUR DASTARDLY
GENERALS AS WELL.

106
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,333
LET US HAVE A FAIR FIGHT.

107
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,000
- ( grunting )

108
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,416
- RAGING FLAME!

109
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,791
- ( men screaming )

110
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,583
- IF YOU AIN'T COMIN' OUT...

111
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,416
- Both: WE'RE COMING IN FOR YOU!

112
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,250
- Akechi: NO SIGN
OF ENEMY FORCES.

113
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,625
IT SEEMS UNLIKELY

114
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,291
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON WOULD STORM
IN WITH JUST KAI'S YOUNG CUB.

115
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,583
- ( horse neighs )

116
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,500
- ODA FACTION, IF YOU
CALL YOURSELVES WARRIORS,

117
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,583
COME OUT HERE AND
ACCEPT THIS CHALLENGE!

118
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,750
- ALRIGHT, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU, DEVIL KING?

119
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,166
HOW 'BOUT YOU, AKECHI?

120
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,666
- THEY ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!

121
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,333
- CRAP. WHAT IS THIS?

122
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,625
- ( bird chirping )

123
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,291
- IT IS TOO QUIET DOWN THERE.

124
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,875
( chuckles ) NOW I GET IT.

125
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,208
- AKECHI MITSUHIDE!

126
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,666
- Date: YOU'VE KEPT US
WAITING LONG ENOUGH.

127
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,916
WHERE THE HELL IS
THE DEVIL KING HIDING?

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,458
- IT WOULD SEEM

129
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,708
THAT I AM THE ONE WHO HAS
FALLEN INTO ODA'S LITTLE TRAP.

130
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,000
- HOW FITTING.
YOU'VE BEEN FORSAKEN.

131
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,833
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

132
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,708
- THE NOBUNAGA WHO
ARRIVED WAS A DECOY.

133
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,041
THE DEVIL KING
ISN'T EVEN HERE.

134
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,000
ODA NOBUNAGA
WANTS ALL OF US,

135
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,500
TO KILL EACH OTHER
HERE AT HONNOJI.

136
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,666
- ( gasps )

137
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,750
- BY NOW, I IMAGINE THINGS ARE
GOING AS MITSUHIDE EXPECTED,

138
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,333
AND THE REMNANTS OF
THE EASTERN ALLIANCE

139
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,416
HAVE BEEN LURED TO HONNOJI.

140
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,791
BECAUSE I BROUGHT DOWN
THE WAR GOD OF ECHIGO,

141
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,625
MITSUHIDE BELIEVED WE WERE
DECEIVED AND COULD BE USED.

142
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,708
EVEN IN HIS WILDEST DREAMS,
HE DID NOT SUSPECT THAT

143
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,166
HE WOULD BE SURROUNDED
AND STRUCK DOWN,

144
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,875
ALONG WITH THE ENEMY
HE DIRECTED AGAINST YOU.

145
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,416
MY LORD KAZUSANOSUKE,
I MUST THANK YOU

146
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,541
FOR ALLOWING
YOUR HUMBLE WIFE

147
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,416
TO ARRANGE THESE
MATTERS AS I SAW FIT.

148
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,208
THAT HE WOULD SEEK TO
LURE YOU INTO A TRAP.

149
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:22,166
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SATISFIED
TO SIMPLY HAVE HIM PURGED.

150
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,041
- HE IS A FILTHY MONGREL
WHO KNOWS NO GRATITUDE.

151
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,791
DISPOSE OF HIM
HOW YOU SEE FIT.

152
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,708
- KICHO, IT SEEMS I HAVE
UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

153
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:37,000
THE FEELING THAT ONE HAS MISSED
OUT ON THE FINEST FEAST,

154
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,875
IS TRULY ABYSMAL.

155
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,833
- SO YOUR PLAN WAS TO TAKE OUT
THE DEVIL KING ALONGSIDE US.

156
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,041
AND SEIZE THE
LAND FOR YOURSELF.

157
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,708
- I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN THE LAND.

158
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,541
A MAN WHO CALLS HIMSELF
DEVIL KING OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN,

159
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,583
ATTACKED BY A SWARMING
FORCE BENT ON REVENGE.

160
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,833
I WANT HIM TO SCREAM.

161
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,166
I WANT TO HEAR HIM
BEG FOR HIS LIFE.

162
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,291
AND FINALLY,
TO TAKE THAT LIFE,

163
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,125
WITH THESE HANDS!

164
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,875
- BUT HOW CAN THIS BE?

165
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,333
WHAT KIND OF GENERAL WOULD WISH
TO BETRAY AND KILL HIS OWN LORD?

166
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,833
- AND THAT LORD IS
TRYING TO KILL HIM AS WELL.

167
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,500
IT'S CRAZY, I KNOW.

168
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,250
THEY KINDA DESERVE EACH OTHER.

169
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,625
HERE HE COMES.

170
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,375
- THIS PENT-UP FRENZY WITHIN ME,

171
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,125
I SHALL TAKE THE LIBERTY
OF VENTING IT UPON YOU!

172
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,041
( yells )

173
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,833
YEAH!

174
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,000
- ( grunting )

175
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,458
- YEAH!

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,875
- ( yelling )

177
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,916
- NOT BAD, GENTLEMEN.
I'M RATHER ENJOYING MYSELF.

178
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,583
- IT... IT'S NOTHING. NO.

179
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,375
- ( bell ringing )

180
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,333
- THIS IS UESUGI'S
FOOLISH NINJA,

181
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,791
WHOM I CAPTURED BEFORE
WE LEFT OWARI.

182
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:50,166
OH ICHI, I KEPT HER
ALIVE JUST FOR YOU.

183
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

184
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,833
- IF YOU INTEND TO
SERVE THE ODA FAMILY,

185
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:59,500
TO SERVE MY LORD KAZUSANOSUKE,
YOU WILL EXECUTE THIS WOMAN.

186
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,583
- ( gasps )

187
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,958
- AKECHI MITSUHIDE.

188
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,000
THE SNEAK ATTACK YOU
LAUNCHED ON MY LORD,

189
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,333
AS WELL AS THE PAIN YOU'VE
CAUSED THE PEOPLE OF KAI,

190
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,875
WILL BE AVENGED!

191
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:14,875
( yells )

192
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,333
( grunting )

193
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,958
- YOUNG CUB HONEST TO A FAULT.

194
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,833
UNLIKE THE TIGER OF KAI,

195
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,375
I NEED NO TRICKERY
TO PUT YOU DOWN.

196
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,708
- DON'T GET TOO FIRED UP,
YUKIMURA. LET'S PLAY THIS COOL.

197
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,541
- I AM MUCH OBLIGED, MY LORD.

198
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,375
- ( Akechi chuckles )

199
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,958
THOUGH, GIVEN THIS FIRE,

200
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,291
THAT MAY BE A
TRICKY PROPOSITION.

201
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,000
- WHOA! AMAZING.

202
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,666
GUYS, YOU CAN GO HOME NOW.

203
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,750
I'LL REPORT BACK IN
WITH LORD ODA LATER.

204
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,958
MITSUHIDE, YOU'RE
GONNA DIE HERE.

205
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,500
- LORD NAGAMASA.

206
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,583
- DO YOU NOT WISH
TO BE OF USE

207
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,125
TO LORD KAZUSANOSUKE,
YOUR BROTHER?

208
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,500
SIMPLY DEPENDING ON HER HUSBAND
AND WAITING FOR THE WAR'S END.

209
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,333
IS NOT A WOMAN'S DUTY
IN THESE TIMES.

210
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,125
- I CAN... I CAN DO THIS.

211
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,833
- GOOD, SHOW US YOUR RESOLVE.

212
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,458
IF YOU SAY YOU CANNOT,

213
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,958
- NO, I... I CANNOT.

214
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,458
- I SEE. THEN I
HAVE YOUR ANSWER.

215
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,166
- ( both grunting )

216
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,041
- ( exclaiming )

217
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,375
- Oda: WOMAN!

218
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,625
USE SOME DISCRETION.

219
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:37,083
DO NOT STAIN MY CASTLE WALLS
WITH THE BLOOD OF FOOLS.

220
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,500
- I APOLOGIZE, LORD.

221
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,416
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

222
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,208
- SISTER OF THE DEVIL KING,
WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

223
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,916
- ALAS, I CANNOT.

224
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,916
I MADE A PROMISE TO MY LORD.

225
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,500
- I SEE.

226
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,333
GO WITH CAUTION THEN.

227
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,958
- DO NOT WORRY.

228
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,791
- ( blowing air )

229
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,500
( exclaims )

230
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,500
- ( screaming )

231
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,833
- ( gasping )

232
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,250
- OH, HOW IT HURTS.

233
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,166
I WOULD EXPECT
NO LESS OF YOU.

234
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,458
YOU MAKE THE VERY MARROW
IN MY BONES QUIVER.

235
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,708
RANMARU?

236
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,125
- YOU KNOW, I REALLY
DON'T LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.

237
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,000
BUT I PITY YOU, SO I'LL HELP.

238
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,291
BUT, YOU GOTTA
APOLOGIZE TO ODA.

239
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,958
- WELL, ISN'T HE A
THOUGHTFUL LITTLE RUNT.

240
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,625
- I MUST ADMIT I FEEL RATHER
CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS.

241
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,833
- BECAUSE YA MAKE THINGS
HARDER THAN THEY NEED TO BE.

242
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,291
WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT,

243
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,500
NO ONE'S COMPLETELY
IN THE RIGHT HERE.

244
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,750
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU KEEP
YOUR EYE TO THE FUTURE

245
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,875
THAT THESE INJUSTICES
BECOME JUST.

246
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,166
IT'S THE WAY OF THE TIMES.

247
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,666
- HOW FAR I HAVE FALLEN TO
GARNER THE PITY OF A CHILD.

248
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,791
I UNDERSTAND.

249
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,291
I SHALL OFFER A HEARTFELT
APOLOGY TO LORD NOBUNAGA.

250
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,041
- ( screaming )

251
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,958
- ( gasps )
- HEY.

252
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,375
IT LOOKS LIKE IT FLEW WELL.

253
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,916
CAME IN HANDY, DIDN'T IT.
JUST LIKE I SAID, RIGHT?

254
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,041
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
WAS THAT WHISTLE?

255
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,458
- WHISTLE? IT'S THE LATEST
IN FLYING NINJA TOOLS.

256
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,625
- I JUST ASSUMED WHEN I BLEW
INTO IT, YOU'D COME RUNNING.

257
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,625
- WHAT? THAT'S THE
STUPIDEST THING I EVER HEARD.

258
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,625
WHATEVER. IT STILL
WORKED, DIDN'T IT?

259
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,500
- ( sighs )

260
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,250
( exclaims )

261
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,250
- ( sighs )

262
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,916
SO, WHAT'S THE WORD?

263
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,541
- ODA NOBUNAGA
IS AT MOUNT AZUCHI.

264
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,958
- ( Ranmaru yells )

265
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,083
- STAY OUT OF THIS, KID!

266
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,916
- SHUT UP, JERK.
I'M NOT A KID!

267
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,708
- ( groaning )

268
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,458
( gasps )

269
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,208
- TIME TO PUT A
QUICK END TO THIS.

270
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,750
- ( yelling )

271
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,583
- SUCH LOVELY PAIN.

272
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,958
- READY TO FINISH THIS CRAP?

273
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,791
- LORD MASAMUNE, I ASK THAT
YOU YIELD THIS BATTLE TO ME.

274
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,875
- Kojuro: MASAMUNE!

275
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,291
- HEY THERE, KOJURO.
GLAD YOU MADE IT.

276
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,375
- THE DEVIL KING IS
AT MOUNT AZUCHI.

277
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,458
I HAVE RELIABLE WORD
FROM AN ECHIGO NINJA.

278
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,666
FROM A GREAT FORTRESS
ATOP A MOUNTAIN

279
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,458
BLANKETED BY OMINOUS
CLOUDS, HE IS PREPARING THE

280
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,416
FINISHING TOUCHES ON HIS
WORLD UNDER WARRIOR RULE.

281
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,083
THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS.

282
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,750
PLEASE, LEAD THE ARMY
OUTSIDE TO THE DEVIL KING.

283
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,000
YOU, TOO, SANADA YUKIMURA.

284
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,875
- BUT, I MUST SETTLE
MATTERS WITH HIM.

285
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,541
- LEAVE THIS MONSTER TO ME.

286
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,750
DON'T LET YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS
OUTWEIGH THE GREATER CAUSE.

287
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,166
WHAT YOU SWORE TO DO
FOR THE TIGER OF KAI,

288
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,500
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE SOME
PETTY ACT OF REVENGE.

289
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,125
- NO, YOU ARE RIGHT.

290
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,583
- THEN WE'RE GONE.

291
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,583
BUT WE GOT HIM NICE
AND WARMED UP FOR YOU.

292
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,583
IT IS IN YOUR HANDS,
MASTER KATAKURA.

293
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,916
- Akechi: AZUCHI CASTLE.

294
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,083
SO, IT HAS BEEN COMPLETED.
FOR THE FINAL BANQUET,

295
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,875
THAT MAY BE THE MORE
SUITABLE LOCATION.

296
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,416
- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THEN,

297
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,875
THAT YOU WERE NOT INVITED.

298
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,500
- PLEASE, NOHIME,
LET ME SEE MY BROTHER.

299
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,291
- THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT.

300
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,666
- ( gun cocking )

301
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,833
- FOOLISH SISTER-IN-LAW.

302
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,166
AT LEAST PERISH
WITHOUT SUFFERING.

303
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,250
- ( gunshot )

304
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,708
- ( theme song playing )

305
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,125
- Date: SORRY TO
KEEP YOU WAITING.

306
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,583
I'LL FINALLY BE SLAMMING
THESE SIX SWORDS

307
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,791
DOWN ON THE DEVIL KING'S FACE.

308
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,791
I PROMISE.

309
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,458
YOU'RE INVITED TO
THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.

310
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,291
YEAH. LET'S PARTY.
