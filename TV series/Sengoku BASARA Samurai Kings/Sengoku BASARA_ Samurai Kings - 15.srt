1
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,458
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

2
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:59,041
- LET US MAKE A DEAL.
IT'S SIMPLE.

3
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,458
I WANT YOU
TO JOIN THE TOYOTOMI ARMY.

4
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,541
- WHAT?

5
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,583
- I'M NO STRANGER TO YOUR
EXPLOITS, MY DEAR KATAKURA.

6
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,583
- YOU TOOK THE TIGER OF KAI'S
OWN STRATAGEM AND USED IT

7
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,333
TO OUTMANEUVER HIM.

8
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:20,250
AND WHEN THE EASTERN ARMIES
CAME TOGETHER TO TOPPLE ODA,

9
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,833
THEY FOUGHT UNDER YOUR COMMAND.

10
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,208
AT HONNOJI,
YOU SENT AKECHI MITSUHIDE

11
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,291
TO WHATEVER DARK GOD
CLAIMS HIM.

12
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,958
FREEING YOUR LORD
TO FIGHT THE DEVIL KING.

13
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,833
AZUCHI CASTLE WOULD YET STAND
WERE IT NOT FOR YOU.

14
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,541
THEN THERE'S KAWANAKAJIMA,
OF COURSE.

15
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,000
I'D SCRIPTED OUR ATTACK
TO BE SO PERFECT, SO PRECISE.

16
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:45,458
YOUR QUICK THINKING DID SCATTER
MY PLANS TO THE WIND.

17
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,958
IT WAS SOMETHING NEW TO ME,

18
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,458
THIS EXPERIENCE
OF BEING OUTFOXED.

19
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,708
WHY HAVEN'T YOU RAISED
AN ARMY BENEATH YOUR OWN BANNER?

20
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,666
WHY DEFER TO LESSER MEN?

21
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,291
A STRONGER,
DISCIPLINED FORCE

22
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,666
YES, AN ARMY NOT UNLIKE
THAT OF LORD TOYOTOMI.

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,291
- MILORD, MASAMUNE IS RIGHTFUL
LEADER OF THE DATE CLAN.

24
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,750
I AM HONORED TO SERVE
AS HIS RIGHT EYE NOW AND EVER.

25
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,875
- ALLOW ME TO SAY, YOUR TALENTS
WILL COME INTO MUCH RICHER BLOOM

26
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,166
ONCE UNDER THE TOYOTOMI BANNER.
MINE DID.

27
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,083
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF YOUR HONEYED WORDS.

28
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,333
YOUR FLATTERY SICKENS ME.

29
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,208
NOTHING YOU CAN SAY WILL
MAKE ME TURN TRAITOR.

30
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,916
- I'M QUITE SINCERE,
GOOD KATAKURA.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,458
LOSING YOU AMIDST
THE ANNIHILATION OF THE DATE

32
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,083
WOULD BE A TERRIBLE WASTE.

33
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,708
- I AM KATAKURA KOJURO.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,791
I WILL NEVER SERVE ANYONE
EXCEPT LORD DATE MASAMUNE.

35
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,000
GOT IT?

36
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:46,166
- IF YOU WANT TO SPURN MY OFFER,
THAT'S YOUR RIGHT.

37
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,750
ALTHOUGH YOUR REFUSAL COMES
AT A COST.

38
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,250
- ( gasps )
- MASTER KATAKURA.

39
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,583
- YOU TAKE THE DEFENSELESS AS
HOSTAGES, LIKE A COMMON BANDIT.

40
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,333
THERE IS NO RIGHTEOUSNESS IN
YOUR ACTIONS, TAKENAKA HANBEI.

41
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,000
WHERE IS YOUR HONOR?
- YOU WOUND ME.

42
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,500
IT'S QUITE VULGAR, I KNOW,

43
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,916
BUT WORTH IT
IF IT GAINS US KATAKURA.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,083
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
ABOUT THE DATE, VILLAIN.

45
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,166
NOT MUCH OF A LIAR, ARE YOU?

46
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,750
THESE NAMELESS PEASANTS
WHO LIVE ON YOUR LAND

47
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,791
AND YOUR UNSWERVING LOYALTY
TO YOUNG MASAMUNE.

48
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,375
YOU CAN PRESERVE ONE, BUT IT'S
GOING TO COST YOU THE OTHER.

49
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:24,791
SIMPLY PUT, I HAVE YOU
EXACTLY WHERE I WANT YOU,

50
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,625
MY POOR KATAKURA.

51
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,375
- ( shouting )
- ( grunting )

52
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,333
- Both:
MASTER KATAKURA!  OH!

53
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,791
- ( grunting )

54
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,166
YOU-- YOU BASTARD!

55
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,041
- YOU DON'T APPROVE
OF MY UNDERHANDED TECHNIQUES.

56
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,000
NOR DO I, FRANKLY.

57
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,041
HONOR'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,

58
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,625
BUT THERE SIMPLY WASN'T TIME
ENOUGH FOR IT TONIGHT.

59
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,541
- BIG BOSS.  BIG BOSS!

60
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,416
- BIG BOSS, WE GOT SERIOUS
TROUBLE ON OUR HANDS.

61
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,041
- DEFINE "TROUBLE."  FIND THAT
SPY FROM TOYOTOMI'S CAMP YET?

62
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,875
- NOT THAT.
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK.

63
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,458
- THREE LANDS UNDER YOUR CONTROL
ARE REVOLTING--

64
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,625
NANBU, TSUGARU AND SOHMA.
- HUH?

65
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,541
- SHIT.

66
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,458
- HE'S PLAYING THAT CARD
ALREADY?

67
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,833
SOMEBODY'S TELLING KOJURO,
AREN'T THEY?

68
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,166
- YES, SIR, BUNSHICHI'S HEADED
OVER TO BOSS KATAKURA NOW--

69
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,750
- BIG BOSS!
IT'S BOSS KATAKURA.  HE'S--

70
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,750
- ( gasps )
- ( grunting )

71
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:25,666
- O-SUZU AND HER GRANDFATHER RAN
FROM THE VILLAGE TO FIND ME.

72
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,458
THEY SAY SOMEONE KIDNAPPED
MASTER KATAKURA.

73
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,916
- Both: HUH?

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,250
- IN THE GRASS ON THE HILL,
WE FOUND THIS.

75
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,500
- THAT SWORD'S ONE OF HIS,
ISN'T IT?

76
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,791
- IT IS.  THE KOKURYU.
- ( sobbing )

77
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,041
HE WAS AMBUSHED IN THE DEAD
OF THE NIGHT.

78
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,541
THEY MUST HAVE OVERPOWERED HIM
SOMEHOW AND DRAGGED HIM AWAY.

79
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,250
HE DID FIND THE TRAITOR
IN OUR RANKS, THOUGH.

80
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,375
- WHO'S IN CHARGE
OF THESE BASTARDS?

81
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,708
TELL ME WE AT LEAST KNOW THAT.

82
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,916
- TOYOTOMI'S MAN.

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,125
- TAKENAKA HANBEI PLANNED
ALL THIS.

84
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,500
- SEND SCOUTS TO OSAKA.

85
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,583
SOON AS WE STOMP THESE REBELS,
WE MOUNT A RESCUE.

86
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,125
- RIGHT.

87
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,166
- YOU WAITING FOR AN INVITATION?
GO KICK SOME ASS!

88
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,416
- All: RIGHT.

89
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,041
- BALLSY LITTLE RAT.

90
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:35,166
TRY TO MAKE A FOOL OUT
OF ME, WILL YOU?

91
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,041
IT'S GONNA BE ONE
OF THOSE MORNINGS.

92
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,500
- KASUGA, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU AREN'T GOOD AT?

93
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,416
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

94
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,541
A NINJA MUST MASTER EVERY TASK
IF SHE'S TO BE OF ANY WORTH.

95
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,708
- WELL, YOU'VE MASTERED
MISO SOUP,

96
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,250
AND THESE PICKLED VEGETABLES
ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD.

97
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,041
MATSU WOULD COOK CIRCLES
AROUND YOU, THOUGH.

98
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,708
I'M JUST SAYING.

99
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,875
- YES, I IMAGINE THAT SHE COULD.

100
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,583
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU'D RATHER
PRAISE MY FOOD THAN EAT IT.

101
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,541
- NAH.  YOU THINK?

102
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,791
- Kenshin:
KEIJI'S PRAISE IS SINCERE.

103
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,333
YOUR MEAL IS SO DELICIOUS THAT
DEVOURING IT IS ALMOST A WASTE.

104
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,500
- MILORD KENSHIN.

105
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,541
- Kenshin:
BETWEEN BISHAMONTEN'S PROTECTION

106
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,750
AND THE BREAKFASTS YOU MAKE
WITH SUCH CARE.

107
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,666
DEAR ME
THE DINNERS ARE JUST AS DIVINE.

108
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,333
THE CUPS OF TEA
WHICH WE DRINK AT MID-DAY.

109
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,833
I AM A VERY FORTUNATE MAN.

110
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,708
- MILORD KENSHIN,
I AM NOT WORTHY OF SUCH--

111
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,000
- I PRAY,
MY MOST BEAUTIFUL BLADE,

112
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,916
THAT YOU WILL EVER GRANT ME
THIS RAREST OF BLISS.

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,250
- YES, MILORD.

114
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,958
- ( shouts )

115
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,000
- IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

116
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,750
- SORRY.

117
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,916
I FORGOT THAT YOU WERE THERE
MOMENTARILY.  PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

118
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
- WHY WOULD A PERSON DO THAT?

119
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,000
- MERCY, MAEDA KEIJI.
I BEG OF YOU.

120
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,500
EVEN A VAGABOND SHOULD KNOW SOME
THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNSAID.

121
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:36,291
- NO, WHY WOULDN'T EVERYONE LIVE
HAPPILY, LIKE THE TWO OF YOU?

122
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,125
I WISH TOSHIIE AND MATSU DID.

123
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,458
THEY FINALLY GET OUT
FROM UNDERNEATH THE DEVIL KING

124
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,500
OF OWARI'S THUMB.  THEY'RE FREE
TO DO AS THEY PLEASE.

125
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,750
THEY HATE WAR,

126
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,875
BUT THEN THEY GO
AND SIDE WITH HIM

127
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,041
FOR A TRANQUIL LAND
OF THE RISING SUN.

128
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,291
- MAEDA KEIJI.

129
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,166
- KASUGA.
- LORD.

130
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,833
- BRING SAKE.

131
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,708
- TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI.

132
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,625
LESS MENACING THAN THE DEVIL
KING OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN,

133
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,958
BUT NO LESS DANGEROUS.
CONSIDER THIS.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,958
IT WAS MORI'S CUNNING SCHEME
TO INDUCE ODA TO ATTACK KYUSHU

135
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,166
BEFORE THE INLAND SEA
OF SETO.

136
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,625
HOWEVER, ONE COULD SAY IT WAS
TOYOTOMI WHO BENEFITED

137
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,125
FROM IT MOST OF ALL.

138
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,958
TOYOTOMI'S TOP LIEUTENANT
TAKENAKA HANBEI,

139
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,916
HIS GUILE MAY OUTSHINE
EVEN MORI'S,

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,333
IN TERMS OF MARTIAL STRATEGY.

141
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,125
AND MORI IS A FOE KNOWN
FOR CUNNING.

142
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,583
- OH, YEAH, HE'S CLEVER.
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

143
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,375
SO EVEN IF HE HATES THE GUY,
HE'LL ALLY WITH TOYOTOMI

144
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,958
FOR THE TIME BEING.

145
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,958
- A PACT BETWEEN THOSE
TWO WOULD BE DIRE INDEED.

146
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,291
THE BALANCE OF POWER WOULD
SHIFT IN THEIR FAVOR AT ONCE.

147
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,041
IF THAT COMES TO PASS,
THE FIRST LAND THEY'LL TARGET

148
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,666
IS SHIKOKU, ACROSS THE INLAND
SEA OF SETO.

149
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,708
- ( shouting )

150
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:10,375
- OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA,
I'VE COME TO ASK A FAVOR OF YOU.

151
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,583
- COUNT ME IN.  I SEE
WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING.

152
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,916
YOU'RE BUILDING AN ARMY
TO TAKE ON THAT BASTARD ODA

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,458
AND YOU WANT OLD MOTOCHIKA
TO JOIN THE FUN.

154
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,125
I'M IN,
WHATEVER FATE MAY BRING.

155
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,833
NOW GO.  GIVE THAT TYRANT HELL,
KEIJI.

156
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,041
- MOTOCHIKA.

157
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,833
- CHOSOKABE, YES.

158
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,625
THE SEA-FARING HEAD OF SHIKOKU.

159
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,375
YOU SOUGHT HIS ARM IN OUR
STRUGGLE AGAINST ODA,

160
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,000
BUT YOU FOUND A KINDRED SPIRIT
IN THE PIRATE, DID YOU NOT?

161
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,541
- THAT'S RIGHT.

162
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,708
IF HE EVER BOTHERED
PUTTING ONE ON,

163
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,583
HE'D GIVE YOU THE VERY
SHIRT OFF OF HIS BACK.

164
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,750
- YOUR NEW FRIEND AND OLD FRIEND
THIRST FOR EACH OTHER'S BLOOD.

165
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,958
THAT MUST BE HARD TO BEAR.

166
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,500
- A MESSAGE FROM ONE
OF YOUR MEN, MILORD.

167
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,375
( whispers )

168
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,000
- IT HAS BEGUN.

169
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,250
KEIJI, YOU'RE LEAVING?

170
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,291
- I THINK I'LL MEET
WITH HIDEYOSHI, AFTER ALL,

171
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,916
AND TELL HIM HOW POINTLESS
IT IS TO FIGHT MOTOCHIKA.

172
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,125
- DO NOT DO THIS.

173
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,208
- I CAN'T JUST LEAVE THINGS
AS THEY ARE.

174
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,250
- AS MUCH AS I HATE TO THINK IT,

175
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,125
I DON'T BELIEVE HE WILL
EVEN GRANT YOU AN AUDIENCE.

176
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,000
- WHY NOT?
I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME.

177
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,416
- HE'S A DIFFERENT MAN

178
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,166
THE BOTH OF YOU ARE.

179
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,666
EVEN SO, YOU SHOULD
PUT ECHIGO BEHIND YOU

180
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,458
AS FAST AS YOU ARE ABLE.
- WHAT'S WRONG, KENSHIN?

181
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,916
- LEVEL WITH ME.
- Kasuga: YOUR UNCLE'S ARMY.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
IT'S ADVANCING ON OUR BORDERS
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

183
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,250
- HUH?

184
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,833
- TO DEFEND OURSELVES,

185
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,000
WE MUST FACE YOUR FAMILY
IN BATTLE.

186
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,750
- WHAT?  YOU CAN'T.
- WE HAVEN'T A CHOICE.

187
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,625
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
FOR LORD TOSHIIE.

188
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,625
THE HEAVENS SHALL
CHOOSE A BANNER TODAY.

189
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,250
THAT FACTION WILL SURVIVE.

190
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,041
- Narrator: TARGETED BY
TOYOTOMI'S SECRET INVASION,

191
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,541
THE DATE TERRITORY OF OSHU
FACED SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS

192
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,625
FROM THREE FRONTS:
NANBU, TSUGARU AND SOHMA.

193
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,041
IN RESPONSE, DATE MASAMUNE
DIVIDED HIS ARMY INTO THIRDS

194
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,041
AND SENT EACH
TO A DIFFERENT BATTLEFIELD.

195
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,250
- ( shouting )

196
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,291
- Narrator: THE THREEFOLD FIGHT
WAS GOING IN DATE'S FAVOR,

197
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,166
BUT A FORCE WAS ON THE MARCH
FROM AIZU

198
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,375
THAT WOULD TURN THE TIDE
OF BATTLE FIRMLY AGAINST HIM.

199
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,791
- BIG BOSS, OUR SCOUTS
HAVE REPORTED BACK.

200
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,625
WE GOT TROUBLE, THE ASHINA
ARMY'S COMING IN FROM AIZU.

201
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,541
THEY'LL SLAM INTO SURIAGEHARA
ANY MINUTE NOW.

202
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,083
- HOW ARE MY BOYS HOLDING UP?

203
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,958
- ALL THREE GROUPS ARE
TAKING THE OFFENSIVE,

204
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,125
BUT NOW WE'VE GOT A FOURTH FIGHT
TO WORRY ABOUT.

205
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,708
- TAKENAKA HANBEI,

206
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,541
THANKS FOR HANDING YOURSELF
OVER LIKE THIS.

207
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,791
- FORGIVE ME,
MY DEAR MASAMUNE,

208
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,083
BUT SPLITTING YOUR ARMY
INTO THIRDS WAS JUST SLOPPY.

209
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,083
- DO TELL.

210
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,541
- WHAT WOULD KATAKURA HAVE DONE?

211
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,666
- HE WOULD HAVE DISPATCHED
AS SMALL OF A FORCE AS POSSIBLE

212
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,000
TO NANBU, TSUGARU AND SOHMA

213
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,166
KEEPING THE BATTLES
EVENLY MATCHED

214
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,708
OR LURED HIS FOES CLOSER
BEFORE STRIKING AT THEM.

215
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,708
HE MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED A FOURTH
DETACHMENT WAS HIDDEN

216
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,458
IN THE WINGS,
WAITING TO TAKE THE STAGE.

217
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,833
- ( shouting )

218
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,083
- MIND IF I DROP IN?

219
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,916
- ( gasps )

220
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,708
- USUALLY, THE TIRELESS
KATAKURA WOULD BE DEFENDING

221
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,500
YOUR BACK AT TIMES LIKE THIS.
NOW IT'S RIPE FOR THE CARVING.

222
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,583
- YOU BASTARD.

223
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,625
- YOU HAVE MY WORD
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM

224
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,125
COME TO YOUR DEATH FREE
OF WORRIES, NOBLE DATE.

225
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,666
LET THIS BATTLEFIELD DRINK DEEP
OF YOUR BLOOD.

226
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,458
- OH, THERE'LL BE BLOOD.

227
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,125
'CAUSE I'M GONNA RUN YOU
THROUGH, YOU SON OF A BITCH.

228
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,250
WAR DANCE!

229
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,583
- BETTER THAN I GAVE
HIM CREDIT FOR.

230
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,541
- DAMN COWARD.

231
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,041
- OH, MAN.
SO THEY'VE BROKEN THROUGH.

232
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,041
- MASAMUNE, YOU GOT PLAYED.

233
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,041
A FEW HOURS
WITHOUT MY RIGHT EYE,

234
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,416
AND THIS IS THE CRAP
I STEP IN.

235
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,375
BUNCH OF FREAKIN'
ROOKIE MISTAKES.

236
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,708
COME ON, I WON'T GIVE UP
MY HEAD WITHOUT A FIGHT.

237
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,833
- ( shouting )

238
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,083
- YOUR LORDSHIP,
I, SANADA YUKIMURA,

239
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
HUMBLY REQUEST TO TAKE MY LEAVE.

240
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,375
- GRANTED.
MIND YOURSELF AROUND WATER.

241
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,166
RIGHT.

242
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,166
- UNSETTLING NEWS
FROM A MEMBER OF MY NINJA CORPS.

243
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,000
- THERE'S TROUBLE IN OSHU.

244
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,875
THREE NEIGHBORING LANDS THAT
USED TO BE UNDER DATE'S CONTROL

245
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,791
HAVE LAUNCHED OFFENSIVES
AGAINST HIM.

246
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,625
AND THE RIGHT EYE OF THE DRAGON,
KATAKURA KOJURO,

247
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,750
HAS GONE MISSING.
- MISSING?

248
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,833
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

249
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,833
- ANOTHER ARMY'S ATTACKING
DATE FROM ASHINA.

250
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,458
HE'S TRYING TO FEND THEM OFF
AT SURIAGEHARA.

251
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,500
BUT AS OF THE REPORT I RECEIVED
LAST NIGHT,

252
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,625
DATE'S LOSING.

253
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,708
- SO TOYOTOMI HAS SET HIS PLAN
INTO ACTION.

254
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,083
THE LOSS OF HIS TOP STRATEGIST
RENDERS THE ONE-EYED DRAGON

255
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,625
HALF BLIND.  YUKIMURA!

256
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,583
DO NOT FORGET,
HIS CLAN IS OUR FOE.

257
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,208
IF DATE MASAMUNE SHOULD
MEET HIS END,

258
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,916
ALL WE'VE LOST IS A RIVAL.

259
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,416
IF HE PREVAILS, HE'LL SURELY
GRANT YOU YOUR REMATCH.

260
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,666
- YOUR LORDSHIP.

261
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,375
- BRAVE MEN OF TAKEDA.
THOUGH I AM LACKING IN YEARS,

262
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,541
I SWEAR TO LEAD THIS COMPANY TO
THE VERY UTMOST OF MY ABILITY.

263
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,041
WILL YOU DEVOTE YOURSELVES
TO OUR MISSION,

264
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,250
HEART AND SOUL, AS I HAVE?
- YES, SIR.

265
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,541
- SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA,

266
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,000
 AIDED BY THE ELITE
OF THE TAKEDA CAVALRY

267
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,125
NOW EMBARKS ON A QUEST
TO HELP THE WARRIORS OF SATSUMA

268
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,208
OR DIE TRYING!  HYAH!

269
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,250
LORD MASAMUNE YOU DEFEATED ME
ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE ONCE,

270
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,083
SO I SHALL NOT FEAR FOR YOU.
I ENTRUST YOU TO FATE,

271
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,291
THAT I MAY BE A WORTHY OPPONENT
WHEN NEXT WE MEET.

272
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,208
MILORD HAS GIVEN ME A MOST
IMPORTANT MISSION,

273
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,791
AND I CAN ONLY CHALLENGE YOU
AGAIN IF I GIVE THIS MY ALL.

274
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,083
- NO DISRESPECT, LORD TAKEDA

275
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,833
BUT OF ALL THE TIMES
TO SEND OUT YUKIMURA,

276
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,625
THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
A PARTICULARLY GOOD--

277
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,916
- THERE COULD BE NO BETTER TIME
- WHAT?

278
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,916
- THESE ARE THE TIMES
THAT TRY MEN'S SOULS.

279
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,083
HIS JOURNEY SHALL BE ALL
THE RICHER FOR IT.

280
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,166
( laughs ) WHAT WISDOM SHALL
BE WRIT ACROSS HIS FACE

281
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,125
ON HIS RETURN?
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE.

282
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,916
YUKIMURA... THOUGH WE ARE APART,

283
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,458
OUR DESTINIES ARE ALWAYS
INTERTWINED.

284
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,916
IF WE SHOULD NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFE, SO BE IT.

285
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,708
NO MATTER WHAT THE WORLD
THROWS AT YOU,

286
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,125
ALWAYS FACE IT LIKE A MAN.

287
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:31,083
- Toyotomi: IS THAT A BANDAGE
ON YOUR HAND, HANBEI?

288
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,125
- IT'S MERELY A SCRATCH.

289
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,750
- I KNOW THAT HE'S HERE.

290
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,166
KATAKURA KOJURO IS BEING HELD
CAPTIVE WITHIN MY KEEP,

291
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,708
BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE?

292
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,708
- RARE BEAST THAT HE IS,
I SAW FIT TO POACH HIM

293
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,291
FOR THE GLORY
OF THE TOYOTOMI CLAN.

294
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,625
I DON'T NEED THE RIGHT EYE
OF THE DRAGON.

295
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,333
- BUT YOUR ARMY GROWS EVEN
LARGER WITH EVERY NEW VICTORY.

296
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,583
A SECOND STRATEGIST CERTAINLY
COULDN'T HURT.

297
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,625
- I CAN'T IMAGINE
HE'D TURN TRAITOR.

298
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,291
- SO LONG AS DATE DRAWS BREATH,
I'M INCLINED TO AGREE.

299
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,875
BUT HE WON'T FOR MUCH LONGER.

300
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,750
THE POOR BOY SHOULD BE
UTTERLY SPENT,

301
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,750
EMBROILED AS HE IS ON ALL SIDES.

302
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,875
ALSO WE'VE THE TIGER OF KAI
FIRMLY BY THE TAIL

303
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,000
FOR THE MOMENT, AND THE MAEDA
ARMY SHOULD BE LAUNCHING

304
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,083
ITS INVASION
OF ECHIGO ANY TIME NOW.

305
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,958
MAEDA ATTACKS FROM THE WEST,
AND ONCE THEY BEAT DATE,

306
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,791
ASHINA AND THE OTHER THREE
STRIKE FROM THE EAST.

307
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,666
BY YOUR LEAVE,
I WILL NOW HEAD FOR AKI.

308
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,208
OUR ALLIANCE WITH MORI
MUST BE MADE OFFICIAL.

309
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,791
HE'LL HELP US DESTROY
CHOSOKABE TO HIS SOUTH.

310
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,166
YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER TAKE
THE FIELD UNTIL THEN, MILORD.

311
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,791
- HANBEI.

312
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,500
- YES, MY GOOD HIDEYOSHI.

313
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,791
- THERE IS NO NEED
FOR SUCH HASTE.

314
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,375
YOU SHOULD REST, TOO.

315
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,958
- YOU ARE TOO KIND.

316
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,583
ONCE SHIKOKU FALLS,
I'LL TRY MY BEST.

317
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,500
- ( laughs )

318
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,375
I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN THAT.

319
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,416
AFTER SHIKOKU, YOU'LL RUSH
HEADLONG FOR SATSUMA.

320
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,041
- PERHAPS SO.

321
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:22,208
HEAVENS ABOVE,
HOW I DO LONG TO SEE IT.

322
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,791
THE ENTIRETY OF THIS LAND
TREMBLING IN YOUR GRASP.

323
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,166
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

324
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,541
- Keiji: IF SOMETHING'S
IMPORTANT TO YOU,

325
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,916
THEN YOU DEFEND IT
TO THE DEATH.

326
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,750
THE ONE WHO TAUGHT
ME THAT WAS HIM.

327
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,916
NEXT TIME'S GONNA BE ROUGH,

328
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,875
BUT BE SURE TO SEE IT THROUGH
TO THE VERY END WITH ME, OKAY?
