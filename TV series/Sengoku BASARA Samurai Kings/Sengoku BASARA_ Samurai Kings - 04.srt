1
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,291
- ( people screaming )

2
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,500
- Oda: THE WORLD
UNDER WARRIOR RULE.

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:41,833
I AM TRULY THE DEVIL KING,
COME FROM THE SIXTH HEAVEN.

4
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,833
FOR I OPEN THE LID
ON HELL ITSELF.

5
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,416
IMBECILES, PROSTRATE YOURSELVES.

6
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,625
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,291
- WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

8
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,875
WILL ODA'S UNPROVOKED
INVASIONS KNOW NO END?

9
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,500
AND NOW I AM GIVEN NEWS
OF HIS LATEST OUTRAGE,

10
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,791
THAT HE MARCHED HIS ARMY
INTO THE HOMELAND OF HIS

11
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,916
OWN WIFE, THE LADY NOHIME,
AND RAZED IT TO THE GROUND.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,416
FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE IN OMI,
ECHIZEN, AND OWARI,

13
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,458
I HAD HOPED WE MIGHT SERVE
THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE TOGETHER,

14
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,791
THAT WE WERE AS ONE IN BOTH
INTENT AND PURITY OF HEART.

15
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,333
I HAD THOUGHT THE PROOF OF HIS
CHANGE WAS IN SENDING YOU,

16
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,500
HIS FLESH AND BLOOD SISTER,
TO BE MY BRIDE.

17
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:59,666
I HAD BELIEVED THE DEVIL KING
HAD REGAINED HIS HUMANITY.

18
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,791
OUR PLAN TO ESTABLISH AN ERA OF
HEALTH AND PROSPERITY

19
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,666
WAS THE REASON, I TURNED A
BLIND EYE TO HIS PAST MISDEEDS

20
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,666
AND CALLED ODA NOBUNAGA
BROTHER-IN-LAW.

21
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,750
- I APOLOGIZE, MY LORD NAGAMASA.
IT IS ALL MY FAULT.

22
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,125
- WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
YOU ARE ALWAYS SO MAUDLIN.

23
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,625
HOW MANY TIMES MUST I TELL YOU

24
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,625
TO STOP MISPLACING
BLAME UPON YOURSELF?

25
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,416
- I APOLOGIZE.

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
- YES, I'VE HEARD THAT
ENOUGH FOR ONE NIGHT.

27
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,708
- MY LORD HUSBAND.
- WHAT IS IT?

28
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,458
- NO MATTER WHAT ALL
OF THIS MIGHT MEAN,

29
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,208
REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN,

30
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,875
DO NOT DEFY MY BROTHER.
PLEASE, I BEG OF YOU.

31
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,083
- TURN A DEAF EAR TO...

32
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,750
- THAT IS SOMETHING I CANNOT DO.

33
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,500
THOUGH HE IS MY BROTHER-IN-LAW,

34
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,750
I AM STILL THE SWORN ENEMY OF
ALL THOSE WHO WOULD COMMIT EVIL.

35
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,458
- THAT OUGHT TO MAKE
THIS PAINLESS.

36
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:53,041
- PARDON MY DROPPING IN SO LATE.
- WHO DARES TRESPASS HERE?

37
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,708
IF YOU KNOW YOU
COMMIT THIS EFFRONTERY

38
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,791
TOWARD AZAI
BIZEN-NO-KAMI NAGAMASA,

39
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,958
I SHALL SMITE YOUR EVIL
HEART WHERE YOU STAND.

40
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:04,291
- SHH, SARUTOBI SASUKE,
SANADA NINJA CORPS.

41
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,208
I FEEL BAD FOR INTRUDING ON
YOUR PRIVATE TIME TOGETHER.

42
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,375
WELL, I'D LIKE TO FEEL BAD.

43
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,583
BUT THE DEVIL KING LEAVES
LITTLE TIME FOR AFFECTION.

44
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,791
- THE TIGER OF KAI SENT YOU.

45
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,916
- I PRESUME YOU
KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,708
- ASK AS OFTEN AS YOU WISH
AND I SHALL ANSWER THE SAME.

47
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,166
AZAI WILL HAVE NO PART
IN ANY PLOT TO ENCIRCLE ODA.

48
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,375
ODA NOBUNAGA
AND I ARE BROTHERS-IN-LAW

49
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,875
BY VIRTUE OF MY MARRIAGE
TO HIS YOUNGER SISTER,

50
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:33,291
MY BELOVED ICHI.
MY POSITION SHOULD BE OBVIOUS.

51
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,375
- ENCIRCLE ODA?

52
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,833
- WE ARE AWARE OF LADY
O-ICHI'S FAMILY TIES. EVEN SO...

53
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,333
- ENOUGH OF YOUR PRATTLING.

54
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,000
ONCE I HAVE MADE A DECISION,
I NEVER GO BACK ON MY WORD.

55
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,166
NOW, TAKE YOUR LEAVE QUICKLY,
NINJA OF KAI.

56
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,125
- ODA IS MOVING ON ASAKURA.

57
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:54,625
- WHAT? IMPOSSIBLE. WE HAVE
A LONG-STANDING PACT

58
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,916
OF STRICT NON-AGGRESSION
WITH ASAKURA.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,750
SURELY, HE WOULD NOT BREAK IT.

60
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,666
- NOBUNAGA IS LITERALLY
NOT HUMAN, HE'S...

61
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,291
- MIND YOUR TONGUE.

62
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,083
YOU WILL NOT
INSULT MY WIFE

63
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,208
WITH SUCH SLANDEROUS
ACCUSATIONS.

64
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,125
I SAY AGAIN. AZAI SHALL NOT
TAKE PART IN YOUR ALLIANCE.

65
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,875
TELL YOUR LORD SHINGEN,
MY DECISION IS FINAL.

66
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,791
- MY LORD.

67
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,541
- MY LORD HUSBAND.

68
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,583
- Sanada: YOUR LORDSHIP,
SANADA YUKIMURA,

69
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,833
AT YOUR HUMBLE SERVICE.

70
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,208
- Takeda: AH, ENTER.
- SIR.

71
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:35,875
( gasps )

72
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:45,166
- I AM A MESSENGER OF UESUGI,
MY NAME IS KASUGA, MY LORD.

73
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,541
- AH, SO YOU ARE KASUGA.

74
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,583
IT IS TRULY A PLEASURE,
I AM SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA.

75
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,125
- SASUKE HAS TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

76
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,375
- HUH?

77
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,625
- BY THE WAY, HAVE THE
TWO OF YOU SET A DATE

78
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,666
FOR THE WEDDING YET?

79
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,250
- A DATE FOR WHAT?

80
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,541
- YOUR LORDSHIP, IT IS A SHAME
I DO NOT SEE SASUKE AROUND.

81
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,916
- ( grunts )

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,625
HE HAS NO REASON TO BE.
SASUKE, MASTER SARUTOBI,

83
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,541
SASUKE AND I DO NOT SHARE
SUCH A RELATIONSHIP.

84
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,541
- SASUKE IS CURRENTLY
ON A MISSION MUCH LIKE YOURS.

85
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:17,291
- I SENT HIM TO VISIT TOKUGAWA
OF MIKAWA AND AZAI OF OMI.

86
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,666
- UH...

87
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,083
- WE HOPE FOR
A TEMPORARY ALLIANCE.

88
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,666
- AN ALLIANCE? SO, YOU ARE
PLANNING A UNITED FRONT

89
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,291
AGAINST THE DEVIL KING?

90
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,458
- PRECISELY, THIS LUDICROUS

91
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,166
"WORLD UNDER WARRIOR RULE"
NOBUNAGA DESIRES,

92
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,500
IS A WORLD RULED
BY FEAR AND CARNAGE.

93
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,041
WE MUST FIRST
PROTECT THIS WORLD

94
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,375
BEFORE WE DESTROY
EACH OTHER OVER IT.

95
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,500
YOU SEEM PUZZLED.

96
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,916
- SIR, WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT YOUR LORDSHIP,

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,625
GIVEN YOUR GREAT STRENGTH,

98
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,416
AND THE POWER OF THE
TAKEDA CAVALRY AT YOUR BACK,

99
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,125
I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE
MORE THAN A MATCH

100
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,500
FOR EVEN ODA'S FORCES.

101
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,750
- BUT WE WOULD NOT GO UNSCATHED.

102
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,333
ASSUMING WE DEFEAT ODA, WE WILL
HAVE SUFFERED GREAT CASUALTIES,

103
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,791
LEAVING US INDEFENSIBLE AGAINST
ANY OTHER ARMIES' ATTACKS.

104
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,458
- BUT WE WILL NEVER KNOW
UNLESS WE TRY.

105
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,500
- ( grunts )

106
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,708
- AM I NOT CONSTANTLY
TELLING YOU

107
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,875
TO EXPAND YOUR VIEW? BUFFOON!

108
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,416
- FORGIVE ME, YOUR LORDSHIP,
BUT OTHER THAN LORD KENSHIN,

109
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,458
THE GENERALS OF THE
OTHER LANDS SEEK ONLY

110
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,291
TO PROFIT FROM THE SIDELINES.

111
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,000
WOULD ANY OF THEM EVER
ANSWER YOUR CALL TO ARMS?

112
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,583
- ( grunts )

113
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,500
YOU CONTRADICT YOURSELF, BOY.
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

114
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,916
"WE WILL NEVER KNOW
UNLESS WE TRY?"

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,208
HEED MY WORDS, YOUNG CUB.

116
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,208
BEFORE YOU ARE ABLE TO
CHARGE THE FOE IN FRONT OF YOU,

117
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,458
FIRST YOU MUST FIX YOUR EYE
UPON THE BROADER HORIZON.

118
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,458
- YES, YOUR LORDSHIP.

119
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,916
- IN TRUTH,
EVEN I HAD HALF GIVEN UP,

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,750
AS WE HAD NOT RECEIVED
A SINGLE FAVORABLE REPLY.

121
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,708
UNTIL ONE DAY, NOT LONG AGO,
WHEN I RECEIVED A LETTER.

122
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,958
- A LETTER? FROM WHOM, SIR?
- THE VAGABOND OF MAEDA.

123
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,416
PUTTING HIS WANDERLUST
TO GOOD USE,

124
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
HE IS SPENDING TIME
VISITING WITH GENERALS

125
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,583
OF NEIGHBORING LANDS.

126
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,083
THIS MAEDA KEIJI'S PLAN
FOR AN ALLIED ARMY,

127
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:18,208
WAS IN FACT EERILY
SIMILAR TO MY OWN.

128
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:22,000
ONCE I ASCERTAINED
THE SINCERITY OF HIS ACTIONS,

129
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,500
I DISPATCHED SASUKE
TO SPEAK WITH THE GENERALS

130
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,500
ON MY BEHALF ONCE AGAIN.

131
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,291
- KASUGA, YES?
- YES, SIR.

132
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,000
- PLEASE INFORM
YOUR LORD KENSHIN

133
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,541
THAT TAKEDA SHINGEN
READILY CONSENTS.

134
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,666
- SIR.

135
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,250
- WITH MAEDA KEIJI
SPURRING HIM TO ACTION,

136
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,166
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON
WILL LIKELY RUSH

137
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,125
THE ENEMY ON HIS OWN.

138
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,750
WE WILL USE HIM
AS OUR SPEARHEAD.

139
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,041
AND QUICKLY ADVANCE
TO REINFORCE HIM.

140
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,166
FOR THAT TO WORK,
I WOULD HAVE TOKUGAWA

141
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,000
JOIN US AND IDEALLY,

142
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,958
I WOULD HAVE AZAI
PIN ODA FROM BEHIND.

143
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,083
THOUGH CERTAINLY, IT WILL
REQUIRE A HEARTRENDING CHOICE

144
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,791
ON AZAI'S PART.

145
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,708
WHAT IS IT, YUKIMURA?

146
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,083
- YOUR LORDSHIP, I,

147
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,583
I AM MERELY FEELING A
RENEWED SENSE OF ADMIRATION

148
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,916
FOR THE DEPTH
OF YOUR FORETHOUGHT.

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
YOU FIGHT NOT ONLY FOR THE
GOOD OF KAI OR YOUR ARMY,

150
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,750
BUT FIRST AND
FOREMOST TO PROTECT

151
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,208
THIS LAND OF THE RISING SUN

152
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,416
FROM THE MENACE
OF THE DEVIL KING.

153
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,250
I AM HUMBLED THAT YOU
WOULD THINK TO ENTRUST ME

154
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,083
WITH SUCH MATTERS
OF GRAVE SECRECY,

155
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,500
ALONGSIDE THIS HONORED
ENVOY FROM ECHIGO.

156
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,333
- LISTEN WELL, YUKIMURA.

157
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,375
DO NOT DOUBT THE IMPORT
OF YOUR PRESENCE.

158
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:34,708
BE A MAN OF FAITH, EVER FORGING
UPWARD TO EVEN GREATER HEIGHTS.

159
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,958
- YOUR LORDSHIP, I SWEAR I SHALL
TAKE YOUR WORDS TO HEART.

160
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,458
- GOOD.

161
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,791
- THE TIGER OF KAI,

162
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,833
THIS IS WHO SO OCCUPIES MY
LORD KENSHIN'S THOUGHTS.

163
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,125
MY LORDS, I SHALL TAKE MY LEAVE.

164
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,625
- SARUTOBI SASUKE, REPORTING IN.
- WELCOME HOME.

165
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,708
- MY LORD, I RETURN IN SHAME.

166
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,458
I JUST COULDN'T GET
THROUGH TO THEM.

167
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,958
NEITHER AZAI NOR TOKUGAWA
WILL JOIN WITH US.

168
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,375
- THEN SURROUNDING THE DEVIL
KING IS NO LONGER AN OPTION.

169
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,791
- SO, SHE WAS HERE, THEN.

170
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,458
SHE COULD HAVE STUCK
AROUND A LITTLE WHILE.

171
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,125
- HER STORY WAS A BIT
DIFFERENT FROM YOURS.

172
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,375
- HMM?

173
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,000
- MISTRESS KASUGA DENIED
SHE WAS YOUR BETROTHED.

174
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,416
QUITE FERVENTLY.

175
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,083
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE LADIES LIKE I DO, MASTER.

176
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,000
I'M SURE SHE WAS JUST
HIDING HER EMBARRASSMENT.

177
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,041
- THAT WAS EMBARRASSMENT, HUH?

178
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,750
Huh, I GUESS WOMEN REALLY
ARE COMPLICATED CREATURES.

179
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,125
- WE ARE ABOUT TO RUSH
INTO THE BATTLE OF OUR LIVES

180
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,583
AGAINST THE DEVIL KING.

181
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,083
THIS COULD'VE BEEN OUR LAST
CHANCE TO SEE EACH OTHER.

182
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,000
- SASUKE, DO NOT
SAY SUCH THINGS.

183
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,791
YOU MUST LIVE THROUGH
THIS AT ALL COSTS

184
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,916
AND BRING MISTRESS
KASUGA HAPPINESS.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,958
- OH, I'LL BE FINE, WHEN IT'S
WORK, I TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

186
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,375
IT'S HER I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT.

187
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,708
ANYWAY, MASTER.
JUST MAKE SURE IT'S YOU

188
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,708
WHO GETS THE DEVIL KING'S HEAD.

189
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,625
- RIGHT NOW, THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY I CAN REPAY HIS LORDSHIP.

190
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,458
HOWEVER...

191
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,125
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

192
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,875
THAT WHEN FACED
WITH A POWERFUL OPPONENT,

193
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,625
I DID NOT FEEL A BURNING
WITHIN MY HEART.

194
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,166
IN THE DEVIL KING, ODA NOBUNAGA,

195
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,833
ALL I FELT WAS UNFATHOMABLE
DARKNESS AND STAGNATION.

196
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,125
THERE IS ONE MAN
I TRULY WISH TO FIGHT.

197
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,375
- BIG BOSS OF OSHU,
DATE MASAMUNE.

198
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,041
- THE ONE-EYED DRAGON.

199
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,583
AFTER THE DEVIL KING
HAS BEEN PUT DOWN,

200
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,041
I SWEAR WE SHALL
HAVE OUR DECISIVE BATTLE.

201
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,458
- IT SEEMS HE'S FOUND HIMSELF
QUITE THE ADMIRER.

202
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,916
- ONE-EYED DRAGON.

203
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,750
- WHAT'S UP, LADY-KILLER?

204
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,500
- UESUGI'S FORCE SHOULD BE
PASSING THROUGH SHINANO BY NOW,

205
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,166
MAKING THEIR WAY TO KAI.

206
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,250
- HUH. LOOKING FOR A REMATCH
OF KAWANAKAJIMA?

207
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,041
- NO, THEY'LL INVADE
OWARI ALONGSIDE TAKEDA

208
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,708
USING US AS THEIR SPEARHEAD.

209
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,125
- DON'T THINK POORLY OF ME.

210
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,125
EVEN IF I HADN'T SPURRED
YOU ON, YOU WOULD'VE...

211
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,958
- DON'T STRESS OUT. KOJURO
ALREADY SAW THROUGH ALL THAT.

212
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,416
THERE COULD BE A MILLION
OTHERS AT MY HEELS,

213
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,416
BUT I WILL TAKE THE
DEVIL KING'S HEAD.

214
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,708
- WAIT AND SEE.

215
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,750
- ( chuckles )

216
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,541
- THEN I SWEEP THROUGH
AND SEIZE THE REST

217
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,791
WITH TAKEDA AND
UESUGI RIGHT THERE,

218
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,000
I'LL CRUSH THEM FIRST.

219
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,208
- ( screams )

220
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,541
- KIND OF TOO BAD THOUGH,

221
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,416
I WANTED TO SAVE MY FUN
WITH HIM UNTIL THE END.

222
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,083
- ( horse neighing )

223
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,791
- ( gasps )

224
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,666
- TAKEDA'S NINJA SPOKE TRUE.

225
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,291
BROTHER-IN LAW,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

226
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,458
- MY HUSBAND, PLEASE...
- ICHI, YOU MUST FLEE AT ONCE.

227
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,083
THOUGH I DOUBT EVEN THE DEVIL
KING WOULD KILL HIS OWN SISTER,

228
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,750
I WON'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

229
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,250
- Azai's soldier: READY.

230
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,541
- AKECHI MITSUHIDE?

231
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,458
- WELL, LORD AZAI NAGAMASA.

232
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,291
TOWARD WHAT FIELD OF
BATTLE MIGHT YOU BE HEADED?

233
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,875
- I LEAD MY TROOPS TO ECHIZEN,

234
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,916
IN PURSUIT OF AN ARMY
OF DARK INTENT,

235
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,708
WHO WISH HARM UPON
MY SWORN FRIEND, ASAKURA.

236
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,291
- AND WHERE, MASTER AKECHI,
MIGHT YOU BE HEADED?

237
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,291
- ( chuckles )

238
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,541
BY ALL APPEARANCES, IT WOULD
SEEM THIS "ARMY OF DARK INTENT"

239
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,875
YOU REFERENCE IS US.

240
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,875
- YOU WOULD BREAK A PACT
MADE BETWEEN WARRIORS

241
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,208
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

242
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,875
- I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO DEEM YOU TRUE EVIL.

243
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,291
- MY LORD, WAIT.

244
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:15,875
- ICHI, PLEASE. GO NOW.
AKECHI MITSUHIDE, LISTEN WELL,

245
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,708
FOR AZAI HEREBY DECLARES
OUR ALLIANCE VOID.

246
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,791
SOLDIERS OF JUSTICE,
FOLLOW ME TO VICTORY.

247
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,708
IN THE NAME OF PEACE,
LET US ERADICATE EVIL.

248
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,583
- IS THAT WISE? YOUR WIFE
IS LORD NOBUNAGA'S SISTER.

249
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,458
IF YOU WERE TO SEVER
THE BLOOD BOND,

250
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,500
WHO WOULD BE THE ONE TO GRIEVE?

251
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,416
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ICHI? RUN.

252
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,250
- I CANNOT RUN, MY LORD.

253
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,750
- I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL, AZAI.

254
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,291
YOU CAN ASK
THE DEVIL KING YOURSELF.

255
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,791
- Oda: NAGAMASA, TO WHAT
PURPOSE DO YOU STAND

256
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,375
IN MITSUHIDE'S PATH?

257
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,125
- MY ANSWER, LORD BROTHER,
IS A QUESTION FOR YOU.

258
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,333
WHY DO YOU BREAK THE
PACT YOU MADE WITH ME

259
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,958
AND SEEK TO DESTROY ASAKURA?

260
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,166
THE PROSPERITY THE
AZAI ENJOY TODAY,

261
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,416
IS OWED TO THE SUPPORT ASAKURA
HAS SHOWN US SINCE DAYS OF OLD.

262
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,750
AND YOU ARE A BLOOD RELATIVE
OF MY BELOVED WIFE.

263
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,458
BOUND BY HONOR TO BOTH,

264
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,750
MY HEART AS A WARRIOR,
NO AS A HUMAN BEING,

265
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,541
DEEMS YOU EVIL AND URGES ME
TO DRAW MY SWORD.

266
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,833
- THIS WAS, THIS WAS MY FAULT.

267
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,125
- YOU SIMPERING IMBECILE.

268
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,875
ALL RIGHT. ODA WILL
NOT ATTACK ASAKURA.

269
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,916
- THANK YOU. I AM GLAD YOU
RECONSIDERED, BROTHER-IN-LAW.

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,083
- YOU WILL DO IT FOR ME.

271
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,583
- ( gasps ) I'M SORRY, MY LORD,
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

272
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,166
- MITSUHIDE.
- SIR.

273
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,375
- WHAT ARE YOU...
- DO NOT MOVE!

274
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,875
- DEAR BROTHER.

275
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,166
- LORD ODA, WHAT IS THIS?

276
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,708
- AZAI NAGAMASA, YOU WILL
DESTROY ASAKURA IN MY STEAD.

277
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,250
- WHAT? THIS IS INSANITY.

278
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,000
YOU INSULT ME WITH THREATS
OF UNSPEAKABLE HORROR.

279
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,541
OUR VOW OF BROTHERHOOD
IS MEANINGLESS.

280
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,833
I HAVE BUT ONE COURSE
AGAINST SUCH EVIL.

281
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,958
I AM SWORN TO DESTROY IT.

282
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,250
- I AM THE DEVIL KING
OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN,

283
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,291
I TRANSCEND HUMANITY.

284
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,125
ONLY DEATH AWAITS
THOSE WHO DEFY ME.

285
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:36,583
- FAREWELL, LORD NAGAMASA.
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

286
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,166
- ICHI! NO!

287
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,208
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

288
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,541
- ( laughs ) SO MUCH
FOR THE "MAN OF JUSTICE."

289
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,541
- LORD NAGAMASA.

290
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,500
- LITTLE BROTHER,
I CAN BE FORGIVING.

291
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,041
BUT THERE WILL NOT BE
A SECOND TIME.

292
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,500
- IF YOU ABIDE THE
TERMS OF OUR NEW PACT,

293
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,375
WE SHALL RETURN THE
LADY O-ICHI TO YOU.

294
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,625
- IN TRUTH, IT IS YOU

295
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,583
WHOM I WOULD MOST
LIKE TO FACE THIS DAY.

296
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,083
- LIKEWISE.

297
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,541
THIS IS ALL OR NOTHING.

298
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,416
IN DISPELLING THE
THREAT OF THE DEVIL KING,

299
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,625
WE ENSURE A FUTURE FOR ALL.

300
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,833
LET US FIGHT FOR THE SAKE
OF A TIME WHEN ALL MAY CHOOSE

301
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,541
THEIR OWN PATH WITHOUT RESERVE.

302
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,708
- ( cheering )

303
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,958
- YOUNG CUB.
I SHALL BE COUNTING ON YOU.

304
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,791
- SIR, I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

305
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,166
- Narrator: TAKEDA SHINGEN
CONTINUED TO SEND LETTERS

306
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,208
ASKING FOR THE DEFECTION
OF TOKUGAWA,

307
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,125
WHO WAS ALLIED WITH
ODA AND CHARGED

308
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,208
WITH WATCHING THE EASTERN LANDS.

309
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,208
IF IEYASU CAN BE CONVINCED,

310
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,833
AND USING DATE'S INDEPENDENT
ADVANCE AS THEIR SPEARHEAD,

311
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,708
THEIR MANEUVER AGAINST ODA
WILL BE ALL THE STRONGER.

312
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,000
HOWEVER, IF HE
DECLINES YET AGAIN,

313
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,625
THEY WILL NOT ONLY HAVE
TO STAVE OFF TOKUGAWA,

314
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,083
BUT ALSO PREVENT
HIM FROM SENDING

315
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,041
A DETACHMENT AGAINST DATE.

316
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,666
- Tokugawa: "WHILE I AM SORRY
TO TROUBLE YOU IN THIS WAY,

317
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,250
I ASK FOR YOUR AGREEMENT."
"BUT IF IT IS NOT TO BE..."

318
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,541
- ( grunts ) DAMN IT,
LORD SHINGEN.

319
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,875
YOU MUST KNOW
THE POSITION I AM IN.

320
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,666
YOU ARE FULLY AWARE
THAT I AM BOUND

321
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,041
BY AN ALLIANCE WITH ODA

322
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,333
AND CANNOT COMPLY.

323
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,333
WHY MUST YOU
CONSTANTLY BEDEVIL ME?

324
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,083
I ONCE SUFFERED A CRUSHING
DEFEAT BY TAKEDA'S HAND,

325
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,625
AND I WILL SOMEDAY
VINDICATE MY HONOR.

326
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,750
IF HE INTENDS TO
CHALLENGE ME BY FORCE,

327
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,416
TOKUGAWA IEYASU, GLADLY ACCEPTS.

328
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,500
- SO, ONE-EYED DRAGON,

329
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,125
WHO WAS THAT WARRIOR YOU
MENTIONED THE OTHER DAY?

330
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,875
- OOPS.
- AH.

331
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,541
- ONCE YOU'VE DEFEATED
THE DEVIL KING,

332
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,458
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
YOU WANT TO FIGHT?

333
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,958
- YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.
- I COULD SEE YOUR HEART.

334
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,291
- HUH?

335
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,583
- THERE'S A LOOK ABOUT YOU
WHEN YOU THINK OF HIM.

336
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,000
- HUH?

337
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,750
- IT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A FIGHT AND A WAR.

338
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,041
- ( chuckles )

339
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,916
- MITSUHIDE.

340
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,875
- WHY IS YOUR ARMY
NOT AT YOUR BACK?

341
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,958
- DO YOU INTEND TO TRY
AND NEGOTIATE?

342
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,333
- INDEED. IT IS MY HOPE
I MAY CONVINCE ASAKURA

343
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,916
TO SURRENDER TO ODA
WITHOUT BLOODSHED.

344
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,500
- OR PERHAPS, YOU HOPE
TO SWAY HIM TO THE SIDE

345
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,250
OF THE EASTERN GENERALS,
WITH THEIR PATHETIC LITTLE PLOT.

346
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:08,041
SURELY, THEY INVITED YOU
TO JOIN THEM BUT KNOWING YOU,

347
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,750
I'M CERTAIN YOU MOST
OBSTINATELY REFUSED.

348
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,791
- NOR WILL I JOIN THEM NOW.

349
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,291
- AS THEIR SPEARHEAD,

350
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:18,125
OSHU'S ONE-EYED DRAGON AND
HIS ARMY ARE CLOSING IN FAST,

351
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,833
HOPING TO TAKE
THE DEVIL KING'S HEAD.

352
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,208
- ONE-EYED DRAGON?

353
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,458
- TOKUGAWA IS MOVING
TO HOLD BACK TAKEDA

354
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,583
AND UESUGI AT NAGASHINO.

355
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:30,125
IF DATE GETS PAST THEM,
IT WILL BE PROBLEMATIC.

356
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,291
AT THE MOMENT, I BELIEVE
THAT IS MORE PRESSING

357
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,625
THAN ASAKURA.

358
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,916
YOU MUST KNOW WHY I HAVE
REVEALED THIS ONLY TO YOU.

359
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,791
YOU MUST SHOW HONOR IN
BATTLE FOR LORD NOBUNAGA

360
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,708
TO ACCEPT A PEACEFUL
END WITH ASAKURA.

361
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,916
AND SHOULD HE NOT,

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,416
LADY O-ICHI'S LIFE WOULD
HANG IN THE BALANCE.

363
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,541
- HE WOULDN'T.

364
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,166
- I AM STRUCK BY YOUR UNDYING
FAITH IN THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE.

365
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,916
THAT SAID, THIS IS ABOUT
ALL I CAN DO FOR YOU.

366
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,083
- THEN I, AZAI NAGAMASA,
SHALL BE A SHIELD AND REPEL

367
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,500
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON.
BUT AFTER WHICH,

368
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,500
I DO INTEND TO RESUME
MY COURSE WITH ASAKURA.

369
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,958
- UNDERSTOOD. I SHALL
CONVEY YOUR MESSAGE.

370
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,083
- MY DEEPEST GRATITUDE.

371
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,875
- I AM GLAD THAT
IN SOME SMALL WAY,

372
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:24,166
I AM ABLE TO HELP YOU CARRY
OUT JUSTICE, AZAI NAGAMASA.

373
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,875
- Narrator: THE CURRENT
OF THESE TURBULENT TIMES

374
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,541
WAS ABOUT TO SHIFT IRREVOCABLY.

375
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,583
THOSE WHO WOULD CARVE
OUT THEIR OWN PATH.

376
00:21:54,666 --> 00:22:01,500
THOSE BEING TOYED WITH.
THOSE RESIGNED ONLY TO FATE.

377
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,041
EACH OF THEIR DESTINIES
WOULD CROSS BLADES

378
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,041
IN A FIGHT FOR SUPREMACY.

379
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,875
- SOLDIERS OF JUSTICE, FALL IN.
PREPARE FOR BATTLE.

380
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,458
THE AZAI ARMY SHALL NOT REST
UNTIL THE ONE-EYED DRAGON,

381
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,625
DATE MASAMUNE, IS OBLITERATED!

382
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,000
- ( theme song playing )

383
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,333
- Tokugawa: FINALLY, NEXT
TIME WILL BE OUR TURN

384
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,750
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

385
00:23:55,833 --> 00:24:00,916
TADAKATSU, ATTACK CONFIGURATION.
ANNIHILATE THE ENEMY.
