1
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,375
- LORD NAGAMASA, RUN!

2
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,875
- ( gunshots )

3
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,208
- ( groans )

4
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,458
ICHI.

5
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,541
- ( gunshots )

6
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,708
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,166
- ( chuckles )

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,708
- ( grunting )

9
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,083
- MY LORD NAGAMASA.

10
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,958
LORD NAGAMASA.
MY HUSBAND, NO.

11
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,833
- ICHI, THIS IS A
FIELD OF BATTLE.

12
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,166
IT ISN'T SAFE FOR YOU HERE.

13
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,916
- ( crying )

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,916
- Akechi: ( chuckles ) THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICES RENDERED,

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,083
LADY O-ICHI. I DO FEEL
IT'S WORTH MENTIONING

16
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,291
THAT YOU DID NOT ACCOMPLISH
ONE OF YOUR OBJECTIVES.

17
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:12,166
WORKED OUT IN THE END, THOUGH.
LADY O-ICHI'S MARRIAGE INTO

18
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,000
THE AZAI WAS THE GROUNDWORK
FOR AN ATTACK ON ASAKURA.

19
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,708
- ( gasps )

20
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,625
- HER ROLE WAS SEDUCTION,
OF COURSE.

21
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,916
NOT JUST OF YOU, BUT OF
YOUR TOP GENERALS,

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,833
TO UNDERMINE YOUR AUTHORITY.
OR SO IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO.

23
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,041
BUT LADY O-ICHI WAS
INCAPABLE OF THIS.

24
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,375
BECAUSE, LIKE A FOOL,
SHE FELL IN LOVE.

25
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,166
LIKE A PUPPET ON A STRING,

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,875
TOO PROUD TO REVEAL
HER TRUE SELF,

27
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:42,125
YET TOO WEAK TO CARRY
OUT HER SECRET MISSION.

28
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,958
BECAUSE SHE CHOSE TO
NURTURE HER MARITAL BONDS,

29
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,250
SHE BROUGHT ABOUT AN
EVEN MORE TRAGIC END.

30
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,833
FOR THOSE CLOSEST TO HER
NOW SHARE IN HER MISFORTUNE.

31
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,375
BEAUTIFUL TO BEHOLD,
ROTTEN TO THE CORE,

32
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,625
SISTER OF THE DEVIL KING.

33
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:02,000
- ICHI, HAVE YOU TRULY
DECEIVED ME ALL THIS TIME?

34
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,541
- MY LORD HUSBAND, I AM SORRY.

35
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,500
YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF AZAI,
YOU DESERVED BETTER.

36
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:14,833
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
I AM SORRY, SO SORRY.

37
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,000
- ( gasps )

38
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,458
- HOW YOU MUST HAVE SUFFERED.

39
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,708
- YOU NEEDN'T BE
MAUDLIN ANY LONGER.

40
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,333
- LORD NAGAMASA.

41
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,583
- ( choking )

42
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,958
MY SOLDIERS OF JUSTICE,
I'M SORRY.

43
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,666
WHILE PERISHING HERE
IS MY DEEPEST REGRET.

44
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,333
I, NAGAMASA, HAVE UPHELD
JUSTICE TO MY VERY LAST BREATH.

45
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,416
ICHI, TELL ME I
WAS NOT WRONG,

46
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,875
THAT ALL OF THIS
WAS NOT IN VAIN.

47
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,750
- NO, MY BELOVED,
YOU WERE NOT WRONG.

48
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,166
YOU WERE NEVER WRONG.

49
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,000
- THANK YOU.
ICHI, I LOVE YOU.

50
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,083
- NAGAMASA? NAGAMASA? NAGAMASA.

51
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,166
( crying )

52
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,958
- ( chuckles ) YOUR WEEPING, MY
LADY O-ICHI IS MUSIC TO MY EARS.

53
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,083
- KOJURO.
- SIR.

54
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,291
BOSS, WHAT'RE YOU...

55
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,041
- WE MEET AGAIN.

56
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,666
- ( chuckles ) CRASHING
OTHER PEOPLE'S BATTLES

57
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,750
IS GETTING TO BE YOUR SPECIALTY.

58
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:42,583
AND TO THINK NOT
A SINGLE ROUND HIT YOU.

59
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,833
- IT SEEMS YOU'RE
EXTRAORDINARILY LUCKY.

60
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,833
- YOU SERVE THE DEVIL KING?

61
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,041
- MASAMUNE, DON'T DO THIS, SIR!
- THIS MAN WAS YOUR SHIELD.

62
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,541
HE FOUGHT FOR YOU
AND YOU GUNNED HIM DOWN

63
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,666
FROM BEHIND LIKE A RABID DOG.

64
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,500
THIS AGGRESSION WILL NOT STAND.

65
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,333
- ( laughs ) I SEE
YOU'RE ANGRY, ONE-EYED DRAGON.

66
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:05,666
- SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE FUN?
- YOU ARE ON. LOTS OF LUCK!

67
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,458
- YOU FREAK, WHAT THE
HELL IS WITH THE DRUNK

68
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,833
LOOK ON YOUR FACE?

69
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,583
- MY DEAR BOY, I AM
SAVORING THE AFTERGLOW.

70
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,875
- WHAT?

71
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,875
- NOTHING IN THE WORLD
GIVES ME GREATER DELIGHT

72
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:23,625
THAN TRAMPLING THE STEADFAST
BOND BETWEEN TWO LOVERS.

73
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,166
THE ONLY PLEASURE
THAT COULD EVEN COMPARE...

74
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:33,000
WOULD BE A WORTHY FOE,
DRENCHED IN BLOOD AND TEARS,

75
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,125
GROVELING AT MY FEET
FOR HIS LIFE.

76
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,625
NOW, LET THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN!

77
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,750
- ( grunts )

78
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,583
- THERE'S IEYASU!
- GET HIM!

79
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,500
- ( screams )

80
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:53,958
- TADAKATSU?

81
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,625
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
TADAKATSU? WHY?

82
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,208
- MY LORD IEYASU,
ODA HAS FORSAKEN US.

83
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,750
NO, WORSE. HE HAS DECEIVED US.

84
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,791
- WE WERE COUNTING ON
HIS ARQUEBUS CORE.

85
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,500
WE'RE SO BADLY OUTNUMBERED,

86
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,166
NOW, OUR DESTRUCTION
IS INEVITABLE.

87
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,666
- IF WE RETREAT...
- RETREAT?

88
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,083
BUT IF WE WITHDRAW NOW,

89
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,000
IT WOULD DISHONOR THE MEN
WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES HERE.

90
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,250
- IF WE DO NOT,

91
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,791
WE WILL CERTAINLY SHARE
THE SAME FATE AS AZAI.

92
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,291
- PLEASE, LORD,
MAKE YOUR DECISION.

93
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,750
- ALL RIGHT, WITHDRAW.

94
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,166
WHAT'RE YOU...

95
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,166
TADAKATSU!

96
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,208
- ( Japanese song playing )

97
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,041
- IT WOULD SEEM MASTER TADAKATSU
PLANS TO ACT AS OUR REAR GUARD

98
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,625
AND HOLD OFF THE ENEMY.

99
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,416
- ( all screaming )

100
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,791
- SO, YOU WISH TO DO BATTLE
WITH SANADA YUKIMURA.

101
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,750
JUST COME BACK ALIVE.

102
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,875
PULL OUT! ALL UNITS, RETREAT!

103
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,958
- YUKIMURA, THE SO-CALLED
GREATEST WARRIOR IN THE LAND,

104
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,791
RECOGNIZES YOU
AS AN EXCEPTIONAL GENERAL.

105
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,583
HOLD YOUR GROUND,
BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE.

106
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,833
- SIR. I PROMISE YOU,
I WILL NOT FAIL.

107
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,583
- ALL UNITS! ON ME!

108
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,958
- ( cheering )

109
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,916
- KEIJI, TURN BACK.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,750
- PLEASE, KENSHIN, LET ME GO.
IF I TURN BACK NOW,

111
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,416
WHO WILL DEFEAT
THE DEVIL KING. AND WHEN?

112
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
- WE WILL SIMPLY
HAVE TO REGROUP.

113
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,708
- HOW CAN WE?

114
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,416
- WE STILL DRAW
BREATH, DO WE NOT?

115
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,750
- I'M SORRY, THIS IS ONE TIME
WHERE EVEN YOUR REQUEST

116
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,041
ISN'T GOING TO STOP ME. YAH!

117
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,000
- KEIJI!

118
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
- ( all yelling )

119
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,500
- Tokugawa's soldier:
TAKEDA SHINGEN IS CLOSING IN!

120
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,541
- PLEASE, LORD IEYASU,
LET US MAKE HASTE.

121
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,291
- TADAKATSU.

122
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,041
- REFINED TECHNIQUE,

123
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,833
A KIND HEART, LOVE OF YOUR LORD
AND LOVE OF YOUR COMRADES,

124
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,666
MASTER HONDA TADAKATSU,

125
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,500
YOU TRULY ARE THE GREATEST
WARRIOR IN THE LAND.

126
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,541
LORD IEYASU IS A GENERAL

127
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:50,958
WORTHY OF LAYING DOWN YOUR
LIFE TO FOLLOW. HOWEVER,

128
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,208
HE SOUGHT TO SAFEGUARD HIS
HOUSE BY ALIGNING WITH ODA.

129
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,416
WAITING FOR THE WINDS TO CHANGE.

130
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,041
EVEN IF IT WAS UNAVOIDABLE,

131
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:02,208
HIS ONLY MEANS OF SURVIVAL,
TO ME, IT'S JUST...

132
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,958
( screams )

133
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,958
TIGER FLAME!

134
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,541
- ( all scream )

135
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,458
- IF WE DO ESCAPE,
THEN TO WHAT PURPOSE?

136
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,916
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU GUYS.

137
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,333
I MUST PROTECT
THE HOUSE OF TOKUGAWA.

138
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,416
- Nohime: SO, YOU PLAN TO
JOIN THE EASTERN ALLIANCE,

139
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,791
LITTLE TAKETCHIYO?

140
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,041
- LADY NOHIME.

141
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,541
- THAT'S TOO BAD.
I'D COME TO HELP.

142
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,041
- ( gunshots )

143
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,625
- LORD SHINGEN.

144
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,208
- BRIDE OF ODA, YOU
WOULD SELL HIS SOUL

145
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,666
AND STAIN YOUR HANDS
IN HIS BLOOD?

146
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,208
- ( gunshots )

147
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,666
- THE WORLD BELONGS
TO MY HUSBAND.

148
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,708
TRY AND DIE LIKE MEN.

149
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,500
- MASTER HONDA, LOOK OVER THERE!

150
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,958
ODA SEEKS TO DESTROY
NOT ONLY MY ARMY,

151
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,916
BUT TO CUT OFF TOKUGAWA'S PATH
OF RETREAT AT THE SAME TIME.

152
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,958
IT IS STILL NOT TOO
LATE TO FIX THIS.

153
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,875
IF WE WORK TOGETHER, WE CAN
DEFEAT THE DEVIL KING.

154
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,083
- JOIN WITH US.
- Tokugawa: TADAKATSU!

155
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,375
TADAKATSU, I'M ON MY WAY!

156
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,958
- MY LORD KAZUSANOSUKE

157
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,208
DID NOT WISH TO MAKE
AN ENEMY OF YOU.

158
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,625
- ( gasps ) THE LADY ODA? WHAT?

159
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,750
- HONDA TADAKATSU,
ENJOY A HERO'S DEATH.

160
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,875
- ( loud explosion )

161
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,041
- ( screams ) MASTER HONDA.

162
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,375
- Tadakatsu!

163
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,291
- ( loud explosion )

164
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,000
- TADAKATSU!

165
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,791
- MASTER HONDA!

166
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:33,500
- ( chuckles ) WITH THAT,
THE EASTERN LANDS ARE CRIPPLED.

167
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,291
RIPE FOR EXTINCTION
ANY GIVEN TIME.

168
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,625
- ( grunts )

169
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,958
- WHAT'S WRONG, ONE-EYED
DRAGON? I EXPECTED MORE.

170
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,958
SO, ARE YOU GOING TO DANCE
FOR ME, OR NOT?

171
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,375
- NICE SPEECH. YOU COULD BE
HELL'S GATEKEEPER.

172
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,291
- MASAMUNE, GIVE THE ORDER
TO WITHDRAW.

173
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,166
WITH THAT MANY
FIREARMS TRAINED ON US,

174
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,500
IF WE FACE THEM HEAD-ON,
WE'LL BE WIPED OUT.

175
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,291
AS YOUR RIGHT EYE, I WILL
SHARE THIS SHAME WITH YOU.

176
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,583
- ( laughs )

177
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,750
- DAMN IT. SOUND THE RETREAT.

178
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,333
- RETREAT! RETREAT!

179
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,875
- ( blowing )

180
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,416
- ( chuckles ) I SUPPOSE
WE'LL HOLD FIRE.

181
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,583
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM SPORTING.

182
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,041
- ( Japanese song playing )

183
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,750
- ( Tokugawa crying )

184
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,875
- Sanada: YOUR LORDSHIP.

185
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,375
- YOU ARE SAFE, I SEE.

186
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:07,416
- SIR, MASTER HONDA THREW ME
CLEAR OF NOHIME'S ATTACK.

187
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,416
HONESTLY, HE SAVED MY LIFE.

188
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,208
BUT YOUR LORDSHIP, I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND WHY ODA ATTACKED

189
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,083
TOKUGAWA IN THE FIRST PLACE.

190
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,291
I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALLIES.

191
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,625
- THEIR ALLIANCE WAS LIKELY
BASED ON ODA WANTING TO KEEP

192
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,083
TADAKATSU'S STRENGTH AT BAY.

193
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,958
JUST AS HE ATTEMPTED
TO DIVIDE AZAI AND ASAKURA,

194
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,625
WHO MIGHT HAVE FORMED
A STRONG ARMY AGAINST HIM.

195
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,916
- TOKUGAWA MUST HAVE
BEEN DECEIVED AS WELL.

196
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,875
- THAT IS SO DASTARDLY.

197
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,958
- ALL BLAME RESTS ON MY
SHOULDERS. I BELIEVED IN HIM.

198
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,416
I MADE A DEAL WITH
THE DEVIL KING

199
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,250
IN HOPES OF WINNING BATTLES,

200
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,833
AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S WROUGHT.

201
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,625
( grunts )

202
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,000
TADAKATSU, I WANTED
TO CONQUER THIS WORLD

203
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,916
WITH YOU AT MY SIDE.

204
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,416
( crying ) TADAKATSU.

205
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,958
- TADAKATSU WAS NOT
YOUR ONLY STRENGTH,

206
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,416
NOT WHEN YOU STILL HAVE LOYAL
TROOPS WHO WILL STAND BY YOU.

207
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,166
YOU UPHELD TWO THINGS TODAY.

208
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,708
YOUR WORD AND THE SPIRIT
OF THE MIKAWA WARRIOR.

209
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,833
- I, SHINGEN, SAW IT ALL.
- I'M SO SORRY.

210
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,250
LORD SHINGEN, THOUGH
I HAVE LOST TADAKATSU

211
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,583
AND MANY OF MY SOLDIERS,
I NOW HUMBLY ASK TO JOIN

212
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,666
IN YOUR FIGHT TO DEFEAT
THE CURSED DEVIL KING.

213
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,875
- YUKIMURA, TRANSPORT AS MANY OF
THE INJURED AS POSSIBLE TO KAI.

214
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,000
- EXTEND OUR HELP,
REGARDLESS OF CLAN.

215
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,416
- SIR.

216
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,666
- Keiji: I HAVE TO WONDER,

217
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,333
HOW MANY OF THEM FOUGHT
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO?

218
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,166
SUCH IS WAR.
IT AFFECTS EVERYONE,

219
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,208
WHETHER THEY CHOOSE
IT TO OR NOT.

220
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,125
THE MEN DOWN THERE COULD
HAVE BEEN SINGERS OR ARTISTS,

221
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:59,125
OR SOME OF THEM EVEN POETS
AND SCHOLARS. WIVES AND LOVERS,

222
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,166
SONS AND DAUGHTERS,
MOTHERS AND FATHERS

223
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,500
WHOSE LOVE CAN
NEVER BE REPAID.

224
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,958
ALL LEFT BEHIND WITH ONLY TEARS.

225
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,250
THAT IS WHAT I WANTED
TO PUT AN END TO.

226
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,125
- A DEMON RUNNING AMOK
CAN ONLY BE PUT DOWN

227
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,916
WITH THE USE OF FORCE.

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,708
KEIJI, WILL YOU GO
TO THE WEST FOR ME?

229
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,250
WITH THE INLAND SEA OF SETO
BETWEEN THEM, MORI AND CHOSOKABE

230
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,833
ARE ON THE VERGE OF HOSTILITIES.
GO WIN THEM OVER.

231
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:29,083
- IF ODA GETS PAST THEM,
OUR PLANS WILL BE FOR NOTHING.

232
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,625
- I AM NOT SAYING
IT WILL BE EASY.

233
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,000
BUT WE MUST ACT BEFORE
THE DEVIL KING'S MENACE

234
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,708
BLANKETS THIS LAND
OF THE RISING SUN.

235
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,833
- ( squeals )

236
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,958
- GIVE MY REGARDS TO YOUR GOD,

237
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,625
I'M SURE I COULD USE
BISHAMONTEN'S HELP.

238
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,041
- MASAMUNE?
- Sanada: ONE-EYED DRAGON, WAIT!

239
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,125
LORD MASAMUNE!

240
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:02,958
IT IS FAR TO OSHU. COME TO KAI,
YOU CAN REST THERE.

241
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,833
- MASAMUNE, LET US TAKE
THE TAKEDA CLAN'S OFFER.

242
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,500
WE HAVE MANY INJURED.

243
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,083
MASAMUNE, SIR?

244
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,250
- MASAMUNE!
- BIG BOSS!

245
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,291
- MY LORD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

246
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,541
- HOW DID I NOT NOTICE YOU HAD
BEEN STRUCK BY AN ARQUEBUS?

247
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:47,250
I BLAME MYSELF. I COULD HAVE
STOPPED YOUR FIGHT WITH AKECHI.

248
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,875
AS YOUR RIGHT EYE,
I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.

249
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,875
- ( footsteps approaching )

250
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,041
- BOSS MASAMUNE WILL BE FINE.

251
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,708
- ( all sighs )

252
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,708
- ENOUGH! QUIT MOPING
AND MAKE YOURSELVES USEFUL.

253
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,166
GATHER ALL OUR ABLE-BODIED MEN
AND GET OUT THERE!

254
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,875
FOLLOW TAKEDA'S EXAMPLE
AND TEND TO THE INJURED.

255
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,541
- NO MATTER WHAT
FAMILY THEY CLAIM.

256
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,916
- All: SIR.

257
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,916
- FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY,
I MUST THANK YOU.

258
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,875
- IT SEEMS HE IS NO
LONGER AT DEATH'S DOOR

259
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,416
BUT HE HAS LOST QUITE
A LOT OF BLOOD.

260
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,416
MY PEOPLE ARE PREPARING
SOMETHING TO POUR DOWN

261
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,291
HIS THROAT. IT SHOULD HELP HIM.

262
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,875
- AGAIN, MY THANKS.

263
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,666
- RIGHT EYE OF THE DRAGON,
DO YOU RESENT OUR USE

264
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,750
OF DATE'S ARMY AS THE
SPEARHEAD IN OUR ATTACK?

265
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,416
- WE HAVE ALWAYS ACTED
OF OUR OWN ACCORD.

266
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,541
FROM THE START, OUR ACTIONS
WERE UNRELATED

267
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:44,041
TO YOURS AND UESUGI'S.

268
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,250
- THERE ARE GENERALS WHO
STILL WISH TO FIGHT OVER LAND.

269
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,750
IT IS THEIR HOPE THAT
WE OURSELVES FALL,

270
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,416
AS WE DEFEAT ODA.

271
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,583
HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE MAN,
ONE WHO IS NOT A GENERAL,

272
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,583
WHO WE HAVE SENT TO SPEAK
TO MORI AND CHOSOKABE.

273
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,416
- MAEDA KEIJI.

274
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,958
- WITH US ALLIED AT HIS BACK,

275
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,500
HE HAD PLANNED TO
FACE ODA ON HIS OWN.

276
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,083
HE HAD HOPED TO RESOLVE
THE MATTER WITHOUT BLOODSHED.

277
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,041
A FASCINATING MAN. IT'S A
SHAME HE SQUANDERED

278
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,666
HIS TALENTS FOR SO
LONG AS A VAGABOND.

279
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,916
- I ASSUMED HE'D
PLANNED THE OPPOSITE.

280
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,750
- VICTORY IS POINTLESS IF IT
LEAVES US ALL COMPLETELY SPENT.

281
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,041
TIME IS SHORT, BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE ODA FULLY ENCIRCLED

282
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,416
BEFORE WE ATTEMPT THIS AGAIN.

283
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,958
- IT WILL BE MOST DIFFICULT
TO GET MORI AND CHOSOKABE

284
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,708
TO YOUR SIDE.

285
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,875
ALSO, THE IDEA OF TEAMING UP
TO DEFEAT A COMMON ENEMY,

286
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,541
IS NOT THE WAY OF THE DATE.

287
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,666
BUT...

288
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,166
NECESSITY KNOWS NO LAW.

289
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,125
- ONE-EYED DRAGON,
LORD DATE MASAMUNE,

290
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,375
AFTER WE HAVE
DEFEATED THE DEVIL KING,

291
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,000
LET US MEET ON THE
FIELD OF DECISIVE BATTLE.

292
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,375
LET US SETTLE OUR RIVALRY
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

293
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,791
- LORD NAGAMASA.

294
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:34,333
- MITSUHIDE, YOU WERE AWARE
OF THE EASTERN CLANS' MOVEMENTS,

295
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,291
YET YOU REMAINED SILENT.

296
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,875
- THEY WERE A PATHETIC
BAND OF WEAKLINGS.

297
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,083
I JUDGED THEM TO BE OF
NO REAL THREAT TO US.

298
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,041
- IT IS FOR LORD ODA
TO PASS JUDGMENT.

299
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,416
YOU PUT A CHINK IN THEIR ARMOR,

300
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,208
BUT HAD YOU NOT SET THE
ARQUEBUSES AGAINST DATE,

301
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,125
TAKEDA'S CAVALRY
COULD HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT.

302
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,958
WHAT'S MORE, YOU CAUSED
AZAI'S POINTLESS DEATH.

303
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,000
AND FORCED OUR HAND IN
DISSOLVING OUR ALLIANCE

304
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,166
WITH TOKUGAWA.

305
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,750
AN ARRANGEMENT STILL
OF GREAT USE TO US.

306
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,833
- WHICH GAVE YOU THE CHANCE
TO KILL HONDA TADAKATSU.

307
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,416
AS FOR AZAI, WE HAD PLANNED
TO CRUSH HIM ALONG WITH ASAKURA.

308
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,666
WITH THE EASTERN
