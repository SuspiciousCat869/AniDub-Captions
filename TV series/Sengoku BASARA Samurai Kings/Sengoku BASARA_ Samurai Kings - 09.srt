1
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,583
- Narrator: AT THE BATTLE
AT NAGASHINO,

2
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,833
THE ODA ARMY FROM OWARI
DELIVERED A CRUSHING BLOW

3
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,041
TO THE EASTERN LANDS.

4
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,000
THE DEVIL KING THEN ADVANCED
HIS ARMY TO THE FAR SOUTHERN END

5
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,791
OF THE LAND OF
THE RISING SUN.

6
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,208
AND COMMENCED HIS INVASION
OF THE ISLAND OF KYUSHU.

7
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,500
- YE'VE ACCEPTED OUR SURRENDER,

8
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:04,208
BUT STILL YOU TRY AND MASSACRE
THE REST OF US?

9
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,250
NO, SIR. I WILL NOT ABIDE
YOUR BOORISH ACTIONS.

10
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:12,166
- YOU OLD FOOL,
JUST WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?

11
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,416
- I'LL HAVE TO SHOW YOU
THE STUBBORN PRIDE OF SATSUMA.

12
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,041
- THIS WAS INEVITABLE.

13
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,500
- ( grunting )

14
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,833
- ( gun firing )

15
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,041
- ( grunting )

16
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,250
- ( groaning )

17
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,916
WELL, ISN'T THIS A REAL
KICK IN THE TEETH.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,541
I S'POSE I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE
THE REST TO THE YOUNG'UNS.

19
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,416
- MAY YOUR SOUL SCATTER
TO THE WINDS OF DESTRUCTION.

20
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,791
- Narrator:
HAVING GAINED A FOOTHOLD

21
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,541
ON THE SOUTHERN TIP OF KYUSHU,

22
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,541
THE ODA ARMY PROCEEDED NORTH.

23
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:22,000
DEFEATING FIRST HYUGA,
THEN HIGO AND SOON...

24
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,541
- THAT COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN EASIER.

25
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,291
BURN IT ALL TO THE GROUND!

26
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,791
- ( theme song playing )

27
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,875
- YOUR WOUND FROM NAGASHINO
SEEMS TO BE ON THE MEND.

28
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,583
- YEAH, I COULD GO AFTER THE
DEVIL KING'S HEAD AT ANY TIME.

29
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,458
- I'M RELIEVED YOUR INJURIES DID
NOT PROVE TO BE GRAVE.

30
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,000
- SURE, NO THANKS TO YOU.

31
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,208
WHAT DO YOU SAY, KOJURO?
WANNA GO ANOTHER ROUND?

32
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,458
- SIR, I WILL BE YOUR SPARRING
PARTNER WHENEVER YOU LIKE.

33
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,625
- LORD MASAMUNE...

34
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,083
- WHAT'S UP?

35
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,791
- ONCE YOU HAVE DEFEATED
THE DEVIL KING

36
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,833
AND SUCCEEDED IN SEIZING
THE COUNTRY,

37
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,833
I, KOJURO, AM PREPARED TO
FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.

38
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,916
- HUH?
- NO MATTER THE REASON,

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,250
I STILL TURNED MY
SWORD AGAINST YOU, SIR.

40
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,416
WHATEVER PUNISHMENT
YOU DEEM APPROPRIATE...

41
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,791
( gasps )

42
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,083
- MAN, YOU KEEP
SPEWIN' THAT CRAP,

43
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,250
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHOP
YOU UP RIGHT HERE.

44
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,583
- YES, LORD MASAMUNE.

45
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,166
- Sanada: THIS IS...

46
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,250
WHAT BEAUTIFUL
CRAFTSMANSHIP, LORD.

47
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,875
I AM MOST GRATEFUL
FOR THIS BOON.

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
- BY THE WAY, YUKIMURA,

49
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,791
I'M MOST CURIOUS TO
HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS

50
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,750
WITH REGARDS TO
THE RECENT INCIDENT.

51
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,375
- SIR, FOLLOWING OUR BATTLE
AGAINST MATSUNAGA HISAHIDE,

52
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,750
I WAS REMINDED OF SOMETHING YOU
TELL ME AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

53
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,875
A WISE LESSON I LEARNED.

54
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,083
"PEOPLE ARE THE STONE WALLS.
PEOPLE ARE THE CASTLE."

55
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,208
IF I MAY BE SO BOLD, SIR.
IN A WORD,

56
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,958
PEOPLE ARE OUR
GREATEST TREASURE.

57
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,458
MASAMUNE CARES
ABOUT HIS RETAINERS,

58
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,125
AND, IN TURN,

59
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,625
MASTER KATAKURA AND THE OTHER
RETAINERS HAVE PLEDGED

60
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,416
THEIR VERY LIVES TO
THEIR LORD'S SERVICE.

61
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,750
SWEARING TO SURVIVE TOGETHER
UNTIL HE RULES THE LAND.

62
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,916
WHAT'S MORE, IF IT WILL LAY THE
FOUNDATION TO THAT END,

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,166
THEY ARE PREPARED TO
DIE AT ANY TIME.

64
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,083
IN THIS RESPECT, THEY ARE NO
DIFFERENT FROM THE TAKEDA.

65
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,083
WHAT WE CALL TREASURE
IS ONE AND THE SAME.

66
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,166
I WAS UNABLE TO BRING BACK
THE ARMOR THAT NEEDS NO SHIELD.

67
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,250
REGRETTABLE AS THAT IS,
YOU HAVE NOT REPRIMANDED ME

68
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,125
AND I THOUGHT THIS
MAY BE THE REASON.

69
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,500
- EXACTLY RIGHT.

70
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,916
- YOUR LORDSHIP.
- YUKIMURA.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,458
ONCE WE'VE DEFEATED THE
DEVIL KING, WHAT WILL YOU DO?

72
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,250
- SIR, NO MATTER WHERE
THEY ARE BORN,

73
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,708
NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE RAISED,

74
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,291
PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE,
JUST LIKE US.

75
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,250
I, YUKIMURA,
WILL SERVE UNDER YOU

76
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,416
AS YOU RULE THIS LAND
OF THE RISING SUN,

77
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,375
AND I SHALL WIELD THE
SPEAR YOU HAVE GIVEN ME

78
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,416
WITH ALL MY MIGHT,

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,208
SO A DAY MIGHT COME
WHEN ALL PEOPLE

80
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,833
FORM A STONE WALL TOGETHER.

81
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,791
- WELL SAID, YUKIMURA.

82
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,166
- THANK YOU, YOUR LORDSHIP.

83
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,750
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

84
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,583
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

85
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,208
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

86
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,833
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR...

87
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,166
- Sarutobi: YOUR LORDSHIP.

88
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,500
TOKUGAWA IEYASU
HAS BEEN KILLED.

89
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,375
IT WAS AKECHI MITSUHIDE.

90
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,958
WHEN TOKUGAWA FORMALLY
BROKE HIS ALLIANCE WITH ODA,

91
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,125
AKECHI APPEARED AS
THE DEVIL KING'S PROXY

92
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,000
AND CUT DOWN THE UNARMED
TOKUGAWA WITHOUT HESITATION.

93
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,166
- ( screaming )

94
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,416
- TADA, KATSU...

95
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,625
- ( laughing )

96
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,250
- ( sighs )
- HUH?

97
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,875
- LORD IEYASU.

98
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,750
SUCH DISAPPOINTMENT
HIS LOYAL RETAINERS

99
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,875
MUST BE SUFFERING NOW.

100
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,333
SUCH HEARTACHE.

101
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,166
( crying )

102
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,708
- THEN THAT MEANS AKECHI
IS NOT TAKING PART

103
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,916
IN NOBUNAGA'S INVASION
OF KYUSHU.

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,208
- ACCORDING TO REPORTS,
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

105
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,166
TWO OTHERS HAVE BEEN
CONSPICUOUS IN THEIR ABSENCE,

106
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,041
ODA'S WIFE, NOHIME AND
AN ARCHER NAMED RANMARU.

107
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,875
- WHILE THE BULK OF HIS
FORCES ATTACK KYUSHU,

108
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,416
IT IS POSSIBLE HE DISPATCHED
THOSE OTHER THREE

109
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
AS ASSASSINS AGAINST
US. AS OUR FORCES ARE STILL

110
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,416
RECOVERING AND REGROUPING
AFTER NAGASHINO.

111
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,541
- CRUSH THE EASTERN ALLIANCE.
AND TAKE US DOWN ONE BY ONE.

112
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:31,500
- IN THAT CASE, WHO'LL BE THEIR
NEXT TARGET, OLD MAN TAKEDA,

113
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,000
YOURS TRULY, OR, MAYBE...

114
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,083
- LORD KENSHIN.
I'VE SENT HIM WORD.

115
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,916
- HMM.

116
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:49,458
- NOT SINCE THE REPORT OF ODA'S
DEFEAT OF SHIMAZU OF SATSUMA,

117
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,416
HAS ANOTHER MESSENGER COME
FROM THE TAKEDA CAMP.

118
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,875
- I FEEL SO USELESS.

119
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,583
IF I WERE OUT THERE,

120
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,291
I COULD BE REPORTING BACK TO YOU
DAILY WITH NEWS OF THE WORLD.

121
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,625
- GIVEN THE TIGER OF
KAI'S EARNEST WARNING,

122
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,625
IT CANNOT BE HELPED
RIGHT NOW.

123
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,833
- SIR.

124
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,291
- ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

125
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,250
I HAVE BEEN GRANTED
THIS UNEXPECTED PRIVATE

126
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,958
TIME WITH YOU.

127
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,750
AND I AM FORCED TO
REALIZE JUST HOW HARD

128
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,958
I MUST HAVE DRIVEN
YOU IN THE PAST.

129
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,291
ONLY NOW THOUGH,

130
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,541
AFTER BEING WITH YOU
NIGHT AND DAY, DO I SEE IT.

131
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,166
PLEASE FORGIVE ME, KASUGA.

132
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,000
- DO NOT THINK THAT.

133
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,875
I HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO
YOUR SERVICE AND PROTECTION,

134
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,125
LORD KENSHIN.

135
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,541
IT IS MY SWORN DUTY.

136
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,750
EVEN NOW, IF YOU WOULD
BUT ORDER IT,

137
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,166
I WOULD MAKE HASTE TO
WHEREVER YOU WISHED.

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,083
PLEASE, MY LORD, MAKE USE OF
ME WHENEVER YOU HAVE NEED.

139
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,083
- THANK YOU, KASUGA.

140
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:49,000
TRULY, THIS IS HOW ONE
MIGHT IMAGINE UTOPIA.

141
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,041
- OH, YES.
SITTING HERE WITH YOU,

142
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,666
THESE VIOLENT TIMES AND THE
MENACE OF THE DEVIL KING,

143
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,250
SEEM LIKE DISTANT DREAMS.

144
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,041
- AS LONG AS YOU ARE BY MY SIDE,
NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE,

145
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,291
IT WILL BE A PLACE OF
CALM AND PEACE.

146
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,708
- SO CLEAR AND PURE.
- ( gasping )

147
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,791
- LIKE A FLOWER
OR A WILLOW.

148
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,291
YOU SHAME ALL NATURE.

149
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,625
- ( gasping )

150
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,791
- AT MY SIDE UNTIL
THE END OF TIME.

151
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,500
- ( moaning )

152
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,833
LORD KENSHIN,
I AM UNWORTHY OF SUCH WORDS.

153
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,791
- ( thunder rumbling )

154
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,041
- BY NOW, THE DEVIL KING
HAS MOST CERTAINLY DEFEATED

155
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,125
ALL OF THE SMALLEST
AND WEAKEST DOMAINS.

156
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,166
I IMAGINE HE HAS
BURNED THEM TO THE GROUND,

157
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,041
MAKING ALL OF KYUSHU HIS.

158
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,916
- ( gasps )

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,208
LORD KENSHIN!

160
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,625
WHO ARE YOU?

161
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,416
- TAKEDA ARMY. SANADA NINJA
CORPS, I SERVE SARUTOBI SASUKE.

162
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,125
MY NAME IS ISAGI.

163
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:09,166
- I DON'T KNOW YOU.
WHICH VILLAGE ARE YOU FROM?

164
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,541
- LORD KENSHIN,
A WORD IN PRIVATE.

165
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,125
- ANSWER MY QUESTION!

166
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,333
- KASUGA.

167
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,833
- YES, SIR.

168
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,791
- IS SOMETHING WRONG, KASUGA?

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,333
- NO.

170
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,166
- DELIVER YOUR
MESSAGE THEN, NINJA.

171
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,541
- LORD TOKUGAWA IEYASU HAS
PASSED ON FROM THIS WORLD.

172
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,708
- ( lightening crackling )

173
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,166
- IS THAT SO?

174
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,208
RETALIATION FROM THE
ODA FACTION, I TAKE IT?

175
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,416
- IT IS AS YOU HAVE SURMISED.

176
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,250
AS SOON AS HE WAS OUTNUMBERED
IN THE BATTLE AT NAGASHINO,

177
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,916
HE BROKE THEIR ALLIANCE.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,041
IT WAS RETRIBUTION
FOR HIS RASH ATTEMPT

179
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,375
TO JOIN FORCES WITH
YOU AND TAKEDA.

180
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,375
- NOW, MY LORD,

181
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,000
YOU WILL SUFFER THE SAME!

182
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,333
( gasps )

183
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,458
- LORD KENSHIN!

184
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,500
- A WOMAN WHO USES
WESTERN FIREARMS.

185
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,458
YOU ARE THE DEVIL
KING'S WIFE, KICHO.

186
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,916
- TRULY THE WAR GOD. IT SEEMS
YOU WILL NOT PERISH SO EASILY.

187
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,250
- ( grunting )

188
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,333
YOU'RE MINE!

189
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,000
- BE GONE. BEFORE MY SWORD
REACHES YOUR THROAT.

190
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,541
- FOR THOSE WHO WISH
ILL ON MY LORD HUSBAND,

191
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,208
THERE IS ONLY DARKNESS.

192
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,250
- WE CARRY OUT HEAVEN'S WILL
IN BISHAMONTEN'S NAME.

193
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,333
- A THOUSAND PARDONS.

194
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,375
( gasps )

195
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,208

- ( metal clanking )

198

- YOU BITCH!
- LORD KENSHIN!

199
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,458
- DO NOT WORRY,
I AM FINE.

200
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,125
HOWEVER, I CANNOT BELIEVE
SHE CAME HERE ALONE.

201
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,625
- HA! I GOTCHA!

202
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,416
- ( grunting )

203
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,208
I PITY YOU, DEVIL SPAWN.

204
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,416
- ( grunting )

205
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,083
- CARELESS!

206
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,250
- LORD KENSHIN!

207
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,833
- ( gasping )

208
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,250
- UESUGI KENSHIN
HAS BEEN LAID LOW.

209
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,625
- KENSHIN, MY LORD.

210
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,500
- MY LORD...

211
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,541
- NO, NO!

212
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,583
- ( Sanada grunting )

213
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:23,958
- Sarutobi: MASTER.

214
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,291
I'M GONNA MAKE A QUICK
TRIP TO ECHIGO.

215
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,125
- DIDN'T YOU?

216
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,916
- YEAH, I'VE SENT THREE OF
MY MEN OVER THERE ALREADY.

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,208
BUT I'VE STILL GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

218
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,291
- WELL, THEN,
YOU BE CAREFUL, SASUKE.

219
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,083
- YOU DO THE SAME, MASTER.

220
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,041
OR YOU WON'T BE READY FOR BATTLE
WHEN THE CRUCIAL MOMENT COMES.

221
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,833
- I KNOW.

222
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:55,791
- THIS AIR OF FINALITY, I HOPE
IT'S JUST THE MISERABLE WEATHER.

223
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,958
- MY LORD!

224
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,875
( panting )

225
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,875
- Takeda: WHAT?
THE DRAGON KING'S DIKE?

226
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,250
- THE WATER LEVEL IS RISING
BEFORE OUR EYES.

227
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,458
THE DIKE LOOKS READY TO
CRUMBLE ANY MOMENT.

228
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,708
IF WE DO NOT ACT QUICKLY,

229
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,875
THEN NEARBY VILLAGES
AND FIELDS WILL BE...

230
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,500
- HMM.

231
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,833
- Narrator: THE DRAGON KING'S
DIKE IS A LEVEE BEING BUILT

232
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,666
AT AN ELEVATED AREA
CALLED THE DRAGON KING'S NOSE,

233
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,166
WHERE THE MIDAGAWA AND
THE KAMANASHIGAWA MEET.

234
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,416
TAKEDA SHINGEN HAS SPENT
MANY YEARS ON ITS CONSTRUCTION.

235
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,083
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE
VILLAGE OF KAI FROM FLOODING.

236
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,958
- ( Takeda urging horse )

237
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,166
WHOA! WHOA!

238
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,541
- GATHER EVERYONE
FROM THE VILLAGE.

239
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,250
- RIGHT!

240
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,500
- ( dike creaking )

241
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,458
- MY LORD!
- HOW GOES?

242
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,791
- IT SEEMS TO BE HOLDING
FOR NOW, BUT EVEN SO, MY LORD,

243
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,333
IT JUST SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE
FOR THE DIKE TO BE SO WEAK.

244
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,500
- I HATE TO THINK IT, SIR.
BUT SOME OF THE MEN ARE SAYING

245
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,125
IT MAY HAVE BEEN SABOTAGED.

246
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,541
- FOR NOW, WE MUST PREVENT
ITS COLLAPSE AT ALL COSTS.

247
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,041
- MY LORD!
- OVER HERE.

248
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,791
- HUH?

249
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,125
- ( grunting )

250
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,000
( yelling )

251
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,041
HURRY, MEN!
IT IS STILL NOT TOO LATE!

252
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,000
- MY LORD.
- FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE!

253
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,125
- OVER HERE!
COME ON!

254
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,916
- ( all grunting )

255
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,791
- ( chuckling )

- ( dike creaking )

257
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,333
- AKECHI MITSUHIDE!

258
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,833
( yelling )

259
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,125
IT SEEMS THE
FOOL OF OWARI TOLD YOU

260
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,083
TO USE ANY MEANS NECESSARY
TO ELIMINATE YOUR ENEMIES.

261
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,208
OR PERHAPS...

262
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,166
- ( laughing )

263
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,375
THOUGH IT DRANK OF
IEYASU'S BLOOD JUST RECENTLY,

264
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,625
MY BLADE, SAKURAMAI IS
THROBBING INCESSANTLY.

265
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:41,375
THE ONLY WAY FOR IT TO BE
APPEASED IS TO DEVOUR YOU.

266
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,708
WHAT IS WRONG, TIGER OF KAI?

267
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,000
PLEASE, ALLOW ME A SMALL
TASTE OF YOUR PUNISHMENT.

268
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,083
DEVASTATION SUCH THAT IT
WILL SHATTER BONE IN AN INSTANT.

269
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,041
IT SHOULD BE SIMPLE
TO DELIVER SUCH A BLOW

270
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,583
TO THE CROWN OF MY HEAD.

271
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,500
AH, OF COURSE.

272
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,583
IF YOU WERE TO
WIELD YOUR WEAPON NOW,

273
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,458
YOU MIGHT ANNIHILATE ME.

274
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,583
BUT YOU MAY WELL DESTROY
YOUR PRECIOUS DIKE,

275
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,583
WHICH YOU WENT TO SUCH
GREAT LENGTHS TO CONSTRUCT.

276
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,416
IN FACT, YOUR MIGHTY AXE

277
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,166
WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LEAVE
NO TRACE OF IT.

278
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,250
( laughing )

279
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,666
HOWEVER,

280
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,833
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE
CONCERNED BY SUCH THINGS, IS IT?

281
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,833
- Sanada: YOUR LORDSHIP,
FORGIVE MY LATE ARRIVAL.

282
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,250
WE HAVE BROUGHT MATERIALS
TO REINFORCE THE DIKE.

283
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,041
IS THAT...
YOUR LORDSHIP!

284
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,333
- YUKIMURA, YOU MUST
SAVE THE DIKE.

285
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,291
- BUT, SIR.
- DO IT, BOY.

286
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,666
IF IT COLLAPSES, THIS
ENTIRE AREA WILL BE DECIMATED.

287
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,208
THAT CANNOT HAPPEN.

288
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,625
- SIR!

289
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,125
- ( creaking )

290
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,875
- NOW'S OUR TIME
TO REPAY TAKEDA.

291
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,416
- SHOW 'EM HOW WE DO IT.
- All: YEAH!

292
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,500
( all grunting )

293
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,708
- MASAMUNE, LOOK.

294
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,500
- AKECHI, HERE? THE BASTARD.

295
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,375
- I MUST MOVE THIS
BATTLE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

296
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,541
BUT IT IS CLEAR
HE WILL NOT PURSUE ME,

297
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,458
AND WILL TAKE ANY CHANCE TO
DESTROY THE DIKE.

298
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,666
WHAT DO I DO?

299
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,166
( grunting )

300
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,916
- ( men exclaiming )

301
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,333
- DAMN IT!

302
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,875
- SHIT! NO!

303
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,125
- ( men screaming )

304
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,208
- MASTER YOSHINAO!

305
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,458
MASTER SAMANOSUKE!
YOUR LORDSHIP!

306
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,333
- ( laughing )

307
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,458
- ( groaning )

308
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,666
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

309
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,291
YOUR LORDSHIP!

310
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,666
- I WISH I HAD MORE
TIME TO SAVOR IT.

311
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,166
BUT THE SENSATION WAS
MOST EXQUISITE, TIGER OF KAI.

312
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,875
- AKECHI MITSUHIDE!

313
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,916
- SICK FREAK! YOU WILL NOT
BE WALKING AWAY FROM HERE.

314
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,500
- SO, YOU LIVE AFTER ALL,
ONE EYED DRAGON.

00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,041
- ( theme song playing )

316
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,458
- Takeda: OF THE FIVE ELEMENTS,
NONE IS SUPERIOR OVER THE REST.

317
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,500
THE MOON WAXES AND WANES.

318
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,625
YUKIMURA, BE ALWAYS FLEXIBLE,
LIKE THE WATER,

319
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,250
WHILE YOUR SPIRIT BURNS
LIKE A FLAME.

320
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,333
RISE ABOVE AND SHOW
THE MAN YOU ARE.
