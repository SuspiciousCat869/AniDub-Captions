1
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:24,958
- MITSUHIDE.

2
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,958
- WHY IS YOUR ARMY
NOT AT YOUR BACK?

3
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:31,041
OSHU'S ONE-EYED DRAGON AND
HIS ARMY ARE CLOSING IN FAST,

4
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,625
HOPING TO TAKE
THE DEVIL KING'S HEAD.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,291
- ONE-EYED DRAGON?

6
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,250
- TOKUGAWA IS MOVING
TO HOLD BACK TAKEDA

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,333
AND UESUGI AT NAGASHINO.

8
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,583
IF DATE GETS PAST THEM,
IT WILL BE PROBLEMATIC.

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,333
AT THE MOMENT, I BELIEVE THAT
IS MORE PRESSING THAN ASAKURA.

10
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,416
YOU MUST KNOW WHY I HAVE
REVEALED THIS ONLY TO YOU.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,375
YOU MUST SHOW HONOR IN
BATTLE FOR LORD NOBUNAGA

12
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,083
TO ACCEPT A PEACEFUL
END WITH ASAKURA.

13
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,291
AND SHOULD HE NOT,

14
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,958
LADY O-ICHI'S LIFE WOULD
HANG IN THE BALANCE.

15
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,083
- HE WOULDN'T.

16
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,666
- ( theme song playing )

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,500
- Azai: WE HEAD FOR NAGASHINO
AND HITARAGAHARA.

18
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,541
WE SHALL SEE JUSTICE
SERVED THE AZAI WAY,

19
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,916
FOR THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS BATTLE.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,500
SOLDIERS OF JUSTICE,
FOLLOW ME TO GLORY!

21
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,416
- BOSS MASAMUNE.
- HMM?

22
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,416
- ABOUT THIS MAEDA VAGABOND,
I'M STILL NOT SURE I TRUST HIM.

23
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,041
- WHAT, YOU THINK HE'S LURING US
INTO THE DEVIL KING'S CLUTCHES?

24
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,166
- IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE.

25
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,250
HE MAY NOT BE TIED
DOWN TO HIS HOUSE,

26
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,708
BUT HE STILL CLAIMS
THE FAMILY NAME.

27
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,916
MAEDA TOSHIIE SUPPORTS ODA.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,500
AND IN RETURN, I HEAR HE WAS
JUST GIVEN THE LAND OF KAGA.

29
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,375
- WHATEVER. AS LONG AS HE
DOESN'T GET IN MY WAY.

30
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,625
- YUKIMURA.
- YES, SIR?

31
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,291
- YOU'RE WITH ME.

32
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,416
- SIR.

33
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,625
- LORD IEYASU!
IT'S TAKEDA SHINGEN, SIR.

34
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,250
HE'S HEADED THIS WAY.

35
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,375
- WHAT?

36
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,666
LORD SHINGEN.

37
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,083
- IT'S TAKEDA SHINGEN.

38
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,708
- THAT'S SANADA YUKIMURA.

39
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,666
- Tokugawa: HOLD!

40
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,875
- YOUR SPEARS, YUKIMURA.
YOU WILL NOT NEED THEM.

41
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,750
IT HAS BEEN
TOO LONG, TAKECHIYO.

42
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,125
- AH! LORD SHINGEN. YOU ARE
LOOKING AS WELL AS EVER.

43
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:48,916
I AM GLAD.

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,250
- HMM.

45
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,250
- LORD TOKUGAWA,
I AM SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA.

46
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,791
IT IS A PLEASURE TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

47
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,166
- I HAVE HEARD TALES
OF YOUR MANY VALOROUS DEEDS.

48
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,083
YOU HAVE NO NEED TO WORRY.

49
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,375
I WOULD NOT BE SO UNCOUTH AS
TO ATTACK YOU OR LORD SHINGEN

50
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,833
WHILE YOU'RE BOTH UNARMED.

51
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,375
FORGIVE MY SILENCE
IN OUR CORRESPONDENCE.

52
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,208
BUT FOR US TO MEET
IN SUCH A MANNER,

53
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,041
ESPECIALLY HERE UPON
THE FIELD OF BATTLE...

54
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,833
- I BELIEVE, RATHER,
I KNOW IN MY HEART,

55
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,541
YOU ARE MERELY WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

56
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,000
FOR I ALSO KNOW YOU MUST
SUFFER THE HUMILIATION

57
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,708
OF YOUR GOSSAMER ALLIANCE
WITH ODA IN SILENCE.

58
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,583
- INDEED. FOR NOW,
I MUST ENDURE

59
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,291
BUT SOMEDAY, I SHALL SURPASS
EVEN YOU, LORD SHINGEN.

60
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:35,416
THIS WORLD, THIS ERA, WILL BE
FORGED BY THESE HANDS!

61
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,208
BUT THE TIME IS NOT YET RIGHT
TO EMBARK ON MY GREAT ENDEAVORS.

62
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,666
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE ALLIED
MYSELF WITH THE OPPONENT

63
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,166
I LEAST WISH TO FACE
UPON A BATTLEFIELD.

64
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,625
- YOUR TIME WILL
NEVER COME, TAKECHIYO.

65
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,208
BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN THINK
TO SEIZE THE COUNTRY,

66
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,250
YOU WILL SURELY BE USED
AND THEN CRUSHED BY ODA.

67
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,666
- ( chuckles )

68
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,208
TAKING UP ARMS LIKE THIS
IS UNLIKE YOU, LORD SHINGEN.

69
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,583
AND SUCH RASH
BEHAVIOR IS ILL-BEFITTING

70
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,708
OF THE WAR GOD OF ECHIGO.

71
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,958
BRUTE FORCE WILL ONLY
BRING YOU FAILURE.

72
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,916
- Takeda: THIS IS NOT
A TIME WHEN PATIENCE

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,041
WILL REVEAL A PATH TO SURVIVAL.

74
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,958
WE MUST POOL ALL
OF OUR RESOURCES,

75
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,916
BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,791
IF WE LEAVE ODA UNCHECKED,

77
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,875
FIGHTING OVER LAND WILL BE
THE LEAST OF OUR CONCERNS.

78
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,666
FOR WHAT GOOD IS
LAND IN A WORLD

79
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,416
WHERE NOT EVEN A BLADE
OF GRASS WILL GROW?

80
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,541
TAKECHIYO, LIVE YOUR
LIFE UNFETTERED

81
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,125
BY THE FEAR OF DEATH,

82
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,166
JOIN WITH US AGAINST ODA.

83
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,250
- ( wind howling )

84
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,583
- ALAS, I CANNOT.

85
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,416
WHETHER I DIE OR REMAIN,
IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME.

86
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,291
ODA HAS CHARGED ME WITH
PROTECTING THE EAST,

87
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,750
AND I WILL NOT
BETRAY THAT ALLIANCE.

88
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,666
- IF THAT IS SO...
- ONCE I HAVE GIVEN MY WORD,

89
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,708
EVEN IF IT IS TO
THE DEVIL KING ODA,

90
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,000
WHO COMMITS ALL
MANNERS OF ATROCITIES,

91
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,333
EVEN KNOWING I MAY
FACE HIS BETRAYAL,

92
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,041
I WILL NEVER BETRAY
A SOLEMN OATH!

93
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,250
ON MY HONOR,
AS A MIKAWA WARRIOR!

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,333
ALL UNITS, ENGAGE!

95
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,791
- ( soldiers yelling )

96
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:26,208
- IN TRUTH, I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT.

97
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,125
I CANNOT BE THE
ONE TO INITIATE,

98
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,583
BUT I MAY ENGAGE ANY AGGRESSORS.

99
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,833
IF I WIN THIS BATTLE,

100
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,375
IT WILL SURELY LAY THE
FOUNDATION OF MY POWER

101
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,208
TO EVENTUALLY CHALLENGE ODA.

102
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:41,666
- AS YOU ARE NOW, DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE CAPABLE OF THAT?

103
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,416
- WATCH ME AND FIND OUT.

104
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,750
- YUKIMURA, WE ARE
FINISHED HERE.

105
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,375
- YOUR LORDSHIP, SHOWING ONE'S
BACK TO ONE'S ENEMY.

106
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,375
LORD IEYASU.

107
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,083
- Uesugi: IN THESE
TURBULENT TIMES,

108
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,000
RIGHT AND WRONG HAVE
ALL BUT LOST THEIR MEANING.

109
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,041
BUT SO LONG AS THE PEOPLE NEED
LEADERSHIP AND PROTECTION,

110
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,916
THE PATH OF RIGHT
MUST STILL BE TAKEN.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,500
BOTH ARMIES, ADVANCE!

112
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,375
MOVE SWIFTLY,
AND ANNIHILATE THE ENEMY!

113
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,833
- ( soldiers yelling )

114
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,208
- ( urging horse )

115
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,666
- YUKIMURA, YOU AND I WILL
STRIKE AT TOKUGAWA FROM BEHIND.

116
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,708
- YOUR LORDSHIP, WAS A
PINCER ATTACK ALWAYS YOUR PLAN

117
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,250
IF LORD IEYASU COULD
NOT BE WON OVER?

118
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,541
- I DID NOT WANT IT THIS WAY,

119
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,291
BUT TAKECHIYO MOST
CERTAINLY HAD TO REALIZE

120
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,500
I WOULD NOT WITHDRAW UNLESS
HE ORDERED A CHARGE.

121
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,500
WHICH HE COULD ONLY ATTEMPT
WITH THE SO-CALLED INVINCIBLE

122
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,541
HONDA TADAKATSU AT HIS COMMAND.

123
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,500
- HONDA TADAKATSU?

124
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:53,750
- OR PERHAPS, HE HAS SOME
OTHER GAMBIT YET TO REVEAL.

125
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,416
- RIGHT, JUST BY SHEER
NUMBERS OF TROOPS.

126
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,541
FIGHTING US HEAD-ON
WOULD SEEM TO BE RECKLESS.

127
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,000
- THEN WE PROCEED
WITH CARE. ONWARD!

128
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,166
- SIR!

129
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,000
- Tokugawa: ISN'T ODA'S
ARQUEBUS CORPS HERE YET?

130
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,583
- ACCORDING TO MASTER
AKECHI'S SIGNAL,

131
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,125
THEY SHOULD ARRIVE SHORTLY.

132
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,625
- I SEE.

133
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,083
- EVEN THE VAUNTED TAKEDA
CAVALRY WON'T STAND A CHANCE

134
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,666
IN THE FACE OF A LEGION
OF ARQUEBUSES, MY LORD.

135
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,208
- WATCH FOR OUR MOMENT,
THEN WITHDRAW THE TROOPS.

136
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,875
WE'LL TAKE BOTH ARMIES
IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

137
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,875
- SIR!

138
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,625
- LORD SHINGEN,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME,

139
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,500
BUT THE FUTURE WILL BE
FORGED WITH THESE HANDS.

140
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,041
- ( soldiers yelling )

141
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,625
- AH, MY MOST BEAUTIFUL BLADE,

142
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,125
HOW YOUR BLOOM
DAZZLES THE BATTLEFIELD.

143
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,416
- ( exclaims )

144
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,791
I AM NOT WORTHY
OF SUCH WORDS.

145
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,250
- ( soldier grunting )

146
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,666
- I SHALL PROTECT YOU,
LORD KENSHIN.

147
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,791
- PERFECT! SPEAR! OF CONQUEST!

148
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,250
SANADA YUKIMURA IS HERE!

149
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,500
( grunting )

150
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,083
- ( grunting )

151
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,000
- Tokugawa: I EXPECTED NO LESS
OF LORD SHINGEN.

152
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:26,208
- ALL UNITS, MOVE FROM FISH
SCALE TO CRANE WINGS FORMATION.

153
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,291
TAKE THE MAIN ENCAMPMENT!

154
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,500
- ( soldiers yelling )

155
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,375
- ( Itchan groaning )

156
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,250
- ITCHAN!

157
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,583
- TETCHAN.

158
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,750
- DAMN IT.
HE WAS A GOOD MAN!

159
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,875
ITCHAN.

160
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,500
FOR LORD IEYASU!

161
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,333
( yelling )

162
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,333
- WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU, MASTER?

163
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,041
THIS ISN'T YOUR FIRST BATTLE.

164
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,708
DID MEETING IEYASU DULL
YOUR FIGHTING SPIRIT?

165
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,833
- NO, NOTHING OF THE SORT.

166
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,583
- Takeda: THAT IS THE PAIN
OF TAKING A LIFE.

167
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,541
- Sanada: YOUR LORDSHIP.

168
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,041
- OUR FOES ARE LIKE US.

169
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,000
THEY, TOO, HAVE PEOPLE
THEY HOLD IN THEIR HEARTS,

170
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,875
FUTURES THEY HOPE FOR.

171
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,500
BUT THE ODA FACTION DOES NOT!

172
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,791
- ( men screaming )

173
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,791
- OUR OPPONENTS
ARE STILL MEN, YUKIMURA.

174
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,375
AS YOU WIELD YOUR SPEARS,
DO NOT EVER FORGET THAT.

175
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,333
- SIR!

176
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,583
- LORD TAKEDA, INSTEAD OF
ATTACKING ASAKURA,

177
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,583
ODA IS SENDING HIS ARMY HERE.

178
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,208
- THEN THIS BATTLE
MAY YET BE DECISIVE.

179
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,708
- AS EXPECTED, WE CAN DO
NOTHING ABOUT BEING OUTNUMBERED.

180
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,291
HONDA TADAKATSU,

181
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,083
GREATEST WARRIOR IN
THE LAND, MOVE OUT!

182
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,000
TADAKATSU!

183
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,833
- TAKE HIM DOWN AND MAKE
A NAME FOR YOURSELF.

184
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:31,958
I AM CALLED NAOE KANETSUGU.
UESUGI'S FIRST UNIT.

185
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,541
THE FIRST UNIT IS ONLY ME,
FOR I AM UNSTOPPABLE!

186
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,125
INVINCIBLE BEATS UNSTOPPABLE!

187
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,708
- ( soldiers screaming )

188
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,875
- TADAKATSU,
DON'T TELL ANYONE THIS,

189
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,666
BUT YOU'RE ALMOST
TOO GOOD FOR ME.

190
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,458
THAT'S THE ONE-EYED DRAGON
OF OSHU.

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,208
- TOKUGAWA IS MOVING TO BLOCK
TAKEDA AND UESUGI'S PATH.

192
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,416
- IT'S JUST A SKIRMISH. ONCE WE
KNOCK OFF THE DEVIL KING,

193
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,041
WE'LL DOUBLE BACK AND CLEAN UP,
THEN WE GET SHINANO, TOO.

194
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,958
- EVEN THE TIGER OF KAI
COULDN'T CONVINCE HIM.

195
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,500
- ( horses neighing )

196
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,083
- ( whistling )

197
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,875
YOU'VE GOT SOME KINDA NERVE
TRY'N TO BLOCK MY WAY.

198
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,916
WHO ARE YOU AND
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

199
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
- HEAR ME WELL. I AM AZAI
BIZEN-NO-KAMI NAGAMASA.

200
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,541
I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER.

201
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,458
- AZAI NAGAMASA?

202
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,375
- IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE,

203
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,250
I SHALL CLEANSE THE
WORLD OF YOUR SINS.

204
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,958
- AZAI NAGAMASA. THE DEVIL
KING'S BROTHER-IN-LAW.

205
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,041
PERHAPS ODA SENT HIM HERE.

206
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,166
- HMPH.

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,833
- WHERE ARE YOU
WATCHING FROM, DEVIL KING?

208
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,291
- ( Keiji urging horse )

209
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,500
- LORD KEIJI?

210
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,500
- DUDE.
- Bunshichi: WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

211
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,250
- Magobei: HE'S NOT
RUNNING AWAY?

212
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,916
- ( gasps )
- LORD KENSHIN, LOOK.

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,041
- Uesugi: KEIJI.

214
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,916
- THAT BASTARD!

215
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,791
MAEDA KEIJI FINISHED
SETTING THE STAGE,

216
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,166
AND NOW HE'S RETURNING
TO HIS OWN SIDE.

217
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,375
I BELIEVE ODA
INTENDS TO CRUSH US,

218
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,708
TAKEDA AND UESUGI
HERE IN NAGASHINO.

219
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:02,791
- SOUNDS LIKE FUN. WILDER THE
PARTY THE BETTER, RIGHT?

220
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:07,541
- ICHI, GUIDE MY SWORD.
WAIT FOR ME.

221
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:12,500
SOLDIERS OF JUSTICE, FOLLOW ME.
ANNIHILATE THE FORCES OF EVIL!

222
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,333
- ( soldiers yelling )

223
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,666
- I MAY LOSE MUCH,
BUT NEVER MY HONOR.

224
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,500
- MASAMUNE, LEAVE THEIR
SOLDIERS TO US.

225
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,625
- THANKS, KOJURO.
I'M SURE YOU GOT THIS.

226
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,125
( urging horse )

227
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,875
- BIG BOSS!

228
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,125
- IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

229
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,458
- LET'S MAKE THIS COOL.

230
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,750
HEY, NOT BAD FOR A WARM-UP.

231
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:52,750
BOSS OF OSHU, DATE MASAMUNE.
FULL SPEED AHEAD!

232
00:15:55,791 --> 00:16:00,208
- AZAI NAGAMASA.
SO, HE SERVES AS ODA'S VANGUARD.

233
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,541
- Akechi: BEHOLD, LORD NOBUNAGA.
AS HE IS PASSIONATELY LOYAL,

234
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,083
LORD AZAI ATTEMPTS TO REPEL
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON FOR YOU,

235
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,541
HIS BELOVED BROTHER-IN-LAW.

236
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,541
- NAGAMASA.

237
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,875
- MITSUHIDE, THE ARQUEBUS CORPS
THAT WAS GOING TO IEYASU.

238
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,291
WHERE ARE WE ON THAT?

239
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,333
- I ASSIGNED THEM AS REAR
SUPPORT FOR AZAI.

240
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,500
I FELT IT WAS A
NECESSARY PRECAUTION

241
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,625
AGAINST DATE'S MOBILITY.

242
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,083
- ( soldiers yelling )

243
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,583
- GOOD, TADAKATSU.

244
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,875
ODA'S ARQUEBUS CORPS
WILL BE HERE SOON.

245
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,625
WE, THE TOKUGAWA, WILL...

246
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,750
- ( Sanada yelling )

247
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,916
MASTER HONDA TADAKATSU,

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,916
GREATEST WARRIOR IN ALL
THE LAND, I PRESUME?

249
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,583
STAND FIRM! YOU FACE
SANADA YUKIMURA!

250
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,333
LET US HAVE A CLEAN FIGHT.

251
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,291
( grunting )

252
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,333
I WILL NOT YIELD!

253
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,666
- HE STOPPED
TADAKATSU'S ATTACK?

254
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,708
- MASTER!
- SASUKE.

255
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,125
- ( grunting )

256
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,875
- YOUR LORDSHIP,
I SHALL TAKE HIM ONE-ON-ONE.

257
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,750
- HE IS NOT ONE WHO
CAN BE DEFEATED ALONE.

258
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,083
- ( yelling )

259
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,291
- HOLD YOUR GROUND, TADAKATSU.

260
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,416
- ( grunting )

261
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,000
- ( soldiers grunting )

262
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,958
- WHERE IS ODA'S
ARQUEBUS CORPS?

263
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,833
- HONDA TADAKATSU'S MOVEMENTS
ARE BEING RESTRAINED.

264
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,958
AT THIS RATE, TOKUGAWA'S ARMY
WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER,

265
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,875
MY LORD HUSBAND.

266
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,708
- ( grunting )

267
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,750
GLEAMING. CROSS SLASH!

268
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,375
- ALL RIGHT.

269
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,875
YOU EARN THE FULL FURY
OF MY DRAGON CLAWS!

270
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,958
- I WOULD DIE
BEFORE I SURRENDER.

271
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,208
- ( gasps )

272
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,041
MASTER AKECHI, YOU WOULDN'T
ORDER THE ARQUEBUS CORP

273
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,000
TO ATTACK FROM WHERE THEY ARE?

274
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,666
- WELL, WE DO NEED TO
KEEP THE ONE-EYED DRAGON

275
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,375
PINNED DOWN.

276
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,833
- BUT MY LORD NAGAMASA
WOULD BE...

277
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,333
- ( horse galloping )

278
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,666
- KEIJI, WAIT!

279
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,583
- KENSHIN!

280
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,625
- I SEE IT NOW. THIS WAS
YOUR PLAN FROM THE START.

281
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,291
UNITE THE EASTERN GENERALS

282
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,958
TO HOLD THE DEVIL KING IN CHECK,

283
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,500
AND WITH ALL OF US BUSY, YOU
WOULD USE THE MAEDA NAME

284
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,625
TO TRY AND TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

285
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,208
UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR
PREPARATIONS ARE LACKING.

286
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,958
- I'LL NEVER
KNOW UNLESS I TRY!

287
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,083
BEFORE THIS GETS ANY
MORE OUT OF HAND, I...

288
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,041
- AND THE DEVIL KING'S RESPONSE
IS QUITE OBVIOUS.

289
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,708
YOU PUT FAR TOO MUCH FAITH
IN THE GOOD IN PEOPLE.

290
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,583
- Keiji: COME ON. THE DEVIL KING
WASN'T ALWAYS A DEVIL, WAS HE?

291
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,166
- Uesugi: SADLY, IN THIS WORLD,

292
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,958
THERE ARE SOME WHO
ARE TRULY BORN EVIL.

293
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,625
AS YOUR FRIEND, I CANNOT
ALLOW YOU TO GO TO YOUR DEATH.

294
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,750
- BROTHER, PLEASE STOP THEM.
PLEASE SPARE MY LORD NAGAMASA.

295
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:08,125
- MITSUHIDE, THIS TIME,
YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR.

296
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,916
- MY LORD.
YOU HAVE MY APOLOGIES.

297
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,833
- BROTHER, PLEASE.

298
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,000
- Akechi: LADY O-ICHI.

299
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,750
GO NOW,
WHILE THERE IS STILL TIME.

300
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,958
- ( horse neighing )

301
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,583
- HEAVEN-RENDING
BLADE OF SOARING!

302
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,625
- ( gasps )

303
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,375
- WOW, YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

304
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,833
X!

305
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:50,000
- MY RIGHTEOUS WILL
IS UNYIELDING!

306
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,333
I GO WHERE THE BEACON
OF HONOR GUIDES ME.

307
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,333
EVEN IF I SHOULD LOSE
ALL MY LIMBS,

308
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,250
I WILL NOT FALTER.

309
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,250
SILENT DEATH SHOCK.
