1
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,791
- Yoshinao: BIG BOSS,
THAT'S TAKEDA'S BANNER!

2
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:34,916
- Samanosuke:
DON'T TELL ME HE'S SIDING

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,458
WITH TOYOTOMI NOW!

4
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,125
- MAYBE, BUT I'M GUESSING NOT.

5
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,208
I DON'T THINK
THE TIGER OF KAI'S

6
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,750
PICKING ANY MORE FIGHTS
THAN HE'S GOT TO RIGHT NOW.

7
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,375
BUT HELL, WE'VE GOT TO TAKE
HIM ON SOME DAY.

8
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,791
GET YOUR GAME FACES ON!

9
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,416
TIME TO KICK SOME ASS!

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,416
- ( cheering )

11
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,958
- MAN, IF HE TOOK DOWN TAKEDA,

12
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,375
THINGS ARE GOING
TO GET UGLY IN A HURRY.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,333
- Takeda:
SUCH A LOSS.

14
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,041
OF ALL MY VASSALS,
OYAMADA NOBUSHIGE'S FAITH

15
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,791
IN YUKIMURA WAS UNSWERVING.

16
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,291
IT WAS THAT FAITH THAT LED
HIM ONTO THE BATTLEFIELD.

17
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,625
THAT LED HIM TO HIS END.
- YES, LORD.

18
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,208
BUT HE DIED BRAVELY.

19
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:20,125
HE SHOWED MASTER SANADA
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GENERAL.

20
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,625
- NOBUSHIGE.

21
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,166
- IN HIS DEATH, OYAMADA
LEFT BEHIND A LESSON

22
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,791
FOR MASTER SANADA.

23
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,833
I JUST HOPE THAT HE CAN SEE
THE WISDOM IN IT.

24
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,416
THOUGH, FROM WHAT I SAW, HE'S--

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,333
- HE'S MIRED IN SELF-DOUBT.

26
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,041
- THEN I'LL GO
TO SATSUMA, MILORD.

27
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,375
I'LL TAKE OYAMADA'S PLACE
BY HIS--

28
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,958
- NO, YOU WILL NOT.

29
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,750
IF YOU HURRY OVER TO SAVE
YUKIMURA FROM HIMSELF,

30
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,458
THEN OYAMADA WILL HAVE DIED
FOR NOTHING.

31
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,500
- BUT LORD, THE FUTURE
OF THE TAKEDA CLAN

32
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,791
MIGHT HINGE ON WHAT HE DOES.

33
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,416
OUR FATE IS A SHARED ONE.

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,041
THIS IS TRULY WHAT IT MEANS--

35
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,166
RAISING SOMEONE AND HANDING
YOUR TOMORROWS TO THEM.

36
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,791
I SHOULDER
THE SAME BURDEN AS HE.

37
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,291
- MILORD...

38
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:12,166
- THERE IS STRENGTH
IN YOU, YUKIMURA.  CLAIM IT!

39
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,041
NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE PATH
ON WHICH YOU JOURNEY.

40
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:19,416
WHAT OF THE TROOPS 
THAT SURROUND THE VILLAGE,

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,250
ANY DEVELOPMENTS?

42
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,333
- WELL, SO FAR THEY'RE
JUST STANDING THERE.

43
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,375
THEY HAVEN'T MADE
ANY HOSTILE MOVES.

44
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,375
THEY'RE NOT EVEN HARASSING
THE OUTLYING HOMES.

45
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,583
I THINK THEY'RE HERE TO ENSURE
WE DON'T MOBILIZE OUR FORCES.

46
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,750
BUT IF THAT SHOULD CHANGE,
WE'LL BE NOTIFIED AT ONCE.

47
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:40,000
- HAVING SAFELY WARDED OFF
TOYOTOMI'S SECRET INVASION,

48
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,541
MASAMUNE HAS BROUGHT
HIS NEIGHBORING LANDS

49
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,208
BACK IN LINE.
BRASH AS HE IS,

50
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,625
HE'S PROBABLY EN ROUTE
TO OSAKA NOW.

51
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,000
- MY SCOUTS SAY
HE'LL BE PASSING US SOON.

52
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,666
I'M SURPRISED HE'S GOING FOR IT.

53
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,458
WITHOUT THE BENEFIT
OF HIS RIGHT EYE,

54
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,666
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON
SEEMS TO BE FLYING BLIND.

55
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,625
- NOW I SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO.

56
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,541
- WHAT?
- DAMN THAT TOYOTOMI.

57
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,083
- WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK
THEIR ASSES BACK TO KAI!

58
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,083
- ( cheering )

59
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,083
- LORD TAKEDA, IT'S THE SOLDIERS
ENCIRCLING KAI.

60
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,291
THEY'RE ENGAGING DATE
DISGUISED AS YOUR TROOPS.

61
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,750
- LET'S SHOW THEM HOW HIGH
A DRAGON CAN SOAR!

62
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,500
- ( shouts )

63
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,333
- ( theme music plays )

64
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,208
- Katakura:
LORD MASAMUNE...

65
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:22,291
I, KATAKURA KOJURO,
AM CERTAIN YOU STILL LIVE.

66
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,541
I'VE NEVER DOUBTED
YOUR SURVIVAL FOR A MOMENT.

67
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,875
SO PLEASE, DO NOT ACT RASHLY
WHILE I AM AWAY.

68
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,541
I BEG OF YOU.

69
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,166
- KOJURO...

70
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,166
- ONE-EYED DRAGON,

71
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,416
THESE WARRIORS ARE NOT TAKEDA'S.

72
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,833
THEY'RE TOYOTOMI'S
IN DISGUISE.

73
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,833
- SON OF A BITCH.

74
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,458
- Narrator:
MEANWHILE, HAVING FAILED TO SAVE

75
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,416
CHOSOKABE AND HIS PIRATES
FROM TOYOTOMI'S ATTACK,

76
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,666
SANADA YUKIMURA NOW TRUDGED
HIS WAY INTO KYUSHU.

77
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,958
HIS COASTAL DESTINATION,
SATSUMA,

78
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,041
WAS ALMOST WITHIN REACH.

79
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,375
- Matsunaga: WHATSOEVER A
MAN SOWETH, THAT SHALL HE REAP.

80
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:14,166
LOOK AT YOU, TREKKING
TO KYOTO IN THESE DARK TIMES.

81
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,208
WHAT IS A GENERAL,
BUT AN AGENT OF CARNAGE,

82
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:21,458
WHO CLINGS TO HONOR
AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR VIOLENCE?

83
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,083
- Sarutobi:
WHY DO YOU THINK OYAMADA

84
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:36,458
LED THOSE MEN INTO BATTLE
AT YOUR COMMAND?

85
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,416
IN TIMES OF PEACE,
IT'S DIFFERENT.

86
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,250
YOU HAVE THE LUXURY
OF GROWING INTO YOUR JOB.

87
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,791
BUT THESE ARE UNCERTAIN DAYS.

88
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,166
NONE OF US MAY LIVE
TO SEE TOMORROW.

89
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,000
IF YOU WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE THE LEADER

90
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,750
TO START ACTING LIKE ONE,

91
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,958
IT'S TOO LATE.

92
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,458
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE LESSON.

93
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,166
ONE THAT OYAMADA PAID FOR
ON YOUR BEHALF.

94
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,625
YOU MADE A CHOICE TO HELP
CHOSOKABE, WHATEVER THE COST.

95
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,541
YET THERE YOU WERE, MASTER,

96
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,916
RUNNING TO OYAMADA'S SIDE

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,333
AFTER THEY STRUCK HIM DOWN.

98
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,916
WE RODE IN UNDER PROTEST.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,916
AND YOU COULDN'T EVEN
STAY THE COURSE.

100
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,250
IF THIS IS THE KIND
OF MAN YOU ARE,

101
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,875
EVEN I MIGHT HAVE TO START
LOOKING FOR OTHER EMPLOYMENT.

102
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,916
- ( crying )

103
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,250
I'M SO SORRY!

104
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,541
PLEASE FORGIVE ME,
MASTER OYAMADA!

105
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,625
YOUR DEATH WAS MY FAULT!

106
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,541
- ( crying continues )

107
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,291
- STOP THAT YELLING.

108
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,375
DO YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT OYAMADA WOULD HAVE WANTED?

109
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,458
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT WILL YOU
DO FROM HERE ON OUT?

110
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,916
- Sanada: I'VE WIELDED THESE
SPEARS IN FIGHT AFTER FIGHT,

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,458
HOPING THAT I MIGHT PLAY
SOME TINY PART IN BRINGING PEACE

112
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,458
TO THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN.

113
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,833
BUT TRY AS I MIGHT, THE WORLD
IS THE SAME AS IT EVER WAS.

114
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,625
WHAT HAVE I WROUGHT
WITH THESE SPEARS?

115
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,250
NOTHING BUT PAIN AND SUFFERING.

116
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,416
UPON FOE AND FRIEND ALIKE.

117
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,458
AND THE ENTIRE TIME WE'VE BEEN
OUT ON THIS MISSION,

118
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,166
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING
LIKE A NOVICE.

119
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,125
I CAN'T STOP THINKING OF--

120
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,375
I FAILED YOU.

121
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,708
FORGIVE ME, YOUR LORDSHIP.

122
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,708
- Soldier:
MASTER YUKIMURA!

123
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,083
- ALRIGHT.

124
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,583
GENTLEMEN, I ASSUME YOU ARE
WITH THE DEFENDERS OF SATSUMA.

125
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,625
WE ARE AN ENVOY OF LORD TAKEDA,

126
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,083
SENT HERE FROM THE LAND OF KAI.

127
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,333
MY GREETINGS. I AM KNOWN
AS SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA.

128
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,708
I BEAR A MESSAGE
FOR YOUR LEADER, IF YOU--

129
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,250
- ( screaming )

130
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,625
- NO, COME BACK!

131
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,083
HOLD ON A MOMENT, PLEASE!

132
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,958
LOOK, I THINK THERE'S BEEN
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

133
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,625
YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE VIGILANT
IN DEFENSE OF SATSUMA,

134
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,833
BUT WE MEAN YOU NO--

135
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:35,000
- ( rustling )

136
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,750
- I JUST WALKED INTO A TRAP.

137
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,833
- ( laughing )

138
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,333
- CHECK IT, I SET UP
MY SIGNATURE AMBUSH

139
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,208
AND YOU CHUMPS
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.

140
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,500
- SO, YOU PLANNED THIS.

141
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,666
AM I TO ASSUME YOU ARE
THE LEADER OF THIS OUTFIT?

142
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,583
- NOW, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
KICK THEIR ASSES!

143
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,708
- Sanada:
DEFEND YOURSELVES,

144
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,500
BUT DO NOT HURT THEM
IF YOU CAN AVOID IT.

145
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,458
- Soldiers:
YES, SIR!

146
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,958
- WANT SOME OF THIS?  ALRIGHT!

147
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,541
YOUR MOMMA'S SO FAT,

148
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,916
TADAKATSU COULDN'T PICK HER UP!

149
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,458
- HE'S HAD NO FORMAL TRAINING,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

150
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,041
BUT THAT MAKES HIS NEXT MOVE
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO READ.

151
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:37,875
- COME ON, YOU TRYING TO COPY
MY TWO-SWORD STYLE?

152
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,541
LOOK, I'VE GOT PLACES TO BE.

153
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,458
SO JUST LOSE ALREADY!

154
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,458
- LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

155
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,916
IF YOU ARE THE COMMANDER
OF SATSUMA'S MILITARY FORCE--

156
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,458
- BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS, JERK!

157
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,708
- FINE, IT NEED NOT BE YOU.

158
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,625
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMANDER
I CAN SPEAK WITH,

159
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,208
WOULD YOU PLEASE GRANT ME
AN AUDIENCE WITH THEM?

160
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,541
- CRAP.

161
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,583
YOU KNOW, YOUR SPEAR-WORK
IS PRETTY BADASS.

162
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:23,125
- WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR THE COMPLIMENT.

163
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,916
LET US TRY THIS AGAIN.

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,791
- OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK!

165
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,583
WHO'S GOT TWO THUMBS,
AND JUST KICKED YOUR ASS?

166
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,916
THIS GUY!

167
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,833
- I'M LIKING YOU
LESS BY THE MOMENT.

168
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,541
- BOO-HOO, MAN.

169
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,833
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THROW
IN THE TOWEL, ARE YOU?

170
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,666
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
ALL STUBBORN AND CRAP,

171
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,625
I GUESS I'LL TAKE YOU
TO SEE OL' POPS.

172
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,958
COME ON, POKEY.

173
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,208
- THAT IS HIM, RIGHT?

174
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,708
- YO, POPS!

175
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,583
TURNS OUT THOSE WEREN'T
TOYOTOMI'S GUYS!

176
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,166
THEY CAME OUT HERE TO SEE YOU.

177
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,291
THEY SAY THEY CAME
FROM THE LAND OF IKA.

178
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,166
- Sanada: WHAT? I NEVER
SAID WE WERE FROM IKA.

179
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,916
WE'RE FROM KAI.

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

181
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,708
- I'M SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA,
SIR.

182
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,916
VASSAL OF LORD TAKEDA SHINGEN
OF KAI.

183
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,416
I'VE COME AT MILORD'S REQUEST

184
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,750
TO BOLSTER YOUR FORCES
WITH YOUR PERMISSION.

185
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,625
THAT WE MAY THWART TOYOTOMI
HIDEYOSHI'S INVASION OF SATSUMA.

186
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,291
- DUDE, POPS!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

187
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,166
THAT'S TOTALLY SHOCHU WINE, HUH?

188
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,500
- JUST WATER.

189
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,000
- YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR!

190
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,333
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DRINK THAT STUFF

191
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,916
UNTIL YOU'RE
ALL HEALED UP, REMEMBER?

192
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,666
- I TOLD YOU, BOY.
IT'S WATER.

193
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,125
- OH, NO IT AIN'T!

194
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,041
- THAT THERE'S
THE BEST MEDICINE.

195
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,333
SANADA YUKIMURA, WAS IT?

196
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:13,041
THE OLD TIGER OF KAI
PUT YOU THROUGH A BIT OF FUSS

197
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,500
COMING ALL THIS WAY TO SEE ME.

198
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:20,041
SHIMAZU YOSHIHIRO OF SATSUMA,
AT YOUR SERVICE.

199
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,958
- BUT HOW?!

200
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:26,541
LORD SHIMAZU, I THOUGHT
YOU HAD PERISHED.

201
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,750
HOW GOOD IT IS
TO FIND YOU ALIVE!

202
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,750
- ( door opens )

203
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,750
- Takenaka:
HAVE YOU AN ANSWER YET?

204
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,750
WE'VE BEEN MORE THAN PATIENT.

205
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,500
- Katakura:
I GIVE NO ANSWER

206
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,500
UNTIL I HAVE SEEN
LORD MASAMUNE'S HEAD.

207
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,750
BRING TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI TO ME.

208
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,333
OR ME TO HIM.

209
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,791
FOR IF HE HAS DEFEATED MILORD,

210
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,083
I DEMAND THE RIGHT TO FACE HIM
IN SINGLE COMBAT.

211
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,500
- THE REALITY OF YOUR SITUATION
CONTINUES TO ELUDE YOU.

212
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,750
YOU OWE THIS CLAN A GREAT DEAL,
MY DEAR KATAKURA.

213
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,125
YOU THWARTED US AT KAWANAKAJIMA,

214
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,625
SETTING BACK OUR UNIFICATION
OF THE COUNTRY.

215
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,083
AND BY EXTENSION,
OUR GRAND CONQUEST OF THE GLOBE.

216
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:11,416
AS OUR CAPTIVE, YOU'RE
NOW OBLIGED TO HELP US.

217
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,041
YOU WILL HOLD A POSITION
OF HONOR IN A FIGHTING FORCE

218
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,875
THAT WILL SOMEDAY
RULE THE WORLD.

219
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,958
ANY TRUE WARRIOR WOULD KILL
FOR SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY.

220
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,416
- ANY WORLD LORDED OVER
BY YOU PEOPLE

221
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,875
DOESN'T INTEREST ME.

222
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,708
- WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL SING

223
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,250
A DIFFERENT TUNE WHEN WE HAVE
THIS COUNTRY UNDER OUR THUMB.

224
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,041
THERE WILL BE NO MASTERS
LEFT TO SERVE,

225
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,625
SAVE LORD HIDEYOSHI.

226
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,458
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
AT ALL, TAKENAKA.

227
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,833
- I IMAGINE NOT.

228
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,791
- WHY DO YOU WASTE
YOUR TIME WITH THIS?

229
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:44,291
YOU'RE NOT SOME FLUNKY
WITH NO BRAIN IN HIS HEAD.

230
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,708
BUT HERE YOU ARE.

231
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,208
WITH YOUR HONEYED WORDS
AND YOUR STALE PROMISES.

232
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,208
TRYING TO RECRUIT
THE LAST MAN ON EARTH

233
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,208
WHO WOULD EVER
STOOP SO LOW--

234
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,791
- ( grunts )

235
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,291
- YOU FORGET YOURSELF,
MY DEAR KATAKURA.

236
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,666
UNDERSTAND THAT I AM
NOT ASKING YOU TO JOIN US.

237
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,833
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

238
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,458
- HAVEN'T I?

239
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,666
WHY SUCH A DAMNABLE HURRY?

240
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,666
- YOU WILL COME TO ADMIRE
LORD HIDEYOSHI, AS DID I.

241
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,625
YOU'LL KNEEL

242
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,583
IN THE PRESENCE
OF SUCH OVERWHELMING STRENGTH.

243
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:23,125
- Date: HE DISGUISED
HIS SOLDIERS AS YOURS

244
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,708
IN THE HOPES OF PISSING ME OFF.

245
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,500
REAL MATURE, TOYOTOMI.
WHAT IS HE, FIVE?

246
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,833
- Takeda: THAT SAID, HE
SEEMED TO HAVE YOU FOOLED.

247
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,250
AT LEAST MOMENTARILY.

248
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,750
WAS IT THE VOICE
OF YOUR RIGHT EYE, PERHAPS?

249
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,250
SUGGESTING CAUTION AS YOU WENT
TO FREE HIS BLADE?

250
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,375
THIS IS LIKELY
HIS OPENING GAMBIT.

251
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,375
TOYOTOMI'S NEXT MOVE WILL BE
DECIDED IN LARGE PART

252
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,791
BY HOW YOU AND I
GO FORWARD FROM HERE.

253
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,416
- HE WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE

254
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,250
TO TRY AND LOCK US
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

255
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,875
- I DOUBT THEY THOUGHT
THEIR RUSE WOULD RESULT

256
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,166
IN BOTH OF OUR DEATHS.

257
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,125
THAT LEAVES FAR TOO MUCH
TO CHANCE.

258
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,333
IT COULD BE THEY WANT US
TO ONCE AGAIN JOIN FORCES

259
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,208
IN PURSUIT OF A SHARED FOE.

260
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,958
- AND THAT HELPS THEM, HOW?

261
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,666
- TOYOTOMI WOULD RATHER
FACE BOTH OF US AT ONCE.

262
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,250
HE BOASTS AN OVERWHELMINGLY
POWERFUL FORCE.

263
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,250
INSTEAD OF CHASING
INDIVIDUAL ARMIES,

264
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,708
I'M SURE HE'D PREFER
TO DESTROY US EN MASSE.

265
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,958
HE MAY BE ANGLING
FOR A SCENARIO

266
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,333
REMINISCENT OF WHEN WE
ENCIRCLED ODA.

267
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,875
JUST TO GET US ALL
IN ONE PLACE.

268
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,416
- HE SITS ON HIS ASS
AND WE COME RUNNING, HUH?

269
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,041
KILL EVERYONE, MOP UP,
TAKE THE COUNTRY FOR HIMSELF.

270
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,083
HELL, HE MAKES IT SOUND SO EASY.

271
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,833
- I'M TEMPTED TO GIVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTS

272
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:37,083
AND FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH YOU.
BUT ON OUR TERMS.

273
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,041
JUST BECAUSE WE TEAM UP
AGAINST HIM,

274
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,541
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE OBLIGATED

275
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,250
TO MARCH ON HIM
AT THE SAME TIME.

276
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,333
WELL, ONE-EYED DRAGON?

277
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,958
DOES CONQUERING ODAWARA
INTEREST YOU?

278
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:51,125
THE DATE CLAIM ODAWARA,
AND WE TAKE UTSUNOMIYA.

279
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,958
UESUGI PLAYS HIS PART
AS I'M SURE HE SHALL.

280
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,166
WITH ECHIGO AND OSHU
AT OUR BACKS,

281
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,875
WE CAN DO THIS WITH LITTLE RISK

282
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,625
AND FORM A DEFENSIBLE BLOC
ACROSS THE EAST.

283
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,041
- SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD, OLD MAN.

284
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,000
I BET YOU IT WOULD EVEN WORK.

285
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,583
BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT MY ANSWER IS.

286
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,708
WE'RE MOUNTED UP AND READY
TO BUST OUR WAY INTO OSAKA.

287
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,416
TOYOTOMI'S GOT SOMETHING.

288
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,833
SOMETHING HE'S GOING TO REGRET
TAKING FROM ME.

289
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,416
WE HAVE A LITTLE SCORE
TO SETTLE, HE AND I.

290
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,125
- WERE HE HERE TO GIVE
HIS OPINION,

291
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,916
YOUR LIEUTENANT KATAKURA
MIGHT ADVISE YOU

292
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,583
TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION.

293
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,833
- YEAH, TOO BAD FOR YOU
HE'S NOT AROUND TO TELL ME.

294
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,250
THAT'S WHY I NEED HIM BACK.

295
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,125
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR BOY
YUKIMURA UP TO?

296
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,750
- I SENT HIM TO KYUSHU.

297
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,583
IN HOPES THAT HE CAN
FORM AN ALLIANCE

298
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,625
WITH THE MEN DEFENDING SATSUMA.

299
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,583
- YOU AND YOUR ALLIANCES.

300
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,875
SO YOU PLAN TO HIT
TOYOTOMI FROM THE WEST, TOO?

301
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:56,000
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT I'LL HAVE TAKEN HIM OUT

302
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,000
BEFORE THE KID
EVEN GETS A CRACK AT IT.

303
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,875
- JUST LIKE THAT?

304
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,416
YOU THINK THAT DEFEATING HIM
IS GOING TO BE EASY?

305
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,875
YOUR WILLPOWER AND PRIDE
ONLY COUNT FOR SO MUCH.

306
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,708
THIS IS NOT A FOE YOU CAN TAME

307
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,750
BY CHARGING HEADLONG
INTO ITS DEN

308
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,916
WITH BUT A SINGLE BATTALION
OF MEN AT YOUR BACK.

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,500
- I'M NOT GOING THERE TO DIE.

310
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,500
OF COURSE, I GUESS
THAT AIN'T UP TO JUST ME.

311
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,708
- ANY DRAGON THAT DOESN'T
TAKE TO THE SKY

312
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,875
MAY AS WELL BE DEAD
TO BEGIN WITH, RIGHT?

313
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,583
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

314
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,333
I CAN'T LET HIM HAVE IT.

315
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,083
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
WHEN I FIRST LAID EYE

316
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,125
ON THAT OVERGROWN BASTARD.

317
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,125
HE'S NOT TAKING MY COUNTRY,
NOT ON MY WATCH.

318
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,000
TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI...

319
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,583
YEAH, HE'S GOT A WICKED RIGHT.

320
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,916
BUT SOMETHING'S OFF
ABOUT THAT GUY.

321
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,666
WHAT HE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL
ISN'T STRENGTH.

322
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,291
I'LL NEVER RECOGNIZE IT
AS STRENGTH.

323
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,041
I'LL DIE FIRST.

324
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:55,500
TAKEDA.

325
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,375
IF I DON'T COME BACK, TELL HIM--

326
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,250
LISTEN TO ME, JEEZ.

327
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,625
TELL THE CUB I WISH
I COULD HAVE SCHOOLED HIM,

328
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,500
ONE MORE TIME.

329
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,750
- Takenaka:
DATE SEEMS AS DETERMINED AS EVER

330
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,541
TO MARCH ON OSAKA
WITH THAT RAGTAG BUNCH OF HIS.

331
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,666
AND THIS IS AFTER HIS LOSSES
AT SURIAGEHARA.

332
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,833
I'VE NEVER KNOWN A COMMANDER
WHO WAS SO DIFFICULT TO READ.

333
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,750
- DO YOU THINK THE TIGER OF KAI

334
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,375
PROPOSED JOINING THEIR FORCES
AGAINST US?

335
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,125
- OH, UNDOUBTEDLY.

336
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,416
LORD SHINGEN SHOULD BE
WELL-ACQUAINTED

337
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,083
WITH DATE'S IMPETUOUS NATURE.

338
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,083
HE PROBABLY SPOKE
OF ALLIANCES, ANYWAY.

339
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,750
IT WOULD PROVE MUCH
TO TAKEDA'S FAVOR

340
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,291
IF DATE DID ACQUIESCE.

341
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:44,250
AS THINGS CURRENTLY STAND,
TAKEDA IS BOUND TO KAI.

342
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,916
THUS HE'D TRY TO SELL
DEAR MASAMUNE ON TAKING ODAWARA.

343
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,583
WE'VE SHORED UP THE CASTLE'S
DEFENSES CONSIDERABLY.

344
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,458
BUT MAYBE HE THINKS
DATE COULD PULL IT OFF

345
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,625
IF HE GAVE IT HIS ALL.

346
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,208
THEY ALL ATTACKED ODA AT ONCE.

347
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,541
I DOUBT THEY'LL REPEAT
THAT SAME STRATEGY AGAINST US.

348
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,208
TAKEDA WAS HOPING TO ESTABLISH
A LINE OF DEFENSE

349
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,166
FROM ECHIGO TO ODAWARA.

350
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,166
THEY COULD THEN WAIT
IN RELATIVE SAFETY

351
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,291
FOR MORE TROOPS
TO COME UP FROM KYUSHU.

352
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,083
PITY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

353
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE
WANTED THEM TO DO.

354
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,166
GENERALLY, MILORD,

355
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,500
OUR FORTE IS NOT IN DEFEATING
INDIVIDUAL ARMIES.

356
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,458
BUT IN CRUSHING
MANY FOES AT ONCE.

357
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,916
THEY LIKELY GATHERED
AS MUCH AT KAWANAKAJIMA.

358
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,250
I THOUGHT IF WE WERE
TRANSPARENT WITH OUR INTENTIONS

359
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,166
WE COULD TWIST THIS KNOWLEDGE
OF OUR STRENGTHS

360
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,666
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

361
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,875
GOAD THEM INTO TAKING
THE BAIT, AS IT WERE.

362
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,416
AFTER ALL, OUR NEW WEAPON
IS SLATED TO ARRIVE

363
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,958
JUST AS THEY WOULD HAVE
FINISHED GETTING INTO POSITION.

364
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,625
BETWEEN YOUR STRENGTH,

365
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,583
AND THE NEW ADDITION
TO OUR ARSENAL,

366
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,625
IT WOULDN'T MATTER
WHETHER THEY DREW

367
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,375
A DEFENSIVE LINE DOWN
THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY

368
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,416
OR ATTACKED US FROM THE WEST.

369
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,166
IN EITHER EVENT, OUR STRATEGY
AND BATTLE FORMATION

370
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,541
WOULD HAVE BEEN
FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

371
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,750
BUT NOW, THE DATE CLAN
HAS SPOILED ALL MY FUN.

372
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,166
IT MAKES ME WANT
TO DESTROY THEM.

373
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,000
IT MATTERS NOT.

374
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,916
OUR COURSE OF ACTION IS SET.

375
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,916
- BRILLIANT WORK, HANBEI.

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,083
- SOON YOU'LL HAVE
THE COUNTRY SITTING

377
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,458
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.

378
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,250
- Servant:
BEG PARDON.

379
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,375
PLEASE FORGIVE
THE INTERRUPTION, BUT--

380
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,791
- OUT WITH IT ALREADY.

381
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,958
- THERE'S A MAN
CLAIMING TO BE THE HEAD

382
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,625
OF THE MAEDA CLAN AT THE GATES.

383
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,375
HE REQUESTS AN AUDIENCE
WITH LORD HIDEYOSHI.

384
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,166
- ( theme music plays )

385
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,083
- Matsunaga:
THIS IS A TURBULENT TIME

386
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,500
FOR THE COUNTRY.

387
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,083
HANG NOT YOUR HOPES
ON TOMORROW.

388
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:11,125
TRULY THERE IS NO GUARANTEE
ALL YOU BRAVE HEROES

389
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,791
WILL YET LIVE TO SEE IT.

390
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,208
YOU'RE QUITE
THE CURIOUS SPECIMEN.
