1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,916
- HIDEYOSHI...

2
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,125
- YOU WILL SUFFER THE FATE
OF ALL THOSE WHO DEFY ME.

3
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,208
FOR THE SAKE OF MY FUTURE REIGN
OVER THIS COUNTRY,

4
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,333
I WILL MAKE AN EXAMPLE
OUT OF YOU AND TAKE YOUR HEAD!

5
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,125
IT APPEARS YOU'VE RISEN
ABOVE THE LITTLE SNAKE

6
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,458
WHO'S HISS WAS WORSE
THAN HIS BITE.

7
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,541
HOWEVER, EVEN IF YOU COULD
WIELD A HUNDRED SWORDS,

8
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,166
EVEN AT YOUR VERY BEST,
YOU ARE ULTIMATELY NOTHING

9
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,625
COMPARED TO ME.

10
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,041
- YEAH, YEAH, I GET YOU.

11
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,416
I DIDN'T EXPECT A PARTY

12
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,708
WITH A WET BLANKET
LIKE YOU TO BE FUN.

13
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,250
'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU.

14
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,625
SO THE QUICKER I GET THIS
OVER WITH, THE BETTER!

15
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,000
- I SEE, SO HE ACTUALLY
SAID THAT, DID HE?

16
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,916
HE TOLD <i>ME</i> TO STAY PUT?

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,833
- SHOULD KENSHIN BE ATTACKED,
GO TO UTSUNOMIYA.

18
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,666
IF DATE IS THE TARGET...

19
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,791
- ...SEND REINFORCEMENTS
TO ODAWARA.

20
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,958
SHOULD THE MOBILE FORTRESS
APPEAR IN THE WEST,

21
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,875
IN THE HANDS OF MORI
OR POSSIBLY THE TOYOTOMI,

22
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:10,833
KNOW THAT I HAVE MET MY END
TRYING MY BEST TO STOP IT.

23
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:14,166
HOWEVER, I SHALL NOT ALLOW
MY DEPARTURE UPON THIS JOURNEY

24
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,666
TO BE OUR FINAL FAREWELL.

25
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,666
I SWEAR UPON THE SOULS
OF MASTER OYAMADA

26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,208
AND ALL THE OTHERS I HAVE LOST,

27
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,791
I SHALL CARRY OUT
MY MISSION WITHOUT FAIL!

28
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,708
- I MOST HEARTILY UNDERSTAND.

29
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,291
SO, YUKIMURA HAS FINALLY FOUND
IT WITHIN HIMSELF

30
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,833
TO MAKE USE OF ME.

31
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:37,291
AT LAST, I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT.

32
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,791
BUT HONESTLY, TELLING <i>ME</i>
TO STAY PUT?

33
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,875
( laughing )

34
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:48,166
YUKIMURA, MY CUB,

35
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,000
ONE-EYED DRAGON,
USE THE STRENGTH OF YOUR YOUTH.

36
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,458
OVERCOME THIS ORDEAL.

37
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,875
ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU
HAVE SET OUT TO DO.

38
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,958
- Soldier: LORD MORI,

39
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,291
THERE IS AN ARMY
WAITING FOR US UP AHEAD.

40
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,791
THEIR BANNERS INDICATE
THEY'RE FROM SATSUMA.

41
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,000
- DECIMATE THEM.

42
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,500
LIGHT IT UP!

43
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,625
WHAT?!

44
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,833
- I AM SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA
OF KAI!

45
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,208
LORD MORI MOTONARI,
IN THE INTEREST OF HIS LORDSHIP

46
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,250
TAKEDA SHINGEN,
THE TIGER OF KAI,

47
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,833
AND WITH WORDS OF ENLIGHTENMENT

48
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,666
FROM LORD SHIMAZU YOSHIHIRO
OF SATSUMA IN MY HEART,

49
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,541
I'VE COME TO STOP
YOUR INVASION OF OSAKA!

50
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,875
- I WAS WONDERING
WHO'S PAWN YOU MIGHT BE.

51
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,458
TAKEDA'S MAN WHO LET
HIS OWN PAWNS DIE

52
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,333
AT ITSUKUSHIMA,
WAS IT STRATEGY OR FAILURE?

53
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:20,416
I'M SURPRISED
YOU STILL DRAW BREATH.

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
- BOTH THE TOYOTOMI AND THE MORI
GIVE NO THOUGHT

55
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,166
TO THE FUTURE OF YOUR PEOPLE.
YOUR ONLY THOUGHT IS BETRAYAL!

56
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,750
YOU WILL GO NO FURTHER!

57
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,875
- YOUR ONLY SKILL
IS MAKING A NUISANCE

58
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,375
OF YOURSELF TO OTHERS.

59
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,291
BE GONE, I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN YOUR DRIVEL.

60
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,916
- Takenaka:
I SEE NOW,

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,791
IT IS CLEAR YOU AND I
ARE QUITE DIFFERENT.

62
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,541
THE WORDS WHICH ADORN YOUR SWORD

63
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,375
ARE NOT THE NOBLE VOW
OF A SECOND-IN-COMMAND.

64
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,958
THEY ARE A SUTRA, MEANT
TO SEAL AWAY THE BRUTALITY

65
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,416
BURIED DEEP WITHIN YOU.

66
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,666
- RECITE YOUR OWN SUTRAS,
TAKENAKA HANBEI.

67
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,458
THAT IS ALL THE TIME
I WILL GIVE YOU.

68
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,458
- AFTER ALL I'VE SEEN,
MY LIFE IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE.

69
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,750
BUT SADLY,

70
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,708
WHAT'S LEFT OF IT WILL NOT END

71
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,416
BY YOUR HAND.

72
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,458
- Toyotomi: ARE YOU NOW
AWARE OF WHAT YOU LACK,

73
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,875
ONE-EYED DRAGON?

74
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,541
IF THAT EYE CAN SEE
HOW THIS COUNTRY

75
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,375
WALKS DOWN THE PATH OF RUIN,

76
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,625
AT LEAST TRY TO STRIKE
A RETURN BLOW.

77
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,916
IF YOU WOULD HOWL, THEN HAVE
THE STRENGTH TO MATCH IT.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,958
THE COUNTRY I GIVE SHAPE TO HAS
NO NEED OF THOSE WHO ARE WEAK.

79
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,958
THOSE WHO LACK STRENGTH,

80
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,875
I WILL SIMPLY CRUSH
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

81
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,625
- GIVE ME A BREAK,

82
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,833
IN A WORLD UNDER
YOUR FAT-ASS THUMB,

83
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,791
NO ONE COMES OUT THE WINNER.

84
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,875
- THE LAND MUST BE RULED
BY STRENGTH!

85
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,875
AND I AM THE STRONGEST ONE
THERE IS!

86
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,375
- ( all ): BOSS!

87
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,041
- THIS COUNTRY SUFFERS
A MALADY OF WEAKNESS.

88
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:08,291
AND I, MY TOYOTOMI ARMY,
WILL BE THE CURE!

89
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,750
- Ishida: YOU ARE UESUGI
KENSHIN, I PRESUME.

90
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,541
- INDEED I AM,
AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

91
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,791
- YOUR SLAYER, ISHIDA MITSUNARI.

92
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,916
UNDER LORD HIDEYOSHI'S
AUTHORITY,

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,916
I WILL TAKE YOU DOWN.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,708
- DRIVEN AND PURE OF HEART.
SO MUCH SO IT PAINS ME.

95
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,833
- LORD KENSHIN!

96
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,000
- HOW SWIFT.

97
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,500
- ONCE WE'VE BEATEN
ALL OF THESE GUYS TO A PULP,

98
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,875
YOU'RE FIGHTING
WITH ME, POPS.  REMEMBER?

99
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,833
- OH, I KNOW.

100
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,250
THIS HERE'S NOTHING
BUT A WARM-UP.

101
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,750
YOU'VE DONE GOOD, BOY.

102
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,291
REST THERE FOR NOW-- BRING IT!

103
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,750
- Tokugawa: GLAD WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO STRIKE OUR ALLIES,

104
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,541
THE MORI, FROM BEHIND.

105
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,416
RIGHT THEN, LET'S FIGURE OUT
WHAT DIRECTION

106
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,125
LORD HIDEYOSHI'S PATH
IS HEADED IN NOW.

107
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,000
TOKUGAWA IEYASU,
TAKING THE FIELD!

108
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:49,166
- LISTEN WELL, MY PAWNS.
GIVE YOUR LIVES IF YOU MUST

109
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,916
BUT SLAY EVERY LAST ONE
OF OUR FOES!

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,041
- HE IS WILLING TO SACRIFICE
HIS OWN MEN.

111
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,083
NO MATTER HOW NOBLE THE CAUSE
ONE MAY SERVE,

112
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,291
THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE!

113
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,291
- Soldier:
MASTER YUKIMURA!

114
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,708
- NO!

115
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,125
- Mori:
THE FOOL,

116
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,250
SURELY HE DOES NOT HOPE TO STOP
THE PASSAGE OF THE SUN

117
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,500
WITH ONLY HIS TWO SPEARS.

118
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,750
A VAIN PLAN
IF EVER THERE WAS ONE.

119
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,416
- PERFECT SPEAR OF CONQUEST!

120
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,833
SANADA YUKIMURA HAS ARRIVED!

121
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,708
YOU SHALL NOT PASS!

122
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,166
BURN ABLAZE!

123
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,166
- WHAT IS THIS?

124
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,458
- THESE SPEARS ARE MY SOUL,
THEY WILL NOT BREAK!

125
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,791
DO NOT BREAK!

126
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:09,708
- HE IS THE ULTIMATE PAWN,
THE IDEAL SACRIFICE.

127
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,208
I WISH I COULD MAKE MY OWN MEN
LEARN FROM HIS EXAMPLE.

128
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,208
- MORI MOTONARI,

129
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,875
COME, LET US HAVE A FAIR FIGHT.

130
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,083
- YOU WILL DIE
MOST HORRIFICALLY,

131
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,458
LIKE THE PAWN YOU ARE.

132
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,416
OH, THREE STARS,
MY FAMILY CREST.

133
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,333
WITH RESPECT, I OFFER
IT UP TO THE SUN.

134
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,916
NO MERE PAWN CAN STOP ME!

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,791
ACTIVATE THE MORNING STAR
DEATH RAY!

136
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,500
- THE HEAT!
IT IS EXCRUCIATING!

137
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,583
- ALL GOES IN ACCORDANCE
WITH MY CALCULATIONS.

138
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,083
- Takenaka:
I HATE TO ADMIT THIS,

139
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,125
BUT I MUST FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGE

140
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,041
THAT DEAR MASAMUNE
IS A BORN DRAGON.

141
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:59,541
HIDEYOSHI IS STRONGER
THAN ANYONE OUT THERE,

142
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,083
BUT HIM--

143
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,833
I SENSE SOMETHING
UNFATHOMABLE IN THAT DRAGON.

144
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,583
SOMEDAY, HE IS CERTAIN
TO BECOME A FORCE

145
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,958
THAT WILL BRING HARM
TO THE TOYOTOMI.

146
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,791
- Sanada:
SOARING THE SKIES,

147
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,500
SCORCHING THE EARTH,

148
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,666
SANADA YUKIMURA

149
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,250
WILL NEVER STAND STILL!

150
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,791
- AMAZING!

151
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,333
THIS MAN BURNS SO FURIOUSLY,

152
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,333
HOTTER THAN EVEN
THE INCOMPARABLE SEARING 

153
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,833
OF THE SUN ITSELF!

154
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,666
- MY SOUL'S LIGHT
SHALL NEVER BE EXTINGUISHED!

155
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,041
- MY CALCULATIONS,
HE HAS VOIDED THEM.

156
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,708
I SUFFER DEFEAT?  IMPOSSIBLE.

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,875
- ( cheering )

158
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,041
- Sanada:
LORD MASAMUNE,

159
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,791
IN SOME SMALL WAY
HAVE I BECOME MORE LIKE YOU?

160
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:54,750
PLEASE LIVE THROUGH THIS.
AND ONCE MORE, LET US--

161
00:12:54,833 --> 00:13:00,166
ONCE MORE, LET US MEET
ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE.

162
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,541
- I'VE WANTED THIS CHANCE

163
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,333
TO HACK AWAY
AT EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

164
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,166
BUT IF YOU'RE LIFE 
IS ALREADY NEARING ITS END,

165
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,583
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME.

166
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,375
BUT I GRANT YOU NO MERCY.

167
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,166
- AS IT SHOULD BE.

168
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,625
THERE WAS NEVER ANYONE
WHO COULD TAKE MY PLACE.

169
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,208
NEVER!

170
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,250
HIDEYOSHI...

171
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,500
- THE DRAGON WILL DEVOUR
EVEN THE GODS.

172
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:33,333
MY LORD MASAMUNE
WILL NEVER KNOW DEFEAT.

173
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DAYDREAMING
ABOUT OVER THERE?

174
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,833
INSTEAD OF STARING OFF
AT A PLACE

175
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,291
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE FROM HERE,
TRY PAYING ATTENTION

176
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,041
TO WHAT'S RIGHT HERE
UNDER YOUR NOSE.

177
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,166
- AGAIN, YOU HOWL
RATHER THAN STRIKE.

178
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,916
CERTAINLY YOU HAVE
LEARNED YOUR LESSON,

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,208
AND HAVE BEGUN TO REGRET
BEING FOOLISH ENOUGH

180
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,166
TO DEFY A MIGHTY POWER
WITHOUT KNOWING YOUR PLACE.

181
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,458
YOU WANT THIS COUNTRY?

182
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,625
YOU KNOW NOTHING
OF THE BROADER PICTURE.

183
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,500
THAT IS THE KEY
TO YOUR DOWNFALL.

184
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,833
THS IS FINALLY THE END
OF ONE WHO LACKS STRENGTH.

185
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,083
DAMN IT!

186
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,333
FIRST THE PIRATE,
AND NOW YOU?!

187
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,666
WHY WILL YOU NOT DIE?

188
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,916
- YOUR LAVENDER LACKEY'S
TOO SCARED

189
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,416
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

190
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,041
YOU'RE JUST NOT AS STRONG
AS YOU THINK.

191
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,541
NO LIMIT!

192
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,625
IT HASN'T YET, BUT YOU
WON'T GET THIS COUNTRY

193
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,208
IF IT DOES KILL ME.

194
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,333
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU
WOULD UNIFY IT, THEN?

195
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,208
AT MOST, YOU ARE THE TOP APE
IN A PACK OF WILD GORILLAS.

196
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,000
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH THIS COUNTRY IF YOU HAD IT?

197
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,583
- DOESN'T MATTER, YOU WON'T BE
AROUND TO FIND OUT.

198
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,541
- PATHETIC FOOL!

199
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,791
- YEAH, THAT SONG'S
GETTING BORING.

200
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,958
LONG AS YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO PROTECT,

201
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,041
THOSE THINGS HAVE A WAY
OF WORKING THEMSELVES OUT.

202
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,208
YOU SEE?

203
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,375
- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

204
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,666
WILL I HAND THIS COUNTRY
TO THE LIKES OF YOU!

205
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,375
- BIG BOSS OF OSHU,
DATE MASAMUNE,

206
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,250
FULL SPEED AHEAD!

207
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,875
BLAST OFF!

208
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,708
I CAN FINALLY HEAD ON OUT
TO THE REAL PARTY.

209
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,666
THE ONE THAT'S BEEN ON HOLD,

210
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,125
THANKS TO YOU.

211
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:39,708
THE ONE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

212
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,375
- Keiji:
HIDEYOSHI...

213
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:55,958
REMEMBER BACK WHEN?

214
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,708
WE ALWAYS USED TO ENJOY
THE BREEZE TOGETHER LIKE THIS.

215
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,541
IT'S LIKE WE'VE GONE BACK
TO THOSE DAYS, EH, HIDEYOSHI?

216
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:07,041
- TIME FLOWS AT QUITE
A LEISURELY PACE HERE.

217
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,166
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER STOPPED

218
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,375
AND ENJOYED THE BREEZE WITH YOU.

219
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,875
- Keiji:
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

220
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,000
SINCE THE THREE OF US
WERE TOGETHER AT ALL.

221
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,041
A REAL LONG TIME.

222
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,333
OH YEAH, HIDEYOSHI,
YOU USED TO LIKE GOING

223
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,208
TO SEE CHERRY BLOSSOMS, RIGHT?

224
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,083
WHEN SPRING COMES, WHY DON'T
YOU AND I HEAD AROUND AND--

225
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,625
- Toyotomi:
KEIJI,

226
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,833
NOT EVERYBODY GETS
TO LIVE FOREVER AS YOU SEEM TO.

227
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:38,000
IN ORDER TO LEAD ALL PEOPLE,
TO BUILD A TRULY STRONG NATION,

228
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,833
YOU CANNOT ALLOW ANYTHING
THAT COULD MAKE YOU WEAK.

229
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:54,500
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
DELIVERED THIS TO ME.

230
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,666
BUT I AM NO LONGER
WORTHY OF HAVING IT.

231
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,625
DO ME THE HONOR
OF HOLDING ON TO IT.

232
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,166
FOR HER, KEIJI.

233
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:11,125
- REALLY?

234
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,000
YOU STUBBORN, STUBBORN FOOL.

235
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,125
DAMN YOU.

236
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,000
- Narrator: THE TOYOTOMI
ARMY SOON FELL TO SHAMBLES.

237
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,500
THERE ONCE WAS A GENERAL,

238
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,333
WHO BELIEVED ONLY IN STRENGTH

239
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,250
AND PURSUED IT
WITH BLIND AMBITION.

240
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,791
AND HIS LOYAL STRATEGIST,

241
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,125
WHO BELIEVED
IN HIS LORD'S ASPIRATIONS.

242
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,208
WITH TRULY CRUSHING MIGHT,

243
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,458
THEY SOUGHT TO UNIFY
THE COUNTRY.

244
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,458
AND THEN TO FORGE RELATIONS

245
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,708
OUT IN THE WORLD AT LARGE.

246
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,458
AND NOW THAT ERA
HAD COME TO AN END.

247
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,541
 NO ONE HAD YET LAID CLAIM
TO THE ENTIRETY

248
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,125
OF THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN.

249
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,916
AND UNTIL THE DAY BLADES
ONCE AGAIN ROSE UP IN CHAOS

250
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,333
TO FIGHT FOR IT, IT'S PEOPLE
GAVE THEMSELVES OVER

251
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,416
TO THE FLEETING PEACE THAT HAD
SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

252
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,916
AND ONCE MORE,
THEY QUIETLY WAITED

253
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,291
FOR THE WAR CRY.
ASPIRING TO THE PINNACLE.

254
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,250
- WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?  KIEJI?

255
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,250
- OH, JUST A QUICK JAUNT
OUT TO KYOTO.

256
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,791
BUT I MIGHT STRETCH IT
INTO A TRIP

257
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,458
TO MOTOCHIKA'S PLACE.

258
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,333
- BUT, YOU JUST GOT HERE.

259
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,083
- YOU ARE TO BECOME A WARRIOR

260
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,791
AND SUCCEED AS HEAD
OF THE MAEDA CLAN.

261
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,291
IN FACT, YOU JUST RECENTLY SAID
YOU WOULD DO SO.

262
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,875
- THAT DOESN'T
REALLY SOUND LIKE ME.

263
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,166
 - ( groans )

264
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,291
- WELL, SEE YOU LATER!

265
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,166
-  KEIJI!

266
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,166
- HONESTLY, WHAT A CHILD
YOU ARE!

267
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,708
EVERYTIME I SEE A GLIMMER
OF MATURITY, YOU BLOW IT!

268
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,833
- MATSU, YOU KEEP
THAT DISAPPROVING LOOK

269
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,416
AND THOSE WRINKLES
WILL STAY THAT WAY!

270
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,916
- JUST A MINUTE, KEIJI.
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

271
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,166
SOME THINGS YOU SIMPLY
DO NOT JOKE ABOUT!

272
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,958
MY LORD INUCHIYO,
THIS REALLY IS NOT A MATTER

273
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,541
TO BE LAUGHED AT.
I SAID GET BACK HERE, KEIJI!

274
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,666
- Takeda: THE WORLD IS
STILL FULL OF STRIFE.

275
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,625
THOUGH MANKIND MAY CEASE TO WAR,

276
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,666
PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE.

277
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,916
THOUGH A DAY MAY COME WHEN
YOU LAY YOUR SPEARS TO REST,

278
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,666
FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE,
WIELD THOSE SPEARS OF YOUR SOUL

279
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,291
FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

280
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:33,500
- SIR, IN ORDER TO FORGE A WORLD
WHERE ALL MAY LIVE,

281
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,333
NOT FOR WAR AND STRIFE

282
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,708
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF HAPPINESS,

283
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,375
TO BUILD A WORLD
WE CAN BE TRULY PROUD OF,

284
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,833
IT IS MY PLEDGE, I, YUKIMURA,
SHALL ENDURE INJUSTICES,

285
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,916
OVERCOME TRIALS,
AND ACCEPT CONTRADITIONS

286
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
FROM NO PERSON BUT MYSELF.

287
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,791
UNTIL LASTING PEACE COMES,
I WILL LET MY SOUL BURN.

288
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,083
I WILL ACCOMPLISH
ALL THAT FATE ALLOWS ME TO

289
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,041
WITHOUT FAIL, MY LORD.

290
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,583
- ( chuckles )

291
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:01,291
PERHAPS MY GENERATION'S TIME
HAS PASSED.

292
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,333
( groans )
- ( gasps )

293
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,625
YOUR LORDSHIP!

294
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,291
YOUR LORDSHIP!

295
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,541
- YOU THINK THAT I WOULD 
UTTER SUCH FEEBLE WORDS?!

296
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,208
MY, HOW YOU'VE GROWN,
YUKIMURA.

297
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,666
- THANKS, YOUR LORDSHIP.

298
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,541
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

299
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,833
- YUKIMURA!

300
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,666
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

301
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,291
- YUKIMURA!

302
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,541
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

303
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

304
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,166
- YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE'S BOUND

305
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,375
TO WANT TO THROW
A NEW PARTY SOON ENOUGH.

306
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,958
- IT CAN'T BE LONG UNTIL
WE LIVE IN A TIME OF WAR AGAIN.

307
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,916
WE MUST COMPLETE THE REBUILDING
OF OSHU BEFORE THEN.

308
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,916
- YEAH, LOOKS LIKE WE WON'T
HAVE ANY TIME TO BE BORED. 

309
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,458
- PLUS, WE'VE ADDED QUITE A
SPIRITED BUNCH TO OUR ROSTER.

310
