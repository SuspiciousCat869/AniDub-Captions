1
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,958
- Narrator: THE SENGOKU PERIOD,
A TIME OF CHAOS AND BLOODSHED.

2
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,458
WHEN THE BATTLE CRIES OF
THOUSANDS OF BRAVE WARRIORS,

3
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,833
RANG OUT ACROSS THE LAND.

4
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,208
SOME WERE DRIVEN BY AMBITION,

5
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,250
OTHERS BURNED WITH LOFTY IDEALS.

6
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,541
SOME SOUGHT TO DEFEND
JUSTICE AND PRIDE,

7
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,125
WHILE OTHERS,
HAD MORE TANGIBLE GOALS.

8
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,750
THEIR EYES FIXED SOLELY
ON A DISTANT PRIZE,

9
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,708
WAITING FOR THEM TO CONQUER.

10
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,625
- ( theme song playing )

11
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,291
- Narrator: DATE MASAMUNE,
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON OF OSHU,

12
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,500
USING A CLEVER PLAN DEVISED
BY HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN,

13
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,000
LURED THE HOJO ARMY
INTO THE ADVANCING TAKEDA ARMY.

14
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:37,208
DATE THEN HEADED FOR SURUGA
TO BRING DOWN IMAGAWA YOSHIMOTO.

15
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,375
ON SHINGEN'S ORDERS,

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,000
SANADA YUKIMURA PURSUES
DATE AND HIS ARMY

17
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,458
IN ORDER TO STOP THEM.

18
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,541
- YOU ARE A BOLD MAN,
LORD MASAMUNE.

19
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,000
YOU'LL FIND SO AM I.

20
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,416
- A ONE-EYED DRAGON WILL BITE
OFF THE HEAD OF IMAGAWA.

21
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,541
- ( sighs )

22
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,208
- Uesugi: DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

23
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,291
OR WAS THERE SOMETHING ELSE
YOU WANTED TO ASK?

24
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,500
- I... FORGIVE ME,
LORD KENSHIN.

25
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,083
I DID NOT INTEND TO...

26
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,625
- THE REASON TAKEDA AND
I DID NOT CROSS SWORDS

27
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:13,041
AT KAWANAKAJIMA, WAS TO
AVOID THE NEEDLESS CASUALTIES

28
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,000
A THREE-WAY BATTLE WITH DATE
WOULD HAVE BROUGHT US BOTH.

29
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,916
FURTHERMORE, THERE WAS
THE TIGER OF KAI'S

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,041
YOUNG CUB TO CONSIDER,
AND THE WORTHY RIVAL HE FOUND,

31
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,666
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON,
DATE MASAMUNE.

32
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,791
THE FURY OF THEIR
BLAZING AMBITION

33
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,875
AND THE PURITY OF
THEIR FIGHTING SPIRIT

34
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:33,083
MADE OUR HEARTS SWELL
WITH HONOR AND PRIDE.

35
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,250
- SUCH THOUGHTS
HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME.

36
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,583
AND TAKEDA SHINGEN,
FELT THE SAME WAY?

37
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,500
- I EXPECT SO.

38
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,875
- WITHOUT EXCHANGING A WORD?

39
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,166
- A GRAND QUIRK OF FATE.

40
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,833
FORTUNATE IS THE MAN
WHO FINDS SUCH A RIVAL

41
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,083
WITHIN THE SPAN
OF HIS FLEETING LIFE.

42
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:58,458
- TAKEDA HAS MOBILIZED TO LAUNCH
AN ATTACK ON IMAGAWA, MY LORD.

43
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,833
- WE MUST...

44
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,333
- WE MUST ENSURE OTHERS
NEITHER STRIKE AT HIS LANDS

45
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,083
DURING HIS ABSENCE.

46
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,208
NOR ATTACK HIM FROM THE REAR.

47
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:10,125
WE SHALL HAVE TO REMAIN
EVER VIGILANT, KASUGA.

48
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,166
- WHY DO YOU NOT CONSIDER THIS
TO BE A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY?

49
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,125
- I HAVE TWO WISHES. FOR A
FAIR BATTLE WITH TAKEDA,

50
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,083
INTO WHICH I MAY POUR
MY HEART AND SOUL.

51
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,416
AND FOR THE ETERNAL PEACE
AND PROSPERITY OF ECHIGO.

52
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,875
THAT IS WHY NOT.

53
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,791
- LORD KENSHIN.

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,541
( gasping )

55
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,250
- KASUGA.

56
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,541
BE MY EYES AS TAKEDA
TAKES SUNPU.

57
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,375
USE IT AS A CHANCE TO SCOUT
NEIGHBORING LANDS' ACTIVITIES.

58
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,833
- SIR!

59
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:07,041
- IN PARTICULAR, WATCH
THE MOVEMENTS OF ODA IN OWARI.

60
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,916
- I UNDERSTAND, LORD KENSHIN.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,291
- MAY BISHAMONTEN'S
DIVINE PROVIDENCE BE WITH YOU.

62
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,750
MY MOST BEAUTIFUL BLADE.

63
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,708
- ( moaning )

64
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,208
- ( yawning )

65
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,166
WE DO SO HATE TO TRAVEL.

66
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,500
( snoring )

67
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,833
- Man: LORD YOSHIMOTO.
LORD YOSHIMOTO.

68
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,875
THIS MOST CERTAINLY BE NOT
THE TIME FOR NAPPING.

69
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,166
- THE LORD DOTH NOT "NAP".

70
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,833
- MY LIEGE, PLEASE FORGIVE
MY IMPERTINENCE.

71
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,125
AS YOU ARE AWAKE,

72
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,333
I SHALL DELIVER MY REPORT
WITH ALL DUE HASTE.

73
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,166
- IT MATTERS NOT.
DO AS YOU SEE FIT.

74
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,000
- BUT THIS IS A MATTER
OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.

75
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,083
I CANNOT MAKE
THIS DECISION ALONE.

76
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,500
- HMM?

77
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,333
WE SUPPOSE THE FOOL OF OWARI
HAS COME TO SURRENDER?

78
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,708
- THAT'D BE UH...WOULDST BE
MOST IMPLAUSIBLE, SIR.

79
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,750
- SO, HATH RIGHTEOUS VICTORY
BEEN CLAIMED?

80
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,958
MARVELOUS!
ONWARD TO THE CAPITAL!

81
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,791
- ( bird chirping )

82
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,458
- UH, YOUR EMINENCE.

83
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,333
WE ARE STILL MAKING OUR WAY
TO THE BATTLEFIELD.

84
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,375
- WHAT IS IT THEN?
SKIES ARE CLEAR.

85
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:25,083
AND WE HAVE ENJOYED
OUR NOONDAY MEAL, HAVE WE NOT?

86
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,625
- 'TIS TRUE, WISE LORD, AND YOUR
ARMY MAKES FINE PROGRESS,

87
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,250
BUT AN UNKNOWN FORCE
APPROACHES WITH DUE HASTE,

88
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,166
SET TO ATTACK US FROM THE REAR.

89
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,416
- ( gasping )

90
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,500
- ( horses approaching )

91
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,833
- Imagawa: OH, DEAR.

92
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,166
- ( gasping )

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,458
- ( laughing )

94
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,958
- ( screaming ) WHY DID YOU
NOT TELL ME THIS SOONER?

95
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,333
- ( men screaming )

96
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,541
- 'KAY, BOYS! YOU READY?
- All: YEAH!

97
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,916
- Date: HERE WE GO!
- NOW! BREAK!

98
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,000
- ( shouting )

99
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,750
- ( screaming )

100
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,083
- ( stammering )
MEN, HURRY,

101
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,458
FORM UP ON ME.
PROTECT YOUR LORD.

102
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,125
JUST SLAY THOSE MEN RIGHT NOW!

103
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,083
- ( men shouting )

104
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,666
- ( grunting )

105
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,208
- OH, DEAR! OH, DEAR! OH, DEAR!

106
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,625
- NO MERCY.

107
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,958
- OH, DEAR.

108
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,500
( gasping )

109
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,791
( stammering )
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

110
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,541
DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO I AM?

111
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,583
- OLD MAN IMAGAWA, RIGHT?
- UH...

112
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,666
- I'M THE BIG BOSS OF OSHU,
DATE MASAMUNE.

113
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,541
SORRY. YOU GOT SOMETHING I NEED.

114
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,958
- ( stammering ) MEN!

115
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,125
PROTECT YOUR LORD. TO ARMS,
I SAY. SLAY THIS MAN.

116
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,541
DO SOMETHING!

117
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,458
- IF YOU'RE THEIR COMMANDER,
FACE ME MAN-TO-MAN.

118
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,750
- ( whimpering )

119
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,375
- Sanada: HOLD!

120
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,208
- ( horses approaching )

121
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,500
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.

122
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,208
- ( gasping )

123
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,250
- MY LORD HAS SET HIS SIGHTS
UPON THE CAPITAL.

124
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,958
SURUGA IS A KEY STEP
ON THAT PATH.

125
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,333
I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO BRING DOWN
IMAGAWA YOSHIMOTO.

126
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,125
- ( scoffing ) YOUR FRIENDS ARE
IN DANGER OF HAVING A HOLE

127
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,333
PUNCHED IN THEIR
FLANK BY HOJO.

128
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,250
SO I COMMEND YOU
FOR COMING AFTER ME.

129
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,250
- TAKEDA WILL NOT WAVER.

130
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,625
HOJO IS A TRIFLE.

131
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,333
- ( laughing ) YOU'RE NOT
PAYING ATTENTION.

132
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,625
EVEN THE TIGER OF KAI'S HEAD
WILL BE MINE EVENTUALLY.

133
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,125
YOU GET IT NOW?

134
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,833
NO MATTER HOW GREAT
THE FOE HE FACES,

135
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,541
MY LORD ACCEPTING DEFEAT
IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY.

136
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,458
EVEN I, THE TIGER'S YOUNG CUB,

137
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,375
HAVE NO INTENTION OF
FALLING ON THIS BATTLEFIELD.

138
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,333
NOT WHILE UNFINISHED BUSINESS
STILL REMAINS.

139
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,958
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

140
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,041
LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

141
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,666
FOR IMAGAWA'S HEAD,
SANADA YUKIMURA.

142
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,125
- I WISH NOTHING MORE.

143
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,750
- KOJURO, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

144
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,333
- SIR! NO INTERFERENCE,
WHATSOEVER.

145
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,625
- ONE-EYED DRAGON,
DATE MASAMUNE,

146
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,625
I FIGHT YOU WITH HONOR!

147
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,666
- WOW, DEJA VU.

148
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,291
- ( both screaming )

149
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,875
- COLOR ME IMPRESSED.

150
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,416
- ( both grunting )

151
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,083
- ( groaning )

152
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,666
- ( grunts )

153
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:47,208
THE TIME, MEN, IS NOW!
LET US TAKEODAWARA CASTLE!

154
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,333
- ( men cheering )

155
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,875
- EVERYONE, FOLLOW ME!

156
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,500
- ( men shouting )

157
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,458
- FOR GLORY!

158
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,291
- ( screaming )

159
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,333
- ( men groaning )

160
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,500
- Hojo: YOU? THE TIGER OF KAI?

161
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,125
I WAS TOLD IT WAS
OSHU'S DATE MASAMUNE

162
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,416
WHO WAS RANGED AGAINST
THE HOJO FAMILY.

163
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,125
- IF YOUR GUARD IS DOWN,

164
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,333
NO ATTACK SHOULD
COME AS A SURPRISE.

165
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,333
REGARDLESS OF BY WHOM.

166
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,166
IN THIS TIME OF CHAOS
AND BLOODSHED,

167
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,166
I HAD HOPED THE TAKEDA
AND THE HOJO

168
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,166
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO FORGE AN ALLIANCE

169
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,916
WHICH COULD BENEFIT
BOTH OF OUR DOMAINS.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,375
- SO INSTEAD, YOU WOULD
ATTACK ME?

171
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,958
THOSE WHO OPPRESS THE ELDERLY
DIE MISERABLE DEATHS.

172
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,500
YOU WILL SHOW ME RESPECT!

173
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,541
- ALAS, I CANNOT.

174
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,083
FOR I DID NOT SEE YOU,
THEIR COMMANDER,

175
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,083
UPON THE FIELD OF BATTLE.

176
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,250
- MANY GOOD MEN
HAVE FALLEN, UJIMASA.

177
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,583
- ( gasping ) FOR THAT,

178
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,833
GENERATIONS OF
HOJO GLORY WILL NOT

179
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,541
BE TARNISHED
BY THE LIKES OF YOU!

180
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,833
I WILL GIVE UP THE CASTLE
OF MY HONORED ANCESTORS,

181
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,458
TO NO ONE!

182
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,625
- YOUR MEN ARE YOUR CASTLE.

183
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,708
THOSE BRAVE WARRIORS
WERE TOO GOOD,

184
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,000
FOR A SELF-SERVING LORD
SUCH AS YOU.

185
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,791
- YOU SPEAK RUBBISH!

186
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,375
- ( grunts )

187
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,625
- ( laughing )

188
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:01,083
NOW, SHINGEN, FACE THE
LEGENDARY NINJA, FUMA KOTARO.

189
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,416
STAND PARALYZED
AS FEAR TAKES ITS GRIP.

190
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,916
BEFORE YOU PERISH
AT THE POWER OF THE HOJO.

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,208
- Takeda: IS THIS THE BEST
YOU HAVE LEFT?

192
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,000
A SILENT MERCENARY.

193
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,500
- ( both grunting )

194
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,541
- OH DEAR. GAMBLING
WITH OUR LIFE

195
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,791
AS THOUGH IT WERE A
MEANS OF ENTERTAINMENT.

196
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,541
THIS IS MORE THAN
OUR HONOR CAN BEAR.

197
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,583
SINCE IT HAS COME TO THIS...

198
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,291
- Date: DEATH FANG,
BLAZING WHEEL!

199
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,166
- ( rumbling )

200
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,333
- ( man gasping )

201
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,375
- I... WE MUST RETREAT.
READY THE DECOYS.

202
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,875
- Takeda: TORIYA!

203
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,916
( grunting )

204
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:22,083
( scoffing ) I HAVE ALREADY
DECIPHERED YOUR EVERY MOVE!

205
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,750
( grunting )

206
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,708
- ( exclaims ) CONFOUND YOU.

207
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,750
( grunting )

208
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,250
I SWEAR, YOU WILL NOT
TAKE ME, SHINGEN.

209
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,541
ON MY HONOR AS A HOJO,
I WILL DEFEAT YOU!

210
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,083
- GOOD, UJIMASA,
A FINE SHOW OF SPIRIT.

211
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,500
- HONORED ANCESTORS,
LEND YOUR STRENGTH TO ME!

212
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,083
- ( howling )

213
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,333
- HE CALLS FORTH THE GHOSTS
OF HIS ANCESTORS?

214
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,166
- ( screaming )

215
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,750
- ( grunting )

216
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,458
- HONORED ANCESTORS!

217
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,250
- THE LIGHT OF BYGONE GLORY.

218
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,458
IS EVER DIMMED BY THE TINGE
OF MELANCHOLY.

219
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,708
THE FAINT DREAMS OF YESTERDAY.

220
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,250
SURELY, WILL LIVE TOMORROW.

221
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,458
SO, YUKIMURA,
HOW FARES YOUR BATTLE?

222
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,291
- THE TIGER OF KAI.

223
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,375
UPON MY LORD'S MIND,
HIS PRESENCE WEIGHS TOO HEAVILY.

224
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,458
- ( explosion )

225
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,291
- ( gasping )

226
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,041
SARUTOBI SASUKE,
EXPLAIN YOURSELF!

227
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,375
- MY, MY, AREN'T YOU
ALL WORKED UP?

228
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,958
I COULD SENSE YOUR BLOOD LUST
FROM EIGHT LEAGUES OUT.

229
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,666
IT'S MY LORD COMMANDER'S HEAD
YOU WANT, YES?

230
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,916
AND I WAGER THE ORDERS
WERE "SCOUTING ONLY".

231
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,875
BUT TO MAKE
AN UNSANCTIONED KILL?

232
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,625
WHAT WOULD YOUR SHINOBI
MASTERS SAY ABOUT THAT?

233
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,250
- WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW, RAT?

234
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,833
- LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IN THIS DAY AND AGE,

235
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,875
NO GOOD EVER COMES OF DOING
MORE THAN YOU'RE PAID TO DO.

236
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,833
- YOU KNOW I CAN NEVER
RETURN TO MY VILLAGE.

237
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,166
- YOU CAN ONLY BLAME YOURSELF
FOR THAT.

238
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,958
UNFORTUNATELY, DARLING,

239
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,208
DATE CAUSED MY LORD SOME DELAY.

240
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,833
- HE'S CURRENTLY IN ODAWARA.
- WHAT?

241
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,333
- AS I RECALL,

242
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,708
A LEGENDARY NINJA RESIDES THERE
IN HOJO'S EMPLOY.

243
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,041
( chuckles ) IT'S A SHAME,

244
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,708
I THINK HE'S ABOUT TO
LOSE HIS LIVELIHOOD.

245
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,875
OH, HEY!

246
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,250
WHY DON'T WE SEND HIM
OVER TO UESUGI?

247
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,708
THEN YOU CAN COME WITH ME
AND WORK FOR TAKEDA.

248
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,458
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

249
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,333
- ENOUGH! YOU MOCK MY PAIN!

250
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,416
- ( rain pattering )

251
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,958
- ( thunder rumbling )
- ( Date sighing )

252
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,750
GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU,

253
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,333
BEST PARTY I'VE
BEEN TO IN FOREVER.

254
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,708
MY LORD,
MY HEART CONCURS,

255
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,791
FOR THE TIGER OF KAI'S YOUNG CUB

256
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,875
HAS NEVER BURNED SO BRIGHTLY
UPON THE FIELD OF BATTLE.

257
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,416
- Katakura: BOSS MASAMUNE!

258
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,375
- ( chuckling )

259
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,500
- Date: SHIT.

260
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,916
- THERE ARE THREE LORD IMAGAWAS?

261
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,125
- ( horses neighing )

262
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,708
- Date: KOJURO!
- ON IT.

263
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,958
- ( urging horse )

264
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,916
- WE'LL LEAVE THE REST
TO YOU, BOYS.

265
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,833
- ( men cheering )

266
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,416
- ( urging horse )

267
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,416
- ( whooshing )
- HUH?

268
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,625
( screaming )

269
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,375
- ( grunting )

270
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,250
- ( arrow whooshing )
- ( Man groaning )

271
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,750
- Katakura: A CHILD?

272
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,625
- DARN IT. I GOT A FAKE ONE.

273
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,208
- "LUCK LIES IN THE LEFTOVERS".
OR SO THEY SAY, MASTER.

274
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,750
- SASUKE!

275
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,791
- I WOULD HAVE TO RECOMMEND
YOU ABANDON THIS PURSUIT, SIR.

276
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,291
THE ODDS ARE TWO-TO-ONE
YOU'LL COME UP WITH A LOSER.

277
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,333
- BUT HE COULD BE THE ONE.

278
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,208
- WE'VE BEEN TOO RECKLESS.

279
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,916
ODA TOOK KITABATAKE WITH EASE.

280
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,916
BUT INSTEAD OF RETURNING
TO OWARI,

281
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,416
HE'S NOW LYING IN WAIT
FOR IMAGAWA.

282
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,833
IF WE KEEP GOING...

283
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,541
- ( gasping )

284
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,083
- ( gasping )

285
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,958
- SORRY, FAKER,
YOU'RE OF NO USE TO ME.

286
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,291
- ( gunshot )

287
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,958
- NOR IS THE REAL ONE,
TO BE HONEST.

288
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,250
- Sanada: YOU! WOMAN!

289
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,208
WHO... UNDER WHOSE BANNER DO YOU
WIELD SUCH WESTERN WEAPONRY?

290
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,375
- CAREFUL YOU DON'T GET BURNED,
LITTLE BOY.

291
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,916
- ( urging horse )

292
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,083
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

293
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,041
- ( laughing )

294
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,500
IT WOULD APPEAR THE RUSE
HAS FOUND ITS END.

295
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,791
THE HEAD OF IMAGAWA IS MINE.

296
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,583
- Imagawa: ( gulping ) OH, DEAR.

297
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,041
- YOU DARE PLAY ME FOR A FOOL?

298
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,333
- ( laughing )

299
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,458
- ( horse neighing )

300
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,291
- ( straining )

301
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,083
- ( explosion )

302
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,583
- ( breathing heavily )

303
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,958
- ( thunder rumbling )

304
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,458
- BOSS MASAMUNE!

305
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,166
THAT'S...

306
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,333
- LOOK. THOSE MUST BE
ODA NOBUNAGA'S FORCES.

307
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,500
- UH, MASTER? SIR?

308
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:56,458
- LORD ODA NOBUNAGA,
SO-CALLED DEVIL KING OF OWARI.

309
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,375
MY NAME IS
SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA.

310
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,833
I AM THE VASSAL OF TAKEDA,
TIGER OF KAI!

311
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,708
- DO ME A FAVOR.

312
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,500
KEEP IT DOWN, WOULD YOU?

313
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,000
HE'S GOT ME PINNED.

314
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,833
WITH HIS DAMN GAZE.

315
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,333
- ( gasping )

316
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,875
- ( thunder rumbling )

317
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,833
