1
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,250
- Date: YOU KNOW, SOMEONE'S
BOUND TO WANT TO THROW

2
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,875
A NEW PARTY SOON ENOUGH.

3
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,666
- YES, MY LORD.
IT CAN'T BE LONG

4
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,541
UNTIL WE LIVE
IN A TIME OF WAR AGAIN.

5
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,583
WE MUST COMPLETE THE REBUILDING
OF OSHU BEFORE THEN.

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,750
- YEAH, LOOKS LIKE WE
WON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO BE BORED.

7
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:42,666
AIN'T NO QUESTION YOU-KNOW-WHO'S
ALL FIRED UP RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,083
- SANADA YUKIMURA,
YOU DEFEATED HIM HANDEDLY

9
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,708
THE LAST TIME YOU FOUGHT.

10
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,166
BUT I THINK IT
ONLY STRENGTHENED HIS RESOLVE.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,208
- PROMISED HIM A REMATCH,

12
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,416
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GOING
TO HOLD ME TO IT.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,541
- THE BOY'S DEFINITELY A PRODUCT
OF TAKEDA'S TRAINING.

14
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,541
AFTER THE BATTLE OF NAGASHINO,

15
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,000
WHEN WE STAYED WITH
THE TIGER OF KAI FOR AWHILE,

16
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,166
I HAD THE DISTINCT PLEASURE
OF SPARRING

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,041
WITH HIS YOUNG PROTEGE
ONCE OR TWICE MYSELF.

18
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,833
- "TAKEDA'S TRAINING," HUH?

19
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,375
TAKEDA'S FUN HOUSE
IS A LOT MORE LIKE IT.

20
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,666
I GOT TO ADMIT THOUGH,
MY FAVORITE PART

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,000
OF THAT WHOLE DAY--
YOU IN THAT MASK.

22
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,750
THAT WAS CLASSIC.

23
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:23,125
YEAH, I WOULD HAVE NEVER GUESSED
YOU LIKED TO PLAY DRESS-UP.

24
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:31,541
- NO, IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT!
I-- THEY MADE ME WEAR IT.

25
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,000
- CALM DOWN,
EVEN THE ONE-EYED DRAGON

26
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,958
GOT SWEPT UP
IN OLD MAN TAKEDA'S ENTHUSIASM.

27
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,166
- Takeda:
YOU BUFFOON!

28
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,041
STARTING NOW,
YOUR TRAINING IS BEGUN.

29
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,875
CRYING CHILDREN
WILL DRY THEIR EYES,

30
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,458
SLEEPING BABIES SHALL AWAKEN
AND TAKE TO THE SKIES!

31
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,916
FOR IT IS TIME
FOR THAT MOST EPIC OF EVENTS--

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,125
THE TAKEDA MAN-STRAVAGANZA!

33
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,375
- TRULY?!

34
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:12,916
HOW LONG HAVE I
DREAMED OF THIS DAY?

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,916
THANK YOU
FOR THIS WONDEROUS BOON

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,416
YOU HAVE GRANTED ME!

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,708
- JEEZ, DON'T BURST
A BLOOD VESSEL, KID.

38
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,791
- A LORD IS BESET
WITH MANY A FOE,

39
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,333
HOW THEY DOG HIS EVERY STEP.

40
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,166
BUT THE TRUE WARRIOR
SHALL OVERCOME.

41
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,458
YUKIMURA, SHOW YOUR LORD
THE FULL MEASURE

42
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,083
OF YOUR MANLY SOUL.

43
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,375
- I WILL!  FOR I, YUKIMURA,

44
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,750
SHALL FULFILL
MY MASTER'S EXPECTATIONS!

45
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,625
AND SUNDER EVERY OBSTACLE!

46
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,500
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

47
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,916
- YUKIMURA!

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,541
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

49
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,583
- YUKIMURA!

50
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,000
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

51
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,666
- BUT LET US NOT FORGET
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON.

52
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,375
YOU, TOO, SHALL TAKE PART
IN THE TAKEDA MAN-STRAVAGANZA!

53
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,916
- ONLY IF YOU CHANGE
THE NAME FIRST.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,750
- Takeda: EXCELLENT, I'LL AWAIT
YOU BOTH AT THE TRAINING HALL.

55
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,500
MAY THE BETTER MAN WIN.
UP, UP, AND AWAY!

56
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,208
- YES, YOUR LORDSHIP.
I HEAR AND OBEY.

57
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,916
AT LONG LAST, I AM TAKING PART
IN THE TAKEDA MAN-STRAVAGANZA!

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,208
MERE WORDS CANNOT CONVEY MY JOY!

59
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,208
- MIND TELLING ME WHAT THE HELL
THIS MAN PARTY'S ALL ABOUT?

60
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,666
- OH, YEAH.
LORD TAKEDA'S GIVEN YOU LEAVE

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,958
TO PARTICIPATE AS WELL.

62
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,958
WHAT A STROKE OF GOOD LUCK.

63
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,708
- WHAT'S SO LUCKY ABOUT IT?

64
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,500
- THE TAKEDA MAN-STRAVAGANZA,
ALSO KNOWN AS

65
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,750
THE TAKEDA CONTEST OF MEN.

66
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,833
SINCE ANCIENT TIMES,
THOSE CHOSEN TO RULE

67
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,625
THE LAND OF KAI HAVE USED IT
AS A CHANCE TO TEST THEIR METTLE

68
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,791
AND BECOME TRUE WARRIORS.
ALMOST NOBODY OVERCOMES

69
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,875
ALL OF THE
GRUELING CHALLENGES WITHIN.

70
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,708
LEGEND HAS IT, THAT THE CONTEST
DEMANDS THE IMPOSSIBLE

71
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,541
OF THOSE WHO DARE TO ENTER IT.
- Date: THAT SO?

72
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,666
- Sanada:
THOSE WHO'VE EMERGED

73
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,333
FROM THE TRAINING GROUNDS
VICTORIOUS,

74
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,750
HAVE ALL GONE ON TO CARVE OUT
A LASTING NAME FOR THEMSELVES

75
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,333
IN KAI'S HISTORY.

76
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,958
MY LORD IS ONE
OF THESE LEGENDARY FEW.

77
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,083
THE TAKEDA MAN-STRAVAGANZA
IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY

78
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,375
FOR A WARRIOR OF KAI
TO PROVE HIMSELF TO THE WORLD!

79
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,791
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO CLIMB THESE STAIRS!

80
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,625
I, SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA,

81
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,208
NEVER DARED HOPE
FOR SUCH A CHANCE.

82
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:23,208
- HUH, SO IN OTHER WORDS--
TO ALL YOU TAKEDA GUYS,

83
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,583
THIS HERE IS THE PARTY
OF A LIFETIME.

84
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,625
- Sarutobi:
WELL MET, WARRIORS.

85
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:47,375
ENTER MY DOMAIN.

86
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,083
EVEN WITH THE MASK,
IT'S OBVIOUSLY ME.

87
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,666
HOW DID I GET ROPED INTO THIS?

88
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,375
- Sanada:
FAMILIAR MOUTH AND CHIN,

89
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,291
GIANT THROWING STAR,

90
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,666
ARTFULLY CAMOUFLAGED
NINJA ATTIRE

91
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,708
THAT ALLOWS ONE TO BLEND
INTO THE WOODS AROUND HIM.

92
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,166
WHO ARE YOU?

93
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,250
- VERY FUNNY.  THAT WAS A JOKE,
RIGHT, MASTER SANADA?

94
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,208
NO, NOT KIDDING.

95
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,833
I AM KNOWN AS TENKO MASK,

96
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:20,833
THE HEAVENLY THOUSAND-YEAR FOX
OF LEGEND!

97
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,166
- YEAH, CAN IT, STARFOX.
YOU'RE THAT NINJA--

98
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,250
- I'VE NEVER MET EITHER OF YOU!

99
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,333
BUT YOU'LL KNOW ME SOON ENOUGH,

100
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,083
AS I PUT YOUR FIGHTING SOULS
TO THE ULTIMATE TEST!

101
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,291
- IT'S JUST AS I'D HOPED.

102
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,041
BEHOLD, MASTER TENKO,
THE MIGHT OF OUR ONSLAUGHT.

103
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,541
- THINK I'M GOING
TO CALL IT A DAY.

104
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,541
I'M ALL MAN-STRAVAGANZA'D OUT.

105
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:47,083
- HOLD ON, IS THERE BAD BLOOD
BETWEEN YOU AND TENKO MASK?

106
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,125
- SON OF A-- YOU'RE NOT
EVEN KIDDING, ARE YOU?

107
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,666
- PLEASE, ONE-EYED DRAGON,
LEAVE HIM BE.

108
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,833
MASTER SANADA IS VERY TRUSTING.

109
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,625
DON'T GO SPOILING THE FUN.

110
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,500
- NO WAY, TENKO MASK
HAS HEARD OF ME?!

111
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,541
- WHAT? UH, YES, I HAVE!

112
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:07,125
BECAUSE I AM VERY GOOD FRIENDS
WITH SARUTOBI SASUKE.

113
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,791
- WHOA, I HAD NO IDEA.

114
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,208
WELL ANY FRIEND OF SASUKE'S
IS A FRIEND OF MINE.

115
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,916
- Date:
HEY, SARUTO--

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,291
TENKO MASK, MY BAD.
THIS GUY OUT HERE

117
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,416
WITH THE SCHNOZZ A BUDDY
OF YOURS OR SOMETHING?

118
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
- HUH?  ARE YOU BLIND?
THAT'S YOUR SECOND-IN-COMMA--

119
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,208
I MEAN, YES!
HE'S WITH ME!

120
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,458
- ANOTHER OPPONENT TO TEST US.

121
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,833
A BLAZING RED TENGU MASK,

122
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,166
AND ODDLY FAMILIAR BLADES
ON YOUR RIGHT HIP,

123
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,958
SUGGESTING A LEFT-HANDED
SWORDSMEN.

124
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,708
- HEY, KOJURO.
THE HELL ARE YOU UP TO?

125
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,750
- LORD MASAMUNE, I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

126
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,833
- YOU AND ME BOTH.
CARE TO EXPLAIN

127
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,166
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE
LOOKING LIKE A DAMN FOOL?

128
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,708
- WE OWE TAKEDA A GREAT DEBT
FOR HIS RECENT KINDNESS.

129
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,250
ON A PERHAPS NOT UNRELATED NOTE,

130
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,750
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
PRACTICING MY SWORDPLAY

131
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,333
WITH AN EXCESS OF FERVOR

132
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,833
AND DESTROYED ONE
OF THE LANTERNS IN HIS GARDEN.

133
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,958
WHEN HE BROUGHT ME THIS MASK,
I COULDN'T SAY NO.

134
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,041
WELL, COULD I?  PLEASE, MY LORD,
ADD NOT TO MY SHAME!

135
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,708
- FINE, WHATEVER.

136
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,375
- IF I HAD TO WAGER A GUESS,

137
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,458
I'D SAY YOU AND LORD MASAMUNE
HAVE MET BEFORE.

138
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,208
- FEAR THE VISAGE OF TEN--

139
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:40,208
TEN... GU... MASK, YEAH.

140
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,041
- WHAT'D YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS, AGAIN?

141
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,791
YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T KILL YOU

142
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,250
TO ANNOUNCE YOURSELF
WITH A LITTLE MORE VERVE.

143
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,458
BELIEVE ME, WHOEVER YOU ARE,

144
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,708
IF YOU CAN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED
TO ANNOUNCE YOURSELF

145
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,208
PROPERLY ON THE BATTLEFIELD,

146
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,625
WHO'S GOING TO WANT TO CROSS
SWORDS WITH YOU?

147
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,125
- AWKWARD, AND KATAKURA
GETS TALKED DOWN TO

148
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,875
BY AN OBLIVIOUS SANADA.

149
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,333
- MANY THANKS
FOR THE SAGE ADVICE.

150
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,875
IF IT'S VIGOR YOU WANT,
YOU'LL HAVE IT.

151
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:14,208
MY NAME IS TENGU MASK,
THE ONE AND ONLY!

152
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,750
SANADA YUKIMURA,
I SHALL BE YOUR UNDOING.

153
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,333
- I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.

154
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,041
I DID NOT MEAN TO OFFEND,
I WOULD BE HONORED TO FIGHT!

155
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,208
- ( sighs )

156
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,833
- Takeda: BEGIN!

157
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,041
- LOOK AT YOU!

158
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,916
IT SEEMS YOUR INJURY
FROM NAGASHINO

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,416
HEALED UP QUITE NICELY.

160
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,000
- LISTEN, THE KID
MADE IT SOUND LIKE

161
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,166
THIS WAS GOING TO BE
SOME EPIC THROWDOWN,

162
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,541
SO WHAT'S UP
WITH ALL THIS BULLSH--

163
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,041
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL,

164
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,625
BUT IT'LL TAKE
TOO LONG TO EXPLAIN.

165
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,125
HE'S SO EXCITED,
SO JUST PLAY ALONG, 'KAY?

166
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,750
- RAGING FLAMES!

167
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,500
YOUR FIGHTING STYLE
IS SIMILAR TO LORD MASAMUNE'S.

168
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,208
YOU ARE NO ORDINARY WARRIOR.

169
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,958
- I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TEST
YOUR METTLE WITH MY OWN BLADE

170
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,000
FOR A LONG TIME NOW
TO SEE IF YOU'RE A WORTHY RIVAL

171
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,583
FOR THE ONE-EYED DRAGON.

172
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,875
SO COME, SANADA.
PROVE YOUR MIGHT TO TENGU MASK.

173
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,625
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

174
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,625
- IT'D BE MY PLEASURE.

175
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,083
- LOOK AT KOJURO,
HE'S HAVING A BALL.

176
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,125
- Sarutobi:
TIME TO CHANGE THINGS UP A BIT.

177
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,875
EVEN ONE AS JADED AS YOU
WILL GET A KICK OUT OF THIS.

178
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,375
- Date:
WHAT THE-- ?

179
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,208
- MY PERFECT SPEAR OF CONQUEST!

180
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,416
SANADA YUKIMURA IS HERE... YEAH?

181
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,291
- LOOKS JUST LIKE HIM.

182
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,833
- AH, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

183
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,916
- SERIOUSLY, NINJA.
THAT'S TOP-NOTCH WORK.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,875
YOU'RE HIS SPITTING IMAGE.

185
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,833
- REALLY?!

186
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,625
WHOA!  TIME OUT!

187
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,750
- YOU DID SO WELL,
I JUST WANT TO KICK YOUR ASS.

188
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:18,750
- DATE, YOU KNOW THAT I'M
NOT REALLY MASTER SANADA, RIGHT?

189
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,708
- CRAZY STORM!

190
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,583
MAGNUM STEP!

191
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,250
PHANTOM DIVE!

192
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,583
- SARUTOBI COULDN'T HAVE PICKED
A WORSE MAN TO IMPERSONATE

193
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,875
IN FRONT OF MY LORD.

194
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,250
- Sanada:
TENGU MASK!

195
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,041
YOU BETTER NOT LET DOWN
YOUR GUARD!

196
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,375
- ( whistles )

197
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,750
LOOKING GOOD THERE, HANDSOME.

198
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,833
- CAN THE SWEET TALK,
ONE-EYED DRAGON.

199
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,291
DON'T HOLD BACK NOW-- I WON'T.

200
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,416
BIG BOSS OF OSHU, DATE MASAMUNE.

201
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,583
OH, YEAH.
FULL SPEED AHEAD!

202
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,833
- NOW WE'RE TALKING.

203
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,458
- Katakura: YOU'RE NOT READY
TO FACE LORD MASAMUNE

204
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,083
IN BATTLE, BOY.

205
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,791
- COME ON, WHAT MAKES
YOU THINK THIS IS OVER?

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,416
- HE'S THROWING A PUNCH?!

207
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,750
- YOU'RE AS SKILLED
AT HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT

208
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,416
AS YOU ARE WITH A BLADE.

209
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,416
THERE'S NO DENYING IT,
YOU BESTED ME.

210
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,958
STRIKING OUT AT ME WITH
YOUR INJURED HAND

211
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,875
WAS BRAVE... AND FOOLISH.

212
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,833
- I ONLY DID IT BECAUSE
I WANTED TO PASS THIS TEST.

213
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:57,250
- I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
I FOUGHT SOMEONE UNARMED.

214
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:03,291
NOT SINCE LORD MASAMUNE HIMSELF
WAS A CHILD, MOST LIKELY.

215
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,541
YOU ARE NOT THE WISEST WARRIOR
I'VE EVER MET,

216
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,500
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBTING
YOUR DETERMINATION.

217
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,541
TAKE IT, YOU DO THEM JUSTICE.

218
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,166
- I'M IN YOUR DEBT, STRANGER.

219
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,875
- ( glass breaking )

220
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,250
- Sanada:
DO MY EYES DECEIVE ME?

221
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,166
IT'S A MOB OF MASAMUNES!

222
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,125
BUT WHICH ONE IS THE REAL ONE?

223
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,458
- THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE
THAT THEY'RE ALL GANGING UP ON.

224
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:33,041
DAMN IT, SARUTOBI.
YOU'RE TAKING THINGS TOO FAR.

225
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,750
- Masamune:
16-TO-1 AIN'T NO KIND OF ODDS.

226
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:40,416
OKAY, YOU FAKE BASTARDS,
I'M THROUGH PLAYING AROUND.

227
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,500
GUESS I'LL TAKE THE WHOLE LOT
OF YOU OUT AT ONCE.

228
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,291
- Sanada:
HE'S DRAWN HIS SIX SWORDS!

229
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,791
THAT TENKO MASK,
HE MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

230
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,000
- Katakura:
LORD MASAMUNE!

231
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,916
I, TENGU MASK, WILL GUARD
YOUR BACK UNTIL MY DYING BREATH!

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,250
- HOLD UP, ARE YOU KOJURO NOW?

233
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:05,083
- MASAMUNE'S RIGHT, WHY WOULD
TENGU MASK TAKE HIS SIDE?

234
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,208
- SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DROP OUT OF CHARACTER.

235
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,166
- THEN WHY'D YOU STILL CALL
YOURSELF TENGU MASK?

236
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,041
- HUH, DID I REALLY?

237
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,708
WAIT, WHY AM I EVEN WORRYING
ABOUT THIS?!

238
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,583
ALL THAT MATTERS IS DEFENDING
MY LORD FROM HIMSELF.

239
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,500
- WELL THEN, GUESS
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

240
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,916
THAT SAID, THE REAL CHALLENGE
IS STILL TO COME.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,625
- HUH?
- WHAT?

242
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,208
- Sarutobi:
ALL DOUBLES, RETURN TO SHADOW.

243
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,250
- Date: I GET IT, THIS IS
ALL STARTING TO MAKE SENSE.

244
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,208
- LORD MASAMUNE?

245
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,291
- LOOKS LIKE OLD MAN TAKEDA
PUNKED US PRETTY GOOD.

246
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,750
BUT I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME,
YOU KNOW, SO WHAT THE HELL.

247
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:49,041
WHY THE LONG FACE, SANADA?
ON YOUR FEET.

248
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,208
IT'S TIME TO FACE
OUR NEXT CHALLENGE.

249
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,875
- YOU'LL HAVE TO GO ON
BY YOURSELF.

250
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,666
THE ONLY REASON I'M IN ONE PIECE

251
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,083
IS BECAUSE TENGU MASK
TOOK PITY ON ME.

252
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,041
MY LORD EXPECTED
GREAT THINGS OF ME HERE,

253
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,833
AND I'VE ALREADY LET HIM DOWN.

254
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,375
- Takeda:
YUKIMURA!

255
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,166
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

256
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,875
- Takeda: CRUSHING YOUR FOE
IS NOT THE ONLY MARK OF VICTORY

257
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,541
IN THE MAN-STRAVAGANZA.

258
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,583
TENGU MASK LAUDED YOU
FOR YOUR DETERMINATION

259
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,875
MERE MOMENTS AGO, DID HE NOT?

260
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,791
- I SUPPOSE SO.

261
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,666
- INDEED, AND WITH THAT HONOR
YOU WIN THE RIGHT

262
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,375
TO ATTEMPT THE FINAL TRIAL
OF THE TAKEDA MAN-STRAVAGANZA!

263
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,875
BEYOND THIS DOOR LIES
THE CHAMBER OF MEN,

264
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,750
A DOMAIN THAT ONLY
THE FIERCEST WARRIORS

265
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,125
ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER.

266
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,416
WITHIN YOU SHALL ENCOUNTER
YOUR FINAL FOE.

267
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,708
NOW, GO! TAKE YOUR PLACE
AMONG THE LEGENDS OF KAI!

268
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,875
- YES, LORD.
I WILL DO AS YOU COMMAND.

269
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,125
AND SO I GO
TO THE CHAMBER OF MEN.

270
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,625
- CRIMINY, TAKEDA'S GOT
AN OVER THE TOP NAME

271
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,541
FOR EVERYTHING, DOESN'T HE?

272
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,333
- MY LORD, YOU DON'T SUPPOSE
THE TIGER OF KAI HIMSELF IS--

273
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,083
- YEAH, BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIND OUT FOR SURE

274
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,041
UNLESS I PLAY ALONG
TO THE BITTER DAMN END.

275
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,541
- ARE YOU SERIOUS, MY LORD?

276
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,208
- I DON'T MIND
DOING HIM A SOLID.

277
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,625
HE'S BEEN GOOD TO US.

278
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,291
THOUGH THE DUDE BEHIND
DOOR NUMBER TWO

279
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,291
IS A TOUGHER HOMBRE THAN YOU
WANT TO GO MESSING WITH.

280
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,250
- AT LEAST TRY TO BE CAREFUL.

281
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,083
- SURE.

282
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,250
KOJURO--
- SIR?

283
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,958
- I KNOW I GAVE YOU CRAP FOR IT,

284
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,500
BUT YOU ROCKED THAT MASK.

285
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,250
- I AM HONORED BY YOUR PRAISE.

286
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,291
- Date:
COME ON, SANADA.  CHOP, CHOP.

287
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,875
- YES, RIGHT AWAY!

288
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,833
MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

289
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,291
- YOU JUST DID.

290
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,791
- WELL, IT'S ABOUT TENGU MASK.

291
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,125
HE LOOKS A LOT LIKE KATAKURA,
DON'T YOU THINK?

292
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,458
- Takeda:
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

293
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,333
I AM NONE OTHER THAN THE MASTER
OF THIS TRAINING HALL,

294
00:15:56,416 --> 00:16:00,250
THE STOKER OF FLAMES WHO
BREATHES LIFE INTO THE INFERNO,

295
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,375
HYOTTOKO MASK!

296
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,125
- WHAT A FINE FIGURE HE STRIKES!

297
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,541
VIGOR RADIATES FROM EVERY FIBER
OF HIS BEING.

298
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,416
HE STANDS AS THOUGH
HEWN FROM ROCK,

299
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,666
BUT I CAN TELL HE MOVES
WITH THE GRACE OF A TIGER.

300
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,125
A TIGER, YES!
IT'S AS THOUGH I'M LOOKING AT--

301
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,458
- IN BATTLE I AM AS RELENTLESS
AS THE DEVOURING FLAMES

302
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,458
TO WHICH I TEND,
CAN YOU TAKE THE HEAT?

303
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,875
- Date: THERE BETTER BE
MORE TO YOU THAN HOT AIR

304
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,416
'CAUSE THIS DRAGON'S
BEEN SHARPENING HIS CLAWS.

305
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,958
- DEFEAT ME OR MEET A FIERY END
WITHIN THIS CAVERN.

306
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,541
SUCCEED OR PERISH,
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

307
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,166
- PERISHING ABLAZE
WOULD SUIT ME WELL.

308
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,458
BUT NOT WHILE I STILL HAVE
SO MUCH TO PROVE

309
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,208
AND A NAME TO MAKE FOR MYSELF.

310
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,458
I WILL DEFEAT YOU,
HYOTTOKO MASK,

311
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,416
AND COMPLETE
THE MAN-STRAVAGANZA!

312
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,125
- AGE BEFORE BEAUTY, KID.

313
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,666
- LORD MASAMUNE,
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

314
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,333
THE AURA HE EXUDES
IS THAT OF NO ORDINARY MAN.

315
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,375
I GET THE FEELING HE'S
AS GREAT A WARRIOR AS MY LORD.

316
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,333
- WOW, WHAT A COINCIDENCE, HUH?

317
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:08,625
- SO YOU ARE TO BE THE KINDLING,
ONE-EYED DRAGON OF OSHU.

318
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,666
- TOUGH TALK, SPARKY.
LET'S DANCE.

319
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,583
YOU BETTER GIVE ME
ONE HELL OF A FIGHT.

320
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,833
- YOUR BRAVADO PLEASES ME.

321
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,291
STRIKE WHEN YOU ARE READY.

322
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,666
- BIG BOSS OF OSHU,
DATE MASAMUNE,

323
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,916
FULL SPEED AHEAD!

324
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,750
- LORD MASAMUNE,
THAT HYOTTOKO MASK--

325
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,541
HE HAS THE STRENGTH OF 20 MEN.

326
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,416
AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH HE
WIELDS THAT MIGHTY AXE OF HIS,

327
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,458
IT REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE,
BUT WHO?

328
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,708
THINK, YUKIMURA, THINK!

329
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,000
- WELL MET, ONE-EYED DRAGON.

330
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,875
THE TALES REGARDING
YOUR SWORDPLAY ALL RING TRUE.

331
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,958
THOUGH YOU'VE LANDED NARY A HIT,
YOUR SPEED AND TECHNIQUE

332
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,583
HAVE CUT ME TO THE QUICK.

333
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,541
THERE IS MORE TO YOU
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

334
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,500
- FEELING'S MUTUAL,
YOU'RE AS HEAVY AS A MOUNTAIN

335
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
BUT YOU'VE GOT THE SPEED
OF A TYPHOON.

336
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,208
AND YOU DEFINITELY
BRING THE HURT

337
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,041
WITH THAT BLAZING AXEWORK.

338
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,250
YOU MAY BE DRESSED ALL IN RED,
BUT YOU AIN'T FLASHY.

339
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,666
YOU'RE AS COOL AS A CUCUMBER.

340
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,666
FOR AN OLD GUY,
YOU'RE A REAL BADASS.

341
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,666
- Sanada: LORD MASAMUNE HAS
DRAWN ALL OF HIS SWORDS AGAIN.

342
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:50,041
- YOU HAVE SPLIT MY MASK
ASUNDER, ONE-EYED DRAGON.

343
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,791
I ADMIT MY DEFEAT.

344
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,208
- NO, CAN IT BE?!

345
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,166
HYOTTOKO MASK'S TRUE FACE IS--

346
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,083
IS THAT OF MY LORD.

347
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,875
MY LORD TAKEDA'S...

348
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,375
LONG-LOST TWIN!

349
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,291
- Takeda:
NO, YOU BUFFOON!

350
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,708
- THAT LEGENDARY PUNCH,
IT WAS JUST LIKE HIS.

351
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,000
- Takeda:
YOU ARE A DOLT, YUKIMURA!

352
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,333
- Sanada:
HE KNOWS MY NAME!

353
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:34,458
THIS FEELING-- AS THOUGH EVERY
BONE IN MY BODY WERE BROKEN,

354
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,000
THAT BOULDER-LIKE FIST
BORING DEEP INTO MY FACE

355
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,500
AND THEN LAUNCHING ME
HEAVENWARD WITH SUCH EASE.

356
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,583
THE IDENTITY OF HYOTTOKO MASK
IS CLEAR NOW-- OF COURSE!

357
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,375
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,
HE IS MY--

358
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,958
- YOU FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT,
MY YOUNG CUB.

359
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,666
- Sanada:
MY LORDSHIP!

360
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,166
- WELL THAT TOOK HIM
LONG ENOUGH.

361
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,291
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
OKAY THEN, I'M OUT.

362
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,750
- LORD MASAMUNE?

363
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,333
- I BELIEVE YOU OWE ME A FIGHT.

364
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,541
- BUT I COULDN'T
POSSIBLY DO THAT.

365
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,958
FOR SOMEONE
AS INEXPERIENCED AS I

366
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,791
TO CROSS BLADES WITH YOU,
THE THOUGHT OF IT--

367
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,375
I WASN'T READY
FOR THE MAN-STRAVAGANZA.

368
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,750
- YUKIMURA.

369
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,000
- YES?

370
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,666
- YOU ARE...

371
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,916
AN UTTER BUFFOON!

372
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,666
YOU ARE A TAKEDA WARRIOR OF KAI.

373
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,458
YOUR OPPONENT
CRAVES SATISFACTION

374
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,333
AND YOU REFUSE TO FACE HIM,
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?!

375
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,791
- FORGIVE ME, MY LORD.

376
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,583
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT
IN ME FIGHTING

377
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,916
WHEN I KNOW THERE'S
NO POSSIBLE WAY I CAN WIN?

378
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,916
- Takeda: BECAUSE THE
ONE-EYED DRAGON BESTED ME.

379
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,166
IF YOU'RE WORTHY OF HIS RIVALRY,
HIS DEEDS ARE NOT BEYOND YOU.

380
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,250
- I WATCHED LORD DATE BATTLE YOU

381
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,208
WITH A FEROCITY I NEVER KNEW
HE POSSESSED.

382
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,750
BUT WHEN I LOOK WITHIN MYSELF,
I DO NOT SEE IT.

383
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,208
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU GIVE UP, THEN?

384
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,166
YUKIMURA, IF YOU LACK THE HEART

385
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,458
TO ARISE AND TAKE UP ARMS
AGAINST ME,

386
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,958
HOW CAN I CALL YOU A MAN?

387
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,875
I CAN'T HELP BUT PITY
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON.

388
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,916
HE TOOK ON A SIMPERING COWARD
AS A RIVAL,

389
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,750
WHO WOULD ACCEPT SUCH A MATCH
BUT A COWARD HIMSELF?

390
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,333
THEY WILL MOCK HIM
FROM SEA TO SEA!

391
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,666
- THEY MAY CALL ME
WHAT THEY WILL,

392
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,166
A COWARD EVEN,
BUT NOT LORD MASAMUNE.

393
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,541
- YOUR FIERCEST RIVAL
IS NOTHING LESS

394
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,125
THAN YOUR GREATEST FRIEND.

395
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,333
ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO SLINK
AWAY HAVING STAINED HIS HONOR?

396
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,375
ARE YOU?!

397
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:51,791
- I'M NOT SLINKING AWAY.

398
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,291
LORD DATE AND I

399
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,625
ARE MEN!

400
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,125
YOUR LORDSHIP!

401
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,083
- NEVER FORGET
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

402
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,583
THAT WAS A PUNCH
WORTHY OF THE MAN-STRAVAGANZA.

403
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,541
- WHY DON'T YOU DODGE MY BLOWS?

404
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,583
- THE WORTH OF A PUNCH
IS FOUND IN TAKING IT.

405
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:21,458
PERSEVERE, MY YOUNG CUB.
YOUR BLOOD AND SWEAT AND TEARS

406
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,291
ARE NEVER SHED IN VAIN,

407
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,416
YOU ARE
A FEARLESS WARRIOR OF KAI,

408
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,083
FOR THIS DAY,
YOU HAVE BECOME A MAN!

409
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,291
- YES, LORD TAKEDA, AND I HIM.

410
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,916
YOUR LORDSHIP!

411
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,916
- YUKIMURA!

412
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,750
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

413
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,041
- YUKIMURA!

414
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,333
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

415
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,791
- Date:
REMEMBER KID,

416
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,833
YOU AND ME STILL GOT
SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

417
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,083
DON'T GO LOSING
TO ANYONE UNTIL THEN.

418
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,458
- ALRIGHT, BUT YOU
HAD BETTER NOT LOSE EITHER.

419
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,583
LORD MASAMUNE,
TO HAVE FOUND A RIVAL

420
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,500
THE LIKES OF YOU
DURING MY LIFETIME,

421
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,666
I FEEL VERY LUCKY INDEED.

422
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,250
- HEY, HEY.

423
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,458
IF YOU GO POURING
YOUR HEART OUT TO ME NOW,

424
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,541
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE
ANYTHING LEFT TO SAY

425
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,333
WHEN I BEAT YOU.

426
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,208
- TOO BAD.

427
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,583
GUESS YOU'LL NEVER HEAR IT
'CAUSE I'M GOING TO WIN.

428
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,708
- ATTA BOY.

429
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,875
- YEAH, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU
WEREN'T THE HAND-SHAKING TYPE.

430
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,666
- PLUS WE'VE ADDED QUITE A
SPIRITED BUNCH TO OUR ROSTER.

431
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,583
THEY SEEM PRETTY IMPATIENT
TO RAISE A WAR CRY.

432
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,458
- EXCELLENT, WE'LL HAVE
TO LET THEM SEE THE COUNTRY

433
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,208
UNDER THE DRAGON'S RULE.
- SIR.

434
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:19,041
- AND ALONG THE WAY, I'LL BE
ENTRUSTING MY BACK TO YOU.

435
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,416
AS ALWAYS, KOJURO.

436
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,000
YOU READY FOR IT?
- YOU NEED NOT EVEN ASK.

437
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,875
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.

438
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
ARE YOU BOYS READY?

439
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,541
- YOUR THOUGHTS WERE
UPON HIM AGAIN,

440
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,250
WEREN'T THEY, YUKIMURA?

441
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:40,875
- THEY WERE, I FELT AS THOUGH
I JUST HEARD HIS VOICE.

442
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:44,500
- THAT FIRE IN YOUR VEINS
BURNS WITHIN HIS AS WELL.

443
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,500
AN OATH BETWEEN RIVALS,
BETWEEN FRIENDS,

444
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,666
CAN UNITE TWO PEOPLE
WHETHER NEAR OR FAR.

445
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,541
- YES, I FEEL IT, YOUR LORDSHIP.
PLAIN AS DAY.

446
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,625
OUR FATES ARE ONE,
NOW AND FOREVER.

447
00:24:56,708 --> 00:25:00,125
- YES, YOUR MEETING HIM
WAS DESTINY.

448
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:04,083
- IT'S ALL COMNIG DOWN TO ONE
LAST RUMBLE, SANADA YUKIMURA.

449
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:07,208
AND YOU AND ME ARE THE ONLY ONES
GETTING INVITES!

450
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:11,125
- LORD MASAMUNE, WE SWORE AN
OATH TO ONE ANOTHER AS EQUALS.

451
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:14,083
AND I SWEAR I WILL UPHOLD IT!

452
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:17,750
- WE'LL MEET AGAIN.
- SOMEWHERE, SOME DAY.

453
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:21,791
- ( both ) IN THE BATTLE THAT
DECIDES THE FATE OF THE WORLD!

454
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:24,666
- ( theme music plays )
