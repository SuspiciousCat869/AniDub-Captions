TOOK ON THE FORCES
OF IEYASU TOKUGAWA.

3
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,291
TO THEIR WEST,

4
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,916
AS DATE'S ARMY ATTEMPTED TO
SWEEP THROUGH SHITARAGAHARA,

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,416
THEY WERE BLOCKED
BY THE AZAI ARMY OF OMI.

6
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,125
- ( Date whistling )

00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,666
YOU GOT SOME KINDA NERVE. )

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,500
- I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER!

IEYASU'S DEFECTION,

ODA SOUGHT TO WIPE HIM OUT,
RESULTING IN GRAVE LOSSES

11
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,166
FOR THE TAKEDA
AND UESUGI, AS WELL.

12
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,875
MEANWHILE, SERIOUSLY INJURED
BY THE ARQUEBUS CORPS

13
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:06,208
LED BY AKECHI MITSUHIDE,
DATE MASAMUNE WAS FORCED

14
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,458
TO SEEK REFUGE AT TAKEDA'S
HOME IN KAI, TO RECUPERATE.

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,875
- ( theme music playing )

16
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,916
- PARDON ME.
LORD KENSHIN?

17
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,791
- WHAT IS IT?

18
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:16,416
- UH, MY LORD,
MUST WE LEAVE KAI SO SOON?

19
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,666
- WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LEAVE
ECHIGO UNTENDED FOR LONG.

20
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,833
OUR INJURED HERE
ARE IN GOOD HANDS.

21
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,500
- BUT DO YOU NOT...

22
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,333
ARE YOU SURE YOU WISH
TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW?

23
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,583
WITHOUT AT LEAST SPEAKING
WITH LORD TAKEDA?

24
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,541
YOU HOLD THE TIGER OF KAI
IN SUCH ESTEEM.

25
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,666
AND YET YOU...

26
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,958
- RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE MUST DO,

27
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,041
IS MOURN THOSE WE HAVE LOST,

28
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,458
STRENGTHEN THE DEFENSE
OF ECHIGO,

29
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,583
AND PREPARE FOR OUR IMPENDING
FINAL BATTLE AGAINST ODA.

30
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,750
THE TIGER OF KAI AND I
WILL FACE ONE ANOTHER.

31
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,375
WITH THE FREEDOM TO SAY
WHAT WE MUST.

32
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,458
HOWEVER THAT TIME
CAN ONLY COME

33
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:59,041
ONCE THIS WORLD IS RID OF
THE DEVIL KING'S MENACE.

34
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,166
- SIR.

35
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,875
LORD KENSHIN!

36
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,416
- MY MOST BEAUTIFUL BLADE,

37
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,583
YOUR PERFORMANCE AT NAGASHINO
WAS FLAWLESS.

38
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,875
- I AM NOT WORTHY OF SUCH WORDS.

39
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,333
- I DO HOPE YOU WILL DANCE
BY MY SIDE FOR YEARS TO COME.

40
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,083
- ( groaning )

41
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,750
- GREAT, YOU AGAIN.

42
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,458
- I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU SURVIVED.

43
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,166
YOU WERE RIGHT IN THE THICK
OF IT, AND NOT A SCRATCH ON YOU.

44
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,333
IMPRESSIVE!

45
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,916
- JUST WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?

46
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,875
- LET ME THINK.

47
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,208
YOU WERE GIVEN ORDERS TO
SNEAK INTO A WARRIOR'S ESTATE

48
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,458
AND ASSASSINATE HIM.

49
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,041
BUT INSTEAD, YOU FELL IN
LOVE WITH YOUR TARGET,

50
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,208
DECIDED TO GO ROGUE,

51
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,625
AND SETTLED THERE
FOR GOOD. THAT RIGHT?

52
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,583
- ( grunting ) FINE.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

53
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,291
- WELL, ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

54
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,458
BEFORE YOU RETURN HOME,

55
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,208
I THOUGHT YOU
AND ME, TWO NINJA...

56
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,916
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
MOONLIGHT TRYST?

57
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,500
- GOODBYE.

58
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,833
- NO, WAIT!
I WAS JUST KIDDING!

59
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,875
COME ON, WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
HOW LONG?

60
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,000
YOU COULD AT LEAST
HUMOR ME ONCE IN A WHILE.

61
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,750
I CAME TO YOU
TO DELIVER A WARNING.

62
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,541
- A WARNING?

63
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,125
- WELL, YEAH, MORE OF A
MESSAGE REALLY, FROM MY LORD.

64
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,541
HE SAYS, "DO NOT STRAY
FROM THE WAR GOD'S SIDE."

65
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,708
- I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD...

66
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,666
- NOT EVEN FOR A MOMENT,
HE MEANS.

67
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,208
EVEN IF YOU'RE
ORDERED TO GO SCOUT,

68
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,500
HE SAID, "DON'T." STAY
WITH YOUR LORD.

69
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,750
- HOW DARE YOU?

70
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,291
I AM LORD KENSHIN'S SERVANT,
I WILL GO WHEREVER HE...

71
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,916
- CALM DOWN.
LOOK, MY LORD HAS MASTER SANADA.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,208
OSHU'S ONE-EYED DRAGON
HAS HIS RIGHT EYE, KATAKURA.

73
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,250
BUT THE WAR GOD,
ALL HE HAS IS YOU.

74
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,625
NOW THAT ODA KNOWS
WE STAND AGAINST HIM,

75
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,666
THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK
HE'LL WAIT FOR OUR NEXT MOVE.

76
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,000
- MY LORD WILL NOT BE KILLED
SO EASILY.

77
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,583
EVEN IF SOMEONE WERE TO
TRY SNEAKING UP BEHIND HIM

78
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,583
IN THE NIGHT, WHEN FACED
WITH HIS PRESENCE...

79
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,583
- NOT EVERYONE THEY SEND
IS GOING TO BE LIKE YOU.

80
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,666
- AND WHY SHOULD I TAKE ORDERS
FROM THE TIGER OF KAI?

81
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,208
- WHAT? WELL, UH,
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS,

82
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,291
BUT MY LORD MUST THINK
PRETTY HIGHLY OF YOU.

83
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,666
- THAT IS A
GREAT HONOR, YOU KNOW.

84
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,333
- ( grunts )

85
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,458
- OH.

86
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,166
THAT'S NOT IT!
- WHAT?

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,083
- I JUST REMEMBERED,
HE THINKS YOU'RE MY BETROTHED,

88
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,125
SO I GUESS HE JUST MUST
BE TRYING TO KEEP...

89
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,375
YOU SAFE.

90
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,750
- MAKE HIM THINK OTHERWISE!

91
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,458
- ANYWAY, MY MEN AND I,

92
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,875
WE'LL SPY ON ODA'S
MOVEMENTS AND REPORT BACK.

93
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,083
- ( distant explosion )

94
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,166
- WHAT THE...?

95
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,208
- THAT LOOKS LIKE THE
WESTERN BORDER.

96
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,166
- I GOT THIS.

97
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,791
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
MASTER TO PROTECT.

98
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,500
CAN'T BE ODA ALREADY.
TOO SOON.

99
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,125
SCOUTS GETTING INTO IT, MAYBE?

100
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,250
- ( Katakura grunting )

101
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,833
LORD MASAMUNE.

102
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,333
- ( Date grunting )

103
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,458
- I AM YOUR RIGHT EYE.

104
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,333
YET I WAS ABLE NEITHER
TO STOP YOU, NOR PROTECT YOU.

105
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,875
FOR I HOLD YOUR WISHES
TO BE OF THE GREATEST IMPORT.

106
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,125
( Katakura grunting )

107
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,416
PERHAPS THAT IS NOT
THE WISEST COURSE.

108
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,416
PERHAPS I ONLY HASTEN YOU
TO AN EARLY GRAVE.

109
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,208
( Katakura grunting )

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,916
- MASTER KATAKURA.

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,250
- A FEW MOMENTS AGO,

112
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,958
I THOUGHT I HEARD A STRANGE
NOISE FROM THE WEST.

113
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,208
- AS DID I.
MEMBERS OF MY NINJA CORPS

114
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,333
SHOULD BE HEADING THERE
TO INVESTIGATE BY NOW.

115
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,750
- I SEE.

116
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,791
- YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHIES.

117
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,458
IF IT HAD BEEN MY LORD WHO
HAD SUFFERED THE SAME

118
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,708
BEFORE MY EYES...

119
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,375
THERE WERE COUNTLESS FIREARMS
ON THAT BATTLEFIELD.

120
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,166
YOU CANNOT HOLD YOURSELF
AT FAULT FOR LORD DATE'S INJURY.

121
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,708
IN FACT, CONSIDERING ODA'S
ARQUEBUS CORPS

122
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,250
WAS SUPPOSED TO
REINFORCE TOKUGAWA,

123
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,875
I COULD EASILY MAKE THE
ARGUMENT THAT LORD MASAMUNE

124
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,583
TOOK THAT GUNFIRE IN OUR PLACE.

125
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,583
- ONE CHANGE OF HEART BY THE
ENEMY AND SUCH THINGS HAPPEN.

126
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,458
IT IS THE WAY OF WAR.
HOWEVER...

127
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,583
THAT AKECHI BASTARD.

128
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:53,000
TO HIM, IT WAS AS THOUGH
WAR WAS A GAME.

129
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,208
EVEN IF THE PLAN IS
TO EVENTUALLY CRUSH

130
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,500
EVERYONE AROUND THEM,

131
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,041
TO KILL AZAI AND BETRAY TOKUGAWA
AT THIS STAGE.

132
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,208
I JUST CANNOT IMAGINE

133
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,666
THAT THAT WAS HIS BEST
COURSE OF ACTION.

134
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,333
- YOU HAVE A POINT.

135
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,125
- PROBLEM IS, THOUGH THE
DEVIL KING NURTURED HIM,

136
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,041
AKECHI CLEARLY HAS NO LOYALTIES.

137
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,250
- AKECHI MITSUHIDE.

138
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,041
- MASTER SANADA!
- SASUKE, WHO IS THAT?

139
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,166
- Katakura: BUNSHICHI!

140
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,291
- MASTER KATA...KURA.

141
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,958
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, MAN?

142
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,958
- I'M SORRY, SIR.
YOSHINAO AND THE OTHERS...

143
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,458
- Takeda guard:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

144
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,708
YOU'LL TAKE OVER
GUARD DUTY FOR US?

145
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,000
- Yoshinao: WE JUST WANT
TO THANK YOU GUYS

146
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,000
FOR PUTTING US UP.

147
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,791
- Samanosuke: YEAH, LOOSEN UP.

148
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,250
- Bunshichi: WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE OURSELVES

149
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,500
USEFUL SOMEHOW.

150
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,166
- AND TO SWEETEN THE DEAL,
WE BROUGHT SNACKS.

151
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,166
RICE BALLS WITH REAL OSHU RICE.

152
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,583
- BUT IT IS OUR SWORN DUTY
TO REMAIN AT OUR POST.

153
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,083
- JUST LET US HELP YOU!

154
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,500
- BEFORE WE MAKE YOU.

155
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,500
- ( Takeda guards quivering )

156
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,541
- ( man screaming )

157
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,541
- Bunshichi: UH, DID YOU GUYS
HEAR SOMETHING?

158
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,458
- Yoshinao: IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A WILD DOG IN HEAT.

159
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,791
- ( man screaming loudly )

160
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,000
- ( all gasp )

161
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,375
- Sarutobi:
BY THE TIME I ARRIVED,

162
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,500
ALL I FOUND WAS THIS GUY
LYING THERE ALONE.

163
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,125
- WHAT OF THE OTHERS?

164
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,458
- IT WOULD SEEM THEY WERE TAKEN.
I FOUND THIS THERE TOO.

165
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,833
- ( gasping ) MASTER KATAKURA!

166
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,833
IT SAYS, IN EXCHANGE
FOR THE MEN THEY CAPTURED,

167
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,500
WE ARE TO HAND OVER TAKEDA'S
ARMOR THAT NEEDS NO SHIELD,

168
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,208
AS WELL AS DATE'S SIX DRAGON
SWORDS BY TOMORROW MORNING.

169
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,875
BUT I CANNOT READ
THE CALLIGRAPHY.

170
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,916
- MATSUNAGA DANJO HISAHIDE.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,083
- THIS MATSUNAGA GUY,

172
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,541
HE'S KNOWN AS THE VILLAIN
OF THE WARRING STATES,

173
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,166
BUT HE HASN'T BEEN
DOING ANYTHING.

174
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,875
IT'S SAID HE'S BEEN
LIVING AS A HERMIT,

175
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,750
SPENDING TIME
COLLECTING ANTIQUES.

176
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,458
- SANADA, WHAT IS THIS
"ARMOR THAT NEEDS NO SHIELD"?

177
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,500
- IT IS A TAKEDA FAMILY
HEIRLOOM.

178
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,291
WHEN MY LORD PREPARES
TO EMBARK ON A GREAT VENTURE,

179
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,583
HE GATHERS HIS CHIEF VASSALS
BEFORE THIS ARMOR

180
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,041
AND THE ANCIENT
BANNER TO DETERMINE

181
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,458
THE CLAN'S COLLECTIVE WILL.

182
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,916
OATHS SWORN ON SUCH
OCCASIONS ARE NEVER BROKEN.

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,333
THE ARMOR THAT NEEDS NO SHIELD

184
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,583
IS A SYMBOL OF THE
TAKEDA'S UNWAVERING WILL.

185
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,708
IT IS LITERALLY A TREASURE.

186
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,083
IT IS SAID THAT NO WEAPON,

187
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,083
NO MATTER HOW SHARP
OR FORCEFUL, CAN PIERCE IT.

188
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,416
AND IN TURN, WHEN SOMEONE
HAS SUFFERED A GRAVE INJURY,

189
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,916
IT IS SAID TO LAY THEIR BED
IN THE ARMOR'S PRESENCE,

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,791
WHICH IS WHY LORD DATE
RESTS THERE NOW.

191
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,333
- SO IT'S THAT ARMOR.
WHAT'S MATSUNAGA'S GAME?

192
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,083
HE WANTS DATE'S
SWORDS AND TAKEDA'S ARMOR.

193
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,208
WHAT, SO HE CAN DECORATE
THE WALLS OF HIS HERMIT CAVE?

194
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,541
- I SHALL GO NOTIFY MY LORD
RIGHT AWAY.

195
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,916
- THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,958
- WHY NOT?

197
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,166
- THIS WAS A FAILURE
ON OUR PART.

198
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,875
WE CANNOT MAKE ANY MORE TROUBLE
FOR THE TAKEDA CLAN.

199
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,208
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
WE TELL THE TIGER OF KAI.

200
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,250
I CANNOT ASK HIM TO GIVE UP
HIS GREATEST FAMILY TREASURE.

201
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,750
- MASTER KATAKURA.

202
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,500
- BOSS MASAMUNE IS NOT TO
HEAR A WORD OF THIS.

203
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,000
THOSE MEN WERE SHOT DOWN
AT NAGASHINO.

204
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,458
THEY DIED. GOT IT?

205
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,583
- BUT, SIR.
MASTER KATAKURA!

206
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,083
- MASTER,
IT'S THE CORRECT DECISION.

207
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,083
- YOU JUST GONNA
IGNORE IT, KOJURO?

208
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,250
LET HIM TREAT US LIKE CHUMPS?

209
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,541
- BIG BOSS!
LORD DATE!

210
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,041
- HEY THERE, YUKIMURA,
WHERE YOU KEEPING MY HORSE?

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,416
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIR?

212
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,791
- NO BIG WHOOP.

213
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,041
SOUNDS LIKE YOUR BASIC
HOSTAGE RECOVERY

214
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,791
SITUATION, RIGHT?

215
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,916
I GOT THAT, NO SWEAT.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,375
SO, WHERE IS THIS
MATSUNAGA BASTARD?

217
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,500
- YOU MUSTN'T!

218
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,416
- NO MAN LEFT BEHIND,
THAT'S THE DATE WAY.

219
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,958
GOT IT?

220
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,083
- I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO LEAVE HERE.

221
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,333
- MASTER KATAKURA, NO...

222
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,875
- KOJURO, YOU REALLY GOING TO
TURN YOUR SWORD ON ME?

223
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,625
- YOUR RETAINERS ARE VALUABLE.

224
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,833
BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS
YOUR OWN PERSON, MY LORD.

225
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,583
- THEN DO THIS WITH ME. WATCH MY
BACK LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

226
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,833
- KATAKURA, WAIT!

227
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,458
- YOU MUST BE ALLOWED
TO FEAR NOTHING,

228
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,750
TO PROCEED FORWARD AT ALL TIMES,
AND AT ANY COST.

229
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,416
SO I DO WATCH YOUR BACK,
I SEE WHAT YOU CANNOT.

230
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,958
YOU KNOW I SWORE THIS TO YOU.

231
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,583
BUT I WILL NOT ALLOW
YOU TO LEAVE HERE

232
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,375
IN YOUR CURRENT STATE!

233
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,333
I SWEAR IT ON MY LIFE!

234
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,375
- WELL, YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

235
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,000
I WON'T HOLD BACK,
KOJURO.

236
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,000
- ( Date shouting )

237
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,750
- (men grunting )

238
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:22,000
- LOOK AT KATAKURA. HE ONLY
ATTACKS DATE'S RIGHT SIDE.

239
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,583
- HIS EVERY MOVEMENT IS SO
PRECISE. I LIKE THIS GUY.

240
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,458
- DAMN IT.
THAT'S LOW.

241
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,625
- ( stuttering ) BOSS!

242
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,958
BIG BOSS. BIG BOSS!

243
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,625
MASTER KATAKURA,
THAT WASN'T FAIR!

244
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,958
BOSS DATE IS BADLY INJURED.

245
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,000
SO WHY?
WHY?

246
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,625
- YES, LORD MASAMUNE,
I UNDERSTAND,

247
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,666
WITHOUT FAIL, SIR.

248
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,500
I WILL SAFELY RECOVER
YOUR MISSING RETAINERS.

249
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,625
- MASTER KATAKURA.

250
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,083
- BUT I NEED TO BORROW THESE
TO DO IT.

251
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,416
- SO IN THE END,
HE'S STILL GOING BY HIMSELF.

252
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,208
- MATSUNAGA, HERE I COME!

253
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,583
- ( chuckling )

254
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,500
- THERE GOES ANOTHER ONE.

255
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,625
LEAVE IT BE
AND THE WORLD CRUMBLES,

256
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:39,208
LIKE A CORPSE LEFT TO ROT
IN ITS TEMPORARY CRYPT.

257
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,041
THE FIRE EVENTUALLY DIES,

258
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,750
AND THE BURNT WOOD
IS NEVER RESTORED.

259
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,166
THE WAY THE WORLD IS BUILT
IS MYSTIFYING.

260
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,166
ALL THINGS ARE FRAGILE,
INCLUDING MAN.

261
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,833
THE MORE I THINK ON IT,

262
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,458
THE MORE I AM INCLINED
TO APPRECIATE IT.

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,041
- I UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS
OF THE MATTER. SO, YUKIMURA.

264
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,375
- SIR.

265
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,125
- WHAT IS THIS QUESTION
YOU WISH TO ASK OF ME?

266
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,083
- YES, SIR, YOUR LORDSHIP.
I WOULD ASK...

267
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,500
I HUMBLY REQUEST...

268
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,250
- COME ON, MASTER SANADA,
JUST ASK HIM ALREADY.

269
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,458
- THEN I SHALL ASK
YOU A QUESTION.

270
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,375
WHY DID YOU ALLOW THE DRAGON'S
RIGHT EYE TO GO ALONE?

271
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,750
- SIR, ALONG WITH
LORD DATE'S SWORDS,

272
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,458
MATSUNAGA WANTS THE ARMOR
THAT NEEDS NO SHIELD,

273
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,916
THE TREASURE OF
THE TAKEDA FAMILY

274
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,416
WHICH MUST NEVER
LEAVE ITS PLACE HERE.

275
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,250
TO SIMPLY HAND IT OVER AS
RANSOM TO SOMEONE BASE ENOUGH

276
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,500
TO TAKE HOSTAGES, IT'S OUT
OF THE QUESTION!

277
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,416
AND, ALSO, MASTER KATAKURA
EXPRESSED TO ME HIS DESIRE

278
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,500
TO AVOID INCURRING
FURTHER DEBT TO THE TAKEDA CLAN.

279
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,125
I WANTED TO...
RESPECT HIS WISHES

280
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,666
FURTHERMORE, WITH THE FATE
OF THE ENTIRE LAND IN JEOPARDY,

281
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,958
THERE IS NO TELLING
WHEN THE DEVIL KING'S

282
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,916
MINIONS MAY SNEAK INTO KAI.

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,708
QUITE POSSIBLY TO MAKE
AN ATTEMPT ON YOUR LIFE,

284
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,041
YOUR LORDSHIP.

285
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,166
SO, FOR ME TO LEAVE KAI
AT THIS POINT IN TIME

286
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,666
WOULD BE...

287
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,916
- YOU... COLOSSAL BUFFOON!

288
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,791
- ( Sanada grunting )

289
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,125
- YUKIMURA, YOU ARE SHOWING
YOUR YOUTH.

290
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,375
WHY HAVE YOU NOT ASKED ME
TO GIVE YOU THE ARMOR?

291
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,166
NO, NOT EVEN THAT.

292
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,916
WHY DID YOU NOT
JUST TAKE THE ARMOR,

293
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,541
WITHOUT EVEN A WORD TO ME,

294
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,208
AND GO OFF TO SAVE
THOSE MEN WITH KATAKURA?

295
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,416
- YOUR LORDSHIP.

296
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,666
- MATSUNAGA'S DEMANDS
DID NOT STOP AT

297
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,791
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON'S SWORDS.

298
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,000
IF HE DOES NOT GET
BOTH THE SWORDS AND

299
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,666
THE ARMOR THAT NEEDS NO SHIELD,

300
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,791
THIS VILLAIN OF THE WARRING
STATES WILL NEVER MAKE THE DEAL.

301
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,208
THAT MUCH IS CERTAIN.

302
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,958
REGARDING DATE,

303
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,708
IN TIME, WE MAY HAVE TO
FIGHT THEM FOR SUPREMACY.

304
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,333
BUT, RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE GUESTS
UNDER THE PROTECTION OF TAKEDA.

305
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,625
TO HAVE OTHERS IN YOUR
CARE IS NOT JUST ABOUT

306
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,666
SHARING FOOD AND LODGINGS.

307
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,625
- ( grunting ) YOUR LORDSHIP!

308
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,291
I UNDERSTAND NOW.

309
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,208
THE WAY LORD DATE AND MASTER
KATAKURA MUST BE FEELING,

310
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,416
IT WOULD BE AS THOUGH,
OUR OWN SASUKE HAD BEEN TAKEN.

311

IT WOULD BE
ABSOLUTELY UNFORGIVABLE!

315
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,708
I SAW SOMETHING OF YOU EARLIER
IN MASTER KATAKURA'S VISAGE.

316
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,916
THE PASSION, THE HEART YOU BRING
TO ALL OF YOUR DEALINGS WITH ME.

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,583
I FELT AS THOUGH

WITHOUT FAIL!

324
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,458

- NO CHOICE, THEN.

333
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,416
- LOSE ONE MAN
AND ANOTHER JOINS.

334
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,583

AND TWO MORE JOIN.

THE MIYOSHI THREE!

338
