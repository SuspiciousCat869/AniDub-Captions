1
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,708
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,291
- Keiji: COMING THROUGH, FOLKS!

3
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,916
( grunts )

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,208
- KEIJI.

5
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,500
- ( squeaks )

6
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,208
- Keiji: SORRY!
- KEI IS BACK!

7
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,041
- Man 1: KEIJI'S HERE!
- Man 2: BIG BROTHER KEIJI!

8
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,250
- Woman: IT'S KEI!

9
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,458
- ( gasps )

10
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,791
- Matsu: HOLD IT
RIGHT THERE, KEIJI!

11
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,875
- UP TO HIS USUAL
ANTICS AGAIN?

12
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,125
- ( laughing )
HE NEVER LEARNS, DOES HE?

13
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,125
- WELL, LADY MATSU
LOOKS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER.

14
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,000
- KEI DOESN'T EVEN HOLD
A CANDLE TO LADY MAEDA.

15
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,708
- ( all laughing )

16
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,041
- MATSU, SIS, PUT THAT THING
AWAY BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.

17
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,208
COME ADMIRE THE CHERRY
BLOSSOMS WITH ME.

18
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,875
THEY WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER.

19
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,416
( grunts )

20
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,916
- OH, COME NOW.
HOW MUCH TIME...

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,708
MUST YOU WASTE...
LOOKING AT FLOWERS...

22
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,916
UNTIL YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH?

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,458
- ( groans )

24
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,500
AH NUTS, WHAT A WASTE.

25
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,875
- I HOPED YOUR LONG ABSENCE

26
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,833
WOULD BRING YOU SOME
MATURITY, BUT NO.

27
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,916
LIFE IS STILL A GAME FOR YOU.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,208
EVEN NOW, DRAWING A COLD BATH
FOR MY LORD HUSBAND!

29
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,250
YOUR RIDICULOUS BEHAVIOR
GOES TOO FAR, KEIJI!

30
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,416
- ( laughing ) HE'LL BE FINE.

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,000
TOSHI ALWAYS RUNS AROUND
HALF-NAKED ANYWAY,

32
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,000
RIGHT, YUMEKICHI?

33
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,625
- ( squeaks )

34
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,125
- STOP WITH THE FOOLING AROUND

35
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,083
AND DO SOMETHING THAT
HONORS THE MAEDA FAMILY NAME!

36
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,708
- Keiji: YEAH, OKAY! OW!

37
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,541
YOU KNOW I'M NOT ANY GOOD
AT THAT SORT OF THING.

38
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:31,250
- I HATE FEELING TIED DOWN.
- ARE YOU STILL USING THAT LINE?

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,958
- TOSHI'S BEING
GIVEN DOMAIN OVER

40
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,041
THE LAND OF KAGA SOON, RIGHT?
IT'S NOT LIKE HE REALLY HAS

41
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,458
THE TIME TO DEAL WITH
THE TROUBLES I'D CAUSE HIM HERE.

42
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,750
- IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
DON'T CAUSE HIM TROUBLE.

43
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,750
HELP GUIDE
MY LORD INUCHIYO WITH...

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,916
( sighs ) MEN.
GO FORTH, JIROMARU!

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
- ( grunting )

46
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,375
- TAKE WING, TAROMARU!

47
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,250
- ( screeching )

48
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,416
- HE IS SO SKILLED. IF THE JERK
WOULD ONLY APPLY HIMSELF,

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,458
HE WOULD BE SUCH AN ASSET.

50
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,666
- MATSU. SIS!
- YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

51
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,541
- ( Toshiie sneezing )

52
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,375
- DESTROY, GOROMARU!
- NO, MATSU!

53
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,708
( sneezing )

54
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,750
MATSU, DON'T DO IT!

55
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,625
- MATSU, SIS...

56
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,875
- PLEASE, MY LORD INUCHIYO.
STAY OUT OF THIS.

57
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,666
- ( growling )

58
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,041
- ( gasps )

59
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,041
- ( screaming )

60
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,458
- MY LORD, NO!
- NOT GOOD.

61
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,250
- ( screaming )

62
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,583
- ( loud thud )

63
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,416
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME. MY LORD
INUCHIYO, PLEASE BE ALL RIGHT.

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,458
- I SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN
TO COME UNARMED. MY MISTAKE.

65
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,416
- LOOKS LIKE TOSHI'S
GOING TO MAKE IT.

66
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,416
THAT'S MY CUE. SO LONG, MATSU!

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,250
- KEIJI, STOP THIS INSTANT!

68
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,208
- ( sneezing )

69
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,708
- MY LORD INUCHIYO.

70
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,625
- DO ME A FAVOR, PLEASE.
JUST LET HIM GO.

71
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,291
FOR NOW LET HIM DO AS HE...

72
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,333
( sneezes )

73
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,958
- MY LORD, THAT COLD BATH
HAS DONE YOU IN.

74
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,375
ALLOW YOUR LOVING WIFE
TO MAKE A NICE WARM

75
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,291
RICE PORRIDGE FOR YOU.

76
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,166
- NO.

77
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,708
HERE IN THE WARMTH OF YOUR ARMS,
IT'S MORE THAN REMEDY ENOUGH.

78
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,666
SEE? MY SHIVER IS ALREADY GONE.

79
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,166
- MY LORD INUCHIYO.

80
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,375
- YOU ARE THE BEST COOK
IN THE WORLD, THOUGH.

81
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,333
I NEVER TURN DOWN YOUR YAM SOUP.

82
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:38,333
I EAT ONE BOWL, AND WHAM! THE
STRENGTH OF A THOUSAND MEN!

83
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:43,125
- OH, MY BELOVED HUSBAND.
YOU SPOIL ME SO.

84
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,666
- ( both laughing )

85
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,583
- AND SCENE.

86
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,666
- ( both laughing )

87
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,666
- I SWEAR,
THAT'S JUST HOW IT HAPPENED.

88
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,666
- QUITE A BOND THEY SHARE.

89
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,083
LORD TOSHIIE AND LADY MATSU

90
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,125
ARE WHAT ALL MARRIED
COUPLES SHOULD ASPIRE TO.

91
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,208
- SO TRUE.

92
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:16,083
LOVE DOES CONQUER ALL
LIKE WITH TOSHI AND MATSU,

93
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,375
OR WITH YOU AND KASUGA.

94
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,583
IF ONLY EVERYONE WERE
SO CONSUMED WITH LOVE,

95
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,375
THERE'D BE NO WAR.

96
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,000
- MAEDA KEIJI,
THAT IS PURE NONSENSE!

97
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,416
I AM BY NO MEANS IN SUCH...

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,208
- AW, COME ON. IT'S NOTHING
TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

99
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,291
LIFE IS SHORT, MY GOOD PEOPLE,
FIND LOVE WHERE YOU CAN!

100
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,833
- HOW DARE YOU BE SO FORWARD?

101
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,208
- ( screams )

102
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,625
- KASUGA.
- SIR.

103
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,333
- COULD YOU PREPARE US
ANOTHER CUP?

104
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,625
- YES, MY LORD KENSHIN.

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,416
- SUCH BEAUTY. YOUR GRACEFUL
AND UNCLOUDED SPIRIT

106
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,625
REVEALS ITSELF IN
EVEN THE WAY YOU SIT.

107
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,791
- PLEASE, MY LORD...

108
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,625
- IF I GAZED UPON YOUR
FORM FOR ALL TIME,

109
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,208
I WOULD NEVER TIRE OF IT.

110
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,750
- ( moaning )

111
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,416
- KASUGA, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE SHINOBI?

112
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,041
YOUR FELLOW NINJA BACK HOME
MUST THINK YOU'RE ODD.

113
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,166
- ( squeaks )

114
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,083
- I HAVE NO FELLOW NINJA.

115
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,833
- REGARDING LORD TOSHIIE,

116
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,833
I IMAGINE HE IS TROUBLED BY ODA
NOBUNAGA'S ACTIONS OF LATE.

117
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,125
ALL THE MORE SO,
AS HE IS HAPPILY MARRIED.

118
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,041
ODA'S RECENT INVASION OF MINO
MUST HAVE GIVEN HIM PAUSE.

119
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,000
AND YOU THOUGHT
TO LIGHTEN HIS MOOD

120
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,375
IN WHAT LITTLE WAY YOU COULD.

121
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,750
HENCE, YOUR PRANK INVOLVING
THE COLD BATHWATER.

122
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,458
OR AM I WRONG?

123
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,416
PERHAPS IT WAS MERELY
FOR NOSTALGIA, A FINAL BOW?

124
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,125
- NOTHING SO COMMENDABLE,
I'M AFRAID.

125
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,083
- EITHER WAY, I AM DEEPLY
SADDENED TO THINK THE

126
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,958
WORLD HAS COME TO PASS, SUCH
THAT YOU FEEL COMPELLED TO ACT.

127
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,916
- THIS DEVIL KING.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,541
I HEARD NOBUNAGA BURNED
MINO TO THE GROUND.

129
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,833
HIS OWN WIFE'S HOMELAND.

130
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:22,583
BUT EVEN SO, LADY NOHIME
CONTINUES TO STAND BY HIS SIDE.

131
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,833
I CAN'T IMAGINE
SHE'S RIGHT IN THE HEAD.

132
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,500
I FEAR FOR TOSHI AND MATSU MOST.

133
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,208
- THE LAND OF OMI
MAY BE IN DANGER AS WELL.

134
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,791
- YEAH, I WENT TO AZAI
TO TELL HIM TO BE CAREFUL.

135
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:41,083
BUT HE GAVE ME SOME SPIEL ABOUT
THE EVILS OF NEEDLESS ADVICE

136
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,958
AND TURNED ME AWAY AT THE GATE.

137
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:48,458
- THOUGH HE TOOK DOWN
IMAGAWA YOSHIMOTO AT OKEHAZAMA,

138
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,583
ODA SHOWS NO INTENT
TO RULE SURUGA.

139
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,250
NOR DOES HE SEEM
TO SHOW INTEREST

140
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,000
IN ATTACKING THE EASTERN LANDS.

141
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,750
- HE'S HOPING WE'LL
TAKE EACH OTHER OUT.

142
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,416
- AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
HE SWEEPS THROUGH WITH EASE.

143
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,041
- AS I THOUGHT.

144
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,375
SINCE YOU WERE IN A POSITION
TO OBSERVE ODA FIRSTHAND

145
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,958
AND CAME TO THE SAME
CONCLUSION, IT MUST BE SO.

146
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,833
BUT INSTEAD YOU INTEND
TO RALLY THE EASTERN GENERALS?

147
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,708
- ( laughs )

148
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,875
I GUESS NOTHING GETS BY YOU,
DOES IT, KENSHIN?

149
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,416
- IT IS NO EASY UNDERTAKING,

150
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,541
HOWEVER, IF ANY MAN IS
CAPABLE OF SUCH A FEAT,

151
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,333
IT COULD BE NO ONE BUT YOU.

152
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,208
- IT'S A FOOL'S ERRAND, I KNOW.

153
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,583
BUT THIS JUST DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE THE TIME

154
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,833
TO BE LOAFING ABOUT ANYMORE.

155
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,416
- HEY GUYS, SHIFT CHANGE...
- WAS A WHILE AGO, JERKS!

156
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,875
- WE WENT TO CHECK
ON HOW BIG BOSS-MAN'S DOING.

157
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,291
- YEAH, HOW WAS HE?

158
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,125
- SAME AS HE HAS BEEN.

159
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,958
DAY OR NIGHT, WHEN HE'S NOT
SWINGING HIS SWORD AROUND,

160
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:01,416
HE JUST STANDS THERE,
LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS.

161
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,083
THINK ABOUT IT WHEN'S THE LAST
TIME HE HELD A WAR COUNCIL?

162
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,583
- AND MASTER KATAKURA'S
BEEN SPENDING ALL HIS TIME

163
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,791
ON THE CROPS.

164
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,458
- Woman: GRANDMA!

165
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:16,125
- MASTER KATAKURA!
HERE, THE TEA IS READY, SIR!

166
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,333
- AH, GREAT TIMING.

167
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,250
- WE WENT RIDING ALL OVER
THE PLACE FOR NOTHING.

168
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,625
WE ENDED UP HANDING OVER ODAWARA
TO TAKEDA AND SURUGA TO ODA.

169
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,041
- NO WAY! BIG BOSS
AND BOSS KATAKURA

170
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,833
CAN'T BOTH HAVE
LOST THEIR DRIVE!

171
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,833
- ( all gasping )

172
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,916
- ( thunder rumbling )

173
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,333
- ( grunting )

174
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,041
- MASAMUNE.

175
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,708
- HELLO, THE CASTLE!

176
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,791
THE DELICACY OF OSHU,
ONE-EYED DRAGON!

177
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,375
- WHAT?

178
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,125
- YOUR LOVELY GUARDS AT THE GATE
TOLD ME I COULD FIND YOU HERE.

179
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,708
- IF YOU'RE HUNGRY,
I THINK YOU WANT THE TEA HOUSE.

180
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,791
- WELL, HE'S GOING TO BE
A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK.

181
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,041
THOUGH, I'D EXPECT NO LESS.

182
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,625
- WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU HAVE
WITH LORD MASAMUNE?

183
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,541
YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE
BIG BOSS OF OSHU, AFTER ALL.

184
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,625
IT WOULD BE PROPER IF YOU'D
INTRODUCE YOURSELF FIRST.

185
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,041
- OH, SORRY.
MY NAME'S MAEDA KEIJI.

186
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,916
PLEASURE MAKING
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,250
THIS HERE'S YUMEKICHI.

188
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,916
- ( squeaks )

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,458
- WE HAVE NO NEED OF A STREET
PERFORMER HERE. MOVE ALONG.

190
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,625
- MY WORD, THIS PLACE IS
IN LACK OF A WOMAN'S TOUCH.

191
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:50,125
GETTING LOVE TO BLOOM HERE?
GOT TO BE ONE HELL OF A CHORE.

192
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,666
- ( squeaks )

193
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,583
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF CARNIVAL YOU CAME FROM,

194
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,291
BUT YOU'RE WAY TOO HAPPY
FOR MY LIKING.

195
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,375
- Takeda: LEAVE THAT
RIGHT WHERE IT IS.

196
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,250
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

197
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,208
MAY I FORMALLY
CONGRATULATE YOU, SIR,

198
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,250
FOR YOUR DECISIVE TAKING
OF ODAWARA CASTLE!

199
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,541
- YES. THOUGH MERE
CIRCUMSTANCE LED US HERE,

200
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:28,416
THAT BASTARD DATE HAD US
DANCING TO HIS TUNE ALL ALONG.

201
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
- NO. "ALL WHO PROSPER
SHALL ONE DAY FALL!"

202
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,166
THIS DEFINES THAT PROVERB.

203
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,875
HOJO'S LANDS WERE FATED
TO BECOME TAKEDA'S.

204
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,583
LORDSHIP, YOUR GRACE IN
HONORING YOUR FALLEN ENEMY

205
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,750
AS A TRUE WARRIOR
ONLY PROVES IT.

206
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,708
AND THIS HUMBLE SERVANT
IS DEEPLY MOVED.

207
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,166
- YUKIMURA, WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF ODA NOBUNAGA?

208
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,083
- SIR, I SENSED SOMETHING
ODD ABOUT HIM.

209
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,625
I CANNOT QUITE DESCRIBE IT.

210
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,333
A MENACING, ALMOST OTHER
WORLDLY QUALITY,

211
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,333
AND AN OMINOUS AURA
THAT COULD NOT BE DISMISSED

212
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,666
AS SIMPLE BLOOD LUST.

213
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,625
EVEN SO, HE IS NO THREAT
TO YOU, YOUR LORDSHIP!

214
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,833
- TELL ME THEN, WHY DO YOU
SUPPOSE THE ONE-EYED DRAGON

215
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,416
OF OSHU HAS MADE
HIMSELF SCARCE OF LATE?

216
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,541
- WELL, SIR, I'D GUESS
HE IS REBUILDING HIS STRENGTH.

217
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,583
AFTER CONFRONTING THE DEVIL KING
OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN.

218
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,166
HE WOULD NOT BE LOOKING
FOR MORE BATTLES!

219
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,583
- ( grunting loudly )

220
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:30,083
DO YOU TRULY BELIEVE THAT?
SPEAK, YOUNG CUB!

221
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,125
- CERTAINLY, YOUR LORDSHIP,

222
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,958
YOU ARE NOT SAYING THE
ONE-EYED DRAGON KNOWS FEAR,

223
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,833
THAT HE IS AFRAID OF THOSE
WHO OPENLY SNATCHED

224
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,708
IMAGAWA'S HEAD FROM
HIM? THAT MAN HAS STRENGTH

225
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,291
AND RESOLVE THE LIKES OF
WHICH I HAVE NEVER SEEN!

226
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:52,083
IMPOSSIBLE! IF THAT IS INDEED
TRUE, I SEVERELY MISJUDGED HIM.

227
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,333
( screaming )

228
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,083
- TO NOT KNOW FEAR
IS SHEER FOLLY!

229
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,625
TO KNOW FEAR IS NECESSARY. IT IS
THE KEY TO PROPER STRATEGY!

230
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:06,208
- BUT, YOUR LORDSHIP,
TO BE AFRAID OF ONE'S ENEMIES...

231
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,291
- YUKIMURA, TO WHAT PURPOSE
DO YOU WIELD YOUR SPEAR

232
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,916
IN THESE TURBULENT TIMES?

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,833
WHY DO YOU FIGHT?

234
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,791
- TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU,
YOUR LORDSHIP!

235
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,500
HUMBLY AND WITH
ALL MY HEART. AND AS SUCH,

236
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,083
I WISH FOR YOUR CONTINUED
CONQUEST OF THE COUNTRY,

237
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,333
UNTIL YOU RULE THIS LAND
OF THE RISING SUN!

238
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,375
- AND WHEN THAT HAS COME TO
PASS, WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN?

239
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,875
- YOUR LORDSHIP, I SHALL EVER
REMAIN BY YOUR SIDE!

240
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,083
I SHALL SPEND MY LIFE
IN YOUR HUMBLE...

241
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:48,500
- THERE WILL SOON COME A TIME
WHEN EVEN YOU UNDERSTAND.

242
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,625
- YOUR LORDSHIP?

243
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,500
- Date: WHAT? AN ALLIANCE?

244
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,333
- MY HOPE IS TO BRING GENERALS
TOGETHER IN A UNITED FRONT.

245
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,416
THEN PIT OURSELVES
AGAINST THE DEVIL KING OF OWARI.

246
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,416
- THAT'S ONE
I HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE.

247
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,625
A STREET PERFORMER RIDING
REIN ON A BUNCH OF SAMURAI.

248
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,666
- UH, MASAMUNE?
- WHAT?

249
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,750
- THIS MAN, HE'S THE MAEDA
FAMILY'S WANDERING ROGUE.

250
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:20,166
- REALLY? THAT MAKES SENSE.

251
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,041
- NO WONDER I THOUGHT
YOUR PLAN WAS BEYOND CRAZY.

252
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,166
- YEAH, WELL,
CRAZY'S KIND OF MY THING.

253
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,916
POINT IS THE TIME
FOR SQUABBLING

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,708
OVER OUR PETTY
DIFFERENCES IS OVER.

255
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,250
IN ANY CONFLICT,
THE MORE IT ESCALATES,

256
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,125
THE HARDER IT BECOMES
FOR THOSE INVOLVED

257
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,916
TO SEE THINGS CLEARLY.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,958
THAT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN WAR.

259
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,333
DATE OF OSHU, TAKEDA OF KAI,
UESUGI OF ECHIGO,

260
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,625
AND TOKUGAWA OF MIKAWA
WILL SECURE THE EASTERN FRONT.

261
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,750
THEN ASAKURA OF ECHIZEN,
AZAI OF OMI,

262
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,458
AND AS MANY OF THE WESTERN
GENERALS AS WE CAN GET,

263
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,166
WILL SURROUND ODA.

264
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,166
AND I'LL PITCH IN TOO,
WHEREVER I CAN.

265
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,458
- NOT ONE FOR BREVITY, ARE YOU?
ODA NOBU-NAGA.

266
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,833
YOU'RE RIGHT,
HE'S NOT JUST ANY OLD MAN.

267
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,666
- YOU'VE MET THE DEVIL KING?

268
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,250
THEN YOU UNDERSTAND!
A MAN OF YOUR SKILL...

269
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,166
- A MAN OF MY SKILL
ISN'T INTERESTED

270
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,041
IN SERVING UNDER SOMEONE ELSE.

271
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,416
- THIS ISN'T A MATTER
OF WHO SERVES WHOM!

272
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,541
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY HERE...

273
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,541
- SINCE IT'S CLEAR
YOU WON'T DROP IT...

274
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,291
MAKE ME SEE THINGS YOUR WAY.

275
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,541
- ( sighs )

276
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,666
I REALLY DID NOT COME HERE
LOOKING TO FIGHT WITH YOU.

277
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,291
BUT IF IT'S SOME
ONE-ON-ONE YOU WANT,

278
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,750
I HEAR YOU'VE GOT A GREAT
RED-LIGHT DISTRICT.

279
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,291
- SHUT UP!

280
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,291
- YOUR WAY, THEN,
ONE-EYED DRAGON.

281
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,208
- WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?

282
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,541
- I'VE HEARD MANY A TALE
OF YOUR DAUNTING ABILITIES.

283
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,375
FIGURE KEEPING IT SHEATHED
MAKES IT A FAIR FIGHT.

284
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,625
- YOU WON'T LIKE ME
WHEN I'M ANGRY.

285
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,958
- WHAT? ARE YOU SAYING
YOU WEREN'T ALREADY?

286
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,458
- KOJURO!

287
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,125
- AS ALWAYS, BOSS,
ENJOY YOURSELF.

288
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,500
- ( grunting )

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,750
- FIND LOVE
WHERE YOU CAN. DRIVEL.

290
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,666
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN ECHIGO?

291
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,125
- IT'S OKAY. I'M JUST TRACKING
SOMEONE'S MOVEMENTS.

292
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,708
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
TRAVELING VARIOUS LANDS,

293
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,958
MEETING UP WITH GENERALS.

294
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,916
- THAT MAEDA SCOUNDREL,
I ASSUME.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,083
- AH, SO HE WAS HERE.
- AND HE IS NOT ANY LONGER.

296
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,916
- WHERE'D HE HEAD OFF TO? OSHU?
- NO CLUE.

297
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,250
- HMM...
- WHAT?

298
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,708
- I SEE, HE AND KENSHIN GOT
ALONG BETTER THAN YOU'D LIKE,

299
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,333
SO YOUR HEART BURNS
WITH FLAMES OF JEALOUSY!

300
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,958
- THAT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,708
- CRAZY. NOW, THEN.

302
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,500
IT IS JUST AS MY LORD SUSPECTED.

303
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,916
HOW WILL YOU RESPOND,
ONE-EYED DRAGON?

304
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,500
- ( grunting )

305
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:42,083
- WHAT IS THE POINT OF RULING
IF YOU NEVER FIND HAPPINESS?

306
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,250
RATHER THAN BLEED OUT
ON A DISTANT BATTLEFIELD,

307
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,625
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER PERISH
IN THE ARMS OF A LOVED ONE?

308
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,333
I WOULD. THE THOUGHT OF
SEEING TOSHI AND MATSU

309
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,541
TORN APART BY WAR...

310
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,833
THAT IS MORE
THAN I CAN EVER BEAR!

311
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,208
I KNOW IT MUST SEEM TRIVIAL
TO SOMEONE LIKE YOU!

312
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,958
WHY RULE,
IF NOT TO MAKE A BETTER WORLD.

313
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,291
WHERE WE ARE FREE
TO LOVE AND FIGHT,

314
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,041
LAUGH AND CRY, FIND HAPPINESS!

315
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,083
A WORLD WORTH DYING FOR!

316
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,375
- ( grunting )

317
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,041
( screaming )

318
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,208
- ( groaning )

319
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,875
- SORRY, FLOWER BOY.
GO SELL IT SOMEPLACE ELSE.

320
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,666
- UH, UH...

321
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,083
AH, MAN, TOUGH NUT INDEED.

322
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,666
- I HAVE TO SAY, SIR,
I AM RELIEVED.

323
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,666
- ABOUT WHAT?

324
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,500
- AT OKEHAZAMA,

325
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,333
HOW YOU LOST YOUR COURAGE
WHEN FACING THE DEVIL KING.

326
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,375
- YOU ASS.
ENOUGH WITH THE SARCASM.

327
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,375
- LORD MASAMUNE, SURELY YOU
MUST HAVE NOTICED IT YOURSELF.

328
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,583
AT THAT MOMENT,

329
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,708
YOU KNEW YOU COULD NOT DIE.
THAT YOUR POSITION IS SUCH,

330
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,083
THAT YOU COULD SIMPLY
NOT AFFORD TO.

331
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:44,875
AND YOU CAME TO REALIZE THIS
WITH EVERY FIBER OF YOUR BEING.

332
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:48,666
YOU SAW A MAN WHO CARRIES
THE LIVES OF HIS PEOPLE

333
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,166
UPON HIS SHOULDERS,

334
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,375
THEIR PRIDE, THEIR FUTURE.
YOU SAW THE RULER OF A NATION.

335
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,083
I AM ASHAMED I DID
NOT NOTICE IT MYSELF.

336
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,541
NOT UNTIL THAT STRANGE
VAGABOND MADE ME REALIZE IT.

337
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,416
HOWEVER, SIR, KEIJI'S CHALLENGE
CANNOT GO UNANSWERED.

338
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,000
THE PEOPLE OF OSHU
AND ITS ENTIRE ARMY,

339
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,208
ARE PREPARED TO FOLLOW
WHATEVER DECISION YOU MAKE.

340
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,083
- KOJURO.

341
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,916
- AS AM I. SINCE OUR
FIRST CAMPAIGN,

342
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I HAVE BEEN YOUR RIGHT EYE.

343
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,791
AND I ALWAYS WILL BE.

344
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,916
THOUGH, LATELY, IT FEELS LIKE
ALL I EVER DO ANYMORE

345
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,041
IS TELL YOU WHAT NOT TO DO.

346
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,208
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

347
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,666
SOMEONE HAS TO
MAKE A STAND EVENTUALLY.

348
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,291
NOT SOMEONE. ONLY ONE MAN CAN.
AND THAT'S ME.

349
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,333
I TRUST YOU'LL HAVE
MY BACK, KOJURO.

350
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,458
- SIR.

351
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:54,291
- Date: YOU BOYS READY?
- All: YEAH!

352
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:58,208
- TO OWARI!
WE FIND ODA AND TAKE HIS HEAD!

353
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,791
- All: LET'S RIDE!

354
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,708
- ALL RIGHT!
THEN LET'S MAKE SOME TRACKS!

355
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,750
- ( all cheering )

356
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,541
- TIME TO ROLL THE DICE
AND I'M ALL-IN WITH OSHU

357
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,791
TO TRY THE LUCK OF
THE WHOLE COUNTRY!

358
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,666
- ( theme song playing )

359
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,083
- Azai: GAZE WELL ON
MY VALIANT FORM!

360
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,500
IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE,

361
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,041
YOU MUST WITNESS
OUR NEXT INSTALLMENT!

362
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,416
THOSE WHO DO NOT
SHALL BE DEEMED EVIL.

363
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,333
AND I, AZAI NAGAMASA,
SHALL ERADICATE THEM!
