1
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,250
- Narrator: AFTER THE BATTLES AT
NAGASHINO AND SHITARAGAHARA,

2
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,250
THE INJURED DATE MASAMUNE AND
HIS ARMY HAD TAKEN SHELTER

3
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,791
WITH TAKEDA IN KAI, WHEN
TRAGEDY STRUCK WITHOUT WARNING.

4
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,708
THE VILLAIN OF THE WARRING
STATES, MATSUNAGA HISAHIDE,

5
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,833
TOOK DATE'S YOUNG
RETAINERS HOSTAGE.

6
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,166
AS RANSOM, HE DEMANDED
MASAMUNE'S SWORDS.

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,541
THE SIX DRAGON CLAWS.

8
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,708
AS WELL AS TAKEDA'S
FAMILY TREASURE.

9
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,666
THE ARMOR THAT NEEDS NO SHIELD.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,125
KATAKURA KOJURO HEADED OFF ALONE
TO THE RUINS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE

11
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,125
WHERE MATSUNAGA AWAITS HIM.

12
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,666
WHILE SANADA YUKIMURA,

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,416
BURNING WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY,
RIDES HOT ON HIS HEELS.

14
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,083
- HAND THE RANSOM OVER TO US.

15
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,583
- THE HOSTAGES WILL
BE DELIVERED LATER.

16
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,958
- SINCE YOU'RE DREAMING,
LET ME PUT YOU TO SLEEP.

17
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,083
COME ON.

18
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,166
- ( grunting )

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,458
- THEY'RE NOT SO TOUGH.

20
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,125
LONG AS THEY'RE NOT
ACTING TOGETHER.

21
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,041
- THE DEATH GOD CORPS USES
ANY AND ALL MEANS.

22
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,291
- WE FINISH MATTERS
SWIFTLY AND QUIETLY.

23
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,041
- ( choking ) THAT'S...

24
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,041
- MESMERIZING INCENSE.

25
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,666
- NO NEED TO WORRY.

26
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,791
- YOUR ARMY IS NO
DIFFERENT FROM US.

27
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,208
- YOU CAN JUST REPLACE
WHAT YOU LOSE.

28
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,791
- LIKE HELL WE CAN.

29
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,333
- ( theme song playing )

30
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,333
- ( Matsunaga laughing )

31
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,000
THIS IS GETTING
SURPRISINGLY INTERESTING.

32
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,416
I HEARD THE ONE EYED
DRAGON WAS WOUNDED,

33
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,291
TAKING SHELTER IN
THE LAND OF KAI.

34
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,500
I THOUGHT IT A
GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.

35
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:07,666
DATE'S SIX DRAGON CLAWS
AND TAKEDA'S LEGENDARY ARMOR.

36
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,125
THESE ARE BOTH TREASURES
I HAVE LONG COVETED.

37
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,750
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW MY GUESTS
WOULD BE DATE'S MEN.

38
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,958
THOUGH, IN RETROSPECT,

39
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,291
YOUR APPEARANCES SHOULD
HAVE GIVEN YOU AWAY.

40
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,166
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

41
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,666
- YOU CAN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH
OSHU AND JUST GET AWAY WITH IT.

42
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:28,916
- ( stomach rumbling )
- I'M HUNGRY.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,041
- Matsunaga: I HEAR THE TIGER OF
KAI IS PROVIDING AID AND SHELTER

44
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,416
TO ALL THOSE
INJURED AT NAGASHINO.

45
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,625
BE THEY FRIEND OR FOE.

46
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:40,791
THAT WILL SOON BE REVEALED
FOR THE HYPOCRISY IT IS.

47
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,208
TO WILLINGLY GIVE UP THE ARMOR,
A FAMILY TREASURE,

48
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,166
FOR A CLAN WHO MAY WELL
BE YOUR ENEMY TOMORROW.

49
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,750
NO LORD OF ANY DOMAIN
WOULD DO SUCH A THING,

50
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,708
LET ALONE FOR MEN
AS EXPENDABLE AS YOU.

51
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,625
- IF YOU'RE GONNA KILL US,
JUST DO IT.

52
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,625
- DO YOUR WORST,
WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

53
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,500
- ( laughs ) I WOULD. BUT IT
SEEMS THE DRAGON'S RIGHT EYE

54
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,000
HAS HASTENED HERE IN PLACE OF
YOUR POOR, CYCLOPTIC MASTER.

55
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,208
- ( gasping )

56
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,916
- Yoshinao: BOSS KATAKURA?

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,416
- Matsunaga: YOU SEE
WHAT I MEAN? INTERESTING.

58
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,958
IF I ADD DATE'S MOST TRUSTED
TACTICIAN TO MY COLLECTION,

59
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,208
EVEN TAKEDA, WHO MUST CERTAINLY
HAVE IGNORED YOUR PLIGHT,

60
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,000
WILL BE FORCED TO
INVOLVE HIMSELF.

61
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,791
AN UNENVIABLE POSITION,

62
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,833
ALL BECAUSE HE TOOK
PITY ON THE DATE

63
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,083
IN THE NAME OF A HASTY ALLIANCE.

64
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,750
- Samanosuke: BOSS KATAKURA
WOULD NEVER BE SO CARELESS.

65
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,541
BESIDES, OSHU HAS NEVER
FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH ANYBODY.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,083
- IT MAY AS WELL HAVE,
GIVEN RECENT EVENTS.

67
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,083
YOU MEN SEEM AWFULLY
FRIENDLY WITH THEM.

68
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,375
OR WAS THERE SOME OTHER REASON
YOU WERE GUARDING

69
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,750
THE KAI BORDER IN PLACE
OF TAKEDA'S OWN MEN?

70
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,208
- WE WERE REPAYING
THEIR HOSPITALITY.

71
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,625
- TAKEDA'S FOOD
WAS REALLY GOOD.

72
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,541
- TENSIONS WILL SURELY
RISE OVER WHETHER OR NOT

73
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,375
TO OFFER UP THE ARMOR IN
ADDITION TO THE DRAGON'S CLAWS.

74
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,208
BUT PERHAPS SUCH PETTY
SQUABBLES WILL BE PUT ASIDE

75
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:08,833
TO ADDRESS THE MORE LOOMING
THREAT, ODA NOBUNAGA.

76
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,750
A GRAND ALLIANCE FORMED
TO PROTECT THE LAND

77
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,166
THEY SO RECENTLY FOUGHT OVER.
FROM THE DEVIL KING,

78
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,833
WHO WOULD RAIN DEATH AND
DESTRUCTION ACROSS THE WORLD.

79
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,000
IT IS BUT A FARCE.

80
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,666
SHARING PLOYS AND STRATEGIES
MAY SEEM BENEFICIAL NOW.

81
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,000
BUT WHEN THE INEVITABLE CLASH
COMES BETWEEN DATE AND TAKEDA,

82
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,666
WHAT THEN?

83
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,875
YOU HAVE NO NEED
TO GRIEVE, GENTLEMEN,

84
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,083
FOR YOU HAVE PROVED
INVALUABLE IN SHOWING THEM

85
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,041
HOW FOOLISH THEY TRULY ARE.
THE SADLY FLEETING LIVES

86
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,625
YOU THREE WERE BLESSED WITH
WILL HAVE SERVED A PURPOSE.

87
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:45,416
REST EASY, NOW. WHEN DEATH
COMES, IT WILL END QUICKLY.

88
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,083
- ( horse whinnying )

89
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,875
- YOU PUSH YOUR HORSE ALMOST AS
HARD AS YOU PUSH YOURSELF.

90
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,583
UH, MASTER?

91
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,250
- GET SOME REST. GOOD WORK
ON THIS LONG JOURNEY.

92
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,375
- AND THE ARMOR THAT
NEEDS NO SHIELD?

93
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,708
- DO NOT WORRY ABOUT IT.

94
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:10,208
MASTER KATAKURA, MAY I
FIND YOU UNHARMED.

95
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,375
- ( both grunting )

96
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,125
- RUN AWAY, IT IS YOUR
MEANS TO SURVIVAL.

97
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,666
- CRY OUT LOUD, IT IS THE
BLOSSOM OF LIFE.

98
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,125
- ACCEPT YOUR FAILURE,
IT IS YOUR FINAL THOUGHT.

99
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,208
- ( grunting )

100
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,833
( groaning )

101
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,125
( gasping )

102
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,916
- ( yelling )

103
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,416
- ( gasping ) NO, I BREATHED IT.

104
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:58,625
- ALREADY? IT'S NOT SO BAD
AFTER YOU GET USED TO IT.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,666
- HOW ARE YOU STILL STANDING?

106
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,875
- IF YOU COME AT ME,
YOU WILL DIE.

107
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,125
THAT WOULD RUIN OUR PLANS.

108
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,166
HOWEVER, THIS WILL
BE AN ENDING OF SORTS.

109
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,958
( yelling )
I WILL BRING YOU DOWN!

110
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,625
- THOSE ARE...
- THEY WERE THE MIYOSHI THREE.

111
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,291
- ( sniffing )

112
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,458
WELL, AT LEAST THEIR
CHEAP TRICKS DIDN'T WORK

113
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,000
AGAINST THE DRAGON'S RIGHT EYE.

114
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,583
- HE CAME ALL THIS WAY
BEARING THE RANSOM,

115
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,000
AND STILL THEY TRY TO KILL HIM.

116
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,333
- HE HAD TO HAVE BREATHED
IN A LOT OF THIS STUFF.

117
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,750
MATSUNAGA WILL HAVE HIM
AT A DISADVANTAGE.

118
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,541
- MASTER, WE SHOULD HURRY.
- RIGHT.

119
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,750
- ( breathing heavily )

120
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,833
( coughing )

121
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,250
DAMN, I INHALED TOO MUCH OF IT.

122
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,208
MATSUNAGA HISAHIDE!

123
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:15,250
- GOOD EVENING, I HAVE BEEN
AWAITING YOUR ARRIVAL.

124
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,625
I MUST SAY I HAD HOPED YOU WOULD
BE BROUGHT TO ME AS A CORPSE.

125
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,458
BUT I SEE YOU ARE NOT
TO BE UNDERESTIMATED.

126
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,666
- I, KATAKURA KOJURO,

127
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,250
AM NOT CALLED THE DRAGON'S
RIGHT EYE FOR NOTHING.

128
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,208
- BOSS KATAKURA.

129
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,125
- SO SORRY, BOSS,
WE WERE CARELESS.

130
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,083
- LISTEN, SIR,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

131
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,291
WE'D LOVE TO BE RESCUED,
BUT BIG BOSS'S SWORDS ARE...

132
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,625
- Katakura: THIS WILL ALL BE
OVER SOON. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE.

133
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,666
- THIS IS A SURPRISE,

134
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,250
THAT YOU ACTUALLY BROUGHT THE
SIX DRAGON'S CLAWS HERE?

135
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,666
- Katakura: I BELIEVE YOU MADE
YOUR DEMANDS CLEAR.

136
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,541
- Matsunaga: THE ONE EYED DRAGON
IS A RARE MAN INDEED.

137
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,875
THAT HE WOULD HAND OVER
HIS PRECIOUS SWORDS

138
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,000
TO SAVE THREE COMMON SOLDIERS.

139
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,916
- DO NOT PRESUME WE
ARE LIKE OTHER CLANS.

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,166
IN THE DATE ARMY THERE
ARE NO COMMON SOLDIERS.

141
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,333
- ( all gasping )

142
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,666
IF THE DAY COMES WHEN WE
ARE ABANDONED IN THE FIELD,

143
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,875
WE WILL BE READY FOR IT.

144
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,708
- I SEE. WHY THEN, WITH THE FATE
OF THE ENTIRE LAND IN JEOPARDY,

145
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,708
HAVE YOU LET YOURSELF BECOME
CAUGHT UP IN THIS TRIVIAL MATTER

146
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,208
AND COME ALL THIS WAY?

147
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,208
IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME
TO ABANDON THE RANK AND FILE,

148
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,333
I WOULD THINK NOW MIGHT BE IT.

149
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:30,416
- THAT'S EASY. THIS IS NOT
WHERE THEY WERE MEANT TO DIE.

150
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
WE FORMED THIS CLAN OF WARRIORS

151
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,458
IN RESPONSE TO THESE
VIOLENT TIMES.

152
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,041
I FULLY EXPECT US
TO SUFFER CASUALTIES.

153
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,833
HOWEVER, I WON'T LET
ONE MAN DIE IN VAIN.

154
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:45,000
THAT IS THE WAY OF THE DATE.
AND THE WILL OF LORD MASAMUNE.

155
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,375
- BOSS, YOU CAN'T.
- PLEASE, NO.

156
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,625
- ( grunts )

157
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,500
THEY'RE YOURS, FOR THE MOMENT!

158
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,750
- BOSS KATAKURA!
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

159
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,291
- THE SOUL OF DATE,
IN HIS HANDS?

160
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,041
- NOW THESE ARE
MY DEMANDS. FIGHT ME.

161
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,625
IF I WIN, YOU WILL RETURN BOTH
THE HOSTAGES AND THE SWORDS.

162
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,750
IF YOU CAN FIGHT.

163
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,041
- ( chuckling )

164
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,000
THIS SHOULD PROVE AMUSING,
BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH.

165
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,291
- WHAT?

166
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,958
- AS YOU SAID, I WAS QUITE
CLEAR IN MY DEMANDS.

167
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,000
WITHOUT BOTH TREASURES,
I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE.

168
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,250
- THIS IS ALL THE DATE
CLAN HAS TO OFFER.

169
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:29,000
IF YOU WANT THE TIGER OF KAI'S
ARMOR, GO BARGAIN WITH HIM.

170
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,583
- ( scoffs ) AS I THOUGHT,

171
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,333
THOUGH TAKEDA BRIEFLY
WELCOMED YOU INTO HIS HOME,

172
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,125
HE WOULD NOT GO SO FAR AS TO
OFFER UP HIS PRIZED POSSESSION.

173
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,291
- Sanada: HOLD! HOLD, I SAY!
- ( gasps )

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,625
- IF YOU WANT TAKEDA'S
ARMOR, HERE IT IS.

175
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,833
- SANADA.

176
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,458
- MY NAME IS SANADA
GENJIRO YUKIMURA.

177
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:59,333
I COME AS PROXY TO HIS
LORDSHIP TAKEDA SHINGEN.

178
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,291
BEHOLD, THE ARMOR THAT
NEEDS NO SHIELD,

179
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,333
TREASURED ANTIQUITY
OF THE TAKEDA FAMILY.

180
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,208
I INVITE YOU, LORD MATSUNAGA,

181
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,416
TO VERIFY ITS AUTHENTICITY
FOR YOURSELF.

182
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,833
- I NEVER IMAGINED
BOTH TREASURES

183
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,208
WOULD COME TOGETHER SO EASILY.

184
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,625
BUT NOW THAT I HAVE THEM,
I BELIEVE IT'S THE END.

185
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,041
- KATAKURA!
- KATAKURA!

186
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,000
- SASUKE!

187
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,666
- ( rumbling )

188
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,000
- ( screaming )

189
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,833
- ( laughing )

190
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,125
- ( gasping )

191
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,916
( groaning )

192
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,625
BASTARD.

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,583
- YOU TOOK QUITE A BEATING.

194
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,208
FOR A ONE EYED DRAGON,

195
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,916
I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY OPPONENT
MORE FORMIDABLE

196
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,166
THAN HIS OWN RIGHT EYE ATTACKING
ONLY ON HIS RIGHT SIDE.

197
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,375
- IT'S NOTHING TO LAUGH AT.

198
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,208
- BUT HE MADE SURE TO AVOID
DIRECT HITS

199
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,791
TO YOUR GUNSHOT WOUND.

200
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,583
A RARE AND TRUSTWORTHY
MAN INDEED.

201
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,916
- WHATEVER.

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,333
YOU SENT SANADA AFTER HIM,
I TAKE IT?

203
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,000
THE ARMOR THAT WAS HERE,

204
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,333
IT'S YOUR FAMILY'S
MOST PRIZED...

205
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,541
- IT IS NEEDED ELSEWHERE
RIGHT NOW.

206
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,291
A MAN WHO CAN DO SOMETHING,
YET CHOOSES TO DO NOTHING,

207
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,666
CAN NEVER BE A MAN
WHO ACHIEVES GREATNESS.

208
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,666
BEFORE LONG, WE'LL BID FAREWELL
TO THESE TURBULENT TIMES,

209
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,708
AND IT WILL BE YOU YOUNG MEN
WHO CARRY ON

210
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,833
AND DEFINE THE ERA TO COME.

211
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,416
- ( scoffs )
- HMM?

212
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,250
- YOU SAY THAT,
BUT YOU'RE THE KINDA GUY

213
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,583
WHO'S GONNA BE THROWING
HIS WEIGHT AROUND

214
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,625
FOREVER OR AM I WRONG?

215
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,833
- NO, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE ME, ALL RIGHT.

216
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,416
( laughing )

217
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,500
MATSUNAGA HISAHIDE
IS THE ONLY GENERAL

218
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,208
WHO HAS FACED ODA IN BATTLE,

219
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,291
AND BEEN ALLOWED TO CONTINUE
BREATHING AFTERWARDS.

220
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,083
THIS COULD MEAN
HE'S UNDER ODA'S COMMAND

221
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,041
AND THE DEVIL KING
ORDERED HIM TO CREATE

222
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,000
SOME SORT OF DIVERSION FOR US.

223
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,541
THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY, THOUGH.

224
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,041
- WHY YOU SAY THAT?

225
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,583
- MATSUNAGA DOES
NOT TAKE ORDERS.

226
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,125
- THEN WHY DID ODA
LET HIM LIVE?

227
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,708
- I COULD NOT SAY
FOR CERTAIN BUT,

228
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,333
PERHAPS, WHEN HE FOUND
A RARE CUCKOO BIRD,

229
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,833
HE FANCIED KEEPING IT IN A CAGE.

230
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,166
REST WELL FOR NOW,
ONE EYED DRAGON.

231
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,208
THE WORLD STILL HAS
GREAT NEED OF YOU.

232
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,000
- TAKEDA, OLD MAN,

233
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,625
I WILL PAY YOU BACK FOR THIS,
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

234
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,291
- AFTER WE DEFEAT
THE DEVIL KING

235
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,166
WE CAN FIGHT EACH OTHER
ALL THE WAY TO KYOTO.

236
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,041
I KNOW SOMEONE ELSE WHO
WISHES THAT AS WELL.

237
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,375
- ALL RIGHT.

238
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,291
- LIFE, DEATH.

239
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,208
ALL THINGS REPEAT THIS CYCLE

240
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,333
OF BEING BORN AND BEING BROKEN.

241
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,125
IF YOU KNOW THAT EVERYTHING
IS TEMPORARY,

242
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:51,458
DO NOT RESIST WHAT YOU DESIRE,
BUT TAKE IT, APPRECIATE IT.

243
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,958
AND IN THE END, DESTROY IT AS
FREELY AS YOU WISH.

244
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,708
- MATSUNAGA!

245
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,750
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO, BOY.

246
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,375
THE MEN YOU CAME TO SAVE
ARE NO LONGER.

247
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,375
FIGHTING ME WILL
DO YOU NO GOOD.

248
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,416
WELL, DON'T YOU LOOK TO
BE IN A FOUL MOOD.

249
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET.

250
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,125
I OBTAINED THAT
WHICH I DESIRED.

251
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,958
THAT IS REALLY ALL
THERE IS TO IT.

252
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,333
- DAMN YOU, MATSUNAGA.

253
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,791
NOW I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO
OPEN THE GATES OF HELL.

254
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,166
- KATAKURA!

255
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,708
- YOU CLEARLY FEEL A
NEED TO TAKE MY LIFE.

256
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,666
SO BE IT, TAKE IT AS
YOUR DESIRE DICTATES.

257
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,500
IT IS THE WORLD'S ONLY TRUTH.

258
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,375
- ( men yelling )

259
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,375
- ( grunting )

260
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,166
- ( men yelling )

261
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,833
- NEVER BEFORE HAVE I FOUGHT
ANYONE LIKE THESE MEN.

262
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,583
I SENSE NOTHING EVEN RESEMBLING
FIGHTING SPIRIT IN THEM.

263
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,125
- THAT'S BECAUSE MATSUNAGA
IS PAYING THEM.

264
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,875
HE CAN'T POSSIBLY HAVE
ANY LOYAL RETAINERS.

265
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,291
- ( men yelling )

266
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,083
- MATSUNAGA, YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
A CHILD THROWING A TANTRUM.

267
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,458
IT'S TIME TO SEND YOU TO BED.

268
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,583
- I HATE TO RUIN YOUR MOMENT,
BUT HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY THINK

269
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,500
YOU CAN WIN IN YOUR CONDITION?

270
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,291
- ( coughing )

271
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,583
- THE INCENSE OF
AGONIZING DEATH.

272
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,541
A SECRET PREPARATION
I AM FOND OF.

273
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,000
IT GROWS QUITE LETHAL

274
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,708
WHEN COMBINED WITH THE POISON
YOU BREATHED EARLIER.

275
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,666
YOU TWO CANNOT WIN!

276
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,791
- KATAKURA!

277
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,166
- NOW THAT COULD'VE GONE BETTER.
- SASUKE!

278
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,541
- WERE YOU HURT?

279
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,125
- PLEASE, WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO HERE?

280
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,750
THOUGH, IT DID GET
A BIT DICEY.

281
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,916
- ( swords clanking )

282
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
- NEITHER THE DRAGON
NOR THE TIGER

283
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,583
CAN AFFORD TO HOLD THE TIPS
OF THEIR TAILS TOO DEAR.

284
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,916
AGAINST A DEVIL WHO
DEVOURS ALL IN HIS SIGHT,

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,208
THEY'LL FIND IT
DIFFICULT TO SURVIVE.

286
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,250
MUCH LESS SEIZE THIS COUNTRY
FROM HIS BLOODY TALONS.

287
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,750
EVEN AGAINST ME, A WITHERED,
GREEDY OLD HERMIT,

288
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,541
YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF VICTORY.

289
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,958
- I AM SICK OF YOUR
POMPOUS RAMBLING.

290
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,666
- ( yelling )

291
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,500
- Sarutobi: MASTER KATAKURA!

292
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,125
- THAT SMOKE HAS THE ANTIDOTE,
BREATHE IN DEEP.

293
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,458
- ( inhaling deeply )

294
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,291
- YOU'RE MINE NOW, MATSUNAGA.

295
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,541
IN THE PITCH BLACK NIGHT,
A SINGLE RAY OF LIGHT!

296
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,666
- ( screaming )

297
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,541
- IT'S A SHAME,

298
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,958
BUT SOMEDAY YOU WILL FADE
FROM THIS WORLD AS WELL.

299
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,666
FOR IN THE END, WE ALL
RETURN TO NOTHING.

300
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,916
- Katakura: WE WILL NOT
JUST FADE AWAY.

301
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,250
THOUGH THERE'S NO WAY TO
KNOW HOW LONG IT MAY LAST.

302
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,541
WE WILL LEAVE OUR MARK
ON THIS WORLD.

303
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,416
- ( laughing )

304
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,958
- THERE IS NO TREASURE YOU CAN
TAKE WITH YOU TO NIRVANA.

305
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,458
- YOU NEEDN'T WORRY. THAT ISN'T
WHERE YOU GO FROM HERE.

306
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,125
BUT I'LL MEET YOU IN HELL.

307
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,875
- YES, YOU WILL.

308
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:30,000
A BRIEF FAREWELL THEN,
RIGHT EYE OF THE DRAGON!

309
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,833
- Katakura: I AM IN YOUR DEBT.

310
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,458
- NO, I AM AS DISAPPOINTED
AS YOU MUST BE.

311
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,208
- I'M SO SORRY.

312
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,125
IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO GET OUT
OF THERE IN ONE PIECE MYSELF.

00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,333
- YEAH. WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

317
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,458
- THE BIG BOSS' SWORDS?
YOU CAN'T HAVE 'EM.

318
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,708
- ( chuckles )

319
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,875
YOU GUYS.

320
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,958
- BOSS KATAKURA!
- WHERE IS THE BASTARD?

321
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,791
- AW, DON'T TELL US...

322
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,583
- IS IT OVER ALREADY?

323
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,625
- IT IS.

324
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,291
- ( all groaning )

325
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,708

326
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,125
- OH, MAN.
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

327
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,750
- BOSS KATAKURA,
WE'RE SO SORRY.

328
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,291
- WE'RE SO ASHAMED, SIR.

329
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,625
- YOU GUYS DID WELL.

330
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,500
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
SAID IT, BOSS KATAKURA.

331
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,083
- THIS ISN'T THE PLACE WHERE
WE'RE MEANT TO DIE.

332
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,250
- NOT UNTIL THE BIG BOSS
CONQUERS THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

333
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,791
- YEAH, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

- Magobei: THAT WAS
SO HARROWING.

335
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,333
I SWEAR, I THOUGHT
I'D WASTE AWAY.

336
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,958
- YOU WERE LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I WAS FRESH MEAT.

337
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,375
- THANK GOODNESS.

338

ONLY BY YOUR INDULGENCE

342
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,791
THAT HE WAS PERMITTED TO
LIVE IN SECLUSION THIS LONG.

343
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,958
MY LORD KAZUSANOSUKE,

344
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,625
WHY DID YOU PERMIT HIM
TO LIVE FOR SO LONG?

345
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,958
- BECAUSE I FOUND HIM
INTERESTING.

346
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,125
OH, YES. WHAT HAS MITSUHIDE
GOTTEN UP TO?

347

- MY LORD,

348
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,791
HE HAS MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO
CRUSH THE ALLIANCE

349
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,250
OF THE EASTERN LANDS.

350
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,500

PROVIDENCE BE WITH YOU,

357
