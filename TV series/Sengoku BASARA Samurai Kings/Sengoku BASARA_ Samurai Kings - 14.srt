1
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,250
- ( shouting )

2
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:41,125
- LONG TIME NO SEE,
SANADA YUKIMURA.

3
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,416
SO YOU DOING
ALL RIGHT THERE?

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,041
- ONE-EYED DRAGON,
DATE MASAMUNE.

5
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,625
I HAVE YEARNED FOR THIS
MOMENT THESE PAST YEARS.

6
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:52,291
NOW, WITH HONOR FIGHT ME!

7
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:56,125
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,
BUT DON'T HOLD ANYTHING BACK.

8
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,750
I WANNA HAVE SOME FUN
WITH THIS.

9
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,166
YEAH, LET'S GET IT ON!

10
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,875
BURN, MY SOUL.
BURN ABLAZE!

11
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,750
- OH, MAN.
ALL SIX SWORDS FROM THE START.

12
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,541
- CAN YOU BLAME HIM?  SANADA'S
MORE OF A BADASS THAN BEFORE.

13
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:39,333
- (  shouting )
- LISTEN UP, GUYS.

14
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,958
AS SOON AS BOSS MASAMUNE WINS,
WE CHARGE.

15
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,875
- All: YEAH!

16
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,916
- HERE AT KAWANAKAJIMA, MY LORD
TAKEDA AND LORD KENSHIN

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,666
WILL FINALLY HAVE
THEIR DECISIVE BATTLE.

18
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,291
I WILL NOT LET YOU INTERFERE!

19
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,166
- SORRY, BUT THE ONE-EYED
DRAGON OF OSHU'S

20
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,833
GONNA CONQUER THIS COUNTRY,

21
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,333
AND NO ONE'S GONNA STAND IN
MY WAY.  THIS PARTY'S CRASHED.

22
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,500
- ( grunting )
- ( screaming )

23
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,541
- ( laughs ) I'VE NOT FELT LIKE
THIS IN SOME TIME.

24
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,666
- NOR HAVE I.

25
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,208
- MAY THIS BATTLE FINALLY
ENRICH BOTH OUR HEARTS,

26
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,750
LORD KENSHIN.

27
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,375
- TIGER OF KAI,
I SHALL REGALE YOU

28
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,333
BY BRINGING ALL I HAVE TO BEAR

29
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,333
UNDER BISHAMONTEN'S
DIVINE GUIDANCE,

30
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,125
I SHALL TAKE YOU DOWN.

31
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,916
- PLEASE LET ME MAKE IT
THERE IN TIME.

32
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,416
I RESPECT YOUR AMBITION,
ONE-EYED DRAGON,

33
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,833
BUT YOU SHOULD WITHDRAW.
- HUH?

34
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,875
- I WISH NOTHING MORE THAN
TO SETTLE OUR RIVALRY,

35
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:35,250
BUT YOU SHOULD WAIT UNTIL
WE HAVE DEFEATED THE UESUGI,

36
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,000
SO WE MAY HONOR THE DATE
WITH THE CLEAN,

37
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,583
ONE-ON-ONE BATTLE
YOU HAVE EARNED.

38
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,250
- FUNNY YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED
A BIT, RED.

39
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,916
THE BEST TIME FOR A FIGHT'S
WHEN IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,333
SHOULD I HAVE SCHEDULED
AN APPOINTMENT?

41
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,083
IN THE TIME IT TAKES ME
TO STOMP YOU,

42
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,708
THE FIGHT BETWEEN OLD MAN TAKEDA
AND THE WAR GOD'LL BE DECIDED.

43
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,958
I WON'T EVEN HAVE TO INTRUDE.

44
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,208
WHICHEVER ONE OF THEM'S STILL
STANDING WILL FALL PREY

45
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,541
TO THE DRAGON.  SEE?

46
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:03,166
- YOUR WORDS TELL ME YOU
HAVE NOT CHANGED, EITHER.

47
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,666
YOU LEAVE ME LITTLE CHOICE.
- ( grunting )

48
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,083
- ( gasps )

49
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,791
- PHANTOM DIVE!
- ( screaming )

50
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,000
- LORD TAKEDA.
- MY LORD KENSHIN.

51
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,458
- WHAT IS THE MATTER, SASUKE?

52
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,791
- YES, KASUGA, WHAT IS IT?

53
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,375
- AN URGENT REPORT, MY LORD.
- ARMY FROM THE NORTHWEST.

54
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,458
LOT OF TROOPS.

55
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,250
- MY FIST CLENCHES

56
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:57,375
WITH THE FURY OF A VOLCANO.

57
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,333
SANADA YUKIMURA

58
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,250
WILL NEVER YIELD.

59
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,166
NEVER.

60
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,000
- IT'S A SHAME TO SEE HIM FALL,

61
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,583
BUT HE'S DONE.

62
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:12,166
- ( shouting )

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,875
- ( groaning )

64
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,541
- WARRIORS AT KAWANAKAJIMA,

65
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,541
HEAR OUR DECREE.

66
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,666
WE, THE TOYOTOMI ARMY,
HAVE NOW

67
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,041
COMPLETELY SURROUNDED
THIS BATTLEFIELD.

68
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:24,083
WE WILL ACCEPT YOUR IMMEDIATE
AND UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.

69
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,208
UNDER OUR TERMS, THE TOYOTOMI
WILL TREAT YOU FAIRLY,

70
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,458
AND WE WILL LEAVE YOU
WITH YOUR LIVELIHOODS.

71
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,750
- I'VE BEEN CARELESS.

72
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,500
- RELEASE BOWS!

73
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,041
- ( roars )

74
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,583
( roars )

75
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,833
I AM TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI.

76
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,833
PLEDGE YOUR FEALTY TO ME NOW

77
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,333
AND BECOME ONE UNDER MY COMMAND.

78
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,708
TOGETHER WE SHALL BRING
PROSPERITY

79
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,541
TO THE LAND AS MEN OF VALOR.

80
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,291
- GOTTA SAY, NEW GUY, YOU SURE
KNOW HOW TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE,

81
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,791
BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
JUST AIN'T GONNA FLY.

82
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,791
- DATE MASAMUNE.
WHAT A SURPRISE.

83
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,541
- Sanada:
LORD MASAMUNE.

84
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,958
- HOO-BOY!
WORKED YOU OVER PRETTY GOOD.

85
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,458
NOW THEN, HOW TO FIGHT
OUR WAY OUT OF HERE.

86
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,166
MASTER KATAKURA.

87
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,083
- SARUTOBI.

88
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,875
I NEED YOU TO RUN A MESSAGE.

89
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,458
OBEY ME.

90
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,083
THOSE WHO DO NOT
SHALL BE GRANTED NO MERCY.

91
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,625
- WHAT A RELIEF.  I THOUGHT YOU
WERE SCARED OF A REAL FIGHT.

92
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,500
I TELL YOU WHAT, CHIEF.
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT

93
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,833
IF YOU CAN PIERCE ONE
OF THIS DRAGON'S SCALES.

94
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,958
- YOU DO NOT KNOW
YOUR PLACE, WHELP.

95
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,333
SHALL I BE THE ONE
WHO SHOWS IT TO YOU?

96
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,125
- OH, PLEASE TRY.

97
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,458
BEEN TOO LONG SINCE I FACED
SOMEONE WHO TRULY MADE ME SICK.

98
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,541
- BOSS MASAMUNE.

99
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,791
- KOJURO, NO INTERFERENCE.

100
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,625
- Takenaka:
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON OF OSHU.

101
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,916
THE TIGER OF KAI,
THE WAR GOD OF ECHIGO.

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,208
COMMANDERS OF UNCOMMON QUALITY.

103
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,458
IT SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A WASTE

104
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,208
THAT WE WILL BE FORCED
TO CRUSH THEM.

105
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,958
- NO MATTER.  ALL WE DESIRE
OF THEM ARE THEIR TROOPS.

106
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,083
- DATE MASAMUNE,

107
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,625
THE BIG BOSS OF OSHU,
FULL SPEED AHEAD.

108
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,833
- WHAT DID I JUST TELL YOU?

109
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,458
- BOSS MASAMUNE,
THERE ARE TWO OF THEM.

110
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:53,250
PLEASE ALLOW YOUR RIGHT EYE
TO ENGAGE THE OTHER OPPONENT.

111
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:57,375
- ALL RIGHT, GUY IN THE COSPLAY
MASK IS ALL YOURS.

112
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,708
- ( screaming )

113
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,208
- WAR DANCE!

114
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,541
- SHATTER!

115
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:52,041
- BOSS MASAMUNE, LET US TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW.

116
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,833
- DO WHAT?

117
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,375
( shouts )
- ( horse whinnies )

118
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,000
- LET THEM RETREAT.

119
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,875
- Narrator: TURBULENT TIMES
ONCE AGAIN FELL UPON THE LAND

120
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,333
OF THE RISING SUN.

121
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,750
SEEKING TO CONQUER
THE FRACTURED COUNTRY,

122
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,625
WARRIORS RETURNED
TO THE BATTLEFIELD

123
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:01,375
WITH EVEN GREATER FERVOR
AND BARING EVEN SHARPER FANGS.

124
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,458
- NO, I'M TOO LATE.

125
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,041
YOU BASTARDS, I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HERE TO STOP THIS.

126
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,916
- HIDEYOSHI.

127
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,291
DAMN YOU.

128
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,208
- Narrator:
THE SENGOKU PERIOD,

129
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,375
A TIME OF CHAOS AND BLOODSHED.

130
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,250
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

131
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,958
- TOSHI, WHY WOULD YOU JOIN UP
WITH A MAN LIKE TOYOTOMI?

132
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,875
I GOT WIND OF IT IN KYOTO.

133
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,125
I WAS SURE YOU TWO WOULD BE
AT KAWANAKAJIMA,

134
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,416
SO I RUSHED THERE AS FAST
AS I COULD.

135
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,625
IF I'D FOUND YOU,

136
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,208
EITHER OF YOU,
AMONG THE DEAD THERE, I ...

137
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,875
- I AM IN AGREEMENT
WITH LORD HIDEYOSHI.

138
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,666
THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN
HAS GROWN VULNERABLE.

139
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,125
THANKS TO ODA NOBUNAGA,

140
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,166
AND THE DEEDS COMMITTED
IN THE NAME

141
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,166
OF HIS "WORLD UNDER
WARRIOR RULE."

142
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,750
WE WERE THERE.
WE LET IT ALL HAPPEN.

143
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,375
TOYOTOMI IS TRYING TO MAKE
THIS COUNTRY STRONG

144
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,208
AND PROSPEROUS AGAIN

145
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,083
INSTEAD OF ONE DOMAIN
FIGHTING ANOTHER,

146
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,958
HE WOULD HAVE US WORK TOGETHER
AS ONE, AS A NATION.

147
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,333
I'VE BEEN AWAITING
YOUR RETURN.

148
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,625
PLEASE, KEIJI,
WILL YOU HELP US?

149
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,333
YOU AND LORD HIDEYOSHI
ARE OLD ACQUAINTANCES.

150
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,833
CLOSE FRIENDS,
ARE YOU NOT?

151
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:12,208
- THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

152
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:16,208
I GUESS A PART OF ME KNEW
A DAY LIKE THIS MIGHT COME,

153
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,708
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED I WOULD
HEAR THESE WORDS COMING

154
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,208
FROM YOU, TOSHI.

155
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,333
AND, MATSU, YOU'RE OKAY
WITH ALL OF THIS?

156
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,708
WE ALL WANT THE COUNTRY
TO BE STRONG.

157
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,666
BUT DO HIDEYOSHI'S MEANS
JUSTIFY THAT END?

158
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,416
- WE COULD HAVE FOUND A WAY
TO MAINTAIN NEUTRALITY.

159
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,791
HOWEVER, MY LORD INUCHIYO
DID NOT CONSIDER IT

160
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,833
THE HONORABLE THING TO DO.

161
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,291
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'LL SUPPORT

162
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,416
WHATEVER DECISION TOSHI MAKES.

163
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,916
- I WILL, AS THE WIFE
OF ANY WARRIOR SHOULD.

164
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,250
- LORD HIDEYOSHI HAS
ALREADY LOST THE ONE HE LOVES,

165
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,000
BUT HIS GRIEF DOES
NOT RULE HIM.

166
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,666
IT FUELS HIS NOBLE AMBITION.

167
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,500
IF I WERE EVER TO--
IF MATSU EVER--

168
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,000
LORD HIDEYOSHI
IS ME IF I LOST MATSU.

169
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,750
- MY LORD INUCHIYO--

170
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,958
- KEIJI, PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

171
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,375
- YOU'RE LEAVING ALREADY?
WAIT.

172
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,375
AT LEAST HAVE
SUPPER BEFORE YOU GO.

173
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,083
I PREPARED ALL OF YOUR
FAVORITE DISHES FOR YOU.

174
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,958
- YEAH, I WISH I COULD,

175
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,250
BUT I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK,
OKAY?

176
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,208
- KEIJI.

177
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:33,625
- SO, TOSHI,
WHERE'S TOYOTOMI'S NEXT TARGET?

178
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:37,000
- KEIJI, DON'T.

179
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,708
- OF COURSE YOU CAN'T SAY.

180
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,541
TOYOTOMI HAS INITIATED

181
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,625
A KIND OF SECRET INVASION.

182
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,958
I'M SORRY, SIR.

183
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,208
I SHOULD HAVE FIGURED
IT OUT SOONER.

184
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,750
THEY'VE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY
EMBEDDING THEIR PEOPLE

185
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,583
IN EVERY ARMY FOR SOME TIME NOW.

186
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,958
- AND HE'S TAKEN UTSUNOMIYA
AND ODAWARA.

187
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,041
- YOUR LORDSHIP.
GIVEN THIS AFFRONT,

188
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,750
SURELY WE HAVE NO RECOURSE,
BUT TO ATTACK OSAKA.

189
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,750
THOUGH HE SURPRISED US
AT KAWANAKAJIMA,

190
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,458
WITH THE UNSTOPPABLE TAKEDA
CAVALRY AT OUR SIDE,

191
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,375
IF WE COULD ONLY FACE THEM
FULLY PREPARED,

192
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,833
THEN WE WOULD HAVE AN EXCELLENT
CHANCE OF WINNING--

193
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,291
- BUFFOON!
WE'VE LOST ALREADY.

194
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,750
THOSE LANDS WERE
UNDER OUR CARE.

195
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,666
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO KAI
IF LEFT UNATTENDED?

196
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,250
I'M CERTAIN YOU CAN IMAGINE.

197
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,916
- THAT IS THE REASON

198
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,708
WE MUST STRIKE NOW WHILE
HIS GUARD IS DOWN!

199
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,583
- PRECISELY WHAT TOYOTOMI WANTS.

200
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,208
FALL FOR THAT RUSE,
AND WE COURT OUR OWN DEMISE.

201
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,250
- THEN WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE US DO?

202
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,750
STAND IDLY BY AND WAIT
FOR TOYOTOMI TO INVADE US?

203
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,208
- YOU LACK PATIENCE.

204
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,916
YUKIMURA, I AM SYMPATHETIC
TO YOUR POSITION.

205
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,375
YOU WERE BESTED BY YOUR RIVAL
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON.

206
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,791
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR TOYOTOMI'S
UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL,

207
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,208
YOU WOULD HAVE SUFFERED UTTER
DEFEAT AT MASAMUNE'S HANDS,

208
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,333
WHICH MAKES IT DOUBLY
HUMILIATING, I'M SURE.

209
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,250
- YOUR LORDSHIP,
AS YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT,

210
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,958
I BEG FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.

211
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,500
MY DESIRE WAS MERELY
TO REDEEM MYSELF

212
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,291
AND DEMONSTRATE MY DEVOTION.

213
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,083
- YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR REDEMPTION
BY LEARNING TO SUPPRESS DESIRE.

214
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,458
ALL THE MORE SO, GIVEN YOUR
RECENT BRUSH WITH MORTALITY,

215
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,208
CAST YOUR SELF-DOUBT ASIDE AND
KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE FUTURE.

216
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,458
- I UNDERSTAND, YOUR LORDSHIP.

217
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,458
- SASUKE, WHAT NEWS
OF MOVEMENTS TO THE WEST?

218
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,458
- AN AGENT OF TOYOTOMI APPEARS

219
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,500
TO BE MAKING CONTACT
WITH MORI OF AKI.

220
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:37,625
- HMM, AN ALLIANCE?
- LOOKS LIKE.

221
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,041
DUE TO SHEER SIZE,
MORI'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN

222
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,041
HIS HOLDINGS IS A BIT TENUOUS.

223
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,875
OF COURSE, THE ALLIANCE WOULD
BE A HUGE LAND-GRAB FOR TOYOTOMI

224
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,500
AS FOR MORI, HE'D GAIN
THE MILITARY BACKING

225
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,708
FOR A MORE-THAN-DECISIVE
BATTLE WITH HIS RIVAL,

226
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,583
CHOSOKABE OF SHIKOKU.

227
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,125
- IF THAT'S THE CASE--

228
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,250
- I STILL BELIEVE OUR ONLY
CHOICE IS TO STORM OSAKA.

229
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,708
- YOU BUFFOON!

230
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,833
YOUR VIEW IS TOO NARROW, BOY.

231
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,166
BY THAT MERE FACT, YOU HAVE
ALREADY LOST TO TOYOTOMI.

232
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,250
- IF HE ADDS MORI'S HOLDINGS
TO HIS OWN,

233
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,250
HIS DOMAIN WILL ENCOMPASS

234
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,208
AN ENTIRE HALF OF THE LAND
OF THE RISING SUN.

235
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,958
- LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

236
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:25,333
WE NEED NOT LOSE OUR HEADS,
BECAUSE IT IS STILL ONLY HALF!

237
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,291
- ( screams )

238
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,000
- HAVE YOU TAKEN NOTHING
AWAY FROM YOUR RECENT DEFEAT?

239
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,958
WHEN YOU ARE SURROUNDED AND YOU
CANNOT FIGHT YOUR WAY OUT OF IT,

240
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,625
WHAT DO YOU DO?
- FIND A WAY TO ESCAPE?

241
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,625
- WE WILL MAKE OUR WAY WEST.

242
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,583
- WEST AS IN SETO, OR--

243
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,083
NO, YOU'RE SAYING WE'LL
GO EVEN FARTHER WEST?

244
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,875
- KYUSHU HAS YET TO FALL

245
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,000
INTO TOYOTOMI'S HANDS.

246
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,083
I HEAR WORD OF A FORCE THERE.

247
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,958
IN THE SOUTHERNMOST REGION
OF SATSUMA,

248
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,875
THEY ARE RESISTING HIS INVASION.
- SO THEN?

249
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,333
- YOU WILL TRAVEL TO SATSUMA
AS MY REPRESENTATIVE.

250
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:10,083
DEFEND THE LAND AND PEOPLE
AS THOUGH THEY ARE YOUR OWN.

251
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,000
AFTER WHICH, YOU WILL STRIKE AT
MORI AND TOYOTOMI FROM THE WEST.

252
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,750
- YES, IT'S BRILLIANT.

253
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,833
ALTHOUGH TOYOTOMI BELIEVES THAT
HE ALREADY HAS US SURROUNDED,

254
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,750
INSTEAD WE WILL TURN THE TABLES
AROUND AND SURROUND HIM.

255
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,750
- I WILL NOT LEAVE KAI UNTIL
I HEAR OF YOUR SUCCESS.

256
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,708
ALL WILL DEPEND UPON YOUR
PERFORMANCE, YOUNG CUB.

257
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,541
- YES, YOUR LORDSHIP.

258
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,041
ON MY HONOR, I, SANADA GENJIRO
YUKIMURA, WILL NOT FAIL YOU.

259
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,083
- AND REMEMBER, BOY,
IN THIS MATTER,

260
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,000
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.
- YES, YOUR LORDSHIP.

261
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,541
I UNDERSTAND.
- YUKIMURA!

262
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:45,333
- YOUR LORDSHIP!
- YUKIMURA!

263
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,958
- YOUR LORDSHIP!
- YUKIMURA!

264
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,541
- YOUR LORDSHIP!
- YUKIMURA!

265
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,666
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HE LET
UTSUNOMIYA AND ODAWARA FALL.

266
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,333
WHAT THE HELL WAS OLD
MAN TAKEDA DOING?

267
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,375
- IT APPEARS SEVERAL HOLDINGS
NOT UNDER THE TIGER OF KAI'S

268
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:05,083
DIRECT SUPERVISION WERE ATTACKED
SIMULTANEOUSLY BY DOUBLE AGENTS.

269
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,291
AND WE'VE JUST RECEIVED WORD
THAT MORI MOTONARI OF AKI

270
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,708
IS NEARING AN ALLIANCE
WITH TOYOTOMI.

271
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,541
- ( murmuring )
- HOWEVER,

272
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,250
WE HAVE A MORE IMMEDIATE
PROBLEM IN FRONT OF US.

273
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,375
THE NEIGHBORING LANDS WE'VE
CONQUERED HAVE NOW BEGUN

274
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,416
TO SHOW SIGNS OF UNREST.

275
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,791
- Date:
MEANING THIS "SECRET INVASION"

276
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,708
IS PROBABLY UNDERWAY
IN OSHU NOW, TOO.

277
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,708
- INDEED, WHILE I APPRECIATE
YOUR DESIRE TO MARCH

278
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,500
ON OSAKA IMMEDIATELY,

279
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:33,791
WE WILL FAIL IF THEY STRIKE
OUR HOME WHILE WE ARE AWAY.

280
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,583
THE PRIORITY IS DISCOVERING
WHAT THESE LANDS ARE UP TO.

281
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,958
WE MUST BE PREPARED TO CONQUER
THEM ALL OVER AGAIN.

282
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,625
- BASICALLY, A WHOLE LOAD
OF TROUBLE WE DON'T NEED

283
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,958
IS COMING THIS WAY.

284
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,250
- MOST LIKELY IT
HAS ALREADY ARRIVED.

285
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,791
TOYOTOMI WAS AWARE NOT ONLY OF
TAKEDA'S AND UESUGI'S MOVEMENTS,

286
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,375
BUT ALSO OF OUR PLANS TO ONCE
AGAIN INTERRUPT THEIR BATTLE

287
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,208
AT KAWANAKAJIMA.

288
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,000
INFORMATION THAT
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAD

289
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,000
WITHOUT BEING PRESENT
AT OUR WAR COUNCIL.

290
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,750
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME FOR?

291
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,250
- OH!
NO TRAITORS OVER HERE.

292
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,750
- TOYOTOMI'S PLAN WAS TO GET US
ALL UNDER HIS THUMB

293
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,625
AT KAWANAKAJIMA.

294
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,875
THINK THE BASTARD'S JOB WAS
JUST TO MAKE SURE WE GOT

295
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,458
WHERE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO?

296
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:19,041
- NO, TAKENAKA HANBEI IS
MORE SHREWD THAN THAT.

297
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,416
HE WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED
THE CHANCE OF FAILURE.

298
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,958
I BELIEVE IT'S LIKELY THEY WOULD
HAVE KEPT THEIR MOLE IN PLACE.

299
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,333
- IN THAT CASE,
DO WE SMOKE HIM OUT?

300
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:31,541
- I AM A BIT RELUCTANT
TO INTERROGATE OUR OWN PEOPLE.

301
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,333
BUT WE CAN START
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

302
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,458
- GUESS WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

303
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,250
- NO ONE HAS FLED UNDER
THE COVER OF DARKNESS.

304
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,083
WERE OUR SUSPICIONS GROUNDLESS?

305
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,916
OR IS THE SNAKE PREPARED
FOR THE WORST?

306
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:00,375
- Takenaka: WHAT AN UNCOMMONLY
GENTLE EXPRESSION.

307
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,291
DATE'S TRUSTED STRATEGIST,

308
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,916
WHO BROKE THROUGH
OUR PERFECT ENCIRCLEMENT,

309
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,166
WHO, WHEN CORNERED LIKE RATS,
CREATED AN ESCAPE ROUTE

310
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,375
BRILLIANTLY ORCHESTRATING
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS.

311
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,916
IS THIS THE TRUE FACE
OF THE RIGHT EYE OF THE DRAGON?

312
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,583
- ( gasps )
TAKENAKA HANBEI.

313
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:21,000
- WHENEVER YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO BE HOME,

314
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:24,291
THIS IS WHERE YOU COME EVERY
EVENING BEFORE TAKING TO BED.

315
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,250
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

316
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,291
I HAVE A GENERAL IDEA
OF YOUR ROUTINE.

317
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,583
MASAMUNE'S AS WELL,
THANKS TO HIM.

318
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,541
- MASTER KATAKURA.

319
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,375
- DAMN YOU!

320
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,791
TAKENAKA, YOU BASTARD!

321
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,833
- MY DEAR KATAKURA,
LET US MAKE A DEAL.

322
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,333
IT'S SIMPLE.

323
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:54,125
I WANT YOU TO JOIN
THE TOYOTOMI ARMY.

324
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,125
- WHAT?

325
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,125
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

326
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,250
- Takenaka: IT SEEMS THE TIME
HAS COME TO SAY FAREWELL.

327
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,875
PLEASE, DO JOIN US AGAIN
FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER,

328
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:46,250
AND YOU, TOO, SHALL KNEEL BEFORE
THE MIGHT OF TOYOTOMI.
