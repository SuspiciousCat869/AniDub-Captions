1
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,166
- SORRY, FELLAS.
I THINK WE'RE, UH--

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,625
OH, YOU AIN'T
GOING TO LIKE THIS.

3
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,166
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BORROW
YOUR HORSES FOR A BIT.

4
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,833
- Samanosuke:
WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?

5
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,375
THIS GUY IS NUTS.

6
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,916
- SO A BUNCH OF BANDITS
WANT TO HORSEJACK MY ARMY?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,500
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DEALING WITH?

8
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,375
- SEE THAT?  YOU'RE JUMPING
TO ALL SORTS OF CONCLUSIONS.

9
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,416
NO BANDITS HERE, WE'RE PIRATES.
WELL, MINUS A SHIP.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,625
THE WRECKAGE OF MY LATE FORTRESS
DRIFTED ASHORE.

11
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,125
ANYWAY, YOUR HORSES WILL BE
SERVING THE GREATER GOOD.

12
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,625
- YEAH, I THINK I'M
GOING TO PASS.

13
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,083
AND FYI,

14
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,500
YOU KIND OF SUCK
AT ASKING FOR FAVORS.

15
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,666
YOU CRACK ME UP, YOU KNOW THAT?

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,000
HERE YOU ARE,
ON TOP OF A DAMN MOUNTAIN,

17
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,833
OCEAN NOWHERE IN SIGHT,
CALLING YOURSELF A PIRATE.

18
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,500
AND THAT ANCHOR-LOOKING THING
JUST SCREAMS SUBTLETY.

19
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,333
YOU'RE MY KIND OF CRAZY.

20
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,208
- ( theme music plays )

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,458
- HEY, FOUR-EYES,
WANT SOME ADVICE?

22
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,458
HAND OVER THOSE HORSES
WITHOUT A FIGHT!

23
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,458
- CAPTAIN CHOSOKABE
AIN'T MESSING AROUND.

24
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,250
SO HAND THEM OVER
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.

25
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,916
- WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,791
- PRETTY COCKY FOR NOT
HAVING A SHIP, AIN'T YOU?

27
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,791
- YOUR CAPTAIN COULD
NEVER BEAT THE BIG BOSS.

28
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,583
NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN, DIG?
NO WAY.

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,750
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY ARE AS PIRATES,

30
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,166
BUT THEY TALK SOME GOOD TRASH.

31
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,416
- DAMN STRAIGHT.
YOUR SONS-OF-BITCHES

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,083
GOT SOME BALLAST
BELOW DECK, TOO.

33
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,750
- WANT TO PLAY,
CAPTAIN LAVENDER?  LET'S PLAY.

34
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,083
BUT DON'T GO PULLING
ANY CHUMP MOVES, ALRIGHT?

35
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,791
- WORKS FOR ME.

36
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,708
WHEN YOU'RE AS GOOD AS I AM,
WHO NEEDS TO CHEAT?

37
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,208
- ( squawks )

38
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,208
- BRING IT ON!

39
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,833
- Bunshichi:
ATTA BOY, BIG BOSS!

40
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,083
- Magobei:
HIT HIM ON THE UPSWING!

41
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,083
Samanosuke:
YOU CAN BEAT THIS POSER

42
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,083
WITH A SINGLE BLOW!

43
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,375
- BIG BOSS KICKS ASS!

44
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,083
NO WAY HE'S LOSING TO THIS GUY.

45
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,208
- Chosokabe's Army:
GO, CAPTAIN!

46
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,125
GO, CAPTAIN!

47
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,083
GO, CAPTAIN!

48
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,458
- ( chanting continues )

49
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:02,458
- BIG BOSS!  BIG BOSS!
BIG BOSS!

50
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,583
- ( together )
BIG BOSS! BIG BOSS!

51
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,583
- GO, CAPTAIN!

52
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,333
- BIG BOSS!

53
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,250
- COCKY BASTARD.

54
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,000
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

55
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,000
DEATH FANG!

56
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,125
CRAZY STORM!

57
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,291
- YOU WANT CRAZY, HUH?

58
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,791
- ( footsteps )

59
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,250
- Matsunaga:
AS I LIVE AND BREATHE,

60
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,625
THE RIGHT EYE OF THE DRAGON.
- MATSUNAGA!

61
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,416
- TURNS OUT THE NETHERWORLD

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,875
HAS LITTLE IN THE WAY
OF TREASURE FOR ME TO COVET.

63
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,458
SO I TOOK MY LEAVE.

64
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,208
HUNTING BAUBLES AMONG THE LIVING

65
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,583
HAS PROVEN FAR MORE REWARDING.

66
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,375
- YOU'VE MADE YOUR RETURN
FROM THE LAND OF THE DEAD.

67
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,541
IF ANY COULD, IT'D BE YOU.

68
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,500
- YOU FLATTER AN OLD MAN.

69
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:28,041
WHAT SEPARATES LIFE AND DEATH,
BUT A MOMENT OR A BIT OF STEEL?

70
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,666
- SO, YOU'VE SET YOUR SIGHTS
ON SOMETHING OF TOYOTOMI'S?

71
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,875
- AND I'LL TAKE IT
WITHOUT THIEVERY.

72
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,083
TOYOTOMI'S STRATEGIST
HAS GIVEN ME A TASK.

73
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,958
TO WIT, THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE DATE ARMY.

74
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,625
WHAT TREASURE I TAKE
IS FOR A JOB WELL DONE.

75
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,375
THAT INSOUCIANT MASTER
OF YOURS LIVES.

76
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,500
THOUGH I TRUST
THIS IS NO SURPRISE.

77
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,250
WHAT BETTER BAIT, THEN,

78
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:54,166
TO LURE IN THE DRAGON
THAN ITS OWN RIGHT EYE?

79
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,958
- WHY BOTHER ASSIGNING
THIS TO YOU?

80
00:05:56,041 --> 00:06:01,583
- TOYOTOMI AND HIS THIRST
FOR CONQUEST MEAN NOTHING TO ME.

81
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,958
NOTHING ENDURES, NOT EVEN STEEL.

82
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,833
I ACCEPTED HIS OFFER, THINKING
IT WOULD BE A FINE CHANCE

83
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,583
FOR ME TO TAKE
DATE'S SIX DRAGON SWORDS.

84
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,708
BUT ALAS, ONLY FIVE REMAIN.

85
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,791
BUT ITEMS CAN ACHIEVE WORTH
IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.

86
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,458
THAT WHICH MAKES ONE UGLY,
MAKES ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL.

87
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,000
TAKE THIS BLADE--
SCARRED, BROKEN,

88
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,958
A SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF.

89
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,291
HAVING SURVIVED JUST BARELY,
NOW IT IS PRICELESS.

90
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,125
I WONDER IF THE ONE-EYED DRAGON
FEELS THE SAME

91
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,458
ABOUT THAT WHICH HE HOLDS DEAR.

92
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,916
HOW THE TEARS MIGHT
BEDEW HIS CHEEK

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,250
IF DATE WERE TO FIND
HIS RIGHT EYE ALL BUT DEAD.

94
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,541
A MAN LACKING IN SCRUPLES
COULD DISPATCH HIM RATHER EASILY

95
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,666
IN SUCH A MOMENT, NO?

96
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,416
- YOU FIEND.

97
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,250
- TOYOTOMI'S LIEUTENANT
HAS PLACED

98
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,916
BUT ONE RESTRICTION ON ME--
HE FORBADE ME TO KILL YOU.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,583
IN OTHER WORDS--

100
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,541
- MATSUNAGA!

101
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,708
- SO LONG AS I DON'T KILL YOU,

102
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,250
I HAVE CARTE BLANCHE TO BEAT
YOU WITHIN AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE.

103
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,041
THIS WILL BE FUN.

104
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,291
- WHOA, CHECK IT OUT.

105
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,583
THAT GUY IN THE BLUE--
HE'S ONE STRONG BASTARD.

106
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,333
- HE'S AS GOOD AS BIG BOSS.

107
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,000
- THIS IS NO ORDINARY PIRATE
WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

108
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,166
- Date: I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO GET A WORKOUT TONIGHT.

109
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,041
THIS IS A NICE WARM-UP
FOR THE BEATDOWBEAT DOWN

110
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,041
I PLAN TO PUT
ON TOYOTOMI LATER.

111
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,458
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST THE LEADER

112
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,125
OF A SECOND-RATE BAND
OF HOOLIGANS.

113
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,166
BUT YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

114
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,583
- CRAZY, AIN'T IT?

115
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,291
BUT DON'T GET SWEET ON ME.

116
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,125
WHEN THESE BEAUTS COME OUT,

117
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,875
IT MEANS THERE'S NO SECOND DATE.

118
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,166
YOU SEE?

119
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,166
- RIGHT BACK AT YOU,
LITTLE BOY BLUE.

120
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,000
'CAUSE WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU,
THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING LEFT.

121
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,125
- ALRIGHT THEN, LET'S DANCE!

122
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,166
- WELL, ANCHORS AWAY!

123
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,583
RAMMING SPEED!

124
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,500
PHANTOM DIVE!

125
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,958
- THOSE SIX SWORDS
AND THAT CRESCENT MOON HELMET...

126
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,625
- WAIT, IS THAT GUY--
COULDN'T BE!

127
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,708
- HE'S STRONG AS AN OX

128
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,458
AND THE WAY HE HANDLES
THAT ANCHOR!

129
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,250
- NO WAY, YOU THINK
THAT DUDE IS-- ?

130
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,541
- YOU KIND OF ROCK.

131
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,666
WELL, FOR A GUY WHO CAN'T
FIGURE OUT A JACKET.

132
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,125
- THIS FROM THE MAN
WHO PUT HANDLEBARS

133
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,208
AND CHROME PIPING
ON THE SIDE OF HIS HORSE!

134
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,041
- THE ONE-EYED DRAGON!
- THE OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA!

135
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,916
- SO WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT HERE?

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,375
YOU GUYS HITCH-HIKING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR SOMETHING?

137
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,291
- YEAH, OR SOMETHING.

138
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,875
TO TELL YOU TRUE, THE CREW
AND I ARE IN A BAD SPOT.

139
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,500
I'M OUT TO AVENGE
MY BEAUTIFUL FUGAKU

140
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,041
FOR THE OUTRAGE
THEY'VE DONE TO HER.

141
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:34,166
AND RESCUE THOSE SONS-OF-BITCHES
WHAT GOT CAPTURED.

142
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,000
OUR DESTINATIONS
ARE ONE AND THE SAME-- OSAKA!

143
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,166
- Akagawa: THE TECHNOLOGY
CHOSOKABE HAD AT HIS DISPOSAL

144
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,125
IS REMARKABLE, MILORD.
UNRIVALED, IF I MAY BE SO BOLD.

145
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,250
THIS FUGAKU,
IS THE CULMINATION OF ALL OF IT.

146
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,166
- WHY DO YOU SQUAWK "FUGAKU"
LIKE A MINDLESS BIRD?

147
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,166
IT BELONGS TO THE MORI NOW,
THE OLD NAME IS DEAD.

148
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,166
- RIGHT, SO THEN WHAT IS--

149
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,125
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

150
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,916
I SAID IT BELONGS
TO ME NOW, FOOL.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,041
- ITS NEW NAME IS THE SUN?

152
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,166
- WHAT OTHER NAME
COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE?

153
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,208
- FORGIVE MY IGNORANCE, MILORD.

154
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,458
- MAKE THESE WRETCHES
WORK FASTER.

155
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,000
IT MUST BE COMPLETED
ON SCHEDULE.

156
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,375
DENY THEM SLEEP
UNTIL THE TASK IS DONE.

157
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,791
- MILORD--

158
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,500
- I WILL BE DEPARTING AKI
FOR A TIME.

159
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:34,125
- RIGHT, AND I SHALL ATTEND
TO MATTERS WHILE YOU ARE AWAY.

160
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:39,458
- THIS TOO IS PART OF MY PLAN
TO DECEIVE THE TOYOTOMI.

161
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,625
MY CALCULATIONS
ARE ALL-ENCOMPASSING.

162
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,000
- Miyamoto:
PAY ATTENTION!

163
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,541
- ( thump )

164
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:52,250
- Sanada:
NOT AGAIN!

165
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,541
I WAS CARELESS, WHY DO I KEEP
GETTING LOST IN MY THOUGHTS?

166
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,541
WHEN I NEED TO BE ON MY TOES?

167
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,333
- HEY, OSTRICH HEAD,

168
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,208
YOU WANT TO DO THIS OR NOT?

169
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,500
I MEAN, I'M TAKING TIME
OUT OF MY BUSY SCHEDULE HERE

170
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,083
TO SPAR WITH YOU, MAN.

171
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,500
- MASTER MUSASHI,
PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES.

172
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,500
IF YOU'RE GAME, I WOULD
LIKE TO CONTINUE.

173
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,083
I'M AWFUL, IF I DON'T
SNAP OUT OF IT

174
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,708
I CAN FORGET ABOUT MY REMATCH.

175
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,125
IT WOULD SHAME ME
TO FACE MASAMUNE LIKE THIS.

176
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,166
- Sanada:
TELL ME, YOUR LORDSHIP,

177
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,791
WHY DO MY ARMS HANG
AT MY SIDES LIKE LEAD?

178
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,916
WHY DO I WIELD
MY PRECIOUS SPEARS

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,916
AS THOUGH THEY INTRUDE
UPON MY HANDS?

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,708
YOUR LORDSHIP, WHY HAVE YOU
TURNED AWAY FROM ME?

181
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,083
FAVOR ME WITH YOUR WISDOM,
I BEG OF YOU!

182
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,333
GIVE ME GUIDANCE!
YOUR LORDSHIP!

183
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,000
- WHO IS THIS MASAMUNE GUY?

184
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,833
- HUH?
- LIKE, WHAT KIND OF GUY IS HE?

185
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,291
HE'S STRONG, YEAH?

186
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,416
- WELL, YES,
OF COURSE HE'S STRONG.

187
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,208
HE'S ONE OF THE STRONGEST.

188
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,583
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON,
LORD DATE MASAMUNE OF OSHU.

189
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,583
HE'S MASTERED
THE SIX SWORD TECHNIQUE,

190
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,708
AND HE'S A MOST EARNEST
OF GENERALS.

191
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,041
EVEN THOUGH HE IS STILL YOUNG.

192
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,250
- SIX SWORDS?  HOLY CRAP!

193
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,000
THIS MASAMUNE SOUNDS
LIKE A BADASS.

194
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,500
IF THAT'S HOW IT IS,
I'D BETTER START PRACTICING

195
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,625
WITH SEVEN OF THEM.

196
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,791
SCREW THAT, I'M GOING EIGHT!

197
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,916
- MY CLAN RECEIVED WORD
THAT HE FOUGHT TOYOTOMI.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,500
THERE WAS NO NEWS OF HIS FATE.

199
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,500
PERHAPS SASUKE HAS
ALREADY BEEN TOLD BY HIS NINJA

200
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,541
THAT LORD MASAMUNE
IS SAFE AND SOUND.

201
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,625
I'M SURE HE IS FINE,
HE HAS TO BE.

202
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,125
HE'S PROBABLY MARCHING
ON OSAKA THIS VERY MOMENT.

203
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,791
COME, GOOD MUSASHI.
LET'S DO IT AGAIN!

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,375
- OH, SNAP. YOU'RE AWESOME
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING.

205
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:41,166
- THINKING OF LORD MASAMUNE
JUST NOW HAS BOLSTERED MY SOUL

206
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,166
WITH A NEWFOUND RESOLVE!

207
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,208
- DREAMING ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND

208
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,666
WON'T DEFLECT A ROCK
TO THE HEAD!

209
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,708
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

210
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,666
THROWING ROCKS IS DANGEROUS,
NOT TO MENTION UNSPORTSMANLIKE!

211
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,875
FINE, YOU BIG BABY.
NO MORE ROCKS.

212
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,333
HOW ABOUT SAND?!

213
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,125
- WAIT!

214
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,166
 KICKING SAND IN MY FACE
IS UNGENTLEMANLY!

215
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,541
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!

216
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,750
- ( screams )

217
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,875
- AND YOU DUG A PIT, HOW CLEVER.

218
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,500
CAN WE GO BACK
TO YOU THROWING THE ROCKS?!

219
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,958
- NEVER SEEN A TIGER CUB
FLY BEFORE.

220
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,416
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL, POPS?!

221
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,875
YOU'RE BOOZING IT UP AGAIN?

222
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,125
- ( laughing )
I TOLD YOU, IT'S WATER.

223
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,458
- LORD SHIMAZU!

224
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,541
- WHAT'S ALL THE SQUAWKING FOR?

225
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:38,458
- ENEMY SOLDIERS, SIR!
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!

226
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:43,166
- Miyamoto:
IS IT THAT PUNK-ASS TOYOTOMI?

227
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,625
- RECKON WE KNEW
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

228
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,916
- GET YOUR GAME FACES ON.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,166
WE'LL BE IN OSAKA
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

230
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,708
AND THEN WE'RE
GOING TO KICK SOME ASS!

231
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,041
- ( cheering )

232
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,791
- LET'S RESCUE OUR MAIDS

233
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,458
AND PAY THAT GORILLA BACK
FOR WHAT HE DID TO THE FUGAKU!

234
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,000
WELL, DOGS, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

235
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,375
- AYE-AYE!

236
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,208
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

237
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,916
YOU KNOW, I HEARD THAT SHIP
OF YOURS WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD.

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,208
BUT BUSTING HEADS
LANDLUBBER STYLE

239
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,000
MIGHT BE A NICE CHANGE OF PACE.

240
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,958
- TRUE ENOUGH,
THE OLD GIRL NEVER WAS

241
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,000
MUCH GOOD FOR A SNEAK ATTACK.

242
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,583
THIS IS A FINE BREEZE,

243
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,875
EVEN IF IT DON'T SMELL
OF THE SEA.

244
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,791
THAT SLIPPERY WHORE'S SON, MORI.

245
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,833
STRIKING TOYOTOMI'S COLORS
LIKE HE DID.

246
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,166
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
HE SHOULD HAVE HAD STONES ENOUGH

247
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,166
TO SETTLE OUR FEUD
BY HIS LONESOME.

248
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,583
WAS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?
- HUH?

249
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,208
- OH, BEG YOUR PARDON.

250
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,541
THERE WAS A DUEL I WAS
PARTICULAR KEEN ON HAVING

251
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,666
BEFORE I CONQUERED
THE COUNTRY, SEE.

252
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,583
BUT NOW IT'S LOOKING LIKE
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED FOR GOOD.

253
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,250
IT'S A DARK DAY FOR PIRACY
WHEN A SCOUNDREL SUCH AS ME

254
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,000
CAN'T LAND A WORTHY RIVAL.

255
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,791
DID I HAPPEN TO STRIKE
A NERVE, DRAGON MAN?

256
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,166
YOU'VE GOT THAT LOOK
LIKE YOU WERE REMINDED

257
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,375
OF SOMEONE JUST NOW.

258
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,958
- HUH?

259
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,916
THERE'S THIS ONE GUY I FOUGHT
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,708
MAN, WHAT A BOY SCOUT.

261
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,416
DON'T KNOW IF I'LL
EVER SEE HIM AGAIN, THOUGH.

262
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,833
HE'S NAIVE, LIKE, REALLY NAIVE.

263
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,666
GOING TO GET SOMEBODY KILLED.

264
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,625
PROBABLY HIMSELF, TOO.

265
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,125
- OH, YEAH?  SOUNDS TO ME
AS THOUGH YOU ADMIRE HIM

266
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,041
ALL THE MORE FOR IT.

267
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,750
- YEAH?

268
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,750
THE DUDE'S GOT MOXIE.

269
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,250
I KID YOU NOT,
HE'S SOMETHING ELSE, THIS GUY.

270
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,041
I MEAN, HE WIELDS HIS SPEARS
WITH SUCH FURY AND PASSION

271
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,333
I LOSE MY COOL EVERY TIME.

272
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,375
IT'S LIKE FIGHTING IN A BONFIRE.

273
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,458
- YOU DON'T SAY?

274
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,458
HOPE I GET TO SEE
THAT SPEARWORK OF HIS

275
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:47,291
FOR MYSELF ONE OF THESE DAYS.

276
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,375
- SANADA YUKIMURA,
HOW'S YOUR PLAN GOING?

277
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,791
- Shimazu:
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED, NO DOUBT.

278
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,291
BUT WE KNOW THE LAY OF THE LAND
AROUND HERE.

279
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,583
THEY WON'T BE TRYING
ANYTHING AT NIGHT.

280
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,625
YOU, MY BOY, ARE GOING
TO LURE THOSE BASTARDS IN.

281
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,458
- LEAVE IT ME, POPS!

282
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,125
- AND TIGER CUB,
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU AS WELL.

283
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,041
DRAW THEM IN NICE AND CLOSE
WHEN YOU TURN TAIL AND RUN.

284
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,291
- SIR!

285
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:28,083
- I'LL DO MY BEST, MILORD.

286
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,083
- Narrator:
WHAT SHIMAZU YOSHIHIRO

287
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,583
AND SANADA YUKIMURA
DID NOT YET KNOW

288
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:36,875
WAS THAT FAR TO THE REAR
OF TOYOTOMI'S ARMY,

289
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,666
MORI MOTONARI'S FORCES
WERE POISED

290
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,583
AND READY TO SWOOP IN
AS REINFORCEMENTS.

291
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,875
- WHAT NEWS
OF OUR NAVAL DEPLOYMENT?

292
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,791
- Soldier:
MILORD, WE'VE REASON TO BELIEVE

293
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,750
THEY'LL ARRIVE
AT THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF SATSUMA

294
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,291
AROUND THE SAME TIME AS US.

295
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,666
- SATSUMA'S DEFENDERS
ARE NOTHING.

296
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,541
A PATCHWORK ARMY AT BEST.

297
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,000
IT MATTERS NOT WHO LEADS THEM,

298
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,583
MY PLAN WILL LEAVE THEM
BEGGING FOR MERCY.

299
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,333
A BOON I SHALL DENY THEM.

300
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,500
- Takenaka:
WE HAVE ARRANGED FOR MOTONARI

301
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,958
TO ATTACK THE SOUTHERN TIP
OF THE COUNTRY, MILORD.

302
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:10,333
- MORI VENTURING OUTSIDE OF AKI
IS A RARE EVENT INDEED.

303
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,166
EASIER FOR HIM TO BETRAY US

304
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,583
WHILE PLAYING THE PART
OF THE FAITHFUL ALLY.

305
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,000
- Takenaka:
AS SOON AS WE CRUSHED CHOSOKABE,

306
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,708
DEAR MOTONARI LOST NO TIME

307
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,958
IN ABDUCTING THE ENGINEERS
WHO'D BUILT THE FUGAKU

308
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,958
AND BROUGHT THEM TO AKI.

309
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,625
MAKING SURE BOTH LAND
AND SEA ROUTES

310
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,166
WERE HEAVILY GUARDED,
HE MOBILIZED HIS ENTIRE NAVY.

311
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,708
TURNING EVERY REMNANT
OF HIS FOE'S TECHNOLOGY

312
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,958
TO THE TASK OF SALVAGING
THE FUKAGU'S REMAINS.

313
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,875
WIN OR LOSE
ON THE BEACHES OF SATSUMA,

314
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,916
MOTONARI LIKELY INTENDS
TO ATTACK US IN OSAKA.

315
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,583
AS SOON AS THE FORTRESS
HAS BEEN RESURRECTED.

316
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,541
- THAT, MILORD, IS WHEN WE
SHALL SEIZE IT FROM HIM.

317
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,125
- Toyotomi:
SO THE SAFETY OF HIS OWN DOMAIN

318
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,541
WAS NEVER MORI'S ONLY OBJECTIVE.

319
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,541
- Takenaka: HE'S STILL
AN ISOLATIONIST AT HEART.

320
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,791
BUT HE'S CLEVER ENOUGH TO SEE
WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING.

321
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,916
PREDICTING THAT OUR CONQUEST
WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM,

322
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,708
NOW HE'S RESOLVED TO CONQUER
THE COUNTRY HIMSELF.

323
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,458
- HE SEEKS TO UNITE
THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN?

324
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,125
HE'S A FOOL, SUCH GOALS
ARE BEYOND HIM.

325
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,500
- HOW TRUE.

326
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,958
NOW, AS TO
THE FINISHING TOUCHES--

327
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,375
- YES, WE WILL MOVE
OUR BASE OF OPERATIONS

328
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,583
TO ODIWARA AND UNIFY THE EAST.

329
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,166
- WE HAVEN'T YET ASCERTAINED

330
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,083
WHO'S LEADING THAT ARMY
AT THE SOUTHERN TIP.

331
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,000
OUR INTELLIGENCE
HAS BEEN LACKING.

332
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,916
BUT GIVEN THAT TAKEDA MEN
WERE SEEN GALLOPING SOUTHWEST,

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,416
LORD SHINGEN SEEMS
READY TO STAND WITH SATSUMA

334
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,458
AND HELP THEM REPEL ANY ATTACK
WE MIGHT MOUNT AGAINST THEM.

335
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,916
THE TIGER OF KAI
DOESN'T DEAL IN HALF MEASURES.

336
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,458
WE IGNORE THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THIS AT OUR OWN PERIL.

337
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,708
WE MUSTN'T BE PUT
ON THE DEFENSIVE.

338
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,375
- IN TIME, WE WILL TAKE
MORI'S FORTRESS

339
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,250
AND USE IT TO BEND
THE ENTIRE WORLD TO OUR WILL.

340
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,000
BUT FOR NOW, THE THREAT OF IT
WILL DEFEND OSAKA IN MY ABSENCE.

341
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,375
THE EAST WILL NOT
DARE RISE AGAINST ME.

342
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,708
OUR PREPARATIONS IN THE NORTH

343
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,916
AND TO THE NORTHERN SIDE
OF KYUSHU ARE COMPLETE.

344
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,083
- I'LL TAKE COMMAND
OF THE FORTRESS, LORD.

345
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:03,333
LEAD OUR MEN INTO BATTLE KNOWING
THAT ALL IS AS IT SHOULD BE.

346
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,083
- I CAN ALWAYS DEPEND
ON YOU, HANBEI.

347
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,208
MANY THANKS.

348
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,291
- Takenaka:
I'M SORRY, HIDEYOSHI.

349
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,041
THIS HAS TAKEN LONGER
THAN I HAD THOUGHT.

350
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:20,125
SOON WE WILL TRIUMPH,
AND THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN

351
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,958
WILL SIT CONQUERED
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.

352
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,916
- ( grunting )

353
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,458
DAMN YOU, TIME.

354
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:32,875
YOU'RE THE ONE FOE
I CAN'T SEEM TO OUTWIT.

355
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,458
- HIDEYOSHI...

356
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,416
- HEY, MAEDA KEIJI, WAKE UP.

357
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,458
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

358
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,500
- I'VE COME WITH A MESSAGE
FROM MY LORD KENSHIN.

359
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,458
TRY AS YOU MIGHT
TO STAY NEUTRAL,

360
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,750
TOYOTOMI WILL BE
YOUR FOE ONE DAY.

361
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,625
MAKE OF THIS MESSAGE
WHAT YOU WILL

362
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,833
AND DEAL WITH THIS DILEMMA
HOWEVER YOU BEST SEE FIT.

363
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,041
BISHAMONTEN IS A GOD OF BATTLE,

364
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,291
BUT HIS DIVINE PROTECTION
REACHES FAR BEYOND

365
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,250
THOSE WHO RUSH EAGERLY
INTO CONFLICT.

366
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,250
- TELL HIM, "THANKS."

367
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,916
- YOUR UNCLE TOSHIIE
HAS LEFT FOR BATTLE.

368
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,583
- HUH?!

369
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,250
- IT SEEMS HE WANTS TO AID
IN THE DEFENSE OF ECHIGO.

370
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,125
- BUT WHY? 
IF HE DOES THAT--

371
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,000
- I GUESS HE COULDN'T BEAR
TO SIT BACK

372
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,041
AND DO NOTHING AT ALL.

373
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,125
- I CAN'T LET HIM.

374
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,166
TOSHIIE'S STILL HURT
FROM BEFORE,

375
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,791
HE'LL GET HIMSELF KILLED!

376
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,291
- MY LORD KENSHIN HAS
NO INTENTION OF WAGING WAR.

377
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,583
HE'S MOVING TROOPS
AS A DIVERSION.

378
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,208
WITH ANY LUCK, IT'LL GIVE TAKEDA
A CHANCE TO TAKE BACK ODIWARA.

379
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,291
- BUT STILL--

380
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,583
- HURRY, MAEDA KEIJI,
TIME IS SHORT!

381
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,291
I'LL TELL YOU WHEN TOYOTOMI

382
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,583
VENTURES FORTH.

383
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,166
THIS HAS TO BE PAINFUL
FOR YOU, I KNOW.

384
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,083
BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DO IT.

385
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,125
- KASUGA...

386
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,625
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

387
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,500
WHO SIMPLY WANTS
TO LIVE IN PEACE.

388
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,125
- YUMEKICHI?

389
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,625
- Chosokabe: SO THEN,
HOW BEST TO SKEWER THEM?

390
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,750
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

391
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,208
- WE COULD SPLIT UP.

392
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,083
WE COULD SEND ONE GROUP
OUT TO WAKASA

393
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,416
AND THE OTHER ONE TO YAMASHIRO.

394
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,041
- NICE.
- GOOD THINKING.

395
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,666
- IT'S SETTLED THEN.

396
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,958
YOU PIRATES LAUNCH
A SURPRISE ATTACK IN WAKASA

397
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,875
TO DISTRACT THEM,
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON

398
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,375
WILL FINISH THEM OFF
IN YAMASHIRO.

399
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,916
- ALRIGHT, YOUR SONS-OF-BITCHES
WILL HIT THEM

400
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,875
WITH A SURPRISE BROADSIDE
IN WAKASA,

401
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,541
THE OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA
LANDS THE COUP DE GRACE!

402
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,291
- ( both )
HANG ON, WHAT?!

403
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,666
- WHERE YOU GET OFF TELLING US
TO BE THE DAMN BAIT?

404
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,041
- OH, SO WE'RE THE CHUM?

405
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,958
- HOLD ON NOW,
EVERYONE CHILL.

406
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,166
- DOES IT REALLY MATTER
WHO THE BAIT IS?

407
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,250
- ( both )
YOU BET YOUR ASS!

408
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,500
- WHAT'S IT SAY?

409
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,708
- IT'S FROM MATSUNAGA HISAHIDE.

410
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,625
- WHAT?

411
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,583
- ( theme music plays )

412
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,750
- Mori: ALL IS IN ACCORDANCE
WITH MY CALCULATIONS.

413
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,458
MY PAWNS NOW COVER THE BOARD.

414
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,541
READY TO FIGHT AND DIE
BY MY COMMAND.

415
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,541
WHEN THE NEXT SUN RISES, 

416
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,208
BE SURE TO WITNESS FOR YOURSELF

417
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,750
THE CUNNING THAT I,
ITS CHILD, DISPLAY.
