1
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,500
- YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.
TIME IS GROWING SHORT.

2
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,750
VERY SOON I SHALL HAVE
YOUR ANSWER OR YOUR LIFE.

3
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:33,958
I MUST INSIST UPON A DECISION
BY THE TIME I'VE RETURNED.

4
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,166
- RUSHING OFF TO DESTROY
MORI OF AKI, RIGHT?

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,791
YOU ALWAYS INTENDED
TO KILL YOUR ALLY.

6
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,375
AS DID HE, NO DOUBT.

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,333
YOU TWO DESERVE EACH OTHER.

8
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,458
BASED ON WHAT I COULD HEAR,
YOUR MAIN FORCE IS HEADED EAST,

9
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,416
FOR ODAWARA, LIKELY.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,666
THREE OR FOUR ARMIES
LIE IN WAIT,

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,375
YOUR BATTALION AND A FEW OTHERS
NEARLY AS BIG.

12
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,375
YOU MEAN TO FINISH THIS WAR.

13
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,166
- THERE ARE TWO PATHS
LAID OUT BEFORE YOU--

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,125
SERVE THE TOYOTOMI FOR THE SAKE
OF YOUR HOMELAND'S FUTURE,

15
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,250
OR SLIT YOUR BELLY FORTHWITH

16
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,875
THAT YOU MAY SERVE
MASAMUNE'S GHOST.

17
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,083
NOT EVEN YOU ARE FOOLISH ENOUGH

18
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,791
TO TRY AND AVENGE
HIS DEATH ALONE.

19
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:16,250
- THE ONLY PATH I ACKNOWLEDGE
IS THIS ONE--

20
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,458
MY LORD SEES THROUGH
THAT CHEAP TRAP

21
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:22,208
MATSUNAGA'S BAITED FOR HIM
AND GRINDS THE TOYOTOMI TO DUST.

22
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,208
- THEN YOU CLING
TO A FAIRY-TALE.

23
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,666
TRUTH BE TOLD, I DON'T THINK
YOUR MASTER WILL FALL

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,083
TO THE OLD MAN'S DUPLICITY,
EITHER.

25
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,750
THE SERPENT HAS HIS EYE
ON OTHER PREY.

26
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,416
MATSUNAGA IS THERE
MERELY TO FORCE AN IMPASSE.

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,625
A STALEMATE THAT I WILL BREAK.

28
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,583
- ( theme music plays )

29
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,958
- Sarutobi:
NO IDEA WHO HE'S WORKING FOR,

30
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,666
BUT HE'S DEFINITELY
MADE THINGS EASIER FOR US.

31
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,333
- Kasuga:
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S HERE.

32
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,916
WE MAY HAVE TO FACE HIM.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,833
- TOYOTOMI'S WAR STRATEGY

34
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,166
IS FAR MORE INTRICATE
THAN WE'D THOUGHT.

35
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,666
THE ONLY WAY WE'LL GET
WISE TO HIS PLAN

36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,583
IS TO SNEAK IN AND TAKE A LOOK.

37
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,250
MASTER KATAKURA!

38
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,875
- Katakura: SARUTOBI!

39
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,333
- GUESS YOU OWE ME ONE, HUH?

40
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,750
- IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE

41
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,708
STILL PLENTY OF SOLDIERS
GUARDING THE PLACE.

42
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,000
- Sarutobi: WE'LL BE FINE,
SO LONG AS WE KEEP QUIET.

43
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,458
- I SEE WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

44
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,291
THE UNIT HEADED
THIS WAY FROM AKI

45
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,416
IS THE MOBILE FORTRESS
MY SCOUTS REPORTED.

46
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,750
MORI MUST HAVE REBUILT
CHOSOKABE'S FUGAKU.

47
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,458
- Katakura: THEY EVEN
ANTICIPATED STEALING IT

48
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,000
FROM MORI IN THE END.

49
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,500
THAT'S WHY THEY FORMED
THE ALLIANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

50
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,500
- Sarutobi:
WHAT?  YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

51
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,958
- Kasuga: JUST LIKE MORI HAS
ALWAYS PLANNED ON BETRAYING THEM

52
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:07,250
WITH A CASTLE ATTACK.
THEY ARE BOTH DANGEROUS FOES.

53
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,083
- Sarutobi:
THIS ARROW HERE,

54
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,708
DOES THIS MEAN THEY'VE SENT
TROOPS TO THE FAR NORTH BY SEA?

55
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,958
- THEY INTEND TO ATTACK
UESUGI FROM BEHIND.

56
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,875
KYUSHU'S IN SIMILAR PERIL.

57
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,458
- AND THESE ARE THE MEN
SENT TO TAKE OUT SATSUMA.

58
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,416
WHERE ARE THEY GETTING
ALL THESE SOLDIERS?

59
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,833
- Katakura: NO ONE BUT TOYOTOMI
COULD EVEN DARE TRY THIS.

60
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,458
IT'S A WAR TO END ALL WARS.

61
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,375
- LORD KENSHIN...

62
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,500
- FLY TO YOUR LORD, WARN HIM.

63
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,375
- THANK YOU.

64
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,750
- Katakura:
THAT "X" IS MATSUNAGA.

65
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,791
- Sarutobi: HE <i>IS</i> STILL
ALIVE. I'D HEARD AS MUCH.

66
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,583
- ANOTHER PART OF THE PLAN.

67
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,125
TAKENAKA'S USING THE VILLAIN
TO STALL MY LORD,

68
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,333
SO HE CAN DESTROY THEM BOTH

69
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,041
WITH THE FORTRESS
HE STEALS FROM MORI.

70
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,791
- HERE, YOU'LL NEED A SWORD.

71
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,250
THIS IS NO TIME TO BE
WALKING AROUND UNARMED.

72
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,083
- SARUTOBI!
- SASUKE!

73
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,000
- SON OF A--

74
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,875
LOOK WHO IT IS,
THE SILENT NINJA HIMSELF.

75
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,458
- FUUMA KOTARO!

76
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,875
- GO ON, KASUGA.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

77
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,500
- ECHIGO'S IN FOR
A SURPRISE ATTACK

78
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,958
IF YOU DON'T WARN THE WAR GOD.

79
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,583
- Katakura:
SARUTOBI, IT'S THE SWORD!

80
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,750
- YOU TOO, MASTER KATAKURA.

81
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,541
NOW, GO!

82
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,500
- SASUKE...

83
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,750
- LISTEN TO ME,
GET RID OF THE SWORD.

84
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,250
THAT NINJA'S
MATSUNAGA'S SERVANT.

85
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,916
HE'S HERE TO TAKE THAT SWORD.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,125
- WHAT? 

87
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,583
HE SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID SO.

88
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,125
HEY, YOU WANT THIS, HUH?

89
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,708
GO FETCH!

90
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,666
- Zenkichi:
LET US OUT OF HERE, DAMN IT!

91
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,208
- Pirate: YOU'RE MESSING WITH
THE WRONG BUNCH OF PIRATES!

92
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,250
- Genbei: I'M GOING TO BUILD
THE CAPTAIN A MEMORIAL

93
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,875
OUT OF YOUR FACE!

94
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,875
- ( shouting )

95
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,625
- Matsunaga:
MY GOODNESS,

96
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,250
NOT A SCRATCH ON YOU.

97
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,958
EN ROUTE TO ODAWARA?
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

98
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,583
BUT PLEASE DON'T TARRY
ON MY ACCOUNT.

99
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,958
- IT'S MATSUNAGA!

100
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,583
- HOW IN THE HELL
IS HE STILL ALIVE?!

101
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,458
- REAL NICE, DROPPING
A DAMN MOUNTAIN ON US.

102
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,708
- I NEVER HAD YOU PEGGED

103
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,208
FOR A TOYOTOMI LICKSPITTLE,
OLD MAN

104
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,333
- FAR FROM IT,
I TEND TO DISREGARD ANY PACT

105
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,833
MADE WITH SOMEONE WHO SHOULD
KNOW BETTER THAN TO TRUST ME

106
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,500
THE MOMENT I'VE ENTERED INTO IT.

107
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,291
BEST TO KEEP THINGS SIMPLE
AT MY AGE.

108
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,291
- YOU'RE A RIGHT EELY BASTARD,
AIN'T YOU?

109
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,291
- I GOT A LOT TO PAY YOU
BACK FOR, WITH INTEREST!

110
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,125
- Matsunaga: AH, GOOD.

111
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,333
MY SERVANT COMES WITH A GIFT.

112
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,958
TOYOTOMI OFFERED ME MANY A BLADE
AND BAUBLE TO KILL YOU.

113
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,750
BUT I COVETED THAT WHICH HE
SOUGHT TO KEEP HIDDEN--

114
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,583
MIKAZUKI MUNECHIKA.

115
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:06,541
I SHALL MARVEL AT ITS PERFECTION
AS I DRINK FROM THE SKULL

116
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,958
OF THE DEMON KING ODA NOBUNAGA.

117
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,250
- WHAT?

118
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,125
- NOW, CHILDREN,

119
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,416
I BID THEE GOODNIGHT.

120
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,833
- Katakura:
LORD MASAMUNE!

121
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,333
- Soldiers:
BOSS KATAKURA!

122
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,500
- KOJURO...

123
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,416
- YOU ARE CHOSOKABE MOTOCHIKA,
YES?

124
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,166
- WHAT OF IT?

125
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,583
- A BATTLE TO AVENGE YOUR DEATH
IS RAGING IN OSAKA CASTLE.

126
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,458
THEY ARE FIERCE,
BUT THEY ARE FEW.

127
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,750
THEY'RE MEN IN NEED
OF A CAPTAIN.

128
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,375
- WELL, CAPTAIN?
- SO...?

129
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,791
- YOU DON'T SAY?

130
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,291
GUESS I GOT MYSELF
A PRESSING ENGAGEMENT.

131
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,666
I GOT TO GO RESCUE
MY BRAVE SONS-OF-BITCHES.

132
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,833
I'LL BE IN ODAWARA,
STRAIGHT AWAY.

133
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,541
AH, WHO AM I FOOLING?

134
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,875
- YOU AND I BOTH KNOW,
TIME YOU GET THERE

135
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,291
I'LL BE EITHER
VICTORIOUS OR DEAD.

136
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,250
- Chosokabe:
ONE-EYED DRAGON,

137
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,500
- YEAH?

138
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,958
- YOU BEST PULL THROUGH.

139
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,291
- AYE-AYE.

140
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,333
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU,
LET'S DUEL OUT ON THE WATER.

141
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,333
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

142
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,458
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME,
COURSE I'LL BE WINNING THAT ONE.

143
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,791
- AHOY, YOU SEA DOGS!

144
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,333
WE'RE GOING TO OSAKA!

145
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,250
- FORGIVE ME, LORD.
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT THE--

146
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,625
- SAVE THE APOLOGY.

147
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,291
JUST GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

148
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,541
- OH, BOSS KATAKURA!

149
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,125
- MORI MOTONARI'S FORTRESS
IS CLOSING IN

150
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,916
AND TOYOTOMI WILL STEAL IT,

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,958
THEIR ARMY HEADED FOR ODAWARA.

152
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,958
THE FORTRESS AND A THIRD FORCE
HIDDEN IN THE NORTH

153
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,541
WILL UTTERLY DOMINATE
THE KANTO PLAIN.

154
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,166
- THEN WE'LL HAVE TO BEAT
THEM TO THE PUNCH.

155
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,458
SEEING HOW WE'RE
SO BADLY OUTNUMBERED AND ALL.

156
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,125
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY?

157
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:11,958
- PRECISELY.

158
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,125
PLEASE, LEAVE IT TO ME.

159
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,875
I, KATAKURA KOJURO,
WILL PROTECT YOUR BACK,

160
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,416
NOW AND EVER!

161
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,291
- ( all ):
BOSS KATAKURA!

162
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,041
- GOOD LUCK.

163
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,416
YOU'RE THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB.

164
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,833
- Katakura:
THAT SCAR ON HIS BACK,

165
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,083
IT COULD NOT HAVE COME
FROM HIDEYOSHI'S FISTS.

166
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:40,041
YOU WILL PAY, TAKENAKA HANBEI!

167
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,666
- MY DEAR, MOTONARI,

168
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,916
ONE NEEDS NO OVERWHELMING FORCE
TO TOPPLE THE MORI.

169
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,541
YOUR MEN DESPISE YOU

170
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,916
AND WILL SCATTER TO THE WIND
THE MOMENT YOU DIE.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,208
WHAT PAWN MOURNS
THE PASSING OF THE PLAYER

172
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,916
WHO SHOVED IT
OUT INTO HARM'S WAY?

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,500
THOSE WHO REMAIN WILL SURRENDER
TO US, MEEK AS LAMBS.

174
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,750
- Mori:
TOYOTOMI,

175
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,125
HOW PATIENTLY YOU WAITED
FOR THE DEVIL KING TO FALL,

176
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,833
FOR YOU SHARE HIS AMBITION.

177
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,625
YOU SCAVENGE THE CARRION
OF ANOTHER HUNTER'S KILL.

178
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,541
- MAY I OFFER
MY CONGRATULATIONS, LORD MORI?

179
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,125
SOON NOW,
THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN

180
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,583
WILL GROVEL AT YOUR FEET.

181
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,208
ALL WE NEED DO
IS SIMPLY ADVANCE UPON OSAKA

182
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,708
IN YOUR INVINCIBLE FORTRESS,
MY LORD.

183
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,583
PLEASE, A TOAST.

184
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,875
- MASTER AKAGAWA!

185
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,375
WHAT REASON CAN YOU HAVE 
FOR SUCH BRUTALITY, LORD?

186
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,166
- OUR LORD HAS LOST HIS MIND!

187
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,541
- DRINK THE SAKE FOR YOURSELF,
AND PROVE THAT I AM INSANE.

188
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,500
- ALRIGHT...

189
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,958
- ( glass breaking )

190
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,916
- ( choking )

191
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,083
- SORRY, AKAGAWA.

192
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,375
I KNEW FROM THE START
THAT YOU WERE A TOYOTOMI SPY.

193
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,750
I'D FACTORED IT
INTO MY CALCULATIONS.

194
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,166
ALL THIS TIME,
YOU WERE A MODEL SERVANT,

195
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,750
KNOWING IT WOULD EARN YOU
THE ACCESS TO MY PERSON

196
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,041
YOU WOULD NEED TO POISON ME.

197
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,166
MY SINCEREST THANKS, TAKENAKA.

198
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,958
THIS PAWN OF YOURS PROVED
VERY USEFUL TO THE MORI CAUSE.

199
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,916
- I HAVE FINALLY HAD
AN EPIPHANY.

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,250
I, YUKIMURA, HAVE DONE NOTHING
BUT TROT BEHIND YOU.

201
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,750
YOU SPEAK OF THE FUTURE
YOU ENVISION, YOUR LORDSHIP,

202
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,416
AND I NOD.  BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN
SEEING IT WITH MY OWN EYES.

203
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
WHEN I TAKE UP MY SPEARS,
IT SHOULD NOT BE TO FIGHT

204
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,875
FOR A FUTURE YOU DESIRE.

205
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,916
IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE I WANT
THAT SAME FUTURE JUST AS BADLY,

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,416
BECAUSE I SEE IT FOR MYSELF.

207
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,375
THIS IS THE FIRE
BURNING WITHIN ME

208
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,375
WHEN I FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE.
FROM THIS DAY FORTH,

209
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,041
AND FOR ALWAYS,

210
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,958
I PLEDGE MY LIFE
TO A WORLD BEYOND WAR!

211
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,750
HEAR ME, YOUR LORDSHIP,
I'VE BEEN BLIND,

212
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,666
BUT NOW I SEE THE WISDOM
OF YOUR WAYS.

213
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,791
YOUR TEACHINGS HAVE BECOME 
PART OF MY FLESH AND BLOOD,

214
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,375
PART OF MY VERY BONES.

215
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,041
I CANNOT REMAIN A TIGER CUB
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

216
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,625
FOR SOME DAY, I MUST BECOME...

217
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,791
THE TIGER OF KAI HIMSELF!

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,250
- Soldier 1: THE SIGNAL
FLARE HASN'T BEEN FIRED OFF.

219
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,375
- Soldier 2: AND IT HASN'T
SLOWED DOWN, EITHER.

220
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,916
DO YOU THINK THE SPY
WAS DISCOVERED?

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,625
- WHY HAS MASTER TAKENAKA
STILL NOT ARRIVED?

222
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,500
- I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE
A FULL RETREAT, RIGHT NOW.

223
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,916
- CANNONEERS, MAKE READY
TO FIRE THE MORNING STAR.

224
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,166
TOYOTOMI, YOU'LL SEE
THE LIGHT SOON ENOUGH.

225
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,833
- CHOSOKABE'S FORTRESS?
BUT I THOUGHT--

226
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,541
- NO, IT'S DIFFERENT.

227
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,666
- FIRE AWAY!

228
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,791
THIS IS MY PLAN, FINALLY
COME TO FRUITION.

229
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,416
TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI

230
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,458
MAY HAVE SINGLEHANDEDLY
DESTROYED THE FUGAKU,

231
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,083
BUT HIS PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH
WILL NOT SAVE HIM,

232
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,000
NOT WHEN THE MORNING STAR
SETS HIS WORLD AFLAME.

233
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,625
STRENGTH HAS NO MEANING
WHEN I CAN BURN

234
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,208
THE MIGHTIEST FOE
TO CINDERS FROM AFAR.

235
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,791
THE SUN GRANTS ME PROTECTION
AND LENDS ME ITS FIRE.

236
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,291
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT,

237
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,250
HEAVEN ITSELF SMILES
UPON MY CONQUEST.

238
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,000
- WHAT DEVILRY IS THIS?

239
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,375
ATTACKING IT IS
TANTAMOUNT TO SUICIDE.

240
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,958
BUT ATTACK IT,
WE CERTAINLY MUST.

241
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,750
ALL IN FAVOR OF SINKING
THAT FORTRESS?

242
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,750
- ( all ): SIR!

243
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,458
- THE QUESTION IS HOW?

244
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,208
WITH A WEAPON LIKE THAT
AT MORI'S DISPOSAL,

245
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,458
HE'LL PUT THE ENTIRE LAND
TO THE TORCH.

246
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,750
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
TOYOTOMI LED HIS MAIN ARMY

247
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,375
TOWARD ODARAWARA,

248
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,666
A STRONGHOLD
FROM WHICH HE'D BRING

249
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,291
ALL OF THE KANTO PLAIN
UNDER HIS BOOT.

250
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,083
- HIDEYOSHI,

251
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,958
I SWEAR I WILL STOP YOU.

252
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,625
IF STRENGTH IS ALL
THAT YOU VALUE IN THIS LIFE--

253
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,333
HIDEYOSHI, WAKE UP!

254
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,291
IF YOU DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE
YOUR WEAKNESS,

255
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,916
INSTEAD OF JUST HIDING IT AWAY,

256
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,833
YOU'LL NEVER TRULY KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE STRONG!

257
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,625
THE PEOPLE YOU CHERISH
MIGHT BE THE HOLE IN YOUR ARMOR,

258
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:33,125
BUT IT'S THOSE VERY PEOPLE,
DAMN IT, WHO WILL INSPIRE YOU

259
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,458
TO FIND YOUR REAL STRENGTH!

260
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,416
YOU CHERISHED HER, HIDEYOSHI.

261
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,916
I KNOW YOU CHERISHED HER,
SO DID I!

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,125
HOW DO YOU MURDER
THE WOMAN YOU LOVE?!

263
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,708
JUST OPEN YOUR EYES, HIDEYOSHI!

264
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,625
THIS ISN'T THE REAL YOU!

265
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,458
PLEASE, WAKE UP
FROM THIS NIGHTMARE!

266
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,416
- BEEN A WHILE HASN'T IT,
ONE-EYED DRAGON?

267
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,166
- KEIJI, YOU EVER GOING TO TAKE
ALL THIS SERIOUS ENOUGH

268
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,833
TO USE THAT SWORD?

269
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,625
- THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

270
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,500
I TAKE EVERYTHING
SERIOUSLY, ALWAYS.

271
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,333
IF THE ONLY TIME YOU MEET
PEOPLE HALFWAY

272
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,291
IS WHEN YOU'RE STABBING THEM,
THIS WAR'S NEVER GOING TO END.

273
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,708
IT'S STRANGE, I KNOW,

274
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,708
BUT JUST THE TINIEST THINGS
IN COMMON ARE ENOUGH

275
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,083
TO MAKE YOU NOT WANT
TO HURT A MAN.

276
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:40,083
PEOPLE ARE GOOD, BASICALLY.
I NEED TO BELIEVE THAT.

277
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,041
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

278
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,125
BUT WE KEEP TAKING LIVES
LIKE IT'S NOTHING.

279
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,041
WHY?

280
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,541
STRANGERS, AND FRIENDS,
AND LOVERS ALIKE.

281
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:54,333
WHY HER? OF ALL THE PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD.

282
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,125
- YOU STOOD YOUR GROUND,
FLOWER BOY,

283
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,416
I RESPECT YOU FOR THAT.

284
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,125
ALSO, IF YOU'RE SAYING
WHAT I THINK YOU'RE SAYING,

285
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:10,000
THEN TOYOTOMI'S AS VILE
A BASTARD AS I ALWAYS THOUGHT.

286
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,083
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PAST
YOU HAVE WITH HIM,

287
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,958
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY
AND TELL ME WHAT A GOOD MAN

288
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,541
HE WAS BACK IN THE DAY,
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

289
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,666
- I WON'T.

290
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,166
- LEAVE HIM BE, BOYS.

291
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,208
THAT VAGABOND FACED HIM
WITH NOTHING BUT WORDS,

292
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,708
WHEN NO ONE ELSE
HAD THE GUTS TO TRY.

293
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,250
HE'LL STAND WHEN HE'S READY.

294
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,000
- ( horse galloping )

295
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,625
- WHAT WILL YOU DO,
SANADA YUKIMURA?

296
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,166
THE TAKEDA CAVALRY,

297
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,458
AND THE TROOPS LORD SHIMAZU
ENTRUSTED TO YOU,

298
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:51,125
THEIR FATE HINGES ON YOU
MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION.

299
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,458
- MASTER, CONGRATULATIONS
ON A JOB WELL DONE IN SATSUMA.

300
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,125
- WHAT NEWS TO REPORT, SASUKE?

301
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,083
- HIDEYOSHI IS HEADED
FOR ODAWARA WITH HIS MAIN ARMY.

302
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,083
LORD KENSHIN HAS 
UTSUNOMIYA CONTAINED.

303
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,416
BUT TOYOTOMI'S SECRET ARMY
TO THE NORTH

304
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,208
IS CLOSING IN FROM BEHIND.

305
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,166
AND IT SEEMS A THIRD
TOYOTOMI BATTALION

306
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,708
HAS BEEN DEPLOYED TO KYUSHU.

307
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:15,541
THEY MEAN TO CONQUER THE COUNTRY
IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

308
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,416
BUT THOSE CREWMEN OF CHOSOKABE
BEING HELD CAPTIVE

309
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,541
AT OSAKA CASTLE HAVE BEEN FREED.

310
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,208
THEY'VE SWORN VENGEANCE AND
ARE READY TO GO DOWN FIGHTING.

311
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,833
AND REUNITED WITH HIS RIGHT EYE,
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON

312
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,208
RACES TO ODAWARA
FOR A FINAL SHOWDOWN

313
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,083
WITH HIDEYOSHI.

314
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,833
MASTER, OUR CLAN'S MAIN ARMY
STILL HAS YET TO TAKE THE FIELD.

315
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,500
SHALL I CALL FOR REINFORCEMENTS?

316
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,041
- NO NEED, I WOULD RATHER
OUR LORD STAY HIS HAND

317
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,666
FOR THE MOMENT AND WATCH HOW
THESE BATTLES UNFOLD.

318
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,125
THERE'S NO WAY TO BE SURE

319
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,833
WHAT IS IN STORE FOR ANY OF US.

320
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,291
HAVE HIS LORDSHIP REMAIN IN KAI,
THAT HE MAY STRIKE

321
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,916
WHEREVER HE CAN DO MOST GOOD.

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
- GOOD THINKING, MASTER.
I'LL PASS THAT ALONG.

323
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,583
LOOKS LIKE THE TIGER CUB
HAS GROWN UP.

324
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,458
- LORD MASAMUNE,

325
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,333
YOU'RE ALIVE AFTER ALL.

326
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,583
- Sarutobi:
ALL SIGNS POINT TO TAKENAKA

327
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,583
HAVING DESIGNS
ON MORI'S FORTRESS.

328
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,833
BUT THUS FAR, HIS SOLDIERS
ARE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

329
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,083
- Sanada: HE WANTS TO
CAPTURE THAT BEHEMOTH?!

330
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,875
- YEAH.
- SASUKE, WHAT KIND OF TERRAIN

331
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,208
LIES ON THE PATH AHEAD OF US?

332
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,416
WE'RE STOPPING THAT FORTRESS,
WHATEVER THE COST!

333
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,875
- Soldier:
MASTER HANBEI!  MASTER HANBEI!

334
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:24,166
THE ADVANCE PARTY'S BEEN
ANNIHILATED BY MORI'S WEAPONRY.

335
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,708
- HOW CAN THIS BE?

336
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,833
- SO, AKAGAWA,
YOU HAVE FAILED ME.

337
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,708
TYPICAL.

338
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,375
- WELL, WHO DO WE HAVE HERE?

339
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,041
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, MUTTON CHOPS.

340
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,875
HOW'S ABOUT A REMATCH?
WINNER TAKES ALL, YOU IN?

341
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,375
OH, AND THANKS FOR SENDING

342
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,333
YOUR ARMIES OUT
TO CONQUER THE COUNTRY.

343
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:02,000
'CAUSE IF I BEAT YOU RIGHT HERE,
I GET THE WHOLE BALL OF WAX.

344
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,291
AND THE ONE-EYED DRAGON
WILL RULE THE LAND.

345
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,541
- YOU COULD FIGHT ME
FOR THE REST OF TIME

346
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,333
AND STILL YOU WOULD NOT WIN.

347
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,833
YOU'VE NEARLY DIED TWICE NOW

348
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,541
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

349
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,458
- GUESS YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE STONES TO FINISH ME OFF.

350
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:21,166
- HANBEI MERELY SLICED
THROUGH YOUR COAT.

351
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,958
I SHALL MAKE IT A BURIAL SHROUD

352
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,208
FOR WHATEVER REMAINS
OF YOUR CORPSE!

353
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,166
- ONE PROBLEM,

354
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,250
YOU'LL BE NOTHING BUT DUST
BY THE TIME I DIE.

355
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,333
COME ON!

356
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,291
- ( theme music plays )

357
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

358
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,791
- Date: YOU CAN'T
CONQUER THIS COUNTRY

359
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,333
WITH NOTHING BUT STRENGTH.

360
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,083
I DON'T CARE
HOW BADASS YOU ARE.

361
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,625
WHEN THE HEAVENS PART,

362
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,458
IT'S A NO-HOLDS-BARRED
RACE TO THE TOP.

363
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,791
SO CUE UP MY THEME SONG
ONE LAST TIME.

364
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,458
I'M GOING TO DO THIS IN STYLE.
