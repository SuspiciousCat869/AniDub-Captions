1
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:30,875
- Keiji:
MAEDA KEIJI.

2
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,875
HEAD OF THE MAEDA FAMILY
OF KAGA.

3
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,625
I AM GRATEFUL
FOR THIS AUDIENCE.

4
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,125
- I AM TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI.

5
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,541
THE MAEDA HAVE DEFIED
MY ORDERS.

6
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,416
AND FAILED TO JOIN
THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST KAI.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,708
I ASSUME THIS IS BECAUSE YOU,

8
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,833
WHO INTERFERED WITH
THE SUBJUGATION OF UESUGI,

9
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,291
HAVE NOW COMMITTED
FURTHER TREASON

10
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,208
AND WRESTED CONTROL
FROM TOSHIIE.

11
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,000
- THAT IS CORRECT.

12
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,166
- I WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU
MAKE EXCUSES.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,250
- I COME TO REQUEST AN END
TO OUR SUPPORT.

14
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:07,083
I'D LIKE YOU TO ALLOW
THE DISSOLUTION OF OUR ALLIANCE.

15
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,000
HENCEFORTH, THE MAEDA WILL SIDE
WITH NO OTHER FORCE.

16
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,166
- ONCE YOU BETRAYED
THE ODA CLAN,

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,333
AND NOW YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU
WOULD BETRAY US, THE TOYOTOMI?

18
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,250
- THAT IS WHY I HAVE
COME IN PERSON.

19
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,541
TO SHOW PROPER RESPECT.

20
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,166
- IN CHOOSING A POSITION
OF NEUTRALITY,

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,208
YOUR DOMAIN MIGHT
ENJOY ITS PEACE

22
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,125
UNTIL I HAVE UNIFIED
THIS COUNTRY.

23
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,416
BUT ONCE WE STRIKE OUT
INTO THE WORLD,

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,625
ANY ARMY THAT DOES NOT
FIGHT AT MY SIDE,

25
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,416
WILL ONLY FACE DESTRUCTION.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,250
- KAGA MAINTAINS
ITS STANCE AGAINST WAR.

27
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,166
WE WILL TAKE PART
IN NO CONFLICT.

28
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,833
- SO BE IT.

29
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,666
- HIDEYOSHI.

30
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,875
WHAT IS STRENGTH?
TELL ME THAT

31
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:02,291
CHOSOKABE MOTOCHIKA
WAS MY FRIEND.

32
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,583
AND THE MAN I ONCE KNEW
YOU TO BE,

33
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,875
WOULD HAVE LIKED HIM A LOT.

34
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,875
HE WOULD HAVE BECOME
YOUR FRIEND, TOO.

35
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,208
- IS THAT WHY YOU'VE
REALLY COME HERE?

36
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,666
IN THE HOPES
THAT YOU MIGHT AVENGE

37
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,458
THIS SO-CALLED,
"FRIEND" OF YOURS?

38
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,125
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M
TRYING TO SAY, AT ALL.

39
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,750
I'M HERE AS YOUR FRIEND.

40
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:22,583
TO ASK--I DO NOT RECALL
EVER HAVING ANY FRIENDS.

41
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,875
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS STRENGTH.

42
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,208
BUT I KNOW YOU, HIDEYOSHI.

43
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,083
- DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND.
I GRANTED AN AUDIENCE

44
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,583
TO THE LORD OF KAGA.

45
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,625
YOUR BUSINESS HERE
SHOULD BE CONCLUDED.

46
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,125
- KEIJI: IF I WANTED REVENGE,

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,541
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

48
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,958
DAMN IT!

49
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,625
WHY DID YOU KILL NENE?

50
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,500
- ( theme music plays )

51
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:24,291
- NENE WAS TO BOTH OF US--
SHE WAS--

52
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,666
WASN'T SHE THE FIRST WOMAN
WHO YOU TRULY LOVED,

53
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,791
FROM THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART?

54
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,625
- THAT IS A TRIVIAL MATTER.

55
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,083
- TRIVIAL?

56
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,708
- IN ORDER TO EFFECT
SWEEPING CHANGE

57
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,416
ACROSS THIS LAND,

58
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,458
IN ORDER TO HOLD THE FATE
OF THE COUNTRY IN MY HANDS,

59
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,833
I HAD TO LET GO OF ALL
I ONCE HELD DEAR.

60
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,708
WHAT IS STRENGTH, YOU ASK ME?

61
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,541
IT IS EVERYTHING,
IT IS ABSOLUTE!

62
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,875
AND IN A COUNTRY PLAGUED
BY WEAKNESS AND STAGNATION,

63
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,625
IT IS THE ONLY CURE!

64
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,541
- WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE

65
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,208
OF WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED.

66
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,125
PEOPLE DON'T LIVE
FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR COUNTRY,

67
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,208
THEY LIVE PURELY FOR THE SAKE
OF FINDING HAPPINESS.

68
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,458
HAPPINESS FOR THOSE
THEY CARE ABOUT,

69
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,291
AS WELL AS FOR THEMSELVES.

70
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,125
HAPPINESS IS WHAT WILL
UNITE US SOMEDAY--

71
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,583
- YOU ARE A FOOL.

72
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,458
HOW LONG WILL YOU CLING
TO YOUR CHILDISH DREAMS?

73
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,041
KNOW THAT IT IS THOSE LIKE YOU,

74
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,375
THE WEAK, THE SOFT,
WHO WILL BRING

75
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,291
THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN
TO RUIN!

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,500
THOSE WHO LET THEMSELVES
BE CRIPPLED BY SUCH FLAWS

77
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,625
WILL BE CULLED.
ONLY THE STRONG WILL SURVIVE.

78
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,750
THE FUTURE WILL BELONG TO THOSE

79
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,375
WITH THE POWER TO TAKE IT!

80
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,708
- THERE'S NOT A MAN IN THE WORLD
WITHOUT FLAWS.

81
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,916
EVERYONE NEEDS HELP SOMETIMES.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,875
PEOPLE COME TOGETHER.
THEY BECOME FRIENDS,

83
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,875
LOVERS, RIVALS, ENEMIES.

84
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,458
BUT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
ARE WHAT MATTER.

85
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,791
THOSE BONDS ARE WHAT BUILD
THAT FUTURE.

86
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,250
UNITING AS A COUNTRY
COMES AFTER--

87
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,708
- YOU SPEAK WITH SUCH IDEALISM,

88
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,833
AS THOUGH WE LIVE
IN A TIME OF PEACE.

89
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,291
IT IS SO VERY LIKE YOU.

90
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,666
- THE TIMES MIGHT CHANGE,
BUT PEOPLE DO NOT.

91
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,708
LIKE TOSHIIE AND MATSU,

92
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,083
LIKE KENSHIN AND KASUGA.

93
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,500
THEY'RE THE STRONGEST PEOPLE
I KNOW, BUT THEY'RE KIND.

94
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,291
NENE WAS, TOO.

95
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,291
BACK THEN EVEN YOU HAD A HEART.

96
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,291
HIDEYOSHI, YOU'RE NOT--

97
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,416
YOU'RE NOT STILL DWELLING
ON WHAT HAPPENED?

98
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,000
THAT WAS--
WE WERE STILL JUST--

99
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,875
- THAT WAS MERELY THE IMPETUS.

100
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,083
- HIDEYOSHI!

101
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,625
- BE GONE, KEIJI.

102
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,208
- HANBEI...

103
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,708
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HIDEYOSHI, DO YOU?

104
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,000
- NO, NOT ONE BIT.

105
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:03,541
BUT THIS BEHAVIOR,
I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT.

106
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,750
TELL ME, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

107
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,625
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIDEYOSHI?

108
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,666
- I'M HIS MILITARY STRATEGIST.

109
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,666
- SO YOU DON'T CONSIDER
YOURSELF HIS FRIEND FIRST?

110
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,750
- HIDEYOSHI IS STRONG.

111
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,125
FROM THE VERY OUTSET,
HE HAS BEEN PREPARED

112
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,833
TO LOSE ME AT ANY TIME.

113
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,041
- HOW CAN YOU BE
SO BLASE ABOUT THAT?

114
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,916
- I'M A REALIST,
I'M BEING PRACTICAL.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,166
THE STRONG BUILD
THE FUTURE KEIJI,

116
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,875
IT IS A SIMPLE TRUTH.

117
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,583
- THAT'S NOT A FUTURE
PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN.

118
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,708
WATCH ME, I'LL STOP HIM.
NO MATTER WHAT.

119
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,041
IF YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S A BETTER MAN

120
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,291
THAN SOMEONE LIKE
THE DEVIL KING OF OWARI,

121
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:44,291
THEN WHEN THE DAY COMES
THAT HE LOSES YOU AS WELL

122
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:48,500
HE WILL SURELY SHED A TEAR.

123
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,750
- IF HIDEYOSHI WAS
STILL THE MAN YOU THINK HE IS,

124
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,458
THE TOYOTOMI OF TODAY
WOULD NOT EXIST, AM I WRONG?

125
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,708
- Keiji:
IF THERE'S STILL ANY

126
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,250
OF THE TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI
I KNEW LEFT,

127
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,541
NENE IS STILL IN HIS THOUGHTS.

128
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,625
AND HE'S SURE TO HAVE
CONTINUED TO GRIEVE IN SILENCE.

129
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,208
IF NOT, THEN HE REALLY IS GONE.

130
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,208
- ( coughing )

131
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,125
- Man:
MASTER TAKENAKA?

132
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,458
- YES, HIDEYOSHI IS STRONG.

133
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,083
AND THIS DREAM THAT HE AND I
HAVE STAKED EVERYTHING ON

134
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:59,458
IS NOT WEAK.
NOT LIKE YOU, DEAR KEIJI.

135
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,583
- ( grunting )

136
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:09,666
- ( battle chants )

137
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,625
- ( chanting continues )

138
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:21,000
- I HAVE HEARD TALES
OF YOUR NUMEROUS ACTS OF VALOR.

139
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,583
LORD SHIMAZU,
I DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE

140
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,416
TO FIND YOU HALE AND HEARTY.

141
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,458
IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO MEET YOU.

142
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,833
- WELL, IT'S GOOD
KNOWING YOU TOO, LAD.

143
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,708
STORIES OF THE TIGER OF KAI'S
YOUNG CUB

144
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,333
HAVE SPREAD ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE TO KYUSHU.

145
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,458
- YOU HUMBLE ME, SIR.

146
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,208
- CAN'T SAY I'M QUITE HALE
AND HEARTY, THOUGH.

147
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,583
YOU CAN SEE MY WOUNDS
FROM ODAR ARE STILL ON THE MEND.

148
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,875
- THEY LOOK QUITE SEVERE.

149
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,500
- EVEN IF I HEAL UP, THERE'S
NO TELLING IF I'LL BE ABLE

150
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,500
TO WIELD MY SWORD
IN THE JIGEN STYLE AGAIN.

151
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,125
- THAT WOULD BE
MOST UNFORTUNATE.

152
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,875
- OH, YOU'LL BE FINE.

153
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,750
IT'S ABOUT YOUR SPIRIT, POPS.
YOUR <i>SPIRIT!</i>

154
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,250
- ( laughing )
YEAH, DON'T I KNOW IT.

155
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,666
- SO THEN, THE MEN
OUT THERE FIGHTING

156
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,583
AND PROTECTING SATSUMA,
WHO ARE THEY?

157
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,625
- Shimazu:
DRIFTERS, REFUGEES, AND SUCH.

158
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,291
FOLKS DRIVEN
FROM THEIR HOMELANDS

159
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,291
BY ODA AND TOYOTOMI.

160
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,791
THEY GOT NOWHERE LEFT TO GO.

161
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,041
SO THEY FIGHT
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW.

162
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,125
- POP'S TACTICS ARE
CRAZY AWESOME, YOU KNOW?

163
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,375
EVERYONE'S GETTING
STRONGER REAL FAST.

164
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,833
COURSE, I AM
STILL THE STRONGEST.

165
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,708
- THAT IS GOOD, YOU STILL LEAD.
ONLY YOU DO IT FROM THE REAR.

166
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,541
- THAT I DO, BUT I'M SORRY.
WE'RE IN NO KIND OF SHAPE

167
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,333
TO CONSIDER JOINING FORCES
WITH YOU.

168
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,625
RECKON TAKEDA'S WANTING
TO ATTACK

169
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,166
TOYOTOMI AND MORI FROM BOTH
THE EAST AND THE WEST, YEAH?

170
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,666
- YOU HAVE ASCERTAINED
CORRECTLY.

171
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,666
- WITH THIS MOTLEY CREW,
WE'VE GOT OUR HANDS FULL

172
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,541
JUST PROTECTING
THIS SOUTHERNMOST TIP

173
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,375
FROM TOYOTOMI'S INFLUENCE.

174
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,708
- LORD SHIMAZU,

175
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,208
THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
MILORD GAVE ME

176
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,000
IN SENDING ME TO THIS LAND,
IS TO FIND SOME WAY

177
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,625
TO REVERSE THIS SITUATION.

178
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,125
EVEN THOUGH ON OUR JOURNEY HERE,
AT ITSUKUSHIMA,

179
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:08,125
I LOST HALF OF THE TROOPS
THAT WERE ENTRUSTED TO ME.

180
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,541
I WOULD HUMBLY ASK
THAT YOU ADD MY MEN AND ME

181
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,041
TO YOUR ARMY HERE IN SATSUMA.

182
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,125
- THEN WHAT ARE THE REST
OF TAKEDA'S ARMY

183
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,166
GOING TO DO WITHOUT YOU
AT THEIR SIDE?

184
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,666
- MILORD HAS SAID THAT HE
WILL NOT ACT UNTIL ALL IS SET.

185
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,708
- HUH, AIN'T THAT SOMETHING?

186
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,708
- HEY, POPS.
THIS GUY HERE'S PRETTY BADASS.

187
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,791
WELL, NOT AS MUCH AS ME,
OBVIOUSLY.

188
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,250
- OH, WELL THAT'S REASSURING.

189
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,791
ALRIGHT THEN.

190
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,250
YOU'VE GOT ME INTRIGUED,
FOR SURE.

191
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,500
RECKON WE'LL HAVE
TO TAKE THE TIGER OF KAI UP

192
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,625
ON HIS KIND OFFER.

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,291
- I LOOK FORWARD TO MY TIME

194
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,625
IN YOUR SERVICE, SIR.

195
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,000
- Miyamoto:
HEY, DUDE.

196
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,916
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN
IN FOR A BIT, HUH?

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,791
YOU'VE GOT TO BE BORED
WATCHING ALL MY AWESOMENESS.

198
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,791
YOU COME, TOO.

199
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,125
AND YOU, AND YOU,
AND YOU, AND YOU.

200
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,416
- Sanada:
I'D BE GLAD TO.  SHALL WE?

201
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,458
THIS SPEAR,
I DO NOT KNOW...

202
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:15,000
AM I TRULY WORTHY OF CONTINUING
TO WIELD THIS SPEAR

203
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,708
IN LORD TAKEDA'S NAME?

204
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,500
YOUR LORDSHIP,
THOUGH I SWORE TO YOU

205
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,041
THAT I WOULD REINFORCE
THE SATSUMA ARMY,

206
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,000
I FACE UNCERTAINTY.

207
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,125
ROBBING INNOCENT PEOPLE
OF PEACE AND ORDER.

208
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,541
THIS WORLD OF WAR CONTINUES
TO OPPRESS THE ELDERLY.

209
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,166
HELPLESS WOMEN--
AND THOSE OF TENDER YEARS.

210
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,458
HOW MANY MORE FOES
MUST WE LAY LOW?

211
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,750
HOW MANY MORE LIVES
MUST BE LOST?

212
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,708
BEFORE THE WORLD OF PEACE
WE BOTH PURSUE FINALLY ARRIVES?

213
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,666
HOW MANY MORE FRIENDS
MUST BE SLAUGHTERED IN VAIN?

214
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,083
YOUR LORDSHIP, PLEASE TELL ME!

215
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,750
- Miyamoto:
JUST HOLD TIGHT, POPS.

216
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,083
THESE ARE COOKING UP NICE.

217
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,666
AND I PROMISE THEY'LL BE TASTY.

218
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,583
- WELL, THEY'RE SURE STARTING
TO SMELL GOOD.

219
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,833
- YOU SHOW SUCH KINDNESS,
MASTER MUSASHI.

220
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,791
IT IS AS THOUGH YOU ARE
FATHER AND SON--

221
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,166
- Miyamoto:
YOU DUMBASS.

222
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,916
ONLY REASON I'M HELPING
POPS GET BETTER

223
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,333
IS SO HE CAN BE AT FULL STRENGTH

224
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,583
WHEN I FINALLY BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.

225
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,875
- GOODNESS.

226
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,875
- MAN, IT WAS A REAL BUMMER.

227
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,625
I CAME ALL THE WAY TO SATSUMA
'CAUSE I HEARD POPS HERE

228
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,541
WAS THE STRONGEST GEEZER IN THE
WHOLE LAND OF THE RISING SUN.

229
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,083
- THERE WAS NOTHING
HE COULD HAVE DONE.

230
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,916
I AM TOLD ODA LAUNCHED
A SNEAK ATTACK

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,291
WHILE LORD SHIMAZU
WAS AWAY IN BATTLE.

232
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,750
AND WITH EVERY LAST ALLY
ALREADY ROUTED--

233
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,208
- OH, LOOK, FOOD'S DONE!

234
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,666
YOU EAT, TOO.

235
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,333
- THAT IS NOT--
I AM MUCH OBLIGED.

236
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,666
- HERE YOU GO, POPS.

237
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,583
EAT WELL AND GET WELL SOON.

238
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,750
'CAUSE I CAN'T WAIT
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

239
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,875
- WELL, I'M ONLY
STILL DRAWING BREATH

240
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,375
'CAUSE OF YOU, YOUNG MAN.

241
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,500
I'D BETTER EAT UP,
SO I CAN GET BEAT DOWN

242
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,208
IN SPECTACULAR FASHION.

243
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,125
- SWEET!

244
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,166
- Shimazu:
I WAS ALL THE WAY OUT IN AKI

245
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,583
AT THE TIME.

246
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,833
JUST LIKE HOW YOU FOLKS
IN THE EASTERN LANDS

247
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,916
FORMED AN ALLIANCE,
I WAS TRYING TO DO THE SAME

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,500
OUT HERE IN THE WEST.

249
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,166
IT WAS MY HOPE
THAT LORD MORI MOTONARI

250
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,708
WOULD TAKE COMMAND.  HOWEVER...

251
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,541
- Mori:
WHAT I DESIRE IS PEACE FOR AKI.

252
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,333
WHAT BECOMES OF OTHER LANDS,

253
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,791
IS OF NO CONCERN TO ME.

254
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,833
PLACE YOUR TRUST
LIGHTLY IN OTHERS,

255
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,250
AND YOU WILL QUICKLY FIND
YOURSELF BEHEADED IN YOUR SLEEP.

256
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:40,291
- MORI WAS ONLY KEEPING ME THERE
TO BUY TIME.

257
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,791
HAD ODA DANCING
PRETTY TO HIS TUNE, TOO.

258
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,916
GETTING HIM TO ATTACK KYUSHU
BEFORE THE INLAND SEA OF SETTO.

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,291
- UNBELIEVABLE.

260
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,875
IN OUR BATTLE AGAINST
THE DEVIL KING AT MOUNT AZUCHI,

261
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,791
HE WAS A GENERAL ON OUR SIDE.

262
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,416
AS A LEADER OF MEN,
SUCH CONDUCT IS--

263
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,000
- NO.

264
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,541
NOT MANY CAN BE SO
THOROUGHLY STEADFAST

265
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:05,541
IN SEEING ONLY TO THE GOOD
OF HIS OWN DOMAIN.

266
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,750
I RECKON YOU COULD SAY HE'S GOT

267
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,916
HIS OWN STRONG SENSE OF HONOR.

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,875
ONE THAT TRANSCENDS THE CONCEPTS
OF GOOD AND EVIL.

269
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,416
- HONOR WITH NO MORAL COMPASS,
PUZZLING.

270
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,125
- I HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING
A MAN LIKE HIM

271
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,125
WILL JOIN FORCES
WITH TOYOTOMI JUST LIKE THAT.

272
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:28,166
MIGHT BE HE'S GOT SOME
OUTRAGEOUS PLOT UP HIS SLEEVE.

273
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,750
- SO, MORI, WHICH SIDE
WILL YOU CHOOSE?

274
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,958
- ( squeak )

275
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,541
- ZONED OUT, SORRY.

276
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,208
BUT AT LEAST AFTER THIS,

277
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,666
TOSHIIE AND MATSU WON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT GOING TO WAR.

278
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,583
COME ON, BUDDY.

279
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,166
LET'S GRAB A BITE
ON OUR WAY HOME.

280
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,125
I'LL GO
TO TOYOTOMI'S CASTLE AGAIN

281
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,041
BEFORE HE MAKES HIS NEXT MOVE.

282
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,041
IF TALKING TO HIM DOESN'T WORK,

283
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,375
I'LL HAVE TO TRY
SOMETHING MORE DIRECT.

284
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,125
OH, IT'LL BE FINE.

285
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,416
THAT'S HOW WE'VE
ALWAYS DONE THINGS, ISN'T IT?

286
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,666
HE WASN'T LIKE THAT
TO BEGIN WITH.

287
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,083
YUMEKICHI?

288
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,250
OH, NO.  NO!

289
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,708
YUMEKICHI!
COME ON, BUDDY.  WAKE UP!

290
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,583
PARDON ME, SIR.

291
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,541
- OH, DEAR.  DON'T TELL ME
I HAVE SOMETHING ON MY FACE.

292
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,666
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

293
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:47,416
YOU'RE A VERY STRANGE MAN.

294
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,208
- Keiji:
I'M SORRY, YUMEKICHI.

295
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,833
I GUESS, I MUST HAVE MADE
YOU PRETTY WORRIED.

296
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,458
- Matsunaga:
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

297
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,625
- BASTARD! LET HIDEYOSHI GO!

298
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,250
HIDEYOSHI!

299
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,708
ARE YOU ALRIGHT, MY FRIEND?

300
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,041
- Matsunaga:
WHY ALL THE ANGER?

301
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,833
YOU WERE THE ONES WHO BROUGHT
THIS BATTLE TO US.

302
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,666
I FIND IT INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
I AM TRULY PUZZLED.

303
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,500
- WE DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT
TO HAPPEN.

304
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,958
WE WERE TESTING OUR STRENGTH,
IT JUST GOT OUT OF HAND.

305
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,833
- KEIJI, GET OUT.  RUN.

306
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,083
- YOU BOYS NEED
TO BE TAUGHT A LESSON.

307
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,625
THOSE WHO LACK STRENGTH,

308
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,125
HAVE NO DEFENSE
AGAINST REPRISAL.

309
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:11,208
THAT IS THE TRUTH OF THIS WORLD.
DEATH IN BATTLE IS INEVITABLE.

310
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,375
AND THIS ONE IS
ABOUT TO LEARN IT FIRSTHAND.

311
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:18,041
- THIS GUY, BAD NEWS.

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,291
SHOW HIM MERCY!

313
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,083
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.

314
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,750
YOU WON, OKAY?
SO PLEASE JUST LET IT GO.

315
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,875
LET HIDEYOSHI LIVE!
HE'S MY--

316
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,375
- ( fighting )

317
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,583
- Keiji:
DON'T KILL HIM!

318
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:42,041
HE'S MY-- MY FRIEND!

319
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,583
- I MERELY DID 
WHAT ANY ADULT WOULD

320
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,625
IN DEALING WITH CHILDREN

321
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,416
WHO ARE IGNORANT
IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD.

322
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,583
- Keiji:
HIDEYOSHI, YOU ALIVE?

323
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,791
SO, YEAH. LET'S NOT DO
THAT AGAIN.

324
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,291
WHEN TESTING OUR STRENGTH,
LET'S CHOOSE BETTER OPPONENTS.

325
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,208
'CAUSE, OW.

326
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,666
- Soldier:
THERE THEY ARE!

327
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,166
- Keiji: CRAP.

328
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,166
IT'S THOSE GUYS
FROM THE OTHER DAY.

329
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,000
- DAMN YOU, MEDDLING RATS!

330
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,333
- I SHALL NOT BE FORGIVING YOU.
NO, SIR, I WILL NOT.

331
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,291
- CHIEF ABBOT KENYO
MAY HAVE LAUGHED IT OFF,

332
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,208
BUT OUR GUTS-- I MEAN OUR BLOOD
IS STILL BOILING!

333
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,083
- Keiji:
WE'RE SORRY,

334
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,416
WARRIOR MONKS OF HONGANJI.

335
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,958
WE JUST GOT A LITTLE
TOO CARRIED AWAY IS ALL.

336
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,500
SEE, I'M SORRY.

337
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,833
IF YOU WANT, WE'LL GO
SEE KENYO NOW, AND--

338
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,666
HIDEYOSHI?

339
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,041
- STRENGTH IS ALL.

340
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,166
SOME HAVE IT, AND SOME DO NOT.

341
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:09,458
THIS LITTLE EXERCISE
HAS SHOWN ME HOW I MUST PROCEED.

342
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,458
- Keiji:
HIDEYOSHI, DON'T!  HIDEYOSHI!

343
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,208
- TO LACK STRENGTH IS CRIMINAL.

344
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:33,041
THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE IT,
HAVE NO FUTURE.

345
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,708
MARK MY WORDS,

346
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,083
I'LL BE THE STRONGEST!

347

MAGNIFICENT CRAFTSMANSHIP.

349
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,125
A TRULY SUBLIME PIECE OF WORK.

350
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,250
THIS IS MOST GENEROUS.

351
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,625
- I HAVE NO NEED
OF SUCH TRINKETS.

352
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,208
- OF COURSE YOU DO NOT.

353
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,500
SWORDS ARE SUPERFLUOUS
ON YOUR ROAD TO SUPREMACY.

354
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,416
YOUR STRENGTH DEPENDS
ON NO OBJECT.

355
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,916
THAT IS TO BE RESPECTED.

356

WE ARE GLAD IT PLEASES YOU.

358
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,291
WE'D LIKE YOU TO THINK OF IT
AS A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH.

359
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,416
- HANBEI, I WILL LEAVE
THE REST TO YOU.

360
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,750
- CERTAINLY.

361
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:25,958
- WELL NOW, NATURALLY I'M
FAMILIAR WITH HIS NAME.

362
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,250
BUT HAVE I MET
YOUR LORD SOMEWHERE

363
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,666
AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST?

364
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,375
- THE REMUNERATION DUE
UPON YOUR SUCCESS.

365
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,416
- OH.
- SUCH BEING THE CASE,

366
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,791
WE WOULD LIKE YOU
TO INTERCEPT DATE'S FORCE

367
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,333
CURRENTLY HEADED FOR OSAKA.

368

- Narrator:
MEANWHILE, HAVING ENTERED

369
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,916
THE LAND OF OWARI,

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,375
THE DATE ARMY FOUND THEIR CAMP
BEING SURROUNDED

371
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,791
BY AN UNKNOWN FORCE.

372
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,666
- WHERE'D THEY COME FROM?

373
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,083
- YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S THE TOYOTOMI?

374
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,291
- LOOKS LIKE BANDITS, BIG BOSS.

375
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,041
- WELL, THEY'VE GOT
SOME KIND OF NERVE.

376
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,791
CLEARLY THEY'VE GOT NO IDEA
WHO THEY'RE MESSING WITH.

377
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,333
GUESS THEY'LL HAVE TO LEARN
THE HARD WAY.

378
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,250
- HANG ON, WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT HUMONGOUS WEAPON?

379
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,375
- ISN'T THAT, A SHIP'S ANCHOR?!

380
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:25,416
- SORRY, FELLAS.
I THINK WE'RE, UH--

381
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,625
OH, YOU AIN'T
GOING TO LIKE THIS.

382
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,625
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BORROW
YOUR HORSES FOR A BIT.

383
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,416
- ( theme music plays )

384
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,416
- Toyotomi:
I AM TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI.

385
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,916
IF YOU TRULY FEAR
FOR THIS COUNTRY, COME!

386
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,833
GATHER AT MY SIDE
FOR OUR NEXT TRIUMPH!

387
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,875
NOTHING IS BEYOND MY GRASP.

388
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,625
FOR AS LONG AS I DRAW BREATH,

389
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,250
I WILL NOT LET THIS COUNTRY
FALL TO RUIN!
