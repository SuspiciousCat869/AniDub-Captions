1
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,291
- WE ARE SO SORRY, BIG BOSS.

2
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,083
- WE SEARCHED ALL OVER
THE PLAINS OF SURIAGEHARA,

3
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,083
BUT WE COULDN'T FIND THE LAST
OF YOUR SIX SWORDS.

4
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,166
- NO WORRIES.

5
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,625
THE ONES I GOT LEFT
WILL DO ME JUST FINE.

6
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,041
- BOSS KATAKURA!

7
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,208
- WHAT THE HELL'S ALL THIS?
SPEAK, KOJURO.

8
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,625
- I HAVE FAILED YOU,
SO I MUST TAKE MY OWN LIFE.

9
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,041
- WHAT?

10
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,833
- ON THAT BATTLEFIELD
AT HITOTORIBASHI.

11
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,458
THOUGH WE SECURED VICTORY
FOR OURSELVES,

12
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,208
I SWORE AN OATH
TO PROTECT YOUR BACK,

13
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:37,083
YET I ALLOWED YOU TO SUFFER
A MOST GRIEVOUS INJURY.

14
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,958
- AH, IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

15
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,166
NO, LORD.
WITH THE SLIGHTEST DEVIATION,

16
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,375
THAT WOUND COULD HAVE TAKEN
NOT ONLY THE USE OF YOUR SWORDS,

17
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,375
BUT ALSO YOUR LIFE.

18
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,333
- ( gasping )

19
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,541
- I KNOW THIS IS
HIGHLY IRREGULAR,

20
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,833
PERHAPS DRASTIC,

21
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,541
BUT I MUST PAY FOR MY MISTAKE.

22
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,625
- NO, BOSS KATAKURA, WAIT.
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

23
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,458
- JUST HOLD ON A MINUTE
HERE, BOSS.

24
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,916
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,625
SOMEONE'S GOTTA ACT
AS YOUR SECOND.

26
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,625
- BIG BOSS, NO!

27
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,125
- ( groaning )
- BIG BOSS!

28
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,916
- OH, MAN, WITH HIS
INJURED RIGHT HAND EVEN.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,583
- AND THAT CUT HAD GOUGED HIM
ALL THE WAY TO THE BONE.

30
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,208
- THIS IS MADNESS.

31
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,583
- YOU GOTTA STOP CODDLING ME
LIKE I'M A CHILD.

32
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,958
YOU'RE MY RIGHT EYE,
DAMN IT.

33
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,333
IF I LOSE MY RIGHT ARM,

34
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,375
DON'T WASTE MY TIME
SPILLING YOUR GUTS OUT.

35
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,916
YOU BECOME MY RIGHT ARM, TOO.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,041
AS YOU CAN SEE, NOT A SINGLE
BLADE TOUCHED MY BACK.

37
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,833
AND BESIDES...

38
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:30,583
I STILL GOT ALL OF MY CLAWS,
TODAY, TOMORROW, WHENEVER.

39
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,875
SO YOU GOT NOTHING
TO ATONE FOR.  ARE WE CLEAR?

40
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,833
- LORD MASAMUNE.

41
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,083
- WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
WE'RE COOL.

42
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:46,250
- I AM SORRY.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

43
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,833
- I, KOJURO,

44
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,500
WILL SERVE AS YOUR RIGHT EYE
WITH EVEN GREATER RESOLVE.

45
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,333
MAY I OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS

46
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,583
FOR YOUR CONQUEST OF OSHU.

47
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,833
- All:
CONGRATULATIONS, BIG BOSS.

48
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,500
- KOJURO.

49
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,958
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS, YOU READY?
- YEAH!

50
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,833
- PICK UP THE PACE.
- YEAH!

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,416
- LET'S FIRE IT UP!
- YEAH!

52
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,333
- NOW GO KICK SOME ASS!
- YEAH!

53
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,916
- BIG BOSS, UESUGI'S ARMY IS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,791
- WHAT?

55
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,625
- THERE'S TOO MANY OF 'EM
FOR US TO MAKE IT THROUGH

56
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,875
WITHOUT A BUNCH OF TROUBLE.

57
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,750
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )


58
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,166
- BIG BOSS, IT'S NO USE.

59
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,958
NO MATTER WHAT WE SAY, THOSE
UESUGI JERKS JUST IGNORE US.

60
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,333
AND THEY'RE BLOCKING ALL
THE PATHS GOING AROUND 'EM, TOO.

61
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,708
- SORRY, BOSS, WE DIDN'T SPOT
ANYONE EVEN RESEMBLING

62
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,500
THE WAR GOD OF ECHIGO.

63
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:30,125
- MAYBE THE UESUGI HAVE ALREADY
BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE TOYOTOMI.

64
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,500
- SO THEN, COULD THERE BE
OTHERS?

65
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,458
CRAP, THEY'RE TRYING
TO BOX US IN AGAIN.

66
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:38,625
- OH, SHUT IT.  GETTING ALL
WORKED UP ISN'T GONNA HELP US.

67
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,500
- HAD TO BE HITOTORIBASHI.

68
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,291
- PARDON THE INTRUSION,
MY DEAR KATAKURA.

69
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:13,958
YOUR LORD IS REALLY
QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

70
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:18,083
NANBU, TSUGARU, SOHMA
AND ASHINA BOXED HIM IN.

71
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,208
FOUR ENTIRE ARMIES AND IT WOULD
APPEAR HE NEVER SUCCUMBED.

72
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,125
I TRULY DID NOT THINK
THE DATE COULD ACCOMPLISH

73
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,208
SO MUCH WITHOUT YOU.
- OF COURSE THEY COULD.

74
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,875
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE
LORD MASAMUNE.

75
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,083
- YES, WELL, THOUGH MY HOPE
HAD BEEN FOR HIDEYOSHI

76
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,125
TO CONSERVE HIS ENERGIES,

77
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,666
I WOUND UP NEEDING HIM
TO PAY A PERSONAL VISIT TO OSHU.

78
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,875
YOU CAN REST EASY.

79
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,791
AS TO THE DEAR MASAMUNE'S FATE,
I WON'T TORTURE YOU

80
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,625
BY WITHHOLDING
THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME.

81
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,708
A SOUVENIR,

82
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,625
COLLECTED BY A SOLDIER
IN LORD HIDEYOSHI'S CONTINGENT.

83
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,916
ONE OF DEAR MASAMUNE'S
VAUNTED DRAGON CLAWS, YES?

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,208
I WON'T ASK THAT YOU JOIN
OUR CAUSE IMMEDIATELY.

85
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,875
I WANT TO GIVE YOU TIME
TO ACCEPT

86
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,166
THAT THE MAN YOU ONCE SERVED
IS NO MORE.

87
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,500
ALTHOUGH I CANNOT WAIT
FOR TOO LONG,

88
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,208
I'M NOT A HEARTLESS MAN.

89
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,750
I CAN SYMPATHIZE WITH WHAT
YOU MUST BE GOING THROUGH.

90
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:31,375
- Toyotomi: HANBEI, RESORTING
TO SUCH MEASURES IS UNNECESSARY.

91
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,291
- HE WILL BE OF USE TO YOU,
WITHOUT FAIL.

92
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,750
I FEEL I MUST APOLOGIZE.
- FOR WHAT?

93
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,333
- FOR WASTING YOUR TIME
WITH A TRIP TO OSHU.

94
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,666
- YOU SEEMED FAIRLY CONCERNED
ABOUT THE DATE.

95
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,875
I WANTED TO SEE FOR MYSELF.

96
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,125
- I NEVER IMAGINED THEY WOULD
BREAK THROUGH

97
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,000
SUCH AN ENCIRCLEMENT.

98
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,500
WITH MY MISHANDLING
OF KAWANAKAJIMA,

99
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,583
TWICE NOW,
I HAVE UTTERLY FAILED YOU.

100
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,708
- PAY IT NO MIND.
FOR IN THE END,

101
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,708
EVEN I RETURNED WITHOUT SENDING
THE ALREADY INJURED

102
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,916
ONE-EYED DRAGON
TO MEET HIS MAKER.

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,041
- TRUE, THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

104
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,458
THOUGH I AM CERTAIN YOU
HAD GOOD REASON

105
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,625
FOR NOT FINISHING HIM OFF.

106
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,541
AT THE VERY LEAST,

107
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,791
NOW WE ARE FREE TO BEGIN
OUR INVASION OF SHIKOKU.

108
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,750
NOW OUR IMPECCABLY TRAINED
ARMY AWAITS YOUR ORDERS

109
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,458
TO LEAD THEM IN GLORIOUS BATTLE.

110
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,166
- MY BRAVEST AND MIGHTIEST
SOLDIERS, HEAR ME.

111
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,208
COME WITH ME AND REIGN SUPREME
OVER ALL.

112
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,416
IN ORDER TO KEEP THIS LAND
FROM FALLING TO RUIN,

113
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,833
IN ORDER TO BUILD A NEW ERA,

114
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,666
THE TIME HAS COME TO GO TO WAR.

115
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,500
- ( cheering )

116
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,958
- JUST LIKE THEIR STANDOFFS
AGAINST THE TAKEDA.

117
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,291
THEY SURE TAKE
THEIR SWEET-ASS TIME.

118
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,833
THE WAR GOD OF ECHIGO.

119
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,083
- LORD UESUGI.

120
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,041
- BIG BOSS,
THERE GONNA BE A FIGHT?

121
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,958
- NAH, YOU BOYS CAN ENJOY
YOUR PICNIC FOR A WHILE LONGER.

122
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,458
TOYOTOMI AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

123
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,916
- LORD KENSHIN.

124
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,458
- KASUGA, WHAT NEWS HAVE YOU
TO REPORT?

125
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,625
- IT SEEMS THE ALLIANCE
HAS NOW BEEN FORMED.

126
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,666
TOYOTOMI APPEARS
TO BE MAKING PREPARATIONS

127
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,791
TO SEND HIS MAIN ARMY WEST.

128
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,458
AS YOU GUESSED, IT IS BELIEVED
HE WILL ATTACK SHIKOKU

129
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,166
WITH MORI.
- I SEE, THANK YOU.

130
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,875
- ALSO REGARDING MAEDA KEIJI.

131
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,625
IT SEEMS HE IS MAKING
HIS WAY TO OSAKA.

132
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,708
WHO KNOWS WHAT
HE INTENDS TO DO.

133
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,583
- THEN YOU ARE CONCERNED
FOR HIM.

134
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,916
- NO, MY LORD.
I MERELY ASSUMED

135
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,250
THAT YOU MIGHT BE CURIOUS
ABOUT HIS SAFETY.

136
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,875
- MY MOST BEAUTIFUL BLADE.

137
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,833
HOW I ADMIRE
YOUR GENTLE NATURE.

138
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,250
TRULY IT WARMS ME TO MY HEART.

139
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,500
- ( shouts )

140
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,750
- THEY'RE GOING TO WAR.

141
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,250
THERE HE IS.

142
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:50,458
HIDEYOSHI, HOLD UP.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

143
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,375
DISSOLVE YOUR ALLIANCE
WITH THE MAEDA.

144
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,375
STOP TRYING TO FORCE EVERYONE
TO YOUR SIDE.

145
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,708
HIDEYOSHI!  HIDEYOSHI!

146
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,791
PLEASE LISTEN
TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

147
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,750
DAMN IT, STOP!

148
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,291
- HELLO, DEAR KEIJI,
YOU SEEM WELL.

149
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,791
- HANBEI.

150
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,000
- AH, YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

151
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,541
STILL HAVE THAT SAME LOOK
IN YOUR EYES.

152
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,958
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED, EITHER.

153
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,583
- I'VE HEARD THE NEWS
FROM TEDORIGAWA.

154
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,000
IF YOU HADN'T FLED
AFTER YOUR SHOW OF DEFIANCE,

155
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,916
THE MAEDA ARMY ITSELF WOULD HAVE
BEEN HELD RESPONSIBLE

156
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,625
FOR THE SHOW OF HOSTILITY
AGAINST TOYOTOMI. REMEMBER THAT.

157
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,250
- THE MAEDA WILL NOT HELP
THE TOYOTOMI

158
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,625
OPPRESS INNOCENT PEOPLE.  NOW
JUST LET ME TALK TO HIDEYOSHI.

159
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,958
- HIDEYOSHI'S GAZE
IS UPON THE WORLD.

160
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,666
A MAN WHO THRIVES ON DEBAUCHERY,
WHO ONLY GOES ONLY

161
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,958
WHERE THE WIND MAY
CARRY HIM.

162
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,041
SHOUT INTO HIS EAR.

163
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,708
HE WILL NOT HEAR
SUCH A MAN'S WORDS.

164
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,875
HE IS IN A DIFFERENT WORLD
FROM YOU NOW.

165
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,041
- WHO ARE YOU INVADING?
SHIKOKU?

166
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,875
- Sanada: HERE, AS ELSEWHERE,
THERE ARE NO MEN LEFT.

167
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,083
THEIR FATHERS,
THEIR HUSBANDS AND SONS,

168
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,625
THEY'VE ALL BEEN SENT OFF
TO WAR.

169
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,375
- YUKIMURA, IS SOMETHING AMISS?

170
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,166
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

171
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,916
- ONCE AGAIN, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY, MASTER OYAMADA.

172
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,625
I SIMPLY COULD
NOT IGNORE THIS.

173
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,791
- IT'S FINE, BUT WE
SHOULD HURRY ON OUR WAY.

174
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,041
- WE WIELD OUR MILITARY MIGHT,

175
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,250
PRIDE OURSELVES ON OUR STRENGTH
FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS LAND.

176
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,041
WE FIGHT EACH OTHER OVER IT.

177
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,333
I NEVER QUESTIONED ANY OF IT
IN THE SLIGHTEST,

178
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,083
BUT IN ALL THIS TIME,

179
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,875
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE
WE ACTUALLY HELPED?

180
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,166
- PLEASE, YOUR LORDSHIP,

181
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,041
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME, AT
THE END OF ALL THIS WAR-MAKING,

182
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,125
WILL THIS LAND
OF THE RISING SUN

183
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,250
EVER FINALLY KNOW PEACE?

184
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,833
- WHAT ON EARTH'S GOING
ON DOWN THERE?

185
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,416
- THAT'S TOYOTOMI'S BANNER.

186
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,041
- PERHAPS THEIR ALLIANCE
WITH MORI HAS COME TO FRUITION.

187
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,250
THEY'RE INVADING
SHIKOKU TOGETHER.

188
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,791
- AND REMEMBER,
IN THIS MATTER,

189
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,041
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE,
BOY.

190
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,041
- HOW COULD I HAVE
LET THIS HAPPEN?

191
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,541
WITHOUT REALIZING IT,
I'VE BEEN NEGLECTING MY MISSION.

192
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,208
YOUR LORDSHIP,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME!

193
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,333
- Katakura: THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO FINALLY

194
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,875
REVEAL YOURSELF AS A CONTENDER.

195
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,833
FIRST, LET US STRIKE AT
THE DEADLOCK AT KAWANAKAJIMA.

196
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,375
TAKEDA AND UESUGI HAVE STOOD OFF
AGAINST EACH OTHER THERE

197
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,833
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

198
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,500
- KOJURO.
- SIR.

199
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,541
- AFTER HITOTORIBASHI,

200
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,625
WHY WERE YOU GONNA COMMIT
HARA-KIRI?

201
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,875
- IT WAS BECAUSE
I WAS RESPONSIBLE

202
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,541
FOR THE TERRIBLE INJURY YOU
SUSTAINED DURING THAT BATTLE.

203
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,458
- I WANNA KNOW THE REAL STORY.

204
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,125
I SAW A CHANCE TO UNIFY OSHU
IN ONE QUICK STRIKE

205
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,791
AND TOOK THE OFFENSIVE,

206
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,916
BUT YOU WERE AGAINST US
GOING TO WAR THAT TIME.

207
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,708
- REGARDLESS,
WE WERE VICTORIOUS,

208
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,041
AND ALL OF OSHU IS NOW
UNDER DATE CONTROL.

209
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,541
- BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

210
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,000
WE SUFFERED UNBELIEVABLE
CASUALTIES.

211
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,791
YOU WERE GONNA TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY

212
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,166
FOR THE WHOLE DAMN THING
AND LEAVE ME--

213
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,125
- I HAD INTENDED
TO TRY AND MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND

214
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,166
WHAT IT WOULD MEAN
TO SUFFER A TRUE LOSS.

215
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,541
YOU MAY WIN THE WAR,

216
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,041
BUT IF YOU HAVE NO ONE LEFT
TO SHARE WHAT COMES AFTER.

217
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,208
YOU WERE STILL YOUNG,

218
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,708
AND I HAD INTENDED TO FORCE
THIS REALIZATION UPON YOU

219
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,208
BY REMOVING YOUR RIGHT EYE
ONCE AGAIN.

220
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,583
- SHUT THE HELL UP!

221
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,500
YOU DON'T GET TO BE COCKY.

222
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,000
I'M NO MATCH FOR YOU.

223
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,500
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

224
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,125
- I MUST HUMBLY DISAGREE.

225
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:14,416
- NEVER AGAIN WILL I LET
THE DATE ARMY LOSE ANOTHER SOUL.

226
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,166
- LORD MASAMUNE.

227
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,041
MY RESOLVE IS FIRM.

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,916
- Man:
HEY, UESUGI'S PULLING OUT!

229
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,958
- THEY'RE LEAVING?
- ( murmuring )

230
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,500
- Kasuga:
MY LORD KENSHIN,

231
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,375
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS
OF ALL PLACES TO STALL DATE?

232
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,833
- IN THE DAYS BEFORE DATE
HAD CONQUERED ALL OF OSHU,

233
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,916
I AM TOLD THIS IS WHERE HE
FOUGHT HIS MOST DESPERATE BATTLE

234
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,125
AND WHERE HE SUFFERED
HIS GREATEST LOSSES.

235
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,666
TO CALM THE DRAGON'S
IMPETUOUS SOUL,

236
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,375
TO HELP HEAL HIS WOUNDS

237
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,625
AND REBUILD HIS STRENGTH,

238
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,500
NO OTHER PLACE COULD HAVE
SERVED AS WELL.

239
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,791
- BIG BOSS?

240
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,250
- I'M GONNA GO SAY
A QUICK THANK YOU.

241
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,333
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MILORD,
WHY GO TO SUCH LENGTHS?

242
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,625
- SIMPLE REALLY.

243
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,041
DATE MASAMUNE,
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON,

244
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,875
IS THE MOST WORTHY RIVAL
OF THE YOUNG CUB,

245
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,583
WHOM THE TIGER OF KAI HAS
MENTORED WITH GREAT CARE.

246
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,458
AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE

247
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,833
HE IS A MAN CAPABLE
OF QUELLING THE WARS

248
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,041
THAT WILL FOREVER
PLAGUE MANKIND.

249
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,541
- LORD KENSHIN!

250
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,166
- ( gasping )

251
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,166
- I HAD A NICE CHANCE
TO COOL DOWN THERE.

252
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,208
- AN INDOMITABLE SPIRIT.

253
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,666
THE REST WILL BE UP TO YOU
AND HEAVEN'S WILL.

254
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,208
- I'D SAY THAT WAS A CLEVER
STUNT YOU PULLED,

255
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:55,000
BUT DON'T COUNT ME
IN YOUR DEBT.

256
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,583
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET THIS.

257
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,250
- SHOULD YOU FAIL TO RETURN,

258
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,250
I SHALL CLAIM OSHU
AND UNIFY IT IN YOUR MEMORY.

259
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,708
IT WOULD NOT BE SO TERRIBLE
A PLACE TO SEEK

260
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,125
TO CONQUER
THE COUNTRY FROM.

261
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,583
YOU NEED NOT FEAR
FOR YOUR PEOPLE.

262
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,375
YOU'RE A CRAFTY SON OF A BITCH.

263
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,541
YOU REMIND ME A LOT
OF THE TIGER OF KAI.

264
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,916
- I CAN THINK OF
NO GREATER COMPLIMENT.

265
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,625
- OKAY, BOYS,
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

266
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,625
- ( cheering )
- LOCK AND LOAD.

267
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,166
- YEAH!
- GET READY.

268
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,833
IT'S GONNA BE
ONE HELL OF A PARTY!

269
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,541
- Narrator:
AT AROUND THE SAME TIME,

270
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,375
ON THE INLAND SEA OF SETO,

271
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,875
CHOSOKABE OF SHIKOKU AND MORI
OF AKI HAD BEGUN THEIR BATTLE

272
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,500
FOR SUPREMACY
IN SPECTACULAR FASHION.

273
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:52,416
- DOESN'T MATTER IF THAT BASTARD
JOINS FORCES WITH TOYOTOMI.

274
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,791
I'LL PUT AN END
TO THIS RIGHT QUICK.

275
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,458
WELL, AVAST.
THEY'RE ALL A-PANIC

276
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,583
'CAUSE WE FIRED THE FIRST SHOTS.

277
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:08,333
THE FUGAKU'S FINALLY COMPLETE
WITH HER 11-FOOT CANNON.

278
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,458
WE'LL TAKE A MINUTE HERE
TO CRUSH MORI

279
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,750
AND THEN WE'LL TAKE THE REST
OF THE COUNTRY.

280
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,458
GOT IT, YOU SONS OF BITCHES?

281
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,958
- AYE, CAPTAIN!

282
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:28,333
- CHOSOKABE'S FORTRESS,
THE FUGAKU.

283
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:32,208
THAT IS ONE FINE PIECE OF WORK.

284
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,375
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )


285
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,541
- Chosokabe:
ALL RIGHT, YOU SONS OF BITCHES.

286
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,541
NEXT TIME, THE OGRE OF THE
WESTERN SEA WILL BE KNOCKING OUT

287
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,000
BOTH TOYOTOMI AND MORI.

288
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,833
YOU FOLKS SITTING COZY
BETTER GET READY FOR IT, TOO.

289
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:16,708
DON'T MISS THE BOAT AS WE SET
SAIL TO CONQUER THE COUNTRY!
