1
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,708

00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,458
- ( men urging horses )

3
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,666
- THIS IS KIND OF RECKLESS,

4
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,166
BUT WE SHOULD REACH
AZUCHI CASTLE

5
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,041
BEFORE ODA'S FORCES
MAKE IT BACK FROM HONNOJI.

6
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,083
- YEAH, BUT THERE'S NO POINT
IF WE END UP CAUGHT

7
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,458
IN THE MIDDLE, IS THERE?

8
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,125
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE THAT PART TO ME.

9
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,791
- LORD MASAMUNE.
- HUH?

10
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,083
- YOU ANTICIPATED ALL OF THIS
HAPPENING, DID YOU NOT?

11
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,375
THAT WAS WHY
YOU DISBANDED YOUR ARMY,

12
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:36,041
AND ROUSED ME
WHEN MY SPIRITS WERE LOW.

13
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,833
- EVERY LAST ONE OF
THEM KNEW IT WAS TIME

14
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,625
TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE.

15
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,208
I DON'T LIKE RUNNING
WITH SUCH A BIG CREW,

16
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,000
BUT I CAN'T MISS
A CRAZY ASS PARTY LIKE THIS.

17
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,333
SO, BOYS, ARE YOU READY?

18
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,500
- All: YEAH!

19
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,791

20
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,291

- ( all yelling )

22
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:02,750
- 'KAY, ONE FELL SWOOP,
AZUCHI WILL BE ODA'S GRAVE!

23
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,625
- OUR FUTURE CANNOT LIE
WITH SUCH A HEARTLESS SAVAGE.

24
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,875
WE OFFER HIM ONLY
PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD.

25
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,166
- All: YEAH!

26
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,458
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
LET'S GET PSYCHED!

27
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,708
- ( all yell )

28
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,208
- ( theme song playing )

29
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,583
- HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO SPREAD
PEACE LIKE MY LORD NAGAMASA,

30
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,916
BUT INSTEAD...

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,666
- THIS FROM THE WOMAN WHO
MERELY LETS THE CURRENTS

32
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,000
BATTER HER AROUND?

33
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,250
I WISH ONLY FOR WHAT
MY LORD KAZUSANOSUKE WISHES.

34
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,500
MY DEVOTION TO HIM
POWERS MY VERY BEING.

35
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:05,083
- PLEASE, NOHIME,
LET ME SEE MY BROTHER.

36
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,791
- THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT.

37
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,333
- ( gun cocking )

38
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,416
- FOOLISH SISTER-IN-LAW.

39
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,791
AT LEAST PERISH
WITHOUT SUFFERING.

40
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:14,833
- ( gasps )

41
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,458

- ( gunshot )

43
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,958
- SINCE YOU ARE THE RIGHT EYE,
I THINK I SHALL TAKE YOUR LEFT.

44
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,750
- YOU ARE WELCOME TO TRY.

45
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,250
EVEN IF YOU TAKE THEM BOTH,
I AM KATAKURA KOJURO,

46
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,583
AND I WILL ALWAYS BE
THE RIGHT EYE OF THE DRAGON.

- ( coughs )

48

- ( grunting )

49
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,125
- PLEASE, QUENCH MY
PARCHED SOUL,

50
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,416
WITH YOUR BLOOD AND YOUR TEARS.

51
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,541
- NARUKAMI ROAR!

52
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,375
- IT HURTS SO MUCH.

53
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,416
IS IT HOT?

54
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,750
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL EXTINGUISH YOUR FLAME.

55

- ( Ranmaru exhales )

56
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,833
IT'S HOT. SO HOT.

57
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,958
NOHIME, LORD NOBUNAGA.

58
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,125
- FIEND!

59
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,083
- DON'T TELL ME
THIS ISN'T FUN FOR YOU.

60
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,250
( laughs maliciously )

61
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,875
"HE WOULDN'T KILL A CHILD,
WOULD HE?"

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,416
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

63
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,375
LOOK HOW WEAK HE IS.

64
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,750
IF YOU DON'T DO
SOMETHING SOON...

65

67
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,916
- HE IS NOT JUST SOME CHILD.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,750
- THAT BOY HAS TAKEN
COUNTLESS LIVES.

69
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,916

OH, THERE'S A CHILL
RUNNING THROUGH ME.

82

YOU NO LONGER HAVE A HOME
TO RETURN TO.

YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW.

THEY ARE IMPENETRABLE.

106

IS YOUR WOUND BOTHERING YOU?

108

00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,916
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY
HAD BETTER AIM, THOUGH.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,416
- WHO? YOU MEAN...

124
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,458

- IS THAT ALL?

142

SHE LOVED YOU
WITH ALL OF HER HEART.

YOU HAVE NO OTHER RECOURSE HERE,
EXCEPT TO RUN ME THROUGH.

00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,041
I AM CERTAIN HE WOULD HAVE...

166
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,250
- ( explosions )

167
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,666
- DEVIL KING!

168
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,958
ALL THIS AND FOR WHAT?

169
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,083
- TWO MORE FOOLS NOW.

170
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,750
DID YOU COME HERE
LOOKING TO TAKE MY HEAD?

171
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,250
LUDICROUS!

172
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,250
- BEFORE WE CUT YOU DOWN,
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANNA ASK.

173
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,666
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

174
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,041
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WITH MY ONE GOOD EYE,

175
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,291
ALL I SEE IS A MONSTER.

176
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,166
ALL THE MALICE AND EVIL THAT
EVER HAS OR EVER WILL RUN

177
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,791
RAMPANT IN THIS WORLD

178
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,583
TWISTED INTO SOMETHING
RESEMBLING A MAN.

179
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,041
- I AM ODA NOBUNAGA.

180
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,375
THE DEVIL KING,
COME FROM THE SIXTH HEAVEN!

181
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,666
- DEVIL KING, FACING YOU NOW,
I FULLY UNDERSTAND,

182
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,083
THAT IS NOT MERELY A NAME.

183
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,750
- THEN DO YOUR WORST.

184
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,750
I WILL DRINK SAKE
FROM YOUR EMPTY SKULLS.

185
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,083
- AH, GIMME A BREAK.

186
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,375
DO YOU REHEARSE
THAT CRAP YOU'RE SPEWING?

187
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,583
- YOUR ARMS CARRY OUT
THE CRUELEST DEEDS,

188
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,541
DOING THE BIDDING OF YOUR
STAGNANT, ARROGANT HEART.

189
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,458
WE WILL PUT AN END TO THEM
HERE AND NOW.

190
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,458
- YES, OF COURSE YOU WILL.

191
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,583
- ( both yelling )

192
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,666
- ( Oda yells )

193
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,708
( grunts )

194
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,750
ENOUGH. IMBECILES.

195
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,541
PROSTRATE YOURSELVES NOW
OR BE SENT TO THE WORLD BEYOND.

196
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,875
- ( clamoring )

197
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,583
- THEY'VE FINALLY
BROKEN THROUGH.

198
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,916
- MASTER SANADA, ONE EYED
DRAGON. IT'S UP TO YOU.

199
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,500
- SOARING PHOENIX!

200
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,875
- LAUGHABLE!

201
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,458
- WAR DANCE!

202
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,375
- BE GONE!

203
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,375
- ( groaning )

204
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,541
- THE TIME FOR FUN
AND GAMES IS OVER.

205
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,791
NOW YOU WILL PAY
FOR YOUR IGNORANCE

206
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,166
WITH YOUR WORTHLESS LIFE.

207
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,125
- AGAIN, HE WOULD GUN
DOWN HIS OWN MEN.

208
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,041
- HERE'S A FINE IDEA.

209
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,375
LET'S GOUGE OUT
YOUR REMAINING EYE.

210
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,166
- YOU JUST TRY IT.

211
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,208
MY EYE WILL BARE ITS FANGS
AND BITE BACK.

212
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,500
- LORD MASAMUNE!

213
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,625
- ALL WHO ARE WEAK
SHALL BE DESTROYED.

214
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,541
THAT IS THE WAY OF THIS WORLD.

215
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,041
BEMOAN IT AND DIE!

216
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,291
- ( all yelling )

217
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,166
- AZAI ARMY, FALL BACK,
YOU'LL BE KILLED.

218
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:03,750
- HOLD FAST.

219
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,125
- IT CAN'T BE.

220
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,166
- Naoe: MASTER TADAKATSU.

221
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,875
- ( Date gasping )

222
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,375
- MASAMUNE, HANG ON.

223
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,958
HONDA TADAKATSU?

224
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,500
- DAMN THAT TOKUGAWA ARMOR.

225
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,166
SO, YOU'RE NOT QUITE DEAD.

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,166
- TADAKATSU!

227
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,333
- ALL WHO DEFY ME
SHALL BE VANQUISHED.

228
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,875
- ODA NOBUNAGA,
YOU CRAVEN BEAST.

229
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,416
AIMING SOLELY FOR THE
CRACKS IN HIS BROKEN ARMOR.

230
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,166
- DON'T LET IT BE IN VAIN.

231
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,250
SEAR THE IMAGE OF HIS
FORM INTO YOUR EYES.

232
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,916
MASTER HONDA.

233
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,083
- Tokugawa: TADAKATSU,
YOU MUST DEFEAT ODA.

234
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,375
HE'S BAD NEWS.

235
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,000
IF SOMEONE DOES
NOT TAKE HIM DOWN,

236
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,000
THIS COUNTRY WILL
HAVE NO FUTURE.

237
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,208
EVEN IF WE MUST MAKE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE,

238
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,541
THOSE WHO COME AFTER US

239
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,250
WILL REALIZE THE WORLD
WE HAVE DREAMED OF.

240
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:31,291
TADAKATSU, SHOW ME YOUR VALOR
ON THE BATTLEFIELD ONCE MORE

241
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,666
AND LIVE UP TO YOUR
MIGHTY NAME, TADAKATSU!

242
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,333
- ( Oda grunts )

243
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,625
YOUR EPITHET
IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

244
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,791
BACK TO THE SCRAP HEAP WITH YOU.

245
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,208
- ( people gasping )

246
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,416
- TADAKATSU, PLEASE,

247
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,625
LORD IEYASU, FOR ALL THAT
HE IS DONE, REWARD HIM!

248
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,958
- ( gasps )

249
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,541
- ( groaning )

250
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,916
ONLY GOT ONE MORE LEFT IN ME.

251
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,833
YOU'LL FINISH IT?

252
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,750
- I SWEAR ON MY LIFE.

253
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,375
- AFTER ALL THIS,
YOU ARE STILL TRYING TO WIN?

254
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,958
YOU ARE BUT INSECTS
TO DEFY MY MILITARY RULE.

255
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,166
- ( Chosokabe laughs )

256
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,375
EXCELLENT. THE FUGAKU CANNON
FOUND ITS TARGET.

257
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,583
ALL RIGHT, YOU DOGS, LET'S CHEW
'EM UP AND SPIT 'EM OUT.

258
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,625

259
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,625
- Mori: I SEE, NOW IS INDEED
THE TIME TO ATTACK.

260
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,291
ONCE ODA HAS BEEN ELIMINATED,

261
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,708
THERE WILL BE NONE
WHO MAY THREATEN

262
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,291
THE PROSPERITY OF MORI
AND THE STABILITY OF AKI.

263
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,291
FORWARD, CHILDREN OF THE SUN,

264
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,166
BURN DOWN THE
DEVIL KING'S CASTLE.

265
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,208
- ( all yelling )

266
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,416
- BOSS OF OSHU, DATE MASAMUNE,

267
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,333
- TAKEDA GENERAL,
SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA.

268
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,208
THE FLAME IN MY HEART
SHALL NEVER EXTINGUISH!

269
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,458
- ( both yelling )

270
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:43,875
- MAEDA.

271
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,208
- HEY, RIGHT EYE OF THE DRAGON.

272
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,666
WE'LL CHAT SOON.
I'M HERE TO HELP.

273
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,333
IT'S THE BIG FINALE!

274
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,541
- CLEAR THE WAY!

275
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,750
- ( men grunting )

276
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,583
- NIGHTFALL.

277
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,291
- EXCUSE ME, COMING THROUGH!

278
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,750
- ( men screaming )

279
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,375
- Matsu: MY LORD INUCHIYO, STEEL
YOURSELF FOR WHAT AWAITS YOU.

280
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,791
FOR NO MATTER WHAT
THE FUTURE MAY HOLD,

281
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,000
YOUR WIFE SHALL
REMAIN AT YOUR SIDE.

282
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,750
- OKAY, MATSU, BUT COOK
SOMETHING GOOD WHEN WE'RE DONE.

283
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,208
- ( grunts )

284
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,250
- ( men screaming )

285
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,958
- I WILL NOT FALL.

286
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,333
I FOLLOW THE ROAD TO SUPREMACY.

287
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,500
I WILL BRING THIS WORLD
UNDER WARRIOR RULE!

288
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,291
- IT'S THE LAST SHOT,
SANADA YUKIMURA.

289
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,750
- I AM RIGHT HERE WITH YOU,
LORD MASAMUNE.

290
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,375
- ( both grunting )

291
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,041
- BURN! BURN ABLAZE!

292
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,333
- REST IN PEACE!

293
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,625
- ( all yelling )

294
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,250
- SCATTERED WILL BE
BLACK MISFORTUNE,

295
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,041
FLOODING OUT
FROM UNDER THE HEAVENS,

296
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,333
TO ETERNALLY DAMN THIS WORLD.

297
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,625
THIS WAS INEVITABLE.

298
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,750
- ( groaning )

299
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,708
- ( all cheering )
- BOSS!

300
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,916
- Narrator: ODA NOBUNAGA, THE
DEVIL KING OF THE SIXTH HEAVEN,

301
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,708
PERISHED AT AZUCHI CASTLE.

302
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,750
WITH THE FALL OF THE ODA FAMILY,

303
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,208
THE FIELD OF WARFARE
OPENED UP AGAIN.

304
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,208
WARLORDS WERE ONCE AGAIN
FREE TO VIE FOR POWER

305
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,375
OVER THIS
LAND OF THE RISING SUN.

306
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,416
- SO, HEY, OUR NINJA CORPS

307
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,375
HAS MADE THIS AN OFFICIAL
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

308
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,583
- OFFICIAL? YOU MEAN
I WAS YOUR TEST SUBJECT?

309
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,583
- I KNEW THAT YOU'D RUSH
OFF TO OWARI REGARDLESS.

310
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,083
I JUST FIGURED
I HAD TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

311
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,708
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO
GET YOURSELF KILLED, GO AHEAD.

312
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,250
BUT, IF YOU'RE
DETERMINED TO SURVIVE,

313
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,416
NO MATTER WHAT,
FOR THE WAR GOD'S SAKE.

314
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,333
- I FEEL THERE WAS
MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

315
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,625
- HUH?
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

316
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,791
- OH, YEAH. WE'RE ENEMIES.

317
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,708
- NO MERCY. YOU GOT IT.

318
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,958
- ( theme song playing )

319
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,041
- Takeda: YUKIMURA.

320
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:48,875
GO, BOY.

321
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,416
- SIR.

322
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,541
- YOU ARE STILL
A GREAT FORCE TO RECKON WITH.

323
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,958
IF I AM TO PERISH HERE, I SHALL
NOT FEEL ONE SHRED OF REGRET.

324
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:04,458
- MY LORD, YOU AND I
STILL HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO.

325
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,541
THE WORLD DOES NOT BELONG
TO THESE YOUNGSTERS YET.

326
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:11,000
- I AGREE, HEAVEN BE MY WITNESS!

327
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,500
- ( both yelling )

328
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,708
- WELL, IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
SANADA YUKIMURA.

329
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,916
- I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS DAY,

330
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,416
ONE-EYED DRAGON, DATE MASAMUNE.

331
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,708
COME, LET US HAVE A FAIR FIGHT.

332
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,541
- HELL, YEAH.

333
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,458
BUT YOU BETTER BRING
YOUR A-GAME,

334
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,708
SO I CAN ENJOY IT.

335
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,041
HERE WE GO!

336
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,875
- MY SOUL BURNS ABLAZE.

337
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,125
- ( both yelling )
