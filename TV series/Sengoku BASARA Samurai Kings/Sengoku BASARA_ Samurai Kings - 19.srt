1
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,666
- ( explosions )

2
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,750
- ( laughs ) FINALLY,
THE OLD GIRL'S ALL DONE UP.

3
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,875
PACKS ONE HELL OF A PUNCH,
AND IF WE CAN SPOT 'EM,

4
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,500
SHE CAN BLAST 'EM.

5
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,291
NO ONE'S BOARDING US,
THANKS TO THIS LITTLE BEAUT,

6
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,416
THE CROWN JEWEL OF THE FUGAKU.

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,833
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

8
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,666
YOU SONS OF BITCHES
REARING FOR A FIGHT?

9
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,666
- ( cheering )

10
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,583
- CAPTAIN!
- WHAT'S UP, BEKUNOSUKE?

11
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,000
- MORE BOATS COMING ASHORE
FROM THE WEST, CAPTAIN.

12
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,583
HAILING FROM MORI'S DOMAIN
BASED ON THE LOOKS OF 'EM.

13
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,625
- WELL, THEN BRING 'EM ABOARD.
THEY'RE REFUGEES NEEDIN' HELP,

14
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,916
SO THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA GIVE 'EM.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,625
YATARO, HIKOJI, TAKE THIS
BATCH TO YOUR VILLAGE.

16
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,666
MAKE 'EM FEEL AT HOME.
- Both: AYE, CAPTAIN.

17
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,875
- WHERE DO THEY GET OFF,

18
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,458
DRIVING AWAY THEIR OWN PEOPLE
LIKE THEY'RE NOTHING?

19
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,583
- Man: BEGGING YOUR PARDON,
CAPTAIN CHOSOKABE.

20
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,541
I MAY BE OLD, BUT I'VE GOT
SOME FIGHT LEFT IN ME.

21
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,083
- PLEASE, CAPTAIN, SIR,
LET US FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE.

22
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,083
- AT LEAST WE CAN MAKE SURE YOU
AND YOUR MEN ARE WELL FED.

23
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,000
- PERMISSION TO COME ABOARD,
CAPTAIN.

24
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,291
- THESE WOMEN AND CHILDREN CAME
HERE FROM HARIMA AND MIMASA.

25
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,958
AND THE OLD FELLAS ARE
FROM KAWACHI.

26
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,250
- YEAH, THEY ALL FEEL
LIKE THEY OWE YOU ONE.

27
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,916
- CAPTAIN!

28
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,333
- THANKS FOR OFFERING,

29
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,250
BUT THE ANSWER IS NO.

30
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,250
THE FUGAKU'S A PIRATE SHIP.

31
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,125
NO PLACE FOR HONEST FOLK
LIKE YOU.

32
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,208
IT'S A PLACE FOR RUFFIANS,
HARD MEN WHO DON'T FEAR

33
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,041
THE WATERY GRAVE
THAT AWAITS 'EM.

34
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,541
YOUR HUSBANDS AND FATHERS
AND SONS WHO FELL IN BATTLE,

35
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,833
THEY WOULDN'T WANT YOU DOING
THIS.  AIN'T THAT RIGHT?

36
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,375
THE OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA
FIGHTS ON YOUR BEHALF,

37
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,250
SO RETURN TO YOUR LANDS.

38
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,875
FOR YOU,
THE BATTLEFIELD IS BACK HOME.

39
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,583
IT'S TIME TO PIECE YOUR LIVES
TOGETHER AGAIN.

40
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,041
I KNOW, IT AIN'T AS EXCITING
AS SWINGING A SWORD AROUND,

41
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,416
BUT IT'LL WORK.  TRUST ME.

42
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,958
DON'T WORRY, LAD.
I'LL GET THE BAD GUYS.

43
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,083
ALL RIGHT, YOU DOGS.
GET SET FOR A HELL OF A FIGHT.

44
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,083
BLAST MORI AND TOYOTOMI

45
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,500
AND THEN THE WHOLE DAMN COUNTRY
IS OURS.

46
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,416
- AYE, CAPTAIN.

47
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,041
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )


48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,833
- Man: LORD TOSHIIE.
PLEASE WAIT, MILORD.

49
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,416
- Matsu: I BEG OF YOU, MY LORD
INUCHIYO, DO NOT DO THIS.

50
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,208
- Toshiie: LET GO OF ME!
CAN'T YOU ALL UNDERSTAND?

51
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,000
I MUST LEAVE,
FOR THE SAKE OF KAGA.

52
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,375
- Matsu: WIELDING A SPEAR
IN YOUR CONDITION ISN'T BRAVERY.

53
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,875
IT'S SUICIDE.
- NO, UNHAND ME, MATSU.  OW!

54
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,125
I AM THE MASTER OF MY FATE,
AND I'M LEAVING-- OW!

55
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,208
- YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.
- Man: LADY MATSU.

56
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,416
- Toshiie: WAIT.
LET'S TALK THIS OUT.

57
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,916
- Matsu: GOROMARU!
- ( screaming )

58
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,416
( groaning )

59
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,708
KEIJI.
- YEAH, SO LONG TIME NO SEE.

60
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,916
- MATSU, MATSU, IT'S KEIJI.
KEIJI'S FINALLY COME HOME.

61
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,916
- WELCOME BACK.

62
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,458
- Keiji: WHAT WAS ALL
THAT YELLING ABOUT?

63
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,458
- TOYOTOMI HAS CALLED
UPON THE MAEDA.

64
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,666
HE WANTS US TO JOIN
THE RANKS ENCIRCLING KAI.

65
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,958
- ENCIRCLING KAI?  THEY TRYING
TO STARVE THEM OUT OR SOMETHING?

66
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,250
- MATSU.

67
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,041
WITH ODAWARA
AND UTSUNOMIYA TAKEN,

68
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,791
TAKEDA IS PINNED DOWN
ESSENTIALLY.

69
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,916
BUT WITH MOST OF TOYOTOMI'S
FORCES EN ROUTE TO AKI,

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,708
IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT
FOR TAKEDA TO CLAIM OSAKA.

71
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,833
- THAT MAKES SENSE.
IF I KNOW MOTOCHIKA,

72
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,958
HE'S GOING TO GIVE THEM ONE HECK
OF A FIGHT.

73
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,541
BUT TOYOTOMI TOOK UTSUNOMIYA
AND ODAWARA

74
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,333
TO KEEP TAKEDA
WHERE HE IS, RIGHT?

75
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,166
BECAUSE KENSHIN TEAMED WITH
TAKEDA AGAINST THE DEVIL KING

76
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,541
DOESN'T MEAN HE'LL SIDE
WITH HIM THIS TIME AROUND.

77
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,291
- YES, MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY.

78
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,208
OUR LOYALTY TO THE CAUSE
IS BEING TESTED

79
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,458
AND IF WE IGNORE TOYOTOMI'S
ORDERS, HE'LL DESTROY KAGA.

80
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,916
- JUST LIKE THAT?
YOU'RE NO BETTER OFF NOW

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,125
THAN YOU WERE WHEN YOU THREW
IN YOUR LOT WITH THE DEVIL KING.

82
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,458
- YOU'RE WRONG.
TOYOTOMI IS NOT ODA.

83
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,625
LISTEN TO ME, KEIJI.
HE SEEKS ONLY THE HELP

84
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,791
OF THOSE STRONG ENOUGH
TO GIVE IT.

85
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:36,041
TO ATONE FOR THE DARK DEEDS
I COMMITTED AS A MEMBER

86
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,166
OF THE ODA FACTION AND TO
PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF KAGA,

87
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,208
I WILL JOIN THE FIGHT
AGAINST TAKEDA.  I HAVE TO.

88
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,791
THAT IS MY DUTY
AS LEADER OF THE MAEDA FAMILY.

89
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,916
AND AS A WARRIOR,
I'LL FULFILL IT.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,666
- TOSHIIE.
- WHENEVER YOU GO INTO BATTLE,

91
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,666
KNOW THAT MATSU IS
BY YOUR SIDE,

92
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,083
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
OVERDOING IT, UNDERSTAND?

93
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,416
IF THE DAY EVER DAWNS
WHEN I COOK FOR ONLY ONE,

94
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,916
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO.
- MATSU.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WE'LL BE DINING TOGETHER
FOR A LONG TIME.

96
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,791
- I NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

97
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,875
I REALLY BACKED YOU TWO
INTO A CORNER, HUH?

98
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,041
- THIS WASN'T YOUR DOING,
KEIJI.

99
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,750
EVEN IF OUR ATTACK
ON ECHIGO WAS A VICTORY

100
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,416
IN EVERY SENSE
OF THE WORD, I KNEW

101
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,875
IT WOULD COME TO THIS
SOONER OR LATER.

102
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:21,291
MATSU TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED
TO LADY NENE.

103
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,125
I TOLD YOU ONCE THAT TOYOTOMI
WAS THE MAN I'D BE

104
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,541
IF I LOST MATSU,
BUT NOW I KNOW THAT ISN'T TRUE.

105
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,541
THE THINGS THAT MAN HAS DONE
IN THE NAME OF POWER,

106
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,791
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
AND I PRAY I NEVER DO.

107
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:38,041
- KEIJI, ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU
REMAIN TRUE TO YOURSELF.

108
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,583
I'VE BEEN SO QUICK TO VOICE MY
DISAPPROVAL WITH YOU

109
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,000
IN THE PAST, WHEN WHAT I SHOULD
HAVE DONE WAS TAKE A MOMENT

110
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,125
TO ASK MYSELF WHY YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO LIVE A WARRIOR'S LIFE.

111
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,916
- THE BREACH BETWEEN TOYOTOMI
AND YOU CAN NEVER BEEN MENDED.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,083
I UNDERSTAND THIS,
MUCH TOO LATE.

113
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,791
MY COURSE IS SET,
FOR GOOD OR FOR ILL,

114
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,833
BUT BELIEVE ME
WHEN I SAY THIS.

115
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,625
WHATEVER MAY HAPPEN, KEIJI,

116
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:04,208
NO MATTER WHAT THIS WORLD
THROWS AT US, WE ARE FAMILY.

117
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,958
- TOSHIIE, MATSU, I--

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,958
FOR A TRANQUIL LAND
OF THE RISING SUN,

119
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,916
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED
FOR IT.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,375
HAVE WE GOTTEN ANY CLOSER?

121
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,208
- HEY, CAPTAIN.

122
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,708
MORI'S SHIPS ARE JUST LAZING
ABOUT WITH THEIR SAILS TIED UP.

123
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,125
- YOU'RE WAITING FOR TOYOTOMI,
ARE YOU?  WISE MOVE, MOTONARI.

124
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,750
NEVER HEARD TALK OF TOYOTOMI
HAVING A NAVY, THOUGH.

125
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,708
I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.
MAYBE THEY'RE ONTO OUR COURSE

126
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,083
AND THERE'S 10,000 OF THOSE
BASTARDS WAITING FOR US TO LAND.

127
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,666
- WAIT, CAPTAIN, YOU'RE SAYING
THOSE SHIPS OF MORI'S--

128
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,833
- ARE JUST BAIT
TO LURE US CLOSER.

129
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,375
- BAIT US, BRIBE US OR BEG US,
WE'RE TAKING OUT THE LOT OF 'EM.

130
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,708
HIT 'EM LIKE A TYPHOON.  HOLD
'EM BACK AND KNOCK 'EM DOWN.

131
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,291
EASY FOR THE FUGAKU.

132
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,875
ENOUGH LOLLYGAGGING,
YOU SALTY SONS OF BITCHES.

133
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,750
PRIME THE CANNON FOR BATTLE.

134
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,291
WE'RE TAKING DOWN MORI'S NAVY
TODAY.

135
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,083
- ( cheering )

136
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,333
- SEND THEM ALL TO HELL
IF IT BRINGS YOU CLOSER,

137
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,333
YOU COCKSURE FOOL.

138
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,625
- BUT, LORD MORI, AS IMPORTANT
OF A TARGET AS THE FUGAKU IS,

139
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,166
AT THIS RATE,
OUR LOSSES WILL BE--

140
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,625
- OUR LOSSES ARE PART
OF THE PLAN.

141
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,916
WHAT GOOD ARE PAWNS IF NOT TO
FALL AT THEIR MASTER'S COMMAND?

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,750
- QUITE RIGHT, MILORD.

143
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,916
BUT WHAT IS YOUR NEXT MOVE?

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,333
- IF I HAD SPURNED THIS ALLIANCE
WITH TOYOTOMI,

145
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,041
HE WOULD HAVE APPROACHED
CHOSOKABE WITH THE SAME OFFER.

146
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,541
HAVE ONE PUT THEIR BOOT
TO THE OTHER'S THROAT.

147
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:54,166
IN DOING SO, LAY THE FOUNDATION
FOR THE CONQUEST OF KYUSHU.

148
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,875
THAT'S TOYOTOMI'S SCHEME
OR TAKENAKA HANBEI'S, RATHER

149
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,583
I'M MERELY LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO TWIST IT TO MY ADVANTAGE.

150
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,250
- RIGHT.

151
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,458
- THINGS SEEM TO BE GOING
TO PLAN, MY DEAR MOTONARI.

152
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,375
- WE'RE RUNNING
HALF AN HOUR LATE,

153
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,000
AND I'VE LOST MORE SHIPS TO THIS
FEINT THAN WE'D ANTICIPATED.

154
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,250
- YOU'RE TO BE COMMENDED FOR
DRAWING THE FUGAKU OUT THIS FAR.

155
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,666
FEAR NOT.  MY MASTER WILL
SHATTER THE PIRATE'S BONES.

156
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,333
THIS POUND OF FLESH YOUR FOE
HAS CARVED FROM YOU

157
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,416
WILL SURELY BUY THE LAND OF AKI
PEACE AND PROSPERITY.

158
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,333
AKAGAWA, ORDER ALL THE SHIPS
TO RETREAT AT ONCE.

159
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:30,083
- RIGHT.

160
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,250
- CAPTAIN, MORI'S SHIPS
ARE TURNING TAIL.

161
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,333
TOYOTOMI FOOT-SOLDIERS.
A WHOLE MESS OF 'EM.

162
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,916
- WHAT DID I SAY?
LURED US TO THE COAST

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
'CAUSE THEY WANT
TO DUKE IT OUT ON DRY LAND.

164
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:47,375
HAVE IT YOUR WAY, MOTONARI.
YOUR NEW PAL CAN PLAY, TOO.

165
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,041
THAT'S IF YOU CAN DODGE MY
CANNON FIRE LONG ENOUGH FOR ME

166
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,208
TO SAIL OVER
AND KICK YOUR ASSES.

167
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,250
- ( gasps )
- OH!

168
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,416
- Man:
THAT-- THAT'S THE GUY.

169
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,333
- CAPTAIN,
THAT HUGE ENEMY GENERAL'S

170
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,833
WALKING RIGHT OUT
INTO THE SEA.

171
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,041
- WHAT'S THAT LAND SHARK
UP TO?

172
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,333
- CHOSOKABE MOTOCHIKA,

173
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,583
SWEAR FEALTY AND I'LL LET YOU
KEEP YOUR LITTLE FLOATING TOY.

174
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,083
FOR IF YOU REFUSE ME...

175
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,500
( roars )

176
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,750
I PROMISE THAT YOU WILL
MEET YOUR DOOM THIS DAY.

177
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,666
- HE PARTED THE VERY WATERS.

178
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,791
- THE SEA IS GONE.

179
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,541
- CAPTAIN, WHAT IN THE--

180
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,958
WHAT THE NINE HELLS IS HE?

181
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,958
- TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI
IN THE BIG UGLY FLESH.

182
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,750
- CAPTAIN, TROUBLE.
BOTH ARMIES ARE COMING AT US.

183
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,166
- AIM AT THE SCRUFFY BASTARD
IN FRONT.

184
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,583
THAT OCEAN-PUNCHING APE
IS THE TOYOTOMI GENERAL.

185
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,333
- GOT 'EM IN OUR SIGHTS.
- FIRE!

186
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,208
- WHAT?

187
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,458
- ( gasping )

188
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,166
- HE STOPPED AN 11-FOOT
CANNONBALL WITH ONE HAND?

189
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,875
- ONE PUNY GUN WAS THE SOURCE
OF YOUR HUBRIS.

190
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,916
YOU ARE NO WARRIOR.
NO OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA.

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,833
YOU'RE JUST A WHARF RAT!

192
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,875
- ( shouting )

193
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,833
- CAPTAIN.

194
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,583
- ( horse whinnies )
- UNBELIEVABLE.

195
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,625
THE INLAND SEA OF SETO
IS GONE.

196
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,375
- BELIEVE IT.  TOYOTOMI SENT
THE WATER FLYING WITH ONE PUNCH.

197
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,041
- SASUKE.
- NO OFFENSE,

198
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,375
BUT SHOULD WE EVEN BE HAVING
THIS TALK RIGHT NOW?

199
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,416
I FIGURED YOU WOULD HAVE ARRIVED
IN SATSUMA EARLIER THAN THIS.

200
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,875
- YES, FORGIVE ME.

201
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,875
- YUKIMURA, THIS IS NO PLACE
FOR US TO TARRY.

202
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,958
- YOU WOULD HAVE US LEAVE?
- YOU WITNESSED TOYOTOMI'S POWER

203
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,666
FIRSTHAND AT KAWANAKAJIMA.

204
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,000
CHOSOKABE'S FORTRESS WILL FALL
TO ITS ATTACKERS.

205
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,916
IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME.

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,708
- RUN!

207
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,166
- ( laughs )
YOU BASTARDS THOUGHT MY FUGAKU

208
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,000
WAS JUST SOME OVERGROWN BOAT?

209
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,333
SHE CAN HOLD HER OWN
ON DRY LAND, TOO.

210
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,750
PUT YOUR BACKS INTO IT, DOGS.
- ( cheering )

211
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,250
- AS I EXPECTED,
IT CAN FUNCTION OUT OF WATER.

212
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,250
A MORE THAN WELCOME ADDITION
TO OUR ARSENAL,

213
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,583
IF DEAR MOTOCHIKA HAS WISDOM
ENOUGH TO SURRENDER.

214
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,541
- CHOSOKABE WILL NEVER SUBMIT
TO ANYONE.

215
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,750
- YES, I'M WELL AWARE
OF HIS DISPOSITION.

216
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,750
- ENJOY MY TREADS,
YOU HULKING BASTARD.

217
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,541
- YOUR SCATTERED BONES WILL BE
A WARNING TO ALL WHO OPPOSE ME.

218
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,958
- ( screaming )

219
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,750
- SON OF A BITCH.
- ( bird squawking )

220
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:26,250
- I DON'T RECALL INVITING
YOU ABOARD.

221
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,916
YOU'VE STUMBLED INTO OGRE
TERRITORY, DUMB BASTARD.

222
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,958
IT'S ONE OF THEM FATAL MISTAKES
YOU MAKE ONLY ONCE.

223
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,750
- I SEE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU ARE, CHOSOKABE.

224
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,125
A TOOTHLESS OGRE, LORDING
OVER YOUR TINY ISLAND KINGDOM.

225
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,000
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR PIRATES

226
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,125
IN THE COUNTRY
I'M PUTTING TOGETHER.

227
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,791
ABANDON THIS FORTRESS,
KNEEL ON THE DECK BEFORE ME,

228
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,791
YOU'LL HAVE A PLACE
IN MY ARMY,

229
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,666
A FORCE THAT WILL DOMINATE
THE WORLD.

230
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,708
- MIGHT AS WELL STOP WASTING
YOUR BREATH.

231
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,666
THE OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA
DON'T TAKE ORDERS

232
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,375
FROM SOME ARMOR-CLAD CHIMP.

233
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,625
- AS I BEAT THE LIFE OUT OF YOU,
KNOW ONE THING.

234
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,041
YOU WILL DIE FOR THE GOOD
OF YOUR COUNTRY.

235
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,833
- YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN TAKE ME?

236
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,250
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.

237
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,833
- CAPTAIN,
THEY'RE COMING RIGHT FOR US.

238
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,750
- Sanada:
THIS IS DIFFICULT TO WATCH.

239
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,708
CHOSOKABE IS SAID
TO BE A GOOD MAN.

240
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,083
FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD,
HE'S TAKEN IN FAMILIES LEFT

241
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,416
FATHERLESS BY TOYOTOMI'S
MILITARY CONSCRIPTION,

242
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,416
AS WELL AS REFUGEES
FROM LANDS DEFEATED BY MORI.

243
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,583
- ONCE THE INLAND SEA OF SETO
IS UNDER THEIR CONTROL,

244
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,791
THEY'LL BEGIN INVADING KYUSHU.

245
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,916
OUR MISSION IS TO RACE AHEAD
OF THEM AND PREVENT THAT

246
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,916
FROM HAPPENING.  YOU SEEM TO
HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS AS OF LATE.

247
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,416
UP UNTIL RIGHT NOW, I WAS
CONTENT IN HOLDING MY TONGUE

248
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,000
OUT OF RESPECT FOR OUR LORD'S
COMMAND THAT WE HELP YOU,

249
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,000
BUT NOT ANYMORE.
I, OYAMADA, REFUSE TO COMPLY.

250
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,583
- MASTER SANADA,
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE THE COMMANDER

251
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,375
OF THIS CAVALRY.

252
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,291
GOOD OR BAD,
IT'S ALL ON YOU.

253
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,708
- ( gasps )
- ( screams )

254
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,458
THE INLAND SEA OF SETO
IS MY STOMPING GROUNDS.

255
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,125
I TAKE NONE TOO KINDLY
TO BASTARDS WHO RUIN IT.

256
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,708
- THE WORLD IS BIGGER THAN
THAT ONE EYE OF YOURS CAN SEE.

257
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,166
THE SHAME MUST BURN
YOU ALIVE, PIRATE.

258
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,333
EXPOSED AS A WEAKLING
BEFORE ALL YOUR MEN.

259
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,208
STRENGTH WILL BRING
OUR FRACTURED LAND TOGETHER.

260
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,958
WITH MY POWER, I WILL STAND
ASTRIDE THE GLOBE.

261
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,083
- CAN'T WE JUST GIVE YOU
A BANANA AND CALL IT A DAY?

262
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,583
I SWEAR ON MY LIFE, YOU'RE
NOT GETTING YOUR GRUBBY PAWS

263
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,083
ON THE INLAND SEA OF SETO
OR THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN.

264
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,125
ALL YOUR TALK
OF CONQUERING THE WORLD

265
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,333
AND YOU AIN'T EVEN FINISHED
THIS LITTLE FRACAS YET.

266
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,166
NOW, PUT UP YOUR DUKES,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

267
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,416
- YOU ARE NOTHING.

268
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:23,250
GO TO YOUR DOOM KNOWING YOU
COULD NEVER HAVE DEFEATED ME.

269
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:38,250
- All: CAPTAIN!

270
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,958
- CHOSOKABE NEEDS OUR HELP.
PREPARE FOR BATTLE.

271
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,750
- Sasuke: IT'S TOO LATE.
THEY'VE LOST.

272
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,625
BUT IF WE MAKE A BREAK
FOR SATSUMA NOW--

273
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,250
- NO, SASUKE.
I AM NOT LEAVING A BRAVE WARRIOR

274
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,375
AND HIS SOLDIERS HERE TO DIE.
- BUT WE--

275
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,541
WAIT, MASTER OYAMADA.

276
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:57,958
- I UNDERSTAND NOW,
MASTER YUKIMURA.

277
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,750
- ( coughs )
- HAVE YOU TAKEN ILL?

278
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,625
- I'M FINE.
JUST A BIT SURPRISED.

279
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,541
A PLAYER WHOSE PRESENCE WE
COULDN'T HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR

280
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,375
IS ABOUT TO TAKE THE STAGE.

281
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:12,291
THE TAKEDA OF KAI.

282
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,041
WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO ACCOMPLISH
WITH SO FEW MEN?

283
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,416
- KNOW THAT I,
SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA,

284
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,958
NOW ENTER THIS FIGHT
TO HELP MASTER CHOSOKABE!

285
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,250
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )


286
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,750
- ( shouting )

287
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,416
- ( grunting )

288
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,583
- CLEAR A PATH FOR YUKIMURA.
- ( slashing )

289
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,541
- All: MASTER OYAMADA!

290
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,291
- OYAMADA, NO!
MASTER OYAMADA.

291
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:54,375
- STOP TICKLING ME.
OR WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO HURT?

292
00:21:55,958 --> 00:22:00,583
LISTEN UP, DOGS.
EVERYONE BACK TO THE FUGAKU.

293
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,208
- OGRE OF A CONQUERED ISLAND,

294
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:08,250
GO SAIL THE SEA OF CORPSES I'VE
SENT TO HELL AHEAD OF YOU.

295
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,250
- PAY CLOSE ATTENTION,
YOU BASTARD,

296
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,166
'CAUSE THIS IS HOW A PIRATE
MEETS HIS END!

297
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,916
- CAPTAIN!

298
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,458
- VICTORY IS OURS.
ALL UNITS, BACK TO THE SHORE.

299
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,208
- TOYOTOMI JUST TOOK
SOMEONE OUT.

300
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,583
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY GUT.

301
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:39,041
WHICH DOMAIN WENT BELLY-UP,
SHIKOKU MAYBE?

302
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,750
MORE POWER TO 'EM.

303
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,333
THE MORE LAND THEY GRAB
BEFORE I GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH 'EM,

304
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,375
THE EASIER IT'LL BE
FOR THIS DRAGON TO SWOOP IN

305
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,333
AND TAKE THE WHOLE BALL OF WAX.

306
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,958
SMACK DOWN TOYOTOMI
AND THIS WAR IS DONE.

307
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,708
I GET BACK WHAT'S MINE

308
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:57,333
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
HYAH!

309
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,375
- Miyamoto: MIYAMOTO MUSASHI,
THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND.

310
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,375
SORRY TO KEEP YOU CHUMPS
WAITING-- NOT.

311
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,791
NEXT UP, A TASTE
OF MY BADASS-NESS.

312
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,250
KILLER TECHNIQUE
AND A WHOLE LOT OF HURT.

313
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,458
BETTER SHOW,
UNLESS YOU WANNA BE NEXT.

314
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,708
I'LL BE ROCKING MY MOVES
RIGHT FROM THE START.
