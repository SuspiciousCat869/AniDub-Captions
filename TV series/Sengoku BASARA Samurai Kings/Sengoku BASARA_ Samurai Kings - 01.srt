26
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,750
I SHALL HOIST YOUR BANNER
OVER THE CAPITAL.

27

BEHOLD THE MIGHT
OF CLAN TAKEDA!

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,333
A TIME OF CHAOS AND UPRISINGS.

33
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,750
SAMURAI LORDS SPILLED
HOSTILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

34
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,750
THE MAP OF POWER REDRAWN
AT AN EVER-INCREASING PACE.

35
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:13,083
- IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE, IT IS
MY DUTY TO DESTROY ALL EVIL.

36
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,875
OICHI, GAZE WELL
ON MY VALIANT FORM.

37
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,333
- YES. LORD NAGAMASA.

38
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,083
- ANY WHO DARE INVADE MY LANDS,

39
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:29,041

00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,500
HONDA, ON YOUR HONOR AS A
MIKAWA WARRIOR, GO DESTROY.

45
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,458

- Oda: I AM TO BE WORSHIPED.

51
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,291
FOR DEFYING THE KING OF THE
HOUSE OF A HUNDRED DEMONS,

52
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,791
YOU WILL ATONE IN THIS LIFE
AND THE NEXT.

53
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,166
- ( rumbling )

54
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,541
- THERE ARE NONE BEFORE ME.

55
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,958
THERE SHALL BE NONE AFTER ME.

56
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,833
I AM THE DEVIL KING OF THE
SIXTH HEAVEN, ODA NOBUNAGA!

57
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,875
- REPORT, SASUKE.

58
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,625
- IT IS AS YOU SURMISED.
- HMM.

59
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,708
- YUKIMURA.
- SIR!

60
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,916
- TAKE A DETACHMENT AND ATTACK
THE ENEMY FROM THE FLANKS.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,041
- DO WHAT?
YOUR LORDSHIP,

62
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,208
THOUGH I KNOW THEY HAVE THE HIGH
GROUND, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

63
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,458
IT IS THE TAKEDA WAY TO FACE OUR
ENEMIES HEAD ON IN FULL FORCE.

64
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:21,791
- BUFFOON! WAR IS MORE
THAN OUR TIME-HONORED TACTICS.

65
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,416
YOU MUST ADAPT,

66
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,041
OR YOU PAVE THE WAY TO
YOUR OWN DEMISE, YUKIMURA.

67
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,833
- BUT, YOUR LORDSHIP,

68
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,125
YOU AND LORDKENSHIN
SHARE A WORTHY RIVALRY

69
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,625
OF THE RAREST KIND.

70
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,708
IF WE LAUNCH A SURPRISE ATTACK
UNDER THE COVER OF NIGHT,

71
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,458
IF NOTHING ELSE, I WORRY IT
IS YOUR REPUTATION THAT WILL...

72
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,000
( groaning )

73
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,000
- IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT RIVALRY.

74
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,208
THIS IS A MERE DIVERSION.

75
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,041
YOU WILL STRIKE DOWN UESUGI'S
COMMON SOLDIERS AND GENERALS.

76
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,791
TO DRIVE OUT KENSHIN HIMSELF.

77
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,291
- YOUR LORDSHIP.

78
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,791
- CALL IT THE
WOODPECKER MANEUVER.

79
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,875
IF IT FAILS, MAY OUR DESCENDANTS
LEARN FROM OUR FOOLISHNESS.

80
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,125
BUT YOU AND I, TOGETHER,
CANNOT FAIL!

81
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,541
- YOUR LORDSHIP, I WAS IGNORANT
OF THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT

82
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,958
YOU HAD GIVEN THIS.

83
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,708
I, YUKIMURA,
MUST ADMIT MY MISTAKE.

84
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,125
UPON MY VERY LIFE, I SHALL
CARRY OUT THIS COMMISSION.

85
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,708
- WELL SAID, YUKIMURA.
- YOUR LORDSHIP.

86
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,750
- YUKIMURA.
- YOUR LORDSHIP.

87
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,291
- YUKIMURA.
- YOUR LORDSHIP.

88
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,750
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

89
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,000
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

90
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,750
- YUKIMURA!
- ILLUMINATING.

91
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,583
- ( horse neighing )
- ( screaming )

92
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,625
- DID WE DO
THE RIGHT THING HERE, MY LORD?

93
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,458
OR SHOULD WE HAVE TOLD
MASTER SANADA,

94
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,708
THE TRUE OBJECTIVE
OF THIS STRATEGY?

95
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,000
- REGARDLESS OF WHAT
WE TELL HIM,

96
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,166
HE WILL BE EQUAL TO THE TASK.

97
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,250
IF HE IS NOT, THEN SO BE IT.

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
- ( grunting )

99
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,375
SO YOU'VE RETURNED, KASUGA.

100
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,291
- SIR.

101
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,708
AS MY LORD EXPECTED,
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON OF OSHU

102
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,333
IS CURRENTLY APPROACHING
THE UESUGI CAMP,

103
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,041
ATTEMPTING TO OUTFLANK US.

104
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,000
- INTERESTING.
I HAD THOUGHT IT A POSSIBILITY

105
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,791
UPON HEARING OF HIS
ONSLAUGHT IN THE FAR NORTH.

106
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,708
NOW I SEE MY FEARS
WERE NOT UNFOUNDED.

107
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,041
- MY LORD.

108
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,416
- OUT WITH IT.

109
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,416
- MY LORD, A DETACHMENT
HAS JUST LEFT THE TAKEDA CAMP.

110
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,333
THEY ARE MAKING THEIR WAY HERE
TO SAIJO MOUNTAIN.

111
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,708
SINCE THEY LEFT
UNDER COVER OF NIGHT,

112
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,208
A SURPRISE ATTACK IS LIKELY.

113
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,583
- TIGER OF KAI,

114
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,750
QUITE A BRILLIANT MOVE.

115
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,208
- LORD KENSHIN?

116
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,708
- I AM FREE NOW

117
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,458
TO FIGHT HIM MY WAY.

118
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,666
WELL DONE,
MY MOST BEAUTIFUL BLADE.

119
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,333
GENTLEMEN! PREPARE FOR BATTLE!

120
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,416
WITH DIVINE STEEL
IN YOUR HEARTS, FOLLOW ME!

121
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,041
OUR TARGET IS THE TIGER OF KAI!

122
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,291
MAY BISHAMONTEN GUIDE US!

123
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,375
- LET HEAVEN'S WILL BE DONE.
- ( men cheering )

124
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,666
- BOSS MASAMUNE.
- YEAH.

125
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,000
WHAT'S UP, KOJURO?

126
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,166
- WE SHOULD HALT THE ARMY
AND SEND ANOTHER SCOUT

127
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,625
UP SAIJO MOUNTAIN.

128
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,000
- WHAT?

129
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,791
- I SENSE TROUBLE, SIR, LIKE
THEY'RE WAITING FOR US.

130
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,625
- HA! ALL THE MORE FUN THEN.

131
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,708
IT JUST MEANS
THEY'RE READY TO PARTY.

132
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,416
- WE NO LONGER HAVE
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

133
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,375
- NO PROB. RACE YOU, KOJURO.
- ( horse neighing )

134
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,166
- BUMMER. LOOKS LIKE
THEY ALREADY TOOK OFF

135
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,208
TO FIGHT OLD MAN TAKEDA.

136
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,208
- Katakura: OR IT COULD
BE A TRAP.

137
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,958
- ( men shouting )

138
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,000
- THOSE AREN'T UESUGI'S TROOPS.

139
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,125
ALL UNITS, HALT! FULL STOP!

140
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,041
A CRESCENT SYMBOL
AND ONLY ONE EYE?

141
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,791
ARE YOU OSHU'S ONE-EYED DRAGON?

142
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,833
- ( men murmuring )

143
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,458
- I AM SANADA GENJIRO YUKIMURA.

144
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,208
LORD DATE MASAMUNE,
BOSS OF OSHU, I PRESUME?

145
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,125
WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU HERE?

146
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,833
- YEAH.

147
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,583
LISTEN, RED.

148
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,291
- WHAT DID... BLACKGUARD!

149
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,791
- CLEARLY, YOU'RE TAKEDA'S
SACRIFICIAL PAWN, BUT...

150
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:31,000
I'M TAKING UESUGI,
AT KAWANAKAJIMA.

151
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,541
SO, ARE YOU GONNA TURN TAIL
AND RUN, OR FACE ME HERE?

152
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,708
EITHER WAY, DATE ENDS UP
THE SOLE VICTOR.

153
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,291
- I KNOW NOT WHAT GROUNDS MY
LORD HAS TO MAKE SUCH A CLAIM.

154
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,083
- I'M JUST SAYING THE
ONE-EYED DRAGON'S

155
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,625
A MAN OF ACTION. YOU SEE?

156
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,458
- YOU WILL NOT DISRUPT OUR FIGHT
WITH LORD KENSHIN.

157
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,291
I SHALL NOT ALLOW IT.

158
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,708
- PERFECT.

159
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,000
KOJURO, DON'T LET ANYONE
INTERFERE WITH US.

160
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,125
- YES SIR.

161
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,541
BOSS OF OSHU, DATE MASAMUNE!

162
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,208
- VASSAL OF KAI,
SANADA YUKIMURA!

163
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,833
I HONOR THIS FIGHT WITH
ALL MY STRENGTH!

164
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,708
- FULL SPEED AHEAD!

165
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,791
- ( both screaming )

166
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,125
( both grunting )

167
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,000
( both straining)

168
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,208
- HE BLOCKED
BIG BOSS-MAN'S ATTACK.

169
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,458
- ( swords clanking )

170
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,916
- HA! WHAT KIND OF SPEAR
FIGHTER LETS ME GET WITHIN

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,291
STRIKING RANGE SO EASY?

172
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,583
- ( growling )

173
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,375
( gasping )

174
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,291
- SORRY, JUST A SCRATCH.

175
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,583
- I AM GLAD YOU'VE FINALLY
ARRIVED ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

176
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,833
- YOU WAITED. MOST THOUGHTFUL.

177
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,666
- A THANK YOU,
FOR THE SALT THAT TIME.

178
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,625
- ( loud explosion )

179
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,333
- ( groaning )

180
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,916
- ( exclaiming )

181
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:01,208
- WELL MET, YOUNG CUB.

182
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,958
- YUKIMURA, YOU HAVE
A NEW RIVAL.

183
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,250
- ( explosion )

184
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,583
- PERHAPS THIS VERY MOMENT,

185
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,708
IS WHAT THIS LONG STANDOFF
HAS BEEN FOR.

186
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,875
- THE DEER HAS FALLEN.

187
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,208
SURELY OUR TIME TO CLAIM
THE KILL IS SOON AT HAND.

188
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,875
- ( explosion )

189
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,958
- ( screaming )
- ( swords clanking )

190
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,666
- BOSS DREW ALL SIX SWORDS.

191
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,708
- GOOD, THE BASTARD'S BEEN
ASKING FOR IT.

192
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,333
- ( both grunting )

193
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,083
( both panting )

194
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,333
- Sarutobi: HOLD!

195
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,791
- Date: WHO THE HELL'RE YOU?

196
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,208
- MASTER ONE-EYED DRAGON,
WON'T YOU CALL IT A DRAW?

197
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,000
SARUTOBI SASUKE,
SANADA NINJA CORPS, TAKEDA ARMY.

198
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,208
I HATE TO SPOIL YOUR FUN,
BUT OUR MAIN ARMY AND UESUGI

199
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,041
WILL SOON HAVE THIS
PLACE SURROUNDED.

200
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,541
A CLEAR THREE-SIDED FIGHT
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT.

201
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,708
BUT WITH BOTH ARMIES
MARCHING ON YOU AT ONCE,

202
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,666
EVEN YOU WOULD BE
AT A DISADVANTAGE.

203
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,500
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT CRAP.

204
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:23,083
AS IF I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST TAKE
THE WORD OF AN ENEMY NINJA.

205
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,583
- MASAMUNE, I BELIEVE
OUR WITHDRAWAL MAY BE WISE.

206
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,875
- KOJURO.

207
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,958
- EVEN IF WE ARE EQUAL
TO THE TASK,

208
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,750
NO SMALL NUMBER OF LIVES
WILL BE LOST.

209
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,916
- ( grunting )
- ( horse neighing )

210
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,500
- WHOO! THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

211
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,833
IF THAT FIGHT KEPT GOING,
EVEN YOU WOULD'VE BEEN...

212
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,000
UH... MASTER?

213
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,333
- IT BURNS.
- HUH?

214
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,791
- THERE IS A BURNING
IN MY HEART.

215
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,958
SUCH AMBITION.

216
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,958
SUCH FIGHTING SPIRIT.

217
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,875
SUCH STRENGTH. IT BURNS.

218
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,166
- SO, HE UH...
LIGHTS YOUR FIRE, DOES HE?

219
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,708
- THE ONE-EYED DRAGON,
DATE MASAMUNE.

220
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,041
- SANADA YUKIMURA,
THE YOUNG CUB.

221
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,625
- Sanada: WHAT?

222
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,958
YOU ANTICIPATED DATE'S AMBUSH?

223
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,250
- Takeda: YES.

224
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,208
LIKELY, KENSHIN DID AS WELL.
WHICH MUST BE WHY

225
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,083
HE MAINTAINED POSITION
ATOP THE MOUNTAIN FOR SO LONG.

226
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,916
- SO, WHAT WAS MY ROLE
IN ALL THIS?

227
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,375
- IF DATE'S INTERFERENCE
HAD NOT COME TO PASS.

228
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,166
YOU WOULD HAVE COMPLETED YOUR
MISSION AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED.

229
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,708
BY ALL RIGHTS,

230
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,458
I HAD NO REASON TO KEEP THESE
DETAILS FROM YOU, YUKIMURA.

231
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,250
- THEN... TO WHAT PURPOSE?

232
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,250
- A GENERAL MUST BE CAPABLE
OF RESPONDING TO THE UNEXPECTED.

233
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,666
HAD YOU NOT RETURNED,

234
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,666
THEN SO MUCH FOR
MY MILITARY PROWESS.

235
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,916
- I SEE NOW, YOUR LORDSHIP.

236
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,166
EVERYTHING IS A TEST.

237
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,291
AND I HAVE FAILED THIS ONE.

238
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,000
I HAVE NO HONOR TO SPEAK OF.

239
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,958
IF IT WAS NOT FOR SASUKE,

240
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,875
I WOULD NOT HAVE
COME BACK UNSCATHED.

241
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,125
- THIS ONE-EYED DRAGON.

242
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,375
HE IS THAT STRONG, IS HE?

243
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,500
- OH, YES.
QUITE STRONG, LORDSHIP.

244
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,291
SO MUCH SO,
IT STIRRED MY VERY SOUL.

245
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,375
- SARUTOBI SASUKE, REPORTING IN.
- GOOD WORK.

246
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,916
- WHAT NEWS FROM SUNPU?

247
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,250
- IMAGAWA SHOWS SIGNS
OF RAISING AN ARMY.

248
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,000
IT SEEMS THEY PLAN TO ATTACK ODA
WHILE HE IS INVADING ISE.

249
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,000
- YES, AS I EXPECTED.

250
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:49,125
PREPARE FOR BATTLE.
WE SHALL TAKE IMAGAWA BY STORM!

251
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,375
- SIR! ONE QUESTION.

252
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,291
THE TRUCE WITH UESUGI,

253
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,916
YOU KNEW IT WOULD BENEFIT
THIS SITUATION AS WELL?

254
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,458
- ( scoffing )
THANK YOUR MAN, SASUKE.

255
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,000
I HAD TO ASK MUCH OF HIM.

256
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,041
- ( laughing )
HOW IMPRESSIVE.

257
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,708
SHREWD AS ALWAYS, MY LORD. I...

258
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,791
( gasping )

259
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,291
- MY LORD, THAT WOULD
KILL A NORMAL MAN.

260
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,791
- ( groaning )

261
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,666
- I WATCH OTHER LANDS
AS A MATTER OF COURSE.

262
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,791
YUKIMURA, TO BE
A GOOD COMMANDER.

263
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,750
ALWAYS CONSIDER
EVERY EVENTUALITY.

264
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,083
- ( screaming )

265
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,166
THANK YOU FOR THE VALUABLE
LESSON, YOUR LORDSHIP.

266
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,750
HOWEVER, I INTEND TO
SERVE YOU, MY LORD.

267
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,666
- AND, GOD WILLING, SOMEDAY
THE WORLD UNDER YOUR RULE.

268
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,625
- BUFFOON!

269
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:40,166
AS A WARRIOR IN THESE TURBULENT
TIMES, SHOW SOME AMBITION.

270
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,791
GRAB THE REINS OF POWER
IF GIVEN THE CHANCE.

271
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,208
- ( groaning )

272
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:48,458
- YUKIMURA, EVEN I AM DESTINED
TO GROW OLD SOMEDAY.

273
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,916
- NO, YOUR LORDSHIP.

274
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,541
OF ALL MEN, IF ONE WILL NOT
GROW OLD, IT IS YOU, SIR!

275
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,000
- UH... COMMANDER?

276
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,708
- Takeda: I AM ONLY HUMAN.

277
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,750
NEVER FOOL YOURSELF
TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE.

278
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,875
( grunting )

279
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,333
YUKIMURA!

280
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,583
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

281
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,541
- YUKIMURA!
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

282
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,500
- YUKIMURA!
- BRILLIANT.

283
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,250
- YOUR LORDSHIP!

284
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,708
- ( men cheering and laughing )

285
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,791
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH, NICE SHOW.
- DANCE FOR US, MAN.

286
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,375
- WE MISSED THE WAR GOD
OF ECHIGO AND THE TIGER OF KAI.

287
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,458
ALL THAT AND NOTHING TO SHOW
FOR IT.

288
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,208
- ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,

289
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,041
YOU DON'T APPEAR
TO BE TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED.

290
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,750
- SO WHY DID YOU STOP ME?

291
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,166
WERE YOU AFRAID
I WAS GONNA LOSE?

292
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,375
- NO.

293
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,583
I MERELY GAVE WEIGHT
TO THE POSSIBILITY

294
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,875
THAT THE NINJA CLAIMING
TO SERVE TAKEDA

295
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,375
WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH.

296
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,791
EITHER WAY, THOUGH,

297
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,625
IF YOU HAD CONTINUED
THAT FIGHT,

298
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,875
ONE OF YOU, MAYBE BOTH,
WOULD NOT HAVE LIVED.

299
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:03,958
- HMM.

300
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,458
GUESS I GOT
A LITTLE OVERHEATED.

301
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,458
GOT TO PLAY IT COOL.

302
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,458
- SO, ARE WE RETURNING
TO OSHU TOMORROW?

303
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,416
- NOT YET.

304
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,625
WE DIDN'T WORK OUR WAY
DOWN TO THE LAND OF MUSASHI

305
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,500
JUST TO TURN BACK NOW.

306
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,458
- THEN, LET'S HOLD A WAR COUNCIL

307
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,958
ONCE THE SCOUT I
SENT OUT RETURNS.

308
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,250
CERTAINLY IMAGAWA WILL
GIVE IN TO THE PRESSURE

309
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,708
OF HIS NEIGHBORS.

310
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,375
I IMAGINE HE'S RAISING
AN ARMY NOW.

311
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,291
- ( scoffing )
GREAT MINDS, AS THEY SAY.

312
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,583
- HOWEVER, TAKEDA IS NO FOOL.

313
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,916
WE'LL HAVE TO
ASSUME HE'LL STRIKE

314
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
AT THIS NEW THREAT BEFORE
THEY GAIN ANY GROUND.

315
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,458
- BUT TAKEDA JUST HAD IT OUT
WITH UESUGI.

316
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,291
- I SUSPECT THEIR
ARMIES DID NOT ACTUALLY

317
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,708
CROSS SWORDS AT KAWANAKAJIMA.

318
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,500
WHEN THEY LEARNED
OF OUR AMBUSH,

319
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,958
I'D VENTURE BOTH COMMANDERS
DECIDED TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER DAY.

320
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,541
- TRICKY SON OF A...

321
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,000
- STEAL THE TIGER OF KAI'S
THUNDER AND BRING DOWN IMAGAWA?

322
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,333
IT COULD BE FUN.

323
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,916
- AND YOU HAVE A PLAN?

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,250
- BUT OF COURSE,
WE IMITATE TAKEDA HIMSELF.

325
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,083
IF I HAD TO GIVE IT A NAME?
THE WOODPECKER MANEUVER.

326
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,375
- THAT DOES SOUND LIKE
A FUN GAME.

327
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,166
COUNT ME IN, KOJURO.

328
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,875
- Hojo: WHAT?

329
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,750
OSHU'S ONE-EYED DRAGON
DARES ATTEMPT

330
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,041
TO INVADE US
HERE IN ODAWARA?

331
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,125
- MY LORD, YOUR DECISION?

332
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,666
- ( grunting )

333
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,208
HE WILL LEARN RESPECT FOR THE
ANCESTRAL POWER OF THE HOJO.

334
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,458
- TEAR IT UP, BOYS. LET'S PARTY.
- YEAH!

335
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,666
- I AM CALLED...

336
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,916
- ( men cheering )

337
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,541
- IMPUDENCE! TURNING THEIR BACKS
ON THE ENEMY WITHOUT A FIGHT?

338
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,041
ALL OF YOU, AFTER THEM!

339
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,291
- ( men shouting )

340
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,125
- SOMETHING AMISS, YUKIMURA?

341
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,041
- ( men cheering )

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,083
- THAT'S DATE'S ARMY!

343
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,958
- ( scoffing )

344
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,416
- MASAMUNE!

345
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,291
- CURSED DRAGON!

346
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,666
LOOK, HE IS IN LEAGUE
WITH TAKEDA.

347
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,000
THERE CAN BE NO TURNING BACK.
CRUSH THEM.

348
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,083
- ( men shouting )

349
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,833
- HOJO UJIMASA'S FORCES.

350
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,916
- ONE-EYED BASTARD.
THIS WAS A TRAP.

351
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,916
YUKIMURA, I'LL DEAL WITH THIS.

352
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,541
TAKE OUR BEST MEN
AND GO AFTER DATE.

353
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,375
DO NOT LET HIM
TAKE YOSHIMOTO'S HEAD.

354
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,000
- Sanada: RIGHT AWAY, YOUR
LORDSHIP. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

355
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,750
DATE IS EMPLOYING
THE WOODPECKER MANEUVER.

356
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,500
THAT HE WOULD NOT ONLY STEAL
LORD SHINGEN'S TACTICS,

357
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,500
BUT USE THEM AGAINST US.

358
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,791
YOU ARE A BOLD MAN,
LORD MASAMUNE.

359
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,583
YOU'LL FIND SO AM I.

360
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,583
- A ONE-EYED DRAGON WILL BITE
OFF THE HEAD OF IMAGAWA.

361
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,958
COUNT ON IT.

362
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,500
- ( theme song playing )

363
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,916
- Sanada: PERFECT SPEAR
OF CONQUEST.

364
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,666
SANADA YUKIMURA IS HERE.

365
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,750
I HUMBLY ASK THAT YOU OBSERVE
OUR EXPLOITS NEXT TIME.

366
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,750
AS OUR BATTLE GROWS
EVEN MORE HEATED!
