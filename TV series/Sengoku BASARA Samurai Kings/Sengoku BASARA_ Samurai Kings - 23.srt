1
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,583
- THIS BELONGS
TO MASTER KATAKURA.

2
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,333
- WHY THE LONG FACES,
DRAGON MAN?

3
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,833
- TOYOTOMI KIDNAPPED
MY SECOND-IN-COMMAND.

4
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,208
BUT NOW THIS BASTARD,
MATSUNAGA, HAS HIM.

5
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,250
NOTE SAYS HE'S WAITING
FOR ME UP AHEAD.

6
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,583
- WHAT, IS HE AFTER
YOUR SIX SWORDS AGAIN?

7
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,500
- Samanosuke:
HOW IS HE EVEN ALIVE?

8
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,583
- OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA,

9
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,750
THESE GUYS ARE WITH YOU FOR NOW.

10
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,250
ATTACK OSAKA LIKE YOU WANTED.

11
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,333
I'LL JOIN YOU
ONCE I TAKE CARE OF THIS.

12
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,583
- Soldiers: BIG BOSS!

13
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,625
- Yoshinao:
WHAT IF YOU NEED BACKUP?

14
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,708
- NOT SO FAST.

15
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,291
- WHAT'S UP?

16
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,541
- HE'S A SLY ONE,
THAT TREASURE-HUNGRY CUR.

17
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,416
- NO SHIT.
SO, YOU KNOW HIM THEN?

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,541
- OL' MATSUNAGA HISAHIDE.

19
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,875
SUFFICE IT TO SAY,
WE'VE EXCHANGED UNPLEASANTRIES

20
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,958
A TIME OR TWO OUR OWN SELVES.

21
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,916
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
YOU COULD DO WORSE

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,583
THAN HAVE CHOSOKABE MOTOCHIKA
FIGHTING AT YOUR SHOULDER.

23
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,041
MARK ME, I AIN'T INSINUATING

24
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,625
YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM
BY YOUR LONESOME,

25
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,166
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'D BE QUICKER THIS WAY.

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,625
BESIDES, TOYOTOMI'S
GOT AN EYE TO THE HORIZON

27
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,875
FOR YOU AND YOURS.
BUT HE'S NOT SAVVY

28
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,791
TO THE OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA
BEING ALIVE AND KICKING.

29
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,291
LOOK, OUR TEAMING UP
LIKE THIS IS A RARE CHANCE

30
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,500
TO SURPRISE THAT GORILLA,

31
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,375
PUNCH A HOLE IN HIS DEFENSES.

32
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,333
I'D HATE FOR US TO GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS

33
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:41,125
JUST 'CAUSE MATSUNAGA
REARED HIS UGLY HEAD.

34
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,416
SO WHAT SAY YOU, TOUGH GUY?

35
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:51,875
- ALRIGHT, YOU SOLD ME.
LET'S DO IT!

36
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,416
- Matsunaga:
ONE-EYED DRAGON OF OSHU,

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,416
YOU'LL SOON ARRIVE.
OF THAT, I HAVE NO DOUBT.

38
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,750
TO THINK THAT I WILL
SLAY THE DRAGON

39
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,250
WITH THE MOST
EPHEMERAL OF WEAPONS--

40
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,875
DECEPTION, WELL-PLAYED.

41
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,083
- ( theme music plays )

42
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,125
- NO USE, GUYS.
THEY'RE JUST TOO TOUGH!

43
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,500
EVERYBODY RUN FOR IT!
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

44
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,541
RETREAT!  RETREAT!

45
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,500
- GOOD WORK, MUSASHI.
NOW REEL THEM IN.

46
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,041
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
FOR AN UNCERTAIN SOUL.

47
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,625
- ALRIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S HAVE AT THEM!

48
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,416
- ( shouting )

49
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,250
- YOU LIKE THAT?

50
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,000
I CALL IT,
"MY SIGNATURE BAIT AND BASH!"

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,083
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

52
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,916
TAKE YOUR BEAT DOWN LIKE MEN!

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,916
COME ON, THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!

54
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,625
- THIS RETREAT PATTERN...

55
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,333
BEHIND THEM, THAT'S...

56
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,375
THE MORI ARMY!

57
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,875
- MUSASHI, COME BACK!

58
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,625
- THEY'RE BARELY WORTH
THE TROUBLE OF KILLING.

59
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,083
NOTHING BUT REMNANTS
AND WEAKLINGS.

60
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,083
USHER THEM ONWARD,

61
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,375
MY CHILDREN OF THE SUN!

62
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,875
- ( battle cries )

63
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:03,958
- Miyamoto:
THAT'S NOT FAIR,

64
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,458
YOU COPIED MY MOVE!

65
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,958
COME UP WITH YOUR OWN STRATEGY,
WHY DON'T YOU?!

66
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,625
- LORD SHIMAZU,

67
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,500
WE ARE AWAITING YOUR ORDERS.

68
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:22,125
- MORI CAME, JUST LIKE
I CALLED IT.

69
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,958
- LEAVE THEM ALONE!

70
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,416
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?!

71
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,166
RAISING YOUR SWORD
AGAINST THE UNARMED,

72
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,250
YOU DARE TO CALL
YOURSELVES WARRIORS?!

73
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,666
- DON'T JUDGE ME!

74
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,458
DAMN IT!

75
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,625
I JUST WANT TO GO
BACK TO MY FARM!

76
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,208
- I WANT TO SEE
MY WIFE AGAIN!

77
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,041
- Takeda:
YUKIMURA,

78
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:07,125
OUR OPPONENTS ARE STILL MEN.

79
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:12,083
AS YOU WIELD YOUR SPEARS,
DO NOT EVER FORGET THAT.

80
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,375
- BUT YOUR LORDSHIP,
THAT IS ALL I CAN THINK OF.

81
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,416
MY OPPONENT'S HUMANITY
FILLS MY MIND

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,166
UNTIL THESE SPEARS
ARE NUMB IN MY GRASP.

83
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,541
I SHOULDN'T BE HAVING
THIS DILEMMA.

84
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,750
BUT INDECISION TAKES HOLD
OF MY SOUL AND I AM HELPLESS.

85
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,916
I STAND IN BATTLE
LIKE A MAN TRANSFIXED.

86
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,416
PLEASE, GUIDE ME, YOUR LORDSHIP.

87
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,125
- ( screams )

88
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,833
- MASTER YUKIMURA!

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,125
- AN ARMADA, YOU SAY?

90
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,208
STORMING THE BEACH?

91
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,875
BUT WHAT ABOUT LORD SHIMAZU?

92
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,125
HE'S ALL ALONE
ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE

93
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,041
RECUPERATING FROM HIS WOUNDS.

94
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,916
- COMPANY, EH?

95
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,541
LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,
MAY AS WELL GET TO KNOW YOU.

96
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,750
WELCOME TO SATSUMA!

97
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,250
COME AND GET ME, BOYS.

98
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,958
IF YOU AIN'T TOO YELLOW!

99
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,916
- LORD SHIMAZU!

100
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,333
SO THAT'S HIS
FAMOUS JIGEN STYLE.

101
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,208
THIS IS AS FAR INTO SATSUMA
AS YOU'RE GETTING!

102
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,041
- I THOUGHT TURNING
THEIR SIMPLEMINDED TACTICS

103
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,291
AGAINST THEM WOULD BE
MORE THAN SUFFICIENT.

104
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,250
BUT THIS RAGTAG BUNCH
KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT.

105
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,541
A SECOND TOYOTOMI DETACHMENT
IS SURELY EN ROUTE

106
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,916
FROM THE NORTHERN END
OF KYUSHU RIGHT NOW.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,041
I'M SURE THEY HAVE ORDERS
TO CRUSH ALL THEY FIND HERE.

108
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,333
INCLUDING ME.

109
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,875
GO FORTH MY SACRIFICIAL PAWNS.

110
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,666
THE BLOOD YOU SHED THIS DAY
FUELS YOUR LORD'S ASCENDANCE.

111
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,791
- Bekunosuke: WHAT THE--

112
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,708
LOOKS LIKE HE STILL FIGHTS
AS DIRTY AS EVER!

113
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,250
- Soldier: HOLY...

114
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,625
- Chosokabe: TIME TO FLY,
YOU SONS-OF-BITCHES.

115
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,166
- BUT, WE CAN'T JUMP THAT!

116
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,250
- ONLY ONE WAY TO KNOW
FOR CERTAIN, RIGHT?

117
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,458
- DAMN STRAIGHT!

118
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,583
- LET'S TAKE HIM OUT.
ARE YOU READY?

119
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,791
- I WAS BORN READY, DRAGON MAN.

120
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,291
- YOU MUST BE MATSUNAGA.

121
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,000
THOSE BOYS OF MINE YOU KIDNAPPED
SAY YOU WERE A CRAPPY HOST.

122
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,208
- LONG TIME NO SEE, OLD MAN.

123
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,416
YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK YOU WERE
SHUT OF ME, NOW DID YOU?

124
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,416
- IT SEEMS I'M IN LUCK.

125
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,958
THE ONE-EYED DRAGON
AND THE OGRE OF THE WESTERN SEA.

126
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,625
- WHERE THE HELL'S KOJURO?

127
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,541
- A THOUSAND PARDONS, BOY.

128
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,375
BUT THE RIGHT EYE OF THE DRAGON

129
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,791
ISN'T ACTUALLY HERE.

130
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,458
- ( screams )

131
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,416
- I APPLAUD YOUR DEDICATION.

132
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,041
- Takenaka: LORD MATSUNAGA
DEIGNED TO LEAVE KATAKURA HERE.

133
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,666
ONE OF THE DEAR BOY'S
PERSONAL EFFECTS

134
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,500
WAS ALL THE OLD TRICKSTER
REQUIRED.

135
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,916
A CONVENIENT DEVELOPMENT, THAT.

136
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,208
ONCE THE COUNTRY LAY
AT YOUR FEET,

137
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,458
I INTEND TO BRING KATAKURA
INTO OUR RANKS AS AN OFFICER,

138
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:03,208
 THAT HE MAY HELP US
PRY OPEN THE WORLD.

139
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:07,208
UESUGI IS TRYING TO CONTAIN
OUR FORCE AT UTSUNOMIYA.

140
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,416
AND THE SUPPOSEDLY
NEUTRAL MAEDA CLAN

141
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,208
NOW DEFENDS KASUGAYAMA.

142
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,750
LORD MAEDA'S WIFE
USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HIM,

143
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,500
BUT SHE REMAINS IN KAGA.

144
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,500
FOR KEIJI'S SAKE,
ONE MIGHT ASSUME.

145
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,375
- THEY ARE NO THREAT TO US.

146
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,000
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WE TAKE
OUR PLACE IN ODAWARA

147
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,291
BEFORE THE TAKEDA
MAKE THEIR MOVE.

148
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,500
- THOUGH THE TAKEDA
WILL NEVER MAKE IT THERE,

149
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,083
EVEN IF WE INVITED THEM IN,

150
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,416
BOTH THE TIGER
AND THE WAR GOD

151
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
WILL BE ATTACKED FROM THE REAR
BY THE ARMY WE'VE SECRETED AWAY

152
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,666
IN THE FAR NORTH.

153
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,041
I'LL HEAD TO HARIMA DIRECTLY.

154
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,833
AND RELIEVE THE MORI ARMY

155
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,958
OF THAT PIRATE FORTRESS
THEY'VE REBUILT.

156
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,000
THE SUN WILL BE SETTING
ON DEAR MOTONARI QUITE SOON.

157
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,875
WHETHER HE CONTINUES
TO FIGHT IN SATSUMA

158
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,041
OR HEADS BACK WITH NEWS
OF THE FORTRESS' COMPLETION,

159
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,375
HIS FATE HAS BEEN DECIDED.

160
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,083
WE'LL HAVE THE UNREST IN SATSUMA

161
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,666
QUELLED BY THE COMMANDER
OF THE ARMY WE DEPLOYED

162
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,166
TO THE NORTHERN END OF KYUSHU.

163
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,916
YOUR MIGHT ARMY
IS UNSTOPPABLE 

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,625
THANKS TO THE MACHINATIONS
WE'VE SET INTO PLAY.

165
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:09,625
THE LAND WILL TREMBLE AT HOW WE
MAKE WAR UPON THEM, HIDEYOSHI.

166
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,791
- READY OUR FORCES FOR ODAWARA.

167
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,000
- HUH, THAT'S STRANGE.

168
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,458
IT'S GOT TO BE AROUND
HERE SOMEWHERE.

169
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,041
YUMEKICHI, DID YOU TAKE IT?

170
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,208
IF YOU GRABBED IT AS A PRANK
WHILE I WAS SLEEPING,

171
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,791
IT'S NOT FUNNY!

172
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,833
LOOK, THAT CHARM MEANS A LOT
TO ME, YUMEKICHI.

173
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,791
YOU KNOW THAT.

174
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,375
KASUGA, HEY.

175
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,250
- I CAME TO TELL YOU
IT'S HAPPENING NOW.

176
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,416
- WHAT?

177
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,166
- TOYOTOMI'S MAIN
FORCE IS ON THE MOVE.

178
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,208
HE MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT WIND
OF MY LORD KENSHIN'S MOVEMENTS.

179
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,583
AND INTEND TO OCCUPY ODAWARA
BEFORE TAKEDA SWOOPS IN.

180
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,250
- AND AFTER THAT,
HE'S GOING TO ROLL OVER

181
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,750
THE WHOLE KANTO PLAIN.

182
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,375
GUESS IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

183
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,500
I NEED A SMALL FAVOR,

184
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,083
TAKE CARE OF YUMEKICHI FOR ME
UNTIL I GET BACK, ALRIGHT?

185
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,625
- WHAT?

186
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,500
- SORRY, LITTLE BUDDY.
I'VE GOT TO GO THIS ONE ALONE.

187
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,833
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY,
YUMEKICHI.

188
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,125
I'M COMING BACK, YOU KNOW?

189
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,500
CHEER UP, WHEN HAVE I
EVER TOLD YOU A LIE?

190
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,541
LOOK, I SOLEMNLY PINKY-SWEAR IT.

191
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,583
- Narrator: THE SUN SETS
UPON THE COAST OF SATSUMA,

192
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,416
WHERE THE DAY'S FIGHTING
ENDS IN A STANDOFF.

193
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,583
SHIMAZU YOSHIHIRO'S
UNEXPECTED ENTRY INTO THE FRAY

194
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,166
HAS THWARTED THE PINCER ATTACK

195
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,791
MORI'S NAVAL FORCES
HAD HOPED TO EXECUTE.

196
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,625
BEREFT OF A COMMANDER AFTER
MOTINARI'S ABRUPT DEPARTURE,

197
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:50,375
HIS SHIPS HAVE RETREATED
TO A SAFE DISTANCE FROM SHORE.

198
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,166
- Shimazu: YOU'VE DONE
REAL GOOD OUT THERE TODAY.

199
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,666
THEY'LL BE NEEDING BACKUP
AFTER THE DRUBBING WE GAVE THEM.

200
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,666
LET YOUR MEN TAKE TURNS GRABBING
SOME SHUT EYE WHILE THEY CAN.

201
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,916
- SIR!

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,083
- I'VE SEEN SOME
FINE SPEARWORK OUT OF YOU.

203
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,125
- SIR?

204
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,958
- YOU SHOWED ME
WHAT KAI'S TIGER CUB

205
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,625
IS REALLY MADE OF.

206
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,916
- WHAT YOU SAW WASN'T RESOLVE,
ONLY DESPERATION.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
MY FOES' DEATHS
WEIGH HEAVILY ON ME.

208
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,416
MY BURDEN GROWS
WITH EVERY MAN I STRIKE DOWN.

209
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,666
- JUST 'CAUSE YOU END A MAN,
DON'T MEAN YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP

210
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,875
HIS HOPES AND DREAMS
IN YOUR RUCKSACK.

211
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,666
- BUT HOW DO YOU FIGURE, LORD?

212
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,833
IS IT CONCEITED OF ME?

213
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,833
- YOU'RE GOING ABOUT IT
ALL WRONG.

214
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:31,333
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN HONING YOUR
SKILLS FOR ALL THIS TIME, HUH?

215
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,875
- PARDON?

216
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,333
- TO DISTINGUISH
YOURSELF IN BATTLE.

217
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,791
GOOD A PLACE TO START AS ANY.
BUT THEN WHAT?

218
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,958
IF I KNOW THE TIGER OF KAI
HALF AS WELL AS I THINK,

219
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,458
HE'S ASKED YOU ALREADY.

220
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,666
WHAT DRIVES YOU
TO PICK UP THEM SPEARS?

221
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,458
- MIYAMOTO MUSASHI...

222
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:54,375
- Shimazu: MIYAMOTO OVER
THERE, HE'S TENACIOUS, TOO.

223
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,291
LIKE A DOG WITH A BONE,
THAT ONE.

224
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,375
WANTS TO BE THE GREATEST FIGHTER
THAT EVER WAS,

225
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,375
LIVES AND BREATHES FOR IT.

226
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,375
NO DOUBT RATTLING AROUND
IN THAT HEAD OF HIS.

227
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,166
NEVER KNOWN HIM TO HESITATE.

228
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,291
BACK IN THE DAY, I FOUGHT
JUST TO BE FIGHTING,

229
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,916
FOOL THAT I WAS.

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,791
BUT NOW, WHEN I HEAVE UP
THIS DAMN HEAVY SWORD OF MINE,

231
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,041
I KNOW THAT I'M DOING IT
TO MAKE THIS A WORLD

232
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,958
WHERE THE YOUNG ONES CAN LIVE
WITH SOME HOPE IN THEIR HEARTS.

233
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,041
IN FACT, I RECKON ALL OF US
WHO HAVE A DUTY TO A DOMAIN

234
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,208
AND THE FOLKS WHO LIVE IN IT
FEEL THAT WAY.

235
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,583
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND YOURSELF,
MASTER YUKIMURA.

236
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,166
IT'S HARD AS HELL
TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT FROM WRONG

237
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,666
WHEN YOU'RE HOPPING
BACK AND FORTH

238
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,541
LIKE THE SAND'S TOO HOT
FOR YOUR FEET.

239
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,291
- IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU KEEP
YOUR EYE TO THE FUTURE,

240
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,375
THESE INJUSTICES BECOME JUST.
IT'S THE WAY OF THE TIMES.

241
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,625
- DECIDE IN HERE
WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE.

242
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,333
THE PATH WILL MAKE ITSELF CLEAR.

243
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,750
IN YOUR HEART OF HEARTS,

244
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,291
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
UNCERTAINTY AGAIN.

245
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,208
- THE PEOPLE OF SATSUMA
ALL CAME HERE

246
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,458
AFTER BEING DRIVEN
FROM THEIR HOMES.

247
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,041
THIS PLACE IS THEIR LAST,
BEST CHANCE.

248
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,083
I FOUGHT WELL TODAY BECAUSE
I WANTED TO DEFEND THAT CHANCE.

249
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:07,250
YOURS IS A LAND OF CLEAR SKIES
AND DAZZLING SUNSHINE,

250
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,958
OF GENTLE WAVES
LAPPING THE SANDS.

251
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,958
I WANTED THIS PLACE
TO KNOW PEACE.

252
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:15,041
HE DID ASK, I FORGOT.

253
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,541
AFTER THE FINAL DEED OF VALOR,

254
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,833
ONCE THESE TURBULENT TIMES
HAS BEEN TAMED,

255
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,791
WHAT DO I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH?

256
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,958
WHAT FUTURE DO I WISH
FOR THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN?

257
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:31,750
LORD MASAMUNE, MORI MOTONARI,
TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI,

258
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,083
EVEN HIS LORDSHIP,
THE GREAT TIGER OF KAI,

259
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,333
WHEN THEY TAKE THE FIELD,
IT'S WITH GOALS AND IDEALS

260
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,583
UNSHAKABLY FIXED
IN THEIR HEARTS.

261
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,791
IT'S NOT THAT THEY NEVER WAVER,
THEY DO!

262
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,833
BUT WHEN THEY DO, THEY FIND
THE WILL TO OVERCOME IT.

263
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:50,708
IT'S NO WONDER I WAS UNABLE
TO BEST LORD MASAMUNE.

264
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:54,166
- GO AND STOP
THAT SUN-ADDLED PANSY MOTONARI.

265
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,958
HE'S HEADING BACK AROUND
TO FIGHT TOYOTOMI.

266
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,583
SO TAKE MY SOLDIERS WITH YOU,
IT OUGHT TO HELP MAKE UP

267
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,083
FOR THOSE WHO YOU LOST
AT ITSUKUSHIMA.

268
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,250
- BUT LORD SHIMAZU, THAT WOULD
LEAVE YOU DEFENSELESS.

269
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,416
- CALL THEM A PARTING GIFT.

270
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,666
NO NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT ME, YOUNG ONE.

271
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,000
I AIN'T FORGOTTEN
MY JIGEN TECHNIQUE.

272
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,125
AND I CAN STILL DEAL OUT
THE HURT.

273
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,250
- TRUE, BUT, SIR--

274
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,916
- SHARE A GOOD-BYE TOAST
WITH ME?

275
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,666
DON'T YOU LOSE THAT KIND HEART
YOU'VE GOT, YOU HEAR ME?

276
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,625
THOSE WHAT GOT THEM AGONIZE
OVER A LOT OF THINGS.

277
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,666
AND THEY MAKE THEIR FAIR SHARE
OF MISTAKES.

278
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,416
TAKES THEM FOREVER AND DAY
TO GET STRONG.

279
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,875
BUT ONCE THEY DO,
THEY'RE DAMN NEAR UNSTOPPABLE.

280
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:40,041
THEY'RE MEN JUST LIKE YOU,
WITH KIND HEARTS, I GUARANTEE.

281
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,916
NOW GET ON WITH YOU,
I KNOW YOU CAN BECOME

282
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,708
THE GREATEST WARRIOR
IN THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN.

283
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,791
- MANY THANKS, MILORD.

284
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,750
- KARMA HAS FAVORED US.

285
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,791
CRUSH ALL WHO OPPOSE US,
MY FORTRESS OF THE SUN!

286
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,416
BEHOLD, THE SUN BEGINS
ITS SKYWARD ASCENT.

287
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,375
- Toyotomi:
HANBEI.

288
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,791
- Takenaka:
WHAT IS IT, HIDEYOSHI?

289
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,416
- ONCE THE COUNTRY IS OURS,
I WANT YOU TO REST.

290
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,833
- WHAT?

291
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,625
- DID YOU THINK THAT I HAD
NOT NOTICED YOUR FATIGUE?

292
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,500
WITHOUT YOU, ALL MY PLANS
ARE FOR NAUGHT.

293
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,250
- YOU COULD OFFER ME THE WORLD,

294
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,625
I WOULDN'T TRADE IT
FOR THOSE FEW WORDS.

295
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,666
- ( coughing )

296
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,125
- Soldier 1:
MASTER TAKENAKA!

297
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,750
- Soldier 2: WHAT
HAPPENED? HE LOOKS TERRIBLE!

298
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,916
- Soldier 3:
CALL FOR THE DOCTOR,

299
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,125
AND NOTIFY LORD HIDEYOSHI.

300
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,166
- DON'T, THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT.

301
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,250
I'M JUST--

302
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,375
( coughing )

303
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,375
I'M JUST A LITTLE TIRED.
I'LL BE FINE.

304
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:26,666
YOU MEN HEAD FOR HARIMA
AS INSTRUCTED.

305
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,291
I'LL BE ALONG SHORTLY.

306
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,375
- BUT, MASTER--

307
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,333
- I AM GIVING YOU AN ORDER.

308
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,125
- ( all )
YES, SIR.

309
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:38,083
GRANT ME TIME.

310
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,000
JUST A LITTLE LONGER.

311
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,125
- Sarutobi:
SO, THIS IS WHERE WE STAND--

312
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,666
MORI'S ROLLING IN FROM THE WEST
WITH HIS FORTRESS.

313
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,041
HIDEYOSHI MUST BE HEADED
FOR ODAWARA LIKE WE THOUGHT.

314
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,708
THEY STARTED MOVING
AS SOON AS THEY CAUGHT WIND

315
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,041
OF WHAT UESUGI WAS UP TO.

316
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,791
THEY'RE FAST, I'LL GRANT
THEM THAT MUCH.

317
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,958
BUT THEY WOULDN'T DARE
LEAVE THE NORTH UNDEFENDED.

318
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,125
A HIDDEN ARMY IN OSHU, MAYBE,

319
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,041
OR PERHAPS FURTHER AWAY.

320
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,041
ARE THEY HEADING OUT
TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT

321
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,416
OF MORI'S FORTRESS?

322
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,416
INFORM OUR LORD TAKEDA
WITHOUT DELAY.

323
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,416
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU, I
JUST HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FIRST.

324
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,166
MIGHT AS WELL CHECK IN
ON OUR MASTER SANADA'S

325
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,625
MOVEMENTS WHILE I'M AT IT.

326
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,041
- Kasuga:
TAKEDA'S NINJA CORPS...

327
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,541
NICE THAT THE NEW GLIDERS

328
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,500
DON'T BLOW UP.
- HEY, THERE

329
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,583
BEEN A WHILE, HASN'T IT?

330
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,458
- SARUTOBI SASUKE,
YOU SCARED ME TO DEATH!

331
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,958
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SO HIGH-STRUNG.

332
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,708
COME ON, YOU'RE A NINJA.

333
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,375
HEADING BACK TO ECHIGO
TO REPORT IN, I ASSUME?

334
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,000
- I SENT A MESSENGER, BUT I'VE
GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

335
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,583
THAT DETACHMENT OF TOYOTOMI'S
IS HEADING WEST.

336
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,916
- BUT NO TAKENAKA HANBEI
IN SIGHT.  YEAH, I KNOW.

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,083
- SO--

338
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,625
- SO, WHY ISN'T THE
TRUSTED LIEUTENANT

339
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,791
OUT THERE LEADING THE CHARGE?

340
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,666
- ONE OF THOSE WHISTLES,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

341
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,291
- ONE OF WHAT?

342
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,291
- THOSE FLYING THINGS
YOUR NINJA JUST GLIDED PAST ON.

343
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,125
YOU FIXED THEM UP, I CAN TELL.

344
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,000
- OH, THOSE.  YEAH, RIGHT.

345
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,250
TECHNICALLY SPEAKING,
WE'RE NOT ALLIES RIGHT NOW.

346
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,583
SO WHY WOULD I GIVE YOU ONE?

347
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,583
KASUGA, YOU ARE SO NAIVE.

348
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,166
- I RISKED MY LIFE
AS YOUR UNWITTING GUINEA PIG

349
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,083
AND YOU--
- SHH!

350
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,083
TOYOTOMI'S PERSONAL SPY.

351
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,875
- WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHO COULD HAVE--

352
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,250
- THAT WAS--

353
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:40,000
- Chosokabe:
SO THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.

354
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,791
TOYOTOMI'S MAIN FORCE,
HEADED FOR ODAWARA I'D WAGER.

355
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,541
- MEANING THAT BASTARD MATSUNAGA

356
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,208
WAS IN LEAGUE WITH HIM
ALL ALONG.

357
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,333
- WHO KNOWS, TEAMING UP MEANS
THAT GRASPING OCTOPUS

358
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,458
ONLY GETS HIS TENTACLES
ON HALF OF THE PRIZE.

359
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,458
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO HERE,
ONE-EYED DRAGON?

360
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,708
THAT OVERGROWN APE IS GOING
TO TAKE THE KANTO PLAIN.

361
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,041
- SERIOUS?
YOU'VE STILL GOT TO ASK?

362
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,875
CATCH HIM AND TAKE HIM DOWN.

363
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,000
- Narrator: AND NOW, THE
RIVAL WARLORDS MAKE HASTE

364
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,000
FOR THEIR FINAL BATTLEGROUNDS
ACROSS THE LAND.

365
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,958
AIMING FOR THE PINNACLE
OF THE ERA,

366
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,041
THE BLADES RISING UP IN CHAOS
HOWL TO ONE ANOTHER.

367
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,125
- YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE,
TIME IS GROWING SHORT.

368
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,041
VERY SOON I SHALL HAVE
YOUR ANSWER OR YOUR LIFE.

369
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,875
- ( theme music plays )

370
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:35,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

371
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,625
- Sanada: PEACE IS MORE
THAN JUST MINDLESS TRANQUILITY.

372
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,875
I KNOW THAT NOW.

373
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,041
ONLY THOSE WHO CAN FACE
ANY AND ALL ADVERSITY

374
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,916
WITHOUT BUCKLING, AND WHO STOKE
THE FIRE IN THEIR HEARTS

375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,541
WILL ACHIEVE ALL
THAT THEY DESIRE.

376
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,916
AT THE FINAL BATTLE, MY SPIRIT
WILL IGNITE ONCE AGAIN!
