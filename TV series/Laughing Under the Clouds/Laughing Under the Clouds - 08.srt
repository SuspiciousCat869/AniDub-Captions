You cannot continue in
this way. It isn't healthy.

They're all but frozen.

[SORAMARU]

00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,291
Why isn't the sun out?

00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,541
The Orochi's dead, right?

00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,166
Why the rain?

How come this is

We need our mom and dad,

You can't go!

[SORAMARU]
It's been a week.

13
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,208
A week. That's all.

14
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:11,541
The house is so, so quiet now.

15

[TENKA]
Soramaru! Tea!

16
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,666
Going out.

17
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,083
[SHIRASU]
Again? Soramaru. Tenka wasn't--

18
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,458
[SORAMARU]
Yeah, I know.

19
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,750
[SHIRASU] He surrendered
his remains willingly--

20
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,750
to help us better
understand the Orochi.

21
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,541
It's not really
much of a comfort.

22
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,791
Damn it, his body
belongs here, at home!

23
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,541
He sacrificed enough for us.

Can't they give the man
his last dignity?

25
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,333
Can't they treat him
like a person?

00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,166
Soramaru, please!

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,208
Forgive me, Tenka.

28
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,625
I am but a poor
substitute for you.

29

Come on, you'll catch a cold.
Let's get outta here.

31

Sorry, sir. I'm
waiting for Tenny.

32
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,250
He'll be back any second now.
You know how it is with him.

33
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,958
Just when you think
he won't show, bam...

34
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,708
...out of nowhere
comes that big ol' smile.

35
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,166
And he'll say,
"Did you miss me?"

36
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,541
And we'll be like,
"What took you so long?"

Keep laughing!

[SORAMARU]
How do you expect us to do that?

Son of a bitch!

What is there left
to laugh at anymore?

[IWAKURA]
Unacceptable!

42
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,625
Why was the Orochi killed?

43
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,375
Blast it! I wanted him alive!

44
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,583
Did none of you think to inform
me of the vessel's capture?

45
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,458
[SOSEI]
My apologies, sir.

46
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,250
[IWAKURA]
Ah, enough!

47
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,958
Consider the squad disbanded.

48
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,666
[SOSEI] With all due respect,
we are palace guards--

49
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,208
[IWAKURA]
Silence!

50
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,958
The Orochi is gone.
The Yamainu is pointless.

51
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,375
The lot of you
were dogs at best.

52
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,500
No, wait.

53
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,041
Did he not have
a pair of siblings?

54
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,833
Yes. One named Chutaro,
the other Soramaru.

55
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,500
Both of them quite young.

56
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,166
Well, keep them under
close observation.

57
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,291
The Orochi favored their line.

58
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,958
Perhaps that will be
of some use to us.

59
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,875
[SOSEI]
As you wish, sir.

60

[door opens]

61
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,333
Did he give us the boot?

62
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,833
No. We've been offered
a chance to redeem ourselves.

63
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,333
And, Sasaki?

64
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,583
Report back to me when you have
a rein on your feelings.

Sir. I already do.

00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,125
Well, the look on your face
suggests otherwise.

67

I'm sorry. I'll do better.

68
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,500
It's none of my business,

69
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,250
but what's the issue with Kiiko?

70
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,125
It's Tenka.

71
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,291
She and the commander were on
intimate terms with the man

72
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,708
from their childhood.

73
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,041
I imagine his death
hit her rather hard.

74
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,291
She deals with it as she can.

75
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,791
[TAKEDA]
What about the commander?

76
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,791
The loss of a childhood friend
doesn't seem to have moved him.

77

[TAKAMINE]
Impressive, isn't it?

[ASHIYA] I wouldn't push
this if I were you, man.

It's dangerous territory.

Any way you slice it,
Sosei's still the boss.

His inner life
ain't our concern.

Couldn't have put it
better myself.

It's not our job
to ask questions.

It's our job to follow.

[HIRARI] Our intel maintains
that Mr. Iwakura and his pack

We court strength,

not for our own sake,
but for that of others.

Thus do we become
true warriors.

where'd you steal it from?

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,041
I was given it
by right, imbecile.

162
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,750
Aw, man! That's totally
and completely unfair!

163
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,833
Dad! How come we don't
have a family sword?

164
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,708
But we do. Now, stop
picking on each other

165
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,708
and I'll bring the sword
for you to see next time.

166
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,916
[SOSEI]
I have a question, Mr. Taiko.

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,916
[TAIKO] My, so formal.
What can I do for you?

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,791
[SOSEI] Do you think
there's any hope for me?

169
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:28,500
Do you think I can really
live up to the Abe name?

170
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,250
[TAIKO]
Never cast your eyes down.

171
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,500
Do you really think I'd take
pride in being your teacher

172
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,875
if there wasn't
any hope for you?

173
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,208
Think about it a sec.

174
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,416
Look outward. Be proud.

175
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,833
Tenka may be the
Yamainu Squad's head,

176
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,958
but you're without a
doubt its right arm.

177
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,166
That's why I'm
entrusting it to you.

178
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,583
I have to find him.

179
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,458
[SORAMARU]
You!

180
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,458
She's Fuma, isn't
she? That hair.

181
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,458
--[SHIRASU] Quite.
--[chopping]

182
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,916
The girl is,
I believe, a refugee.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,375
[SORAMARU]
What do you mean?

184
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,708
[SHIRASU] Some, like myself,
were taken in.

185
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,583
Fate smiled on us.

186
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,333
Others, Fate overlooked.

187
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,708
Ninja are put on this
earth to follow orders.

188
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,666
Lacking them, we
have no purpose.

189
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,291
For creatures like us,
hell is the freedom to choose.

190
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,791
[SORAMARU]
Whoa. That's rough.

191
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,875
[NISHIKI]
Master.

192
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,583
Stop it. I am
no one's master here.

193
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,416
[NISHIKI]
I beg your pardon.

194
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,041
A doctor tended to your
injuries while you slept.

195
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:23,041
--Thank Soramaru for that.
--He's one of your two wards?

196
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,000
When the injuries are healed,
I'll ask you to be on your way.

197
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,958
Do not become involved
with this family.

198
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,666
[NISHIKI]
Am I to understand

199
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,833
you have no intention
of restoring the clan?

200
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,125
[SHIRASU] I feel I was quite
clear on that matter.

201
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,666
I have no business
with an Unfledged, period.

202
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,375
Consider yourself free.

203
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,416
Hey, is she all right?

204
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,291
[SHIRASU]
Just awoken, I believe.

205
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,166
Why not sit with her
while I make tea?

206
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,083
Wanna tell me how
you got so torn up?

207
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,083
If only I could say.

208
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,166
All I can remember is something
attacking me in the woods.

209
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,083
Oh wow. Really?

210
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,083
How long has that man
been with you?

211
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:11,041
[SORAMARU] Who, Shirasu?
I'd guess about ten years maybe.

212
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,333
Huh. It's been so
long, I'm not sure.

213
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,583
He, uh-- he says you're a Fuma.

214
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,083
So...

215
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,041
how come only half
your hair is white?

216
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:26,083
[NISHIKI] I am what's
called an Unfledged.

217
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,041
[KITAMURA]
Soramaru!

218
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,833
[panting]

219
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,625
The hell's goin' on?

220
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,375
We sort of let a transport slip
through our fingers again!

221
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,000
We're fairly certain

222
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,666
he took refuge in the
woods near the shrine!

223
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,916
[KITAMURA] He could hide out
in there for months!

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,458
What am I gonna do?

225
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,000
[TSUCHIYA] Please! There's
no one else to ask!

226
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,208
[KITAMURA] Damn. There's not
a tree he couldn't be behind.

227
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,125
I'm thinking we ought to
split up to cover more ground.

228
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,375
Right. You okay with that?

229
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,375
We'll go off in one direction
while you keep an eye out here.

230
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,375
Sure. Yeah.

231
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,208
[TSUCHIYA]
All right. Let's do it.

232
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,000
[leaves rustling]

233
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,125
[SORAMARU]
Who's there?

234
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,458
Not a good time to be
wandering around!

235
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,458
[NISHIKI] I thought my talents
might be of service to you.

236
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,583
Seriously? Dressed like
that? Are you nuts?

237
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,833
Look, just go back
to the house and rest.

238
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,500
Don't shun me.

239
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,666
You lose nothing by
agreeing to let me help.

240
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,583
It's not exactly helpful
if you pass out again.

241
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,208
So thanks, but no thanks.

242
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,041
[NISHIKI]
Use me. I beg you.

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,833
[SORAMARU]
Uh... why are you shaking?

244
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,791
[NISHIKI] I am an Unfledged.
No one will give me orders.

245
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,625
I am less than useless.

246
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,250
[SORAMARU]
Hey, c'mon. Cheer up.

247
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,791
Can it really be all that bad?

248
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,000
[NISHIKI]
I look as I do

249
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,208
because I fled
from the darkness.

250
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,750
I was weak.

251
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,791
The Fuma are not born with
white locks and violet eyes.

252
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:16,000
In truth, we bear the outward
markings of any normal person.

253
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:20,750
Yet from infancy we are taught
death, murder, warfare.

254
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,041
We are prevailed
upon by evil magic

255
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,083
used to extinguish our hearts.

256
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,083
We are made to kill a beloved,

257
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,958
then entombed in a box,
surrounded by darkness.

258
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:36,166
Days pass. Madness encroaches.

259
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,125
Slowly, the abyss
becomes part of you.

260
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,375
I couldn't stand it.

261
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,250
So I ran.

262
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:54,125
Thus I am now neither
Fuma nor human.

263
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:58,333
You see, when I caught wind
of the clan's annihilation,

264
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,416
I thought revenge might
open a path to salvation.

265
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,375
You thought the Fuma
would forgive you.

266
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,625
Life without purpose
is no life at all.

267
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,875
I am adrift in a sea
of nothingness and fear.

268
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,291
I need orders. I need meaning.

269
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,375
I'm sorry, this isn't the
place to look for orders.

270
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,958
Here, you're free to do
as you damn well please.

271
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,666
I know that may be
terrifying to you,

272
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,166
but hear me out.

273
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,166
We're a lot alike.

274
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,541
Both lost.

275
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,833
Scared.

276
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,458
But so what?

277
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,083
Everybody is. That's life.

278
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,958
You gotta pick up and move on.

279
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,583
And when things
are at their worst,

280
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,500
you wait for a reason to laugh!

281
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
[SORAMARU]
Look at us.

282
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,708
Like we're even old enough
to regret being alive.

283
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,375
"Fear and nothingness," my foot.

284
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,125
And who says we can't
sail this sea together, right?

285
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,083
Now. Let's get you home.

286
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,625
Here, climb on.

287
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,250
We pretty much

288
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,708
have our mysterious
ninja quota covered, but...

289
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,666
we could use help with odds
and ends around the shrine,

290
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,333
if you're interested.

291
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,750
The pay is room and board.

292
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,541
It's not exactly glamorous,

293
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,750
but you could do worse for
three squares a day and a bed.

294
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,875
I...

295
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,625
Ugh. C'mon, my legs
are gettin' numb.

296
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,375
The trick is to not give
yourself time to feel afraid.

297
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:57,625
Let hope find its own way.
The rest is easy.

298
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,083
[SORAMARU]
Hey, Tenka. Check it out.

299
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm taking in
another freeloader.

300
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,958
Happy?

301
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,416
Sensei!

302
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,458
I'm here for my training, sir!

303
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,875
Teach me to be a warrior!

304
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,916
Come.

305
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,166
[panting]

306
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,416
He bested you not
even once, I take it?

307
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,416
Ha. Of course not.

308
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,708
No, not yet.
But I will one day.

309
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,166
I may not ever be
as strong as Tenka,

310
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,875
but I'll carry the
torch any way I can.

311
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,625
[SOSEI]
Powerful words, those.

312
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,458
Worthy of your family.

313
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,166
Do you mean them?

314
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,416
Yes. With all my heart and soul.

315
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,916
With all my pride as a Kumoh!

316
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,708
[SOSEI]
When looking outward,

317
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,458
fix your eye on those
you'd protect.

318
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,916
[SORAMARU]
Yes, sensei!

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,833
[TAKAMINE]
Whaddya know?

320
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,833
The boy's got some
fire in him yet.

321
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,500
The commander's a good teacher.

322
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,250
Takamine, sir!
Train me like that!

323
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,750
Yeah? What do I get?

324
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,666
I, uh-- a bottle of wine?

325
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,541
Make it three.

326
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,375
Sir. I'm being serious.

327
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,458
Good. So am I.

328
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:20,000
Believe me, you won't be low
man on the totem pole forever.

329
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,041
When that happens,
I want you ready.

330
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,791
Yes, sir.

331
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,791
[SORAMARU]
Today,

332
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,458
I take the title,

333
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,666
the burden, and the duty
of my brother!

334
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,250
Head of the Kumoh Line!

335
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,833
Good to have you home.

336
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,916
Thanks a lot. Good to be home.

337
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,583
[GEROKICHI cooing]

338
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,333
[SORAMARU]
Gerokichi?

339
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,875
Is that Chutaro's hat?

340
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,583
I have to wonder where he'd
be this late in the day.

341
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,041
Especially...

342
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,583
that is, given his
considerable youth,

343
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,416
Tenka's absence will lead
him to mischief, I fear.

344
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,458
[SORAMARU]
Get your butt home, Chutaro.

345
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,250
I mean it.

346
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,875
[KAGAMI]
Hey-hey! What are the odds?

347
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,875
We haven't seen each other
since that day.

348
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,291
[CHUTARO]
Kagami!
