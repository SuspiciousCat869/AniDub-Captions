Japan struggles to quell

In Otsu, Shiga,

a great prison rises from
the center of Lake Biwa,

So, where are they now?

Heavy day for
them, you know?

I made sure they were
tucked in and all that.

Figure we'll drop by the

That poor boy.

I certainly hope
his memory recedes.

[TENKA]
I think what came to him

21
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,458
when he was being
choked was pretty vague.

22

Just bits and pieces.

However this family sees
fit to use me is my pleasure.

Come on, man. Why do you
have to say it like that?

Nah. It'll be fine.

hate you, okay?

He's just traumatized.
He needs a good laugh.

Well, yeah.

That's what I was doing.

Ah, but times like these
call for a special prop.

I still question your charity.

Taking a man like that
under wing was a huge risk.

It's not like he's
waiting to turn on me.

He's bad stock, Tenka.

How long have you known

106

are more than legend

to someone my age.

111
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,208
There was the Koga,
fierce advocates

112
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,458
of the wretched
and disenfranchised.

The Iga, who lived and
died by the contracts

114
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,791
of their wealthy patrons.

115
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,166
Such wild, cutthroat days.

116

Death walked quietly,

117
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,791
took indiscriminately.

118
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,125
And the Fuma--

Ended long enough ago now

120
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,000
that they might as well
have been a bad dream.

00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,083
Yes, well. Funny
thing about dreams.

122
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,666
Sometimes you can't tell
them apart from what's real.

123
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,000
Kinjo Shirasu
is a trusted friend.

So, cut the guy a
little slack, huh, Doc?

If you don't knock it off with
this talk, I'm gonna get angry.

Forgive me.

You'll probably want to
make haste for the shrine.

We have intelligence
that Naoto Kagami

the way from the Choshu region.

163
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,416
but Tenny said we're
not working today.

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,833
Huh. Well this is awkward.

165
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,291
I didn't realize you
gentlemen took holidays.

166
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,125
Can you work an oar, son?

167
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,333
No, sir.

168
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,000
Not without Tenny's
permission I can't.

169
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,666
I picked up quite a few stories

170
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,833
about you and your
brothers on the way here.

171
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,041
You're pretty strong, huh?

172
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,416
I don't know about that,
but Tenny sure is, sir!

173
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,583
Heh. He's amazing.

174
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,541
I'd be lucky to be
like him when I grow up!

175
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,291
Whoa.

176
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,625
Now Tenny's the oldest, right?

177
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,750
Uh-huh. Next oldest is Sora.

178
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,125
He's not as amazing as Tenny

179
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,458
but the food he
makes is delicious!

180
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,916
And now he wishes I were dead.

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,125
I thought poop would
make everything okay

182
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,125
but all it did was make
him madder at me.

183
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,916
Aw, there, there, kiddo.
Don't lose heart.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,041
He'll come around.

185
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,625
Huh?

186
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,291
Imagine what'd he'd think if
you ferried me to Gokumonjo,

187
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,041
all by yourself
without any help.

188
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,583
I'd be impressed.

189
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,875
You've become a man, Chutaro!

190
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,791
I'm so proud I could cry!

191
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,791
No. No.

192
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,541
You know, I had brothers
of my own once upon a time.

193
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,750
Our family was torn
part years ago, though.

194
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,916
I haven't seen them
since I was little.

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,083
It's sad.

196
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,041
I can't remember
their faces now.

197
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,375
But deep down,
something tells me

198
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,166
we'll all be
reunited one day.

199
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,750
I shouldn't be
telling you this,

200
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,583
but the mission I'm on
might help me find them.

201
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,250
As a matter of fact,
you're in a unique position

202
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,708
to help me make that so.

203
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,458
I could help you?

204
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,958
All right then, I'll do it!

205
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,041
You can count on me, sir!

206
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,583
Excellent.

207
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,833
I had a feeling.

208
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,083
[CHUTARO]
Let's go!

209
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,125
[SORAMARU]
Chutaro!

210
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,916
[CHUTARO]
Oh, hey! You came back!

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,958
I don't know who you are,

212
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,583
but get the hell away
from my brother!

213
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,083
[CHUTARO]
What?

214
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,625
[SORAMARU]
Run and get Shirasu.

215
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,750
[CHUTARO]
Uh.

216
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,291
I have to take this
man to Gokumonjo.

217
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,250
Do as I say!

218
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,375
[CHURATO crying]

219
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,291
Oh boo.

220
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,750
Did you have to make him cry?

221
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,625
I'm gonna gamble and say
you're not from around here.

222
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,791
That weird accent
is pure Choshu.

223
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,625
Soften that tone a bit, huh?

224
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,625
I'm just a simple
traveler hoping to book

225
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,750
passage in your pretty
little boat, nothing more.

226
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,166
Spare me the act.

227
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,791
I happened to pass three
policemen on the way here.

228
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,875
Every one of them a corpse.

229
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,750
Coincidentally, you
reek of their blood.

230
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,583
I must be speaking
to the eldest.

231
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,208
I'm told you're amazing.

232
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,250
Must be hard living
up to that hype, huh?

233
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,083
Wouldn't want
to disappoint you.

234
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,375
[KAGAMI]
Oh-ho.

235
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,875
So you're Tenka?

236
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,250
The one and only.

237
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,458
Now what may I ask does
a filthy, murdering lowlife

238
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,500
want with a warrior?

239
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,500
Oh. Just a bit of fun!

240
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,583
Is that all?

241
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,000
You guys are supposed
to be the army?

242
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,458
Tenka, please!
You've gone too far!

243
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,708
Who says?

244
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,458
[OFFICER] You've taken
out a battalion, sir.

245
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,416
They started this mess.
My conscience is clear.

246
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,583
No retreat!

247
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,708
But, sir!

248
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,458
Do not mistake our
opponent for a man.

249
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,250
He is a monster.

250
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,666
Coming through, boys!

251
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,875
Nothing personal.

252
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,500
Who are you losers
taking orders from anyway?

253
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,583
From me.

254
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,083
Rakucho Takeda.

255
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,375
My squadron answers
to the government.

256
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,333
Well doesn't that sound fancy.

257
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,958
--[TAKEDA] You and me. Now.
--[TENKA] Meh.

258
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,125
[TAKEDA]
What?

259
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,625
I'm not doing this
for the hell of it.

260
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,666
I have somewhere to be.

261
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,333
So, sorry but some other time!

262
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,125
You dare to run from me?

263
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,666
Try to look at the bright side.

264
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,250
I would've totally wiped
the floor with you.

265
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,500
Of course you would flee!

266
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,333
Just as from your past!

267
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,833
Yes, I imagine it's
sensible to turn a blind eye.

268
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,833
Must protect your
brothers from the truth.

269
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,500
From what the Orochi--

270
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,500
I get it, you're a masochist.

271
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,208
[TENKA]
That do it for you?

272
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,791
Let's get one thing straight.

273
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,458
Whether you're military or not,

274
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,875
under these clouds, my clan
defends the common good.

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,333
You're not the law.

276
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,875
You're just pissing the law off.

277
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,583
That's rich.

278
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,958
You lecturing me
about the common good.

279
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,958
This squadron could've
used your strength!

280
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,083
Yet you fritter it away
in this backwater

281
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,958
while your country
is in shambles!

282
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,375
Charity begins at home.

283
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,583
Besides, what do you want?

284
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,541
It's all I can do to keep
the people close to me

285
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,833
out of harm's way.

286
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,291
Poor trees.

287
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,166
Your shrine won't
have any shade.

288
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,750
What is he?

289
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,541
I--

290
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,416
[MAN]
Naoto Kagami.

291
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,250
A fisherman from
the Choshu region.

292
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,458
Ambidextrous. Slim build.

293
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,500
Considerable
upper-body strength.

294
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,458
Combat training unknown.

295
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,416
Though he studied at Seizan,
where evidently the seed

296
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,125
of his ultra-nationalist
politics was first planted.

297
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,583
His methods are
bloody and merciless.

298
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,583
So much so he was
estranged from his own cause.

299
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,958
This is his idea of revenge.

300
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,416
His preferred weapon
is called Dodomeki,

301
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,833
a kind of sword.

302
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,375
Our latest reports place
him in the vicinity of Shiga.

303
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,541
That's all we know.

304
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,458
But why, if he's such
a bloody-minded

305
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,041
anti-foreign zealot,

306
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,333
would he bare his fangs against
the government of his Emperor?

307
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,708
It's not our job to
puzzle out the rationale

308
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,291
of a man driven mad
with devotion.

309
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,833
The point being,
he's in Shiga.

310
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,250
I say ignore it.

311
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,666
Let the police do their job.

312
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,166
I'd agree.

313
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,666
Except Takeda's already
moved in without authorization.

314
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,208
Our hand's forced.

315
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:04,041
Well, the Kumoh Shrine
is in that neighborhood.

316
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,166
Might be useful.

317
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,125
We'll scrounge for information

318
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,333
on the vessels
while we're there.

319
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,125
[WOMAN]
Where the Commander goes,

320
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,791
it's for us to follow.

321
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,541
[SORAMARU]
No! No running away!

322
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,666
You're killing me, champ.

I knew Shirasu was strong, but

to come back?

The ninja must be
hard-up for new masters.

This regime makes

The Shogunate is helping foreign

and he seized it!

Isn't that a man's right,

access to Gokumonjo.

If he can free the criminals
interred within its walls,

plunged into anarchy.

00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,708
[SOSEI]
Our goal is very simple.

484
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,250
[BOTH] Locate the Vessel
by any means necessary,

485
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,166
before the Orochi can return.

486
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,166
--[TENKA] And protect it.
--[SOSEI] And break it.

487
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,416
[BOTAN]
You mean what you say.

488
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,708
Protect the Vessel
of the Orochi?

489
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,791
[TENKA]
It's the Orochi

490
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:36,958
we should be hunting,

491
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,625
not the person who
serves as its vessel.

492
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,583
I'm not a big fan of
spilling innocent blood.

493
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,125
[SORAMARU]
The vessel of the Orochi?

494
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,166
I don't understand.
What's going on?
