Why are they doing this?

He's revealed himself to be
the vessel of the Orochi.

The government has no choice.

Tenka will be publicly
executed on the pretext

of having bombed Gokumonjo.

Why is right now the first

Why would no one talk to me?

A few days ago, this
whole "Orochi" thing

10

was just some old wives' tale.

And now my brother's
being executed?

He knew what was going on
and kept us in the dark!

Tenka has tried to do

With the blood comes a

Oh, is that a fact?

Precisely what

This falls outside

Six hundred years ago,

a great tree rose from the

soaring upward to the sky above.

It was there that the
Orochi's pride was wounded,

and his grudge toward the
blood of your family born.

Time and again,

Time and again, the sky
darkens at his approach.

So, that's why the sky is
always so cloudy and stuff,

a special kind of idiot.

[TENKA]
What I owe you isn't lost on me.

Hey. Do a dead man a favor

get the book thrown at 'em.

they're harmless.

[HIRARI]
Of course.

170

I can count on you
for that. Right, Hirari?

171
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,500
I knew you for an imbecile,
but this is beyond the pale.

Sosei.

173
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,083
What kind of sadist
comes all this way

174
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,916
to see a guy he doesn't
like kick the bucket?

175
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,958
Why didn't you say anything
when you realized?

176
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,833
How long have you known?

177
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,750
And here I thought
I'd go to my grave

178
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,708
before you guys
pieced it all together.

179

Guess I should've
had more faith.

Damn you!

182
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,750
Why did you leave the squad?

183
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,958
It was your life's
goal to join,

184
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,916
your dream, and you walked away.

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,125
Hey. What can I say?

186
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,166
Dreams can go sour.

187
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,250
Hunting down the Orochi's
vessel was great at first.

188
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:23,125
It felt like we'd been entrusted
with something really special,

189
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,458
that we could be heroes
behind the scenes.

190
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,125
So in the beginning,

191
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,541
the squad was everything
I wanted it to be.

192
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,500
We were loyal to Japan,
to each other.

193
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,333
It was fantastic.

194
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,291
All the more because
I was with you.

195
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't speak to me about loyalty,
after you betrayed me!

196
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,208
You had two brothers who
could've taken over the shrine

197
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,916
after your parents died!

198
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,291
You didn't have to
take it upon yourself!

199
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,750
Your zeal was everything to us,
and then you were just gone.

200
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,666
We all needed your guidance.

201
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,125
We needed you and
you left us to rot!

202
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,166
So yeah, you're damn
right dreams go sour!

203
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,583
Here's to being heroes.

204
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,458
I did what I had to do.

205
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:10,916
I'm sorry, but that's
just how I'm made.

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll take "big brother"
over "hero" any day.

207
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,250
Uggh!

208
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,833
Then I guess you've made
peace with being alone.

209
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh hey, that reminds me.

--He is.
--Yes.

You're not about to ask me
to look after him, are you?

213
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,375
Of course. How
infuriatingly typical.

214
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,208
Let's not fool ourselves
into believing

to try and reach you?

Cry.

316
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,250
Scream.

317
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,166
Be fierce.

318
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,333
But most of all...

319
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,625
...keep laughing!

320
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,625
[TENKA] Especially when
the clouds hang low.

321
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,666
[BOTAN] Year 11 of
Emperor Meiji's reign.

322
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,416
A turbulent time.

323
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,750
Behind the heavy clouds...

324
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,791
[thud]

325
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,958
...the sun sets.

326
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,875
[HIRARI] Where is he that kept
laughing under the clouds?

327
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,625
Where is he that wept
beneath the lowering sky?

328
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:38,583
Beyond my furthest reach,
perhaps, but not my thought.

329
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,500
Let then these words find you.

330
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,375
You are not alone.

331
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,083
One day, we shall meet again.

332
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,083
Only promise me...

333
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,416
...you'll laugh until we do.
