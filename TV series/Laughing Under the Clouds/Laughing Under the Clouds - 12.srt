I think we can handle
these vermin ourselves.

13

You're the best one of us to go
head-to-head with the Orochi.

Let the Fuma be our concern.

It's Hirari, right?

in peak condition?

Our lord has been
separated from the vessel.

The Great Serpent's
rebirth is assured.

67
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,000
Separated from the chosen host,

68
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,291
he's unable to be sealed.

69
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,208
[BOTAN] Are you certain?
I rather wonder.

70
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,625
The Kumoh family swords
are rife with his own magic,

71
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,791
and yet he is averse
to them as if to poison.

72
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,625
Can it be that the Orochi
is lethal to himself?

73
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,625
That's impossible.

74
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,583
[BOTAN] Is it? Or is the
vessel his deadliest foe?

75
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,208
C'mon, talk to me, kid.

00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,208

Okay.

00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,708
There's still work to be done.

94
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,750
We cut the Orochi from
your body, but now he's free.

still use Lake Biwa

to don his snake form.

97
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,541
If we don't put a stop
to this once and for all,

98
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,125
he'll keep comin' back.

99
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,125
But how do we stop him?
The Orochi's an immortal being.

100
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,583
As I understand it, he has
to be sealed, correct?

101
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,250
Only the vessel can do it,

102
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,250
and it won't be that easy.

103

I'm in.

Hey, whatever it takes, right?

107
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,416
My ancestors have used
this weapon to subdue

108
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,833
the Great Serpent
for generations.

109
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,583
May it serve you well.

110

Can't forget this.

Watch me.

I'm about to make you proud.

Or jealous. One of the two.

But aren't you coming?

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,250
Yeah. I'll catch up soon.

Wait just a minute!

124
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,375
I'm not about to let a couple
of brats hog all the glory!

125
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,166
It's early yet to fall into
a swoon, don't you think?

126
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,750
Gimme a break, man.

127
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,458
I'm kinda at my
limit here as it is.

128
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,916
Let a guy get some rest.

Where's the harm in that?

He miraculously survives
execution only to plea

for a moment's repose.

132

For the record, you might've
told me of Iwakura's bid for

longevity before now.

I know he's been
terminally ill.

Just as I know you're the
guinea pig for his Orochi serum.

136

Why keep that a
secret from me?

Why bother spillin'
the beans, huh?

138
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,583
It's not like I did this
with you in mind.

139
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,333
It was all for the rug rats.

Sorry to upset
everybody, though.

141

For what it's worth, that's
the one thing I regret.

[TENKA] Look. I acknowledge
you have every right

143
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,625
to hate my guts.

144
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,250

done differently?

On your feet.

147
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,791
I would've tried my damnedest

to do right by those

they knew where I stood.

151

Of course it's easy to apportion
blame in times like these.

152
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,041
But hypotheticals
are meaningless.

153
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,541
In any event, it's not
what I would've done.

154

It's what I plan to do.

Uh-uh! Don't just walk away!

You owe me an explanation.

for what he did to us?

Good question.
