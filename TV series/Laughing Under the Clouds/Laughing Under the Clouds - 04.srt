Closest thing we
have to a clinic.

The head warden found
you passed out.

Took it upon himself
to carry you here.

say that's not like me.

Without Tenka, I'm nothing.
Just a scared little kid.

63

I couldn't do for him
what he did for me.

64

is on the other side.

--Who is it?
--I don't know, why can't you

just ask the higher-ups,
or whatever.

--Whoa! Hands off!

74
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,958
Well, what do we have here?
Looks like I'll have to tell

75
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,500
the higher-ups we've
got ourselves a spy.

All right, all right!

77
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,791
The guy was like...
I guess he wears a fox mask

78
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,333
and he has long, white hair.

Wait a minute? You know
who the bastard is?

--What do you care?
--I...

revenge, right?

Call it what you like.
I intend to exact a price

commensurate with what I lost.

That is my right.
In my situation,

92
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
you would feel like I do.

by the man in that cell.

I want him dead.

96
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:04,541
But I'm just a kid, I'm
powerless to do anything.

Help me. And I'll
give you your revenge.

our price of him as one.

seems so easy.

00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,791
Tell me that you do.

165
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,291
--Hm?
--I was just five years old,

166
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,291
the day you murdered
my parents in cold blood.

167
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,541
You're speaking to one for
whom that might've been

168
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,208
any given day.

169
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,291
You took my family from me!

170
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,000
I will never forget!
I will never forgive!

171
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,625
Ahh... you've come
to be vindicated.

172
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,458
I suppose you want
to kill me, then?

173
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,666
No... no, you're wrong.
I'm not like you,

174
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,541
I don't kill people,
I protect them.

175
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,458
I won't stoop to spilling blood
to satisfy my hatred.

176
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,375
I won't throw away the family
I have left over you!

177
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,333
Better to let you live...
let you rot behind these walls

178
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,166
for the rest of your days,
but I'll be damned

179
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,833
if you brush me off.

180
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,500
I am Soramaru Kumoh.

181
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,625
The boy whose
parents you killed.

182
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,250
The young man who punched
you in the face.

183
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,541
Remember my name.

184
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,708
[door opens, slams]

185
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,625
Oh... I will.

186
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,291
Well done, my friend. That was
very much in character.

187
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,541
You knew all along?

188
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,125
You did, didn't you?

189
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,250
I was asked not
to say anything.

190
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,000
Tenka again, huh?

191
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,083
I'm sure he was just
worried about you.

192
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,416
Ah, whatever, he treats
me like a little kid.

193
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,875
Does he, now?

194
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,000
It's not like I can blame him
for that... look at me.

195
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,375
He knew everything.

196
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,708
Carried it on his back
so we wouldn't have to.

197
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,583
And still somehow managed
to cut up and make us laugh

198
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,208
all the time.

199
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,375
Wait! I'm so sorry.
There's something else.

200
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,958
Give me just a minute!

201
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,875
[footsteps departing]

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,791
[SORAMARU]
Up here!

203
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,583
What are you doing?

204
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,416
Hey, let me ask you...
when's the last time

205
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,291
you laughed?

206
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,416
No idea.

207
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,875
Not something I'm prone to.

208
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,291
Listen to me! True strength
is being able to laugh

209
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,333
in the face of pain!

210
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,750
Is that a fact?

211
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,250
Yes it is! Whenever you
give in to hatred,

212
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,458
the bastard wins!

213
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,208
Don't surrender your soul!

214
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,166
Laugh to spite what
he's done to you.

215
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,625
Is this a pep talk?

216
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,875
Why not?

217
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,541
Oh, and hey...

218
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,875
Here... you left this!

219
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,708
Thank you.

220
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,541
True strength...
that's what it's all about.

221
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,041
Helping people.

222
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,833
Hey... Tenka? Chutaro?

223
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,041
Sorry for all this.

224
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,625
I'm coming home.

225
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,208
Whaddaya say you
give us a smile?

226
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,375
In fact, let's all
have a good laugh.

227
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,708
I still can't believe I let
you take advantage of me.

228
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,541
It was all for an
excellent cause.

229
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,416
Oh, and nice work,
by the way.

230
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,250
It seems I underestimated you.

231
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,708
Yeah? Well, most of the credit
goes to your superior.

232
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,500
Hmph. Well, did you
find anything out?

233
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,916
[SORAMARU]
Little bit.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,458
[TAKEDA]
You really want the Commander

235
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,541
to teach you
swordsmanship that badly?

236
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,833
Why, when there's an expert
living under your own roof.

237
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,750
[SORAMARU] My brother only
trains me when he feels like it.

238
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,291
Well, that and his idea
of giving lessons

239
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,666
is beating the snot out of me.

240
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,500
What kind of a man is he?

241
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,375
I've been hearing
all sorts of things.

242
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,583
Honestly? The guy's
kind of a jerk.

243
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:26,125
For one thing, he makes me
and Chutaro do all the chores.

244
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,750
If there're no
criminals to catch,

245
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,541
he just lies around
all day. He doesn't bathe,

246
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,083
he takes stuff without asking,
he'd be late to his own funeral.

247
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,333
[TAKEDA]
Sounds like a real joy

248
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,708
--to be around.
--Still though, it's not easy

249
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,750
bein' our brother

250
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,083
and dad at the same time.

251
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,791
Ahh... so you do
respect him, then?

252
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,125
[SORAMARU]
More or less.

253
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,708
It's hard not to, growing
up, looking at his back.

254
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:51,000
Ask him about it sometime.
He'll tell you.

255
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,041
Nah, at the end of the day,
he's a decent man.

256
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,166
Huh?

257
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,833
So... ra... ma... ru!

258
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,375
Wait, I--

259

Whine your way out of
this one, ya li'l pissant!

260

261

--as a smile.
--Ow!

00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,083
What a relief. Glad he's
home safe and sound.

00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,958
Yes, ma'am, I think
we're all pretty glad.

264
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,791
I do hope Master Tenka
takes it easy on the boy.

265
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,458
I uh, I wouldn't count on that.

266
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,458
Hmmmmmmm....

267
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,583
Hey, I said I was
sorry, all right?

268
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,083
I know I screwed up.
I won't do it again.

269
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,333
And stop lookin'
at me like that.

270
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,708
I'm disappointed in you, man.

271
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,250
You break my heart.

Beggin' that Yamainu butt-stick
for swordsmanship lessons?

273
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,375
You'd rather learn from him
than your own flesh and blood?

274
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,750
Oh, no...

275
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,333
Am I not good enough?
Or do you wanna up your game

276
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,041
behind my back so you
can take me by surprise?

277
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,125
Either or, way to let
that Qian-Lang freak

278
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,375
get his hooks into you.

279
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,416
How'd you know about that?

280
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,958
How do you think I know?

281
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,041
Did it ever cross your
mind why they wanted you

282
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,708
inside Gokumonju
in the first place?

283
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,666
--Well...
--Look, just, point is,

284
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,375
stay away from
those people, okay?

285
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,375
I didn't know
what I was doing.

286
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,666
I-- I'll make it up to you.

287
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,208
One false step and
you'd have never seen

288
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,416
the light of day again.

289
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,291
I mean, hell, your
life was at stake,

290
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,708
you could've been killed.

291
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,458
I was ready for that.

292
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,875
Don't even go there,
you have no clue

293
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,250
what it means to
be ready to die!

294
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,833
D'you even care that
Chutaro was worried?

295
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,041
How 'bout the trouble
you put Shirasu through?

296
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,041
I thought I'd have to
barge in there myself

297
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,000
and make a big scene.
No. Screw that.

298
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,458
You don't get to talk
like a big shot.

299
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,541
Why the hell can't
you rely on me?

300
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,875
We're family, aren't we?

301
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,958
Look, don't say that.
I do rely on you,

302
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,208
I always have.

303
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,500
And that's the problem.

304
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,125
Because you take it
all on yourself.

305
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,291
The scar on your back is proof.

306
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,375
Hold up! You
remember that night?

307
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,250
It's all right,
I needed to.

308
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,750
I needed to remember
the sacrifices you've made

309
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,583
for us. Let me turn
your words around

310
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:08,916
on you... why can't
you rely... on me?

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,416
We are family,
after all, right?

312
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,666
[SORAMARU]
Chutaro could ask you

313
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,666
the same thing.

314
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,166
Yes, he's young...
but he tries.

315
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,458
And every day I practice,
proud to call myself a Kumoh.

316
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,458
Because one day, I'm gonna
live up to that name.

317
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,500
Aw, come on, don't cry.

318
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,666
[TENKA]
It's cool. I get you.

319
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,333
Big bro can read
between the lines.

320

[SORAMARU]
Are you listening to me?

321
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,041
[TENKA]
Little birdie's

322
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,208
leaving the nest!

323
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,083
Oh, Gerokichi...

324
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,166
Chutaro...

325
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,250
could you go inside
for a moment, please?

326
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,500
Your brothers might need you.

327
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,541
[TENKA]
Ohhhhh!

328
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,750
[SORAMARU]
Shut up! Stop it!

329
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,333
[TENKA]
Soramaru is going out

330
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,666
into the world on his own!

331
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,458
Sora, how could you?

332
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,416
I'm not letting you
leave without me!

333
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,208
Hm.

334
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,291
Whatever your knowledge
of the Orochi,

335
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,708
it would be best
if you stayed

336
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,416
out of Tenka's way.

337
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,666
I think he knows
what he's doing.

338
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,166
That came out of nowhere.

339
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,541
You'll have to forgive me.
It's odd to see a Fuma

340
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,416
so concerned with
another person

341
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,791
not of... "the blood."

342
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,333
[SHIRASU]
We've spoken of this.

343
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,625
The Fuma belong
to a distant past.

344
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,875
It was extinguished
a long time ago.

345
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,083
Slaughtered.

346
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,041
By a child.

347
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,250
One of their own.

348
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,166
One who saw his advantage
in the clan's diminished glory.

349
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,541
Its thinning stock.

350
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,333
Who, in a single
night, struck true

351
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:44,083
and folded my clansmen
into their common dust.

352
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,833
Alone, I wandered aimlessly.

353
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:52,500
Feared... despised.
Not even the cold solace

354
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,458
of revenge was mine.

355
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,875
[gunshot]

356
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,416
I lost everything.

357
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,458
And then... one day...

358
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,375
fate took pity on me.

359
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:19,041
Now, the world sees fit
to bless me with a home.

360
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:23,791
So... I say again,
the Fuma are dead.

361
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:27,833
I am a servant
of the Kumoh blood.

362
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,500
[TENKA]
Okey-dokey!

363
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,166
Bedtime!

364
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,375
--Yes, in the morning.
--Huh?

365
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,791
None of us has slept,
we've gotta catch up

366
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,625
sometime, right? Let's do it,

367
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,166
go crawl under those sheets!

368
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,208
Aye-aye, sir!

369
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,000
Sweet dreams, you guys!

370
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,666
--[rooster crows]
--I can't do this.

371
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,333
Ohh... what's wrong?
We slept like this

372
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,916
all the time
when we were little.

373
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
It's nostalgic!

374
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,041
[SORAMARU]
It's ridiculous.

375
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,083
--Nuh-uh! Come on, don't go!
--Please don't go!

376
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,625
This sucks! Ugh! It's cramped

377
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,000
and Chutaro thrashes
in his sleep like--

378
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,125
[TENKA]
Stop bein' a killjoy!

379
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,541
Dog pile!

380
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,416
[SORAMARU]
Get off me, you're too big!

381
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,666
[CHUTARO]
I'm the sumo champion!

382
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,750
[TENKA laughs]

383
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,666
Fine... if it's that important,

384
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,291
--get in bed already.
--[laughing] I knew

385
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,500
we could wear you down.

386
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,666
Ha!

387
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,958
[TENKA]
Seriously, man, why you always

388
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,500
wanna act so grown up?

389
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,958
[SORAMARU]
Somebody's got to.

390
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,500
[CHUTARO]
So grumpy.

391
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,625
[SORAMARU]
Go to sleep.

392
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,458
Tell me this ain't
the good life, eh?

393
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,375
Hm...

394
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,208
[TENKA]
Oh, right, by the way,

395
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:37,333
Soramaru? [laughs] Welcome home.

396
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,625
It's good to have you back.

397
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,833
Yeah. Thanks.

398
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,250
Good to be back.

399
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,625
[SHIRASU]
There, there. Time to eat.

400
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,333
Skittish creature,
will you never find it

401
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,708
in your heart to
see me as a friend?

402
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:36,250
Whoever's there,
you may come out.

403
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,666
Oh, my.

404
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,000
My long search ends today.

405
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,208
I've spent a lifetime
seeking you.

406
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:56,083
Master Kotaro Fuma the Tenth.
