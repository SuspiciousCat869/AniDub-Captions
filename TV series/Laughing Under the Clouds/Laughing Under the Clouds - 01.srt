Yes, they're a lively bunch.

163
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,000
One hopes their
parents look down

164
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,875
from above with a smile.

165
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,833
[BOY]
Oh! Hi, teacher!

166
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,916
Let's play! Pick a game, Miss!

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,083
[chuckles]

168
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,416
So that's the object of
his childish infatuation.

169
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,333
I don't really know
about infatuation.

170
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,833
More like he enjoys
being spoiled rotten.

171
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,083
Of course.

172
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,333
He's too young
to really remember

173
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,666
what having a mother was like.

174
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,000
Tenka.

175
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,208
Stop! The only mother
you'll ever need is me!

176
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,833
Um.

177
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,208
Hey, Tenny.

178
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,416
What are you doing here?

179
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,041
[SORAMARU]
Excuse him, everyone.

180
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,041
[CHUTARO]
And you too, Sora?

181
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,291
You-- You two-timing runt!

182
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,041
Gnash your teeth!

183
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,333
[CHUTARO]
Yes, sir!

184
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,958
Don't listen to him,
he's just having a fit.

185
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,416
Heh. Made you look!

186
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,583
[CHUTARO]
Good one, big brother!

187
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,750
[SORAMARU]
You idiot!

188
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,166
Uh. Sorry for all the ruckus.

189
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,083
I'm Chutaro's big
brother, Tenka.

190
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,416
Pleased to meet you all.

191
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,041
Same here. I'm Soramaru.

192
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,083
Charmed. I feel
like I know you both

193
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,583
from all the stories he tells.

194
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,958
I'm Chutaro's teacher.

195
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,375
Oh, but please, you
can call me Botan.

196
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,833
[TENKA]
Ah. Nice to meet you.

197
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,041
So has he been keeping
up with his lessons?

198
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,833
Huh? Oh. Well, he's
working quite hard.

199
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:23,833
Right?

200
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,000
--Mmm...
--[TENKA] I believe she

201
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,083
just asked you a question.

202
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,166
Uh. Yes, very hard. Absolutely.

203
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,166
[SORAMARU]
Tenka.

204
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,458
I really think we
should go home.

205
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,333
We've caused--

206
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,416
[TENKA]
No.

207
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,666
We didn't dress up for nothing.

208
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,583
I'm gonna give this
place a once-over.

209
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,500
Whoa! You can't just
barge in! Tenka!

210
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,916
Perfectly all right.

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,875
No harm done. Why not
make yourselves at home?

212
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,041
[humming]

213
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,791
So your teacher seems
pretty nice. That's important.

214
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,291
[CHUTARO laughs]

215
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,791
Is there some reason you
blush when I point that out?

216
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,958
Oh, hey. What's
with the tanuki?

217
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,500
Is that the one that
hangs out at the shrine?

218
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,166
[calls]

219
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,458
It's Gerokichi.

220
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,416
Great. You gave it a name.

221
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,833
Well, I couldn't very well
let our family mascot

222
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,541
go without one, could I? No way.

223
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,625
The two of you kind of
resemble each other.

224
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,666
Huh. The funny thing is

225
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,041
Gerokichi likes
Miss Botan. A lot.

226
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,916
Lets her pet him and everything.

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,541
I've never seen him like that.

228
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,666
He's usually shy
around everybody but us.

229
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,250
Huh.

230
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,125
Hmm.

231
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,125
"Working quite hard," are we?

232
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,291
Not hard enough.

233
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,416
[gasps]

234
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,208
[BOTAN]
Something I can help you with?

235
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,291
[TENKA]
Oh, my bad.

236
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,500
Sorry. I got turned around.

237
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,666
The bathroom is where exactly?

238
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,666
Out and to the left.
You can't miss it, I'm certain.

239
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,583
Thanks, I appreciate it.

240
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,041
Got to pee.

241
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,875
So, this is the 14th
head of the Kumoh Shrine.

242
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,333
Pleased to meet you, Tenka.

243
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,166
Oh, come on! You can't
just back away!

244
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,666
Step into your movements!

245
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,583
[SORAMARU]
I'm trying to!

246
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,750
[TENKA]
You couldn't slice

247
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,041
through a piece of
tofu with that swing!

248
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,791
Maybe that's what
I want you to think!

249
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,708
When you want to
fight, let me know.

250
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,333
Hey, but who knows?
Another trillion years

251
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,500
and you might beat me.

252
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,291
Wow! You're so strong, sir!

253
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,333
No one could beat you!

254
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,541
You're like the head of a crab!

255
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,125
[TENKA] And what is
that supposed to mean?

256
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,833
I want you to practice
on me next, sir! Please?

257
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,833
Your enthusiasm is admirable,
but don't be rash.

258
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,000
[CHUTARO]
I'll be fine! Promise!

259
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,833
--[OFFICER 1] Tenka, sir!
--Huh?

260
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,166
--What is it?
--We need your assistance!

261
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,583
[TENKA]
Let some more ruffians

262
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,333
slip through your
fingers, I take it?

263
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,583
Yeah.

264
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,041
Not again.

265
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,958
[OFFICER 1]
Apparently a master swordsman

266
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,583
got mixed in with the rest.

267
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,708
First chance he got,

268
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,416
he made off with my blade.

269
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,833
Please, you have to
help us. We're screwed!

270
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,625
If our boss catches
wind of this--

271
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:09,500
[TENKA]
Gents.

272
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,583
Always glad to be of service

273
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,833
for the right incentive.

274
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,750
[OFFICER 1, OFFICER 2]
Uh.

275
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,500
[TENKA]
Cold hard cash-a-roo.

276
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,375
There are people who'd
call this extortion!

277
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,375
[TENKA]
We're a little low

278
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,625
on funds at the moment.

279
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,708
I'm perfectly willing
to work for the money.

280
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,333
I say go for it, Tenny!

[SORAMARU]
Don't copy him!

283
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,125
I recommend coming
to a decision.

284
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,375
Your quarry is only
getting further off.

285
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,375
[SORAMARU]
We gotta do what we gotta do.

286
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,333
Let's go, Chutaro.

287
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,291
Yes, sir!

288
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,083
I'll handle this on my own.

289
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,291
[BOTH]
Huh?

290
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,458
[TENKA] No lip. You two
are staying here.

291
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,583
[TENKA]
Hold on! I'm the second son!

292
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,708
And I'm the third, which means

293
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,958
I should get to help, too!

294
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,541
You really wanna help me out?

295
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,958
Keep a low profile.

296
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,791
Lead the way.

[SORAMARU]
Damn it, Tenka!

299
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,791
[TENKA]
I don't need you

300
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,041
slowing me down.

301
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,541
[OFFICER 1]
We're going on 10 years now.

[OFFICER 2]
Hmm?

303
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,333
Since the skies
darkened over Shiga.

304
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,583
Hey, that's right.

305
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,000
Like all those old tales.

306
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,291
They say the clouds gather

307
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,041
every 300 years,
refusing to disperse.

308
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,666
Supposed to be an omen,

309
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,375
means bad things are coming.

the Great Snake, Orochi?

312
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,583
You believe that stuff?

313
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,375
[OFFICER 1]
No, of course not.

314
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,250
Why does he always
treat me like a child?

315
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,291
[SHIRASU]
Try to look at it

316
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,583
from his point of view.

317
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,833
After all, you are younger.

318
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,833
He feels obligated to act
as mother and father.

319
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,625
And he's a warrior,

320
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,000
so being protective
comes with the territory.

321
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,458

He's not my mom and dad.

He's my brother. Period.

[SHIRASU]
Which, like it or not,

[SORAMARU]
So what then?

00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,041
He can't give me a
chance to prove myself?

328
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,875
I'm not useless.

329
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,208
I can help him.

330
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,666
He can rely on me.

331
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,083
Why else did he give
me the family sword?

332
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,791
That should mean something.

333
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,875
I thought he'd acknowledged
me as an equal.

334

What are you doing?

00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,375
I'm keeping a low profile
like Tenny told us to, sir!

338
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,541
Be your own person for once!

Ignore him!

Don't you want to pull
your weight in this family?

I dare you to try and stop us.

we can turn him on a spit.

[CHUTARO]
What's the big deal?

We can burn him a little bit!

into his movement.

This sword is special.

killing, but for protecting.

never stoop to your level.

[SORAMARU crying]
Leave me alone.

485
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,708
Sora.

486
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,166
Hey. Come on, let them flow.

487
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,708
There's no shame in a few tears.

488
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,375
Sometimes being able to cry

489
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,916
is what makes you a man.

Given how scared you seem,

492
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,750
I'm guessing you know
what's said about this place.

493
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,041
Just a few things
here and there.

[GUARD]
Let's hope you caught the rumor

495
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,375
about what new inmates
are wise to bring with them.

496
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,458
This is absurd!

497
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,666
How can I be expected to
smuggle in something like that?

498
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,041
I see. That's too bad.
