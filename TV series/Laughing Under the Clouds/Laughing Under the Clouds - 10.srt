in agreement, old friend.

163
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,291
This is certainly unexpected.

164
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,708
Just remain calm.

165
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,625
But, sir, they're--

166
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,333
Mortal creatures.

167
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,833
Who you have my
permission to kill.

[HIRARI]
Wait. Police?

169
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,666
What's going on here?

Is something wrong?

[KITAMURA]
Something wrong?

172
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,583
There's been a prison
break at Gokumonjo!

173
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,125
Everyone's escaped!

174
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,875
Our first instinct was
to ask Soramaru for help--

175
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,208
heaven knows we need
all we can get--

176
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,916
but he's nowhere to be found!

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,375
Where could he have gone?

Where are you going?

179
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,208
You heard them. They need help.

180
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,458
I'm getting reinforcements.

181
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,541
Right. I'll wait here.

182
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,666
Soramaru's bound to come back.

[SORAMARU]
Shirasu?

187
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,791
[TAKEDA]
What an entrance. Sheesh.

188
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,166
Ah, so we meet again.

[groans]

What the hell is wrong
with you? He's one of us!

191
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,875
You appear to have confused
me with Shirasu, comrade.

192
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,541
An all too common misconception.

[laughs]

194
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,916
You again! What are
you doing here?

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,416
And why do you
have Shirasu's face?

196
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,041
One could just as easily
remark that he has my face,

197
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,291
though I doubt our mother
would much approve.

198
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,875
You're twins?

199
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,125
That we are, as well as joint
orchestrators of this strategy.

200
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,500
You're a damn liar!

201
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,875
Do not imagine his loyalty
to you outweighs his

202
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,416
loyalty to the Fuma.

203
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,250
He is, in point of fact, the
undisputed leader of our clan.

204
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,375
Screw you! He's a
member of our family!

205
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,875
So you say.

206
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,958
Would you still grant him
that honor if you knew him

207
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,166
to have murdered your parents?

208

Ah!

I thought I made it clear you're
not to lay a hand on him.

Lest you forget, our lord

What's going on here?

Hail, Lord Orochi.

00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,791
I am yours.

something like this!

You deceived him for ten years.
This is to be expected.

Shut up! Go to hell!

229
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,666
Surely there is at least
some small degree of solace

230
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,250
in knowing your brother did
not live to see this moment.

that it isn't too late.

capable of staging their own

good graces of the Kumoh.

but what do they want?

ability of these swords

True.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,916
[SHIRASU]
What of the prisoner's gambit?

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,625
Did the escape go as intended?

324
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,125
[KOTARO]
Yes.

325
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,250
That Kagami fellow
played his role admirably.

326
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,458
[SHIRASU]
Did he?

327
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,958
[KOTARO]
Envision it, brother--

328
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,500
Lord Orochi risen, exalted.

329
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,750
The word Fuma once again
synonymous with power.

330
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,333
[SHIRASU]
Not yet.

331
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,875
There is work to be done.

332
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,666
[flames roaring]

333
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,541
[SHIRASU]
Farewell, Shirasu Kinjo.

334

--[water splashing]
--[grunting]

335
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,541
Aw, c'mon, I had you! No fair!

336
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,875
[KAGAMI laughs]

337
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,791
I'm gonna go out on
a limb and say somebody's

338
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,000
never had to scrabble after
their own meal before.

339
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,666
Must be nice havin' brothers
waitin' on ya hand and foot.

340
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,458
They cart your butt around in
one of them chariots, too?

341
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,833
Fan you with palm fronds?

342
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,000
That's what you do if you don't
want your little brat growin' up

343
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,041
to be his own man.

344
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,041
[splash]

345
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,666
[laughing]

346
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,083
Keep talking about my
brothers and you'll be sorry!

347
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,958
You wanna say that again,
Your Highness?

348
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,916
Or shut your damn trap?

349
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,833
Now, you hear that sound?

350
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,083
We got ourselves some
unlucky villagers.

351
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,666
[CHUTARO]
That's the vegetable lady!

352
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,916
Well, she picked
a bad day to forage.

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,875
If you really wanna put your
brother's soul at peace,

354
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,125
you gotta show me
how serious you are.

355
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,583
[VILLAGERS chattering]

356
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,666
[VILLAGER screaming]

357
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,916
--[BANDITS growling]
--Well dammit.

358
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,583
They beat us to the
punch, didn't they?

359
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,083
That's what you get for waitin'
so long to make a move.

360
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,375
Too bad, so sad.

361
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,125
[CHUTARO]
I can sneak up behind them--!

362
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,541
Ah, there we go!
That's what I need to see!

363
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,333
Get this through
that thick skull, kiddo.

364
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,333
Revenge is an
all-or-nothing proposition.

365
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,458
Period.

366
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,083
You're all alone.

367
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,333
It's all on you. Do or die.

368
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,125
No one's gonna feed you.

369
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,166
No one's gonna carry you.

370
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,791
[BANDITS laughing]

[VILLAGERS whimpering]

372
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,458
Hyaaaah!

00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,625
[grunting]

374
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,416
Heh. Think you're
some kinda hero?

375
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,875
[grunting, screaming]

376

[birds chirping]

377
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,750
Now go!

378
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,583
[VILLAGERS gasp]

379
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,708
[HIRARI]
Wow.

380
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,625
We can always count
on you to make a scene.

381
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,958
Take it easy! It's only me, man.

382
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,666
You're such a pain.

383
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,333
Next time you
decide to take off,

384
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,750
maybe run your brilliant
plan by me first?

385
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,000
People might get
the wrong idea.
