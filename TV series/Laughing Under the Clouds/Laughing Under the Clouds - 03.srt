both sides of that sentiment.

That was your name, right?

325
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,250
[SORAMARU]
Uh. Right! Yeah.

326
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,916
Your story. How did
you get into this place?

327
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Wha-- What d'you mean?

328
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,375
[WOMAN]
Your crime.

329
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,791
Well, uh--

330
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,166
Actually, my memory
is kind of shot.

331
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,208
It's all a haze.

332
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,125
So you have amnesia?

333
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,791
Your entrance papers
gave no indication of it.

334
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,791
Well, it's only been
an issue recently.

335
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,583
See, for the past few days,

336
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,666
when I think about this
one time when I was five,

337
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,750
my throat closes up.

338
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,083
Gonzo Gonda.

339
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,166
You have three accounts
of armed robbery.

340
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,916
One count of attempted escape.

341
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,625
Hence the additional sentence.

342
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,166
That ring any bells?

343
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,000
[SORAMARU]
Yeah. Sounds about right.

344
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,833
Get used to being alone,

345
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,750
and only worry about yourself
at the expense of others.

346
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,750
You'll find camaraderie
very rare.

00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,166
[WOMAN]
Gokumonjo is the home

348
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,000
of those with blood
on their hands.

349
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,708
Except,

350
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,333
for some reason,

351
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,875
I don't smell blood on you.

352
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,916
Whatever you're hiding,
I will find out.

353
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,333
[WARDEN]
Get out. Move.

354
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,708
[KAGAMI]
That was nice. I liked it.

355
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,583
Maybe you should change the
name to the Chamber of Reward.

356
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,375
[SORAMARU]
Kagami?

357
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,166
They brought him here?

358
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,291
[WOMAN] Wait here for
a moment. Don't move.

359
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,458
Uh.

360
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,916
[TENKA]
What the hell is going on?

361
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,875
Uh. I know this looks bad.

362
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,791
But it's not what
you think, I swear it!

363
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,416
[muffled grunt]

364
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,375
Who's this guy supposed to be?

365
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,958
I believe that would
be the criminal

366
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,500
we apprehended this morning.

367
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,833
Aw, come on, you guys!

368
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,416
Why would he even be here?

369
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,541
Next you're probably going to
ask me if Sora traded clothes

370
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,958
with him so he could
sneak into Gokumonjo,

371
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,208
which he didn't do!
'Cause that'd be

372
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,083
as crazy as me...

373
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,541
[TENKA]
Interesting.

374
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,291
...watching the guy while
he's gone, which I'm not.

375
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,583
One moment.

Your color isn't too good.

377
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,750
You're in no condition
to retrieve him.

378
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,666
I don't have much choice.

379
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,083
We can't just leave him there.

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,375
[SHIRASU]
Very well. Then use me.

381
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,458
What'd I say about that word?

382
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,666
You're not a damn
servant, you're a friend.

383
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,125
I am what I am, yes.

384
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,750
There's no shame in that.

385

Rootless, though
I am still a ninja.

You know the extent of my skill.

387
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,833
I can bring Soramaru home.

388
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,791
Whether as a friend
or no, give the order.

389
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,375
All right, you win.

390
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,750
I don't ask this because
you were a Fuma.

391
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,958
I ask because you're
someone that I respect.

392
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,958
Bring my brother home. Please.

393

Must you be such a mule?

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,375
I am what I am.
No shame in that.

395
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,375

I shall return.

I was expecting
something much worse.

Seriously.

Am I just too jaded?

401
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,000
Or is it called
death row because

402
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,541
they bore you to death?

403
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,541
I can think of so
many better ways to do it.

404
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,500
Not that I'm eager to die.

do with a bunch of poppies.
