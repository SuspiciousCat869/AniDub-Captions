And now... before me stands
Master Kotaro Fuma.

You cannot know who I am,
because my rank is low

I'm so sorry, young lady,
I believe you've mistaken me

I serve the Kumoh clan.

But sir! I've found
the bane of our blood!

He who slaughtered
the Fuma line,

I know where he dwells.

And I offer to lead
you to him, sir.

And if I do not
wish to be led?

Free yourself. The Fuma
line has had its day.

I'm just going to Kyoto.

Oh, sure. Abandon your family

of big city life.

Quit being so dramatic.
I'll be back later tonight.

Wait! Don't leave me!

Soramaru seems to have
a lot on his plate.

Why's he wanna
learn swordsmanship

from the Yamainu
jerks instead of me?

You're having difficulty
letting him go?

Hmm... what can I say?

Well... uh... I've come back
to try and strike a deal.

Takamine, Sasaki.

32
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,791
Right. My apologies.

33
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,583
We're in the middle
of a classified debriefing.

34
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,708
Shouldn't I be allowed to stay?

Wait a minute, please!

36
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,333
Look, sir, when we spoke before,

37
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,541
you said you were motivated
by profit, right?

Well, I can pay for my
training with information.

You're annoying me. Get out.

Damn it, I know what's going
on at Gokumonjo prison!

Turns out the rumors are true.

Well, sir, I overheard
a conversation

49
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,333
between two inmates.

50
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,916
One was a man in a fox mask

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,083
being kept in the
Isolation Chamber.

52

He's collecting poppies.

Excuse me?

I know it sounds crazy,
but I could smell them.

You have proof?

Yes.

00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:24,291
This is part of the disguise
I used to sneak in.

58
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,916
It's faint but...

it for yourself.

Of course, sir.

lives up to its potential.

Is it worth taking
me seriously?

We shall see.

But what exactly is it
that you expect from us, son?

make me stronger.

enlisting him to the squad?

Don't be daft. He's
merely another tool.

vessel, might he not?

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,833
Hm?

321
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,583
Laugh to spite what
he's done to you!

322
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,708
--Ohh...
--The entire prison heard you

323
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,208
give me that pep talk.

324
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,833
Sorry, my bad.

325
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,500
It's all in the past,
but I got what I wanted.

326
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,000
There was no need to stay.

327
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,000
That's... good, I guess.

328
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,083
Is that why you tracked me down?
To say you lost your job?

329
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,666
You think I tracked you down?

330
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,708
Sorta. I mean, you are here.

331
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,916
This was... incidental.

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,291
So you're still harping
on revenge, aren't you?

333
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,166
Do not presume to know
the lay of my heart.

334
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,708
Hate, despite what
you may think,

335
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,666
is not what motivates me.

336
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,750
I am driven by a
duty to my clan.

337
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,208
That must be a pretty
heavy thing to carry.

338
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,750
I accept the weight in exchange
for a purpose in life.

339
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,500
Look, it's none of my business,

340
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,958
but do you have
anywhere to stay?

341
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,583
I'll find something.

342
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,750
Wait, hang on!

343
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,291
You're totally welcome
to stop by our place

344
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,208
if you want. Look at this!

345
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,583
It's more food than I
know what to do with.

346
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,875
Isn't it a bit foolish of you

347
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,875
to invite a stranger
over to dinner?

348
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,625
Stranger? We practically
served time together.

349
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,125
Thank you, no.

350
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,583
Well, if you change your
mind, just come on over.

351
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,458
You can drop in whenever
you feel like it.

352
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,791
Oh, there you are.

353
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,291
Is he still alive?

354
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,125
Where have you been?
I was about to look for you.

355
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,750
Are you alone?

356
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,916
I was just talking
to this girl. Or not.

357
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,333
He seems like a kind soul.

358
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,583
All the more reason
to keep him at bay.

359
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,625
Oh... hey, check it out,

360
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,750
we're gonna eat like
royalty tonight, huh?

361
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,291
There's a lotta good stuff here
to get Tenka up and running.

362
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,833
Soramaru. Get inside
the house immediately.

363
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,083
Okay.

364
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,958
[SORAMARU]
What was that all about?

365
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,875
I've never seen him like that.

366
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,250
This can't be good.

367
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,750
Terrible news!

Huh?

00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,625

00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,250
Hey, it's okay, talk to me.

372
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,416
Why? Why did you make me go?

373
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,333
What in the hell's going on?

374
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,708
Miss Botan?

375
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:12,166
Talk to me, please...
somebody. Where is Tenka?

376
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,500
Tenny got arrested by the police
and they took him away!

377
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,375
This is ridiculous!
What are you talking about?

378
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,666
[TAKEDA]
It's true, ma'am.

379
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,791
He was seized by the
Shiga Prefectural Police

380
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,041
not an hour ago in
connection with the bombing

381
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,333
at Gokumonjo.

382
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,583
Tenka? They have the wrong man!

383
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,291
He would never do that!

384
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,041
Agreed. The charges
are clearly a pretext

385
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,625
for hauling him away
without due process.

386
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,875
[ASHIYA]
No way.

387

[SHI QUIAN-LANG]
Wait! You're not suggesting...

388
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,458
[SOSEI]
He's the Orochi's vessel.

389
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,166
Commander, I--

390
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,875
[SORAMARU]
Tenka? The Orochi's vessel?

391
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,791
Are you out of your minds?

392
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,166
I only wish we were.

393
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,041
I'm so sorry. Oh my god.

394
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:18,041
So, yeah. I don't have
a whole lot of time.

395
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,625
How can this be?

396
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,666
Can you seriously
be the vessel?

397
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,958
The doc's concoction
held off the symptoms

398
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,208
for as long as it could.

399
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,708
But... they built
up a tolerance.

400
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,500
The snake's got its fangs
into me pretty good now.

401
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,083
[SHIRASU]
When did you realize?

402
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,791
Haven't you been seeking
the vessel for years?

403
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,333
[TENKA]
Sure. You helped me out on that

404
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,750
more than you know.

405
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,375
And I will help you still.

406
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,708
You must fight this illness
for your brothers' sake.

407
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,958
About them... I do
have a last request.

408
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,416
I will not entertain this!

409
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,291
Ignore that, sir.
His emotions are ragged.

410
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,958
But he is a ninja.
Order him as you will,

411
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,500
and honor leaves the man
no choice but to obey.

No, I ask... as a friend.

You stupid, selfish bastard.

[TENKA]
I know.

415
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,208
[CHUTARO] But... I mean...
they'll let him out

416
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,791
to come back home, won't they?

417
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,541

Don't just stand there...
