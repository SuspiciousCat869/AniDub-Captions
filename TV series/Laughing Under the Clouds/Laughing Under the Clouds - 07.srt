1
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,625
[OKI]
Preoccupied, my friend?

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,791
Oh. Why hello, sir.

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,791
And to what do we owe
the pleasure today?

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,833
Just a small formality.

5
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,875
The Justice Department wanted me
to file a report on Tenka Kumoh,

6
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,000
and now that the dust
has settled somewhat, I am able.

7
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:35,333
Good the storm's passed.
Nonetheless we must be on guard.

8
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,958
Hmm.

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,291
Naturally, sir.

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,875
Yes, naturally.

11
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,291
That man's nonchalance
gives me no small headache.

12
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,958
Pardon, sir. Who was that?

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,875
That's Officer Hirari
of the Shiga Prefecture.

14
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,291
Enlisted by the militia
during the Satsuma Rebellion,

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,583
despite his youth, and being
born with only one arm.

16
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,750
Yes, I've heard
stories about that man.

17
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,625
They say that he has visions.

18
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,916
Dreams, actually.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,833
Curious ones,
as I understand it.

20
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,375
[SUBORDINATE]
How so?

21
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,750
[OKI] They involve some
mysterious woman or other.

22
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:21,041
[HIRARI]
Fleeting as a cloud on the wind.

23
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,166
[BOTAN]
Omi lies shrouded in darkness,

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,375
Beset by the wrath
of evil spirits.

25
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,750
The land is rife
with Onmyo magic.

26
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:41,375
Fanatics thrive in the maelstrom
of wickedness and fear.

27
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,416
Night has fallen
on Old Kamakura.

28
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,833
Ah. There you are.

29
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,708
Whatever you call yourselves--

30
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,958
lay a finger on this woman
and you answer to me.

31
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,083
Who, might I ask, are you?

32
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,333
[HIRARI]
You'll want to take a step back.

33
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,250
[thud]

34
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,416
You still in one piece?

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,208
[footsteps]

36
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,250
[HIRARI] I humbly ask
for your hand in marriage.

37
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,666
[BOTAN]
Excuse me?

38
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,291
Please, m'lady. I have
sought you for ages.

39
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,458
[BOTAN]
This poor creature must be mad.

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,291
[stones falling]

41
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,916
[BOTAN]
Oh, no!

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,375
They could've led me

43
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,666
to the identity
of the Orochi's vessel!

44
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,375
[SASAKI] We are profoundly
indebted to you

45
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,500
for saving our Botan, stranger.

46
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,166
I am the Guardian of Omi.

47
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,125
Kiyotsuna, of the ancient
Sasaki bloodline.

48
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,666
And this...

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,625
is Kagemitsu Kumoh,
head of the Kumoh Shrine.

50
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,958
Knock it off!

51
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,083
Forget it! I can't do this!

52
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,916
I'm not gonna sit here
and let some outsider

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,166
swoop in and whisk her away!

54
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,916
[BOTAN]
No one's whisking me!

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,333
'Kay. Would it be any easier
for you if you knew my name?

56
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,791
Hirari Abe, maybe
you're familiar

57
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,500
with the Abe clan
of Onmyo mages?

58
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,083
You're not serious.

59
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,375
Since when do mages
rely on swords?

60
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,333
Your reputation
precedes you, sir.

61
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,458
I've heard it said
that of all your clan,

62
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,166
you possess the least
aptitude for Onmyo magic.

63
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah. And that's about
the nicest way to put it.

64
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,166
I can't even muster up
a banishing spell.

65
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,916
Which qualifies me as
the proverbial black sheep.

66
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,333
Not an easy life.

67
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,500
Zero prospects make a
guy liable to reach out

68
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,250
and grab what he
wants out of life.

69
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,458
Keep your hands off! I won't
have you corrupt her!

70
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,458
Prodigal son or no,
your blood must commit you

71
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,958
to the same sacred
mission as does ours.

72
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,166
[HIRARI]
To eliminate the Orochi?

73
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,416
So, you are on our side.

74
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,166
Look, honestly,
I couldn't care less.

75
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,750
If you were the prize, though,
that'd make any mission sacred.

76
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,416
I prefer your virtue
be its own reward.

77
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,750
We welcome you as brother
to a common cause.

78
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,166
Sasaki, sir! Please!

79
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,833
[SASAKI]
In any event, you'd be wise

80
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,041
to lodge here for the night,
given the hour.

81
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,250
[HIRARI]
Will the lady offer sake?

82
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,166
I'll leave it for you
to pour yourself.

83
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,166
[HIRARI] Why was Botan attacked?
Who were those people?

84
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,666
A band of religious fanatics.

85
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,958
They want to see
the Orochi reborn.

86
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,000
Ugh. That sounds
like a handful, huh?

87
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,166
Well, they won't be touching
a hair on Botan's head,

88
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,791
I can promise you that.

89
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,958
So, uh, how'd you fall in
love with her so quickly?

90
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,125
[HIRARI] It was her eyes.
Without a doubt.

91
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,500
They're just--

92
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,083
they have that spark that
makes them irresistible,

93
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,208
you know what I mean?

94
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,291
And so compassionate.

95
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,958
They're definitely the
windows to an honest soul.

96
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,750
[KAGEMITSU] A soul that really
values the freedom to choose.

97
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,125
[HIRARI] Hey, either way.
I like 'em feisty!

98
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,583
[KAGEMITSU]
I'm sure you do.

99
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,500
[HIRARI laughing]

100
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,833
[water dripping]

101
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,333
[SASAKI]
Tell me, child.

102
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,750
What do you make of our guest?

103
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,291
[BOTAN]
I see no evil in him, per se.

104
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,541
[SASAKI]
And yet we must remain vigilant.

105
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,500
He may be the vessel.

106
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,125
[BOTAN]
It's possible, but...

107
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,416
surely not.

108
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,458
Show yourself!

109
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,291
[crash]

110
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,416
Hey! Botan! Tell me you're okay!

111
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,375
[BOTAN]
As luck would have it, I am.

112
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,750
Our enemies strike in darkness.

113
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,125
[KAGEMITSU]
Oh, great.

114
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,083
They have us surrounded.

115
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,708
Where is Hirari?

116
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,666
Out in the yard,
being an imbecile.

117
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,166
Ugh. The nerve of this guy!

118
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:20,208
A little too easy. It's like
knocking down corpses.

119
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,583
[MANGETSU]
Bravo.

120
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,791
Well deduced.

121
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,625
At least the Abe
gave you knowledge.

122
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,375
[HIRARI]
Mangetsu Ashiya.

123
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,333
Still peddling the old
cheap tricks, I see.

124
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,750
[MANGETSU] Oh, yes.
What about you, old friend?

125
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,208
I thought the concept
of duty repulsed you.

126
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,916
And I thought the Ashiya family
had more self-respect

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,333
than to serve the Orochi.

128
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,041
You dare speak to me
of self-respect?

129
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,166
On behalf of my
family, rot in hell.

130
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,666
Attack!

131
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,916
Om shiro dabija kangun sousa!

132
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,125
Wait a second.
You know Onmyo magic?

133
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,875
Sir, I advise you to
keep well out of the way.

134
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,208
Swords are useless against
creatures of this ilk.

135
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,125
The hell they are!
Let me be your shield!

136
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,875
Why are you so bent
on protecting me?

137
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,625
This isn't a game! Leave!

138
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,750
Those who can't wield magic
are a liability in a fight.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,916
And besides, she
already has a shield!

140
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,041
I'm not letting you go.

141
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,875
I will not be bound by your
bloated sense of entitlement!

142
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,666
[HIRARI]
It's not about entitlement.

143
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,041
A man doesn't like to see
the woman he loves hurt.

144
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,625
Apologies, but I'm afraid you
fail to fully comprehend.

145
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,833
I was created to fulfill
a specific purpose.

146
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,875
I was made to serve the Abe.
I am not a human being.

147
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,458
I am a demon in service
to your father.

148
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,875
His familiar.

149
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,375
I know not pain nor love.

150
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,250
The subtle shades of human
feeling are wasted on me.

151
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,791
Uhh.

152
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,708
So you're a demon, huh?

153
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,458
It'll take a lot more than
that to get rid of me.

154
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,750
I won't be mocked!

155
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,750
Jaki funbaka!

156
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,666
Mister Sasaki, I shall leave
the gentleman to you.

157
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,541
[BOTAN]
What an infuriating man!

158
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,916
Now be honest.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,333
Are these avowals to Botan true?

160
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,291
Do you believe I'd be risking
my life if they weren't?

161
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,166
She's at the Abe's
beck and call.

162
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,375
Explain to me how a familiar
can use Onmyo magic.

163
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,166
I assure you she is
no ordinary familiar.

164
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,166
Botan was summoned forth by
the full force of Abe's mages.

165
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,958
She alone possesses
the means to seal the Orochi.

166
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,125
The necessary ritual,
however, takes time.

167
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,208
It is the sworn
duty of the Kumoh

168
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,458
to guard her while
the spell takes effect.

169
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,625
The need for you is negligible.

170
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,166
--Spare me the speech, old man.
--Eh?

171
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,541
You can't argue with love.

172
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,541
This was meant to be.

173
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:15,000
I knew it then,
and I know it now.

174
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,791
Abandon all thought of living.

175
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,708
Do not shed tears.

176
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,958
Do not indulge hope.

177
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,916
Mercy is repugnant,

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,666
to yourself and to others.

179
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,291
You are a shadow.

180
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,791
[panting]

181
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,166
[HIRARI]
Those eyes.

182
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,500
The first to really see me.

183
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,083
But I don't kid myself.

184
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,166
No way she remembers.

185
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,541
Hmm.

186
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:04,500
[MANGETSU] Rin, pyou, tou, sha,
kai, rai, zetsu, mu, san!

187
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,375
[KAGEMITSU]
What just happened?

188
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,666
Why'd the bastard
run away like that?

189
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,500
You see the lesson
in all of this, yes?

190
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,291
Om shiro dabija
jaki funbaka. Free!

191
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,875
[HIRARI] Please. Don't ever
worry me like that again.

192
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,208
[BOTAN]
Let go! This is shameful!

193
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,875
That stupid little--

194
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,958
I suggest for now
we leave them be.

195
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,583
Love between a human
and a familiar

196
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,625
must, alas, be short-lived.

197
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,208
When Botan's sacred
duty is fulfilled,

198
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,666
her place shall
know her no more.

199
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,333
Let the heart beat while it may.

200
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,916
[HIRARI]
Wow. Breathtaking.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,083
Omi has a beautiful view.

202
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,500
Poets have filled volumes

203
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,000
on the scenic tranquility
of this place.

204
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,125
Mister Sasaki feels
Omi's particular draw.

205
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,500
His loyalty to the land
preserves its beauty

206
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,125
for those who call it home.

207
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,250
Too bad about
the clouds then, huh?

208
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,291
It'd be great to see the sun.

209
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,958
[BOTAN] The Orochi's
presence obscures it.

210
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,125
Regret is foreign to me,

211
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,458
but if, when I go, these waters
have yet to catch gold,

212
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,958
I think I shall be disappointed.

213
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,541
[HIRARI] When you vanish
off the face of the Earth,

214
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,916
that's it for me.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,250
I won't let you go alone.

216
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,041
How strange.

217
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,125
Is it not customary
for one in love to say only,

218
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,750
"I won't let you go"?

219
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,500
Nothing gets by you,
does it, my darling?

220
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,125
I'm not long for
this world myself.

221
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,083
[BOTAN]
Uhh...

222
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,583
[HIRARI] And if I gotta die,
I'd rather do it next to you.

223
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,458
Do not talk like this.

224
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:10,333
Botan, I want you to smile.

225
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,916
Do that for me
and I can be happy.

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,708
What are you...

227
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,458
Aaaah! What the hell, man?

228
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,791
I'm glad I came out here
to check on you when I did

229
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,208
or who knows
what'd you be up to?

230
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,083
Ugh, you're killin'
me here, kid.

231
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,125
We were just gettin'
in the mood.

232
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,708
[KAGEMITSU] In the mood
for what, exactly?

233
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,458
[HIRARI]
Wait. I see what's happening.

234
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,000
Hmm? What are you
talking about?

235
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:39,208
[HIRARI] You think I might be
the Orochi's vessel, don't you?

236
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,166
How did you know?

237
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,458
[HIRARI]
Are you wary of me, too, Botan?

238
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,208
Yes! It's her job to be!

239
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,958
[HIRARI]
Uh-huh.

240
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,583
It's sad there's
no trust anymore.

241
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,625
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

242
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,541
[HIRARI] To try and wake myself
up from a bad dream.

243
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,916
What's with this guy? Seriously.

244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,458
[insects chirping]

245
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,666
--[knock]
--[SASAKI] Hmm?

246
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,375
Hey.

247
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,125
Excuse me, old timer.

248
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,958
Hello, Mister Hirari.

249
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,166
[HIRARI]
I wanted to say thanks.

250
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,333
Ah, I see.

251
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,875
I take it you've thought better
of pursuing your heart?

252
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,333
Yeah, place is too laid back.

253
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,166
If I stay here,
I'll lose my edge.

254
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,916
[SASAKI]
Will you indeed?

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,833
I grant you Omi is lovely.

256
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,833
That's what compels me
to preserve it.

257
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,041
[HIRARI]
That what you tell people?

258
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:35,208
Nice. You get to have your cake
and eat it too, I guess.

259
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,625
Well, you just sit there
in your hot bath

260
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,000
and spin lies
all day, old man.

261
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,791
The truth'll catch up
to you eventually.

262
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,375
You know it isn't me.

263
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,833
The Orochi's inside
of you, isn't it?

264
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,666
Looks like it's got its
hooks into you pretty good,

265
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,875
but you're still human
enough to be scared.

266
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,708
Effective diversionary
tactic, by the way.

267
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,666
I mean, who'd suspect
the Orochi zealots

268
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,541
would attack the man
harboring their god?

269
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,500
Yeah. Good way
to earn the trust

270
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,541
of those who'd kill you
if they knew the truth.

271
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,333
Such a cavalier attitude.

272
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,541
You cannot know the horror
of what it means

273
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,875
to be chosen by the Orochi!

274
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,666
Is everything all right, sir?

275
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,458
[SASAKI]
This man is the vessel!

276
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,875
He really is?
Freeze! It's over!

277
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,208
[HIRARI]
No! Don't listen! He's a liar!

278
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,166
The vessel is him! Botan!

279
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,416
Ha! An obvious ploy!

280
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,333
Surely you take my word
over that of a stranger!

281
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,125
Please forgive me, sir.

282
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,916
Doubt comes uneasily
with regard to your word.

283
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,583
However...

284
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,291
a man like Hirari does not lie
to the woman he loves.

285
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,333
[KAGEMITSU]
What? Are you out of your mind?

286
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,875
[SASAKI groans]

287
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,875
Sasaki?

288
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,916
[SASAKI]
I'm so sorry.

289
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,875
Oh, no.

290
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,041
Sir!

291
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,958
[SASAKI]
So very sorry.

292
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,416
Get down!

293
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,625
[rumbling]

294
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,833
This isn't happening!

295
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,291
Botan! I need you to raise
a barrier, quickly!

296
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,916
Yes, master!

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,958
Om kiri kiri basara
basara jama.

Shinkin seimei. Shindo seimei!

301
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,083
Move it!

302
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,791
Don't be so rash!

303
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,916
Your business
is protecting Botan!

304
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,166
The Kumoh are shields!

305
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,083
Yeah, and what
are you gonna do?

306
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,541
[HIRARI]
"Abandon all thought of living.

307
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,041

Do not indulge hope.

That's what the Abe

drilled into the minds
of every kid they've taken in.

We're no more than bait.

This is my purpose. My destiny.

What an awful thing
for a child to hear.

Do your thing and leave
the stalling to me.

Where do you find
cause to smile?

319
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,750
Just work your magic, m'lady.

320
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,125
Be fleet and
be wise. Good luck.

321
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,541
Arrggh!

322
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,000
When I understood my destiny,

323
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,625
the future held
only fear and pain.

324
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,875
But then, for the first time,

325
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,833
someone looked at me
like I was a person.

326
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,791
I smiled because of you.

327
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,083
Because all of a sudden,
the world didn't seem so cold.

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,916
Please, you mustn't
let the man die.

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,166
Hmm.

330
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,208
Poko!

331
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,125
All right, let's
confuse it! Are you ready?

332
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,958
Yeah, just focus
on protecting Botan!

333
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,958
She told me to protect you.
I think I'll go with her.

334
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,458
Aaaaah!

335
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,458
[HIRARI]
Protect me?

336
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,875
Someone actually cares
if I live or die.

337
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,666
She cares.

338
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,958
This is too much.

339
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,333
[BOTAN]
Om kiri kiri basara basara jama.

340
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,875
We're almost there!

341
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,125
[BOTAN] Fuu shiki shinka
seimei. Shinsui seimei.

342
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,916
Shimoku seimei.

343
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,875
[explosion]

344
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,250
Don't lose heart.
Just keep on with the spell.

345
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,916
As long as I draw breath,
nothing is going to hurt you.

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,416
[BOTAN]
Don't die.

347
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,916
[HIRARI]
I thought I asked you to smile.

348
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,708
Don't be scared. I'm not
gonna die, all right?

349
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,958
And I would never lie
to the girl I love.

350
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:44,125
Kiyotsuna Sasaki!

351
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:48,041
You've fallen a
long way, old man!

352
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,666
Wait! It'll never work!
You'll be swallowed whole!

353
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,375
[HIRARI]
You used to love this place.

354
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:00,250
You really wanna see it fall
as hard as its former protector?

355
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,291
[SASAKI voice echoing]
Please. No.

356
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,166
I'm not ready to die.

357
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,416
Give me more time.

358
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,375
I beg you.

359
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,416
[HIRARI]
Do not falter now.

360
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,791
Protect this land
to your last breath,

361
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,541
Guardian of Omi.

362
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,250
Die with dignity.

363
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,625
I will take it on myself
to carry the torch

364
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,041
where you cannot.

365
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,125
You will survive in me.

366
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,958
I accept your burden as my own.

367
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,750
Aaah!

368
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,958
Whatever you've done,
the serpent is still.

369
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,666
The chant is complete.

370
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,125
Final spell begin.

371
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,500
Seal!

372
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,791
[coughing, groaning]

373
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,291
[whimpering]

374
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,041
[panting]

375
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,041
My purpose is served.

376
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,208
[HIRARI]
Botan!

377
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,083
Look at that.

378
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,500
The waters are catching gold,
just like you wanted.

379
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,083
It's okay. I'm numb
from the poison.

380
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,500
Can't feel a thing.

381
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,208
[BOTAN]
Thank you.

382
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,416
Because of you, the Orochi
has been sealed.

383
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,375
[HIRARI] If you go
by my training, I failed.

384
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,833
I disgraced the
Abe by surviving.

385
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,833
So be it.

386
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,625
I'm happy that little boy
outlived the weight

387
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,208
unduly put on him.

388
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,833
[HIRARI]
Wait, you remember me?

389
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,708
[BOTAN]
As though it were yesterday.

390
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,041
You've grown into someone
of which to be proud.

391
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:27,000
My heart has held out for
this very moment for so long.

392
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,583
And yet, the moment
is doomed to fade.

393
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,750
My duty is fulfilled.

394
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,125
My existence is forfeit.

395
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm afraid you and
I shall meet no more.

396
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,916
[HIRARI]
You're wrong.

397
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,708
We'll meet again.

398
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,125
If oceans divide us,
we'll hoist our sails.

399
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,833
If death divides us,
we'll be reborn.

400
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:53,333
Next time, though, I'll try
to find you a little quicker.

401
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,375
You're either a hopeless
romantic or a hapless fool

402
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,541
to address a familiar this way.

403
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,166
Don't expect to catch me
in the next life

404
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,583
as easily as all that.

405
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,541
[HIRARI] Botan. Promise
you'll wait for me.

406
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,750
Please.

407
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,916
Yes, I will wait for you.

408
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,291
[HIRARI]
Was it real?

409
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,125
Or the mirage
of a summer's day?

410
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,291
Did we meet, or was
it all just a dream?

411
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,208
If my mind plays tricks,
let me be quick to laugh.

412
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:37,291
If what it shows me
is true, let us both be.

413
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,791
Another vision.

414
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,208
[sighing] Where are you?
