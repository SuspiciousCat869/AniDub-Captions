1
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:14,041
We haven't seen each
other since that day.

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,666
[CHUTARO]
Kagami!

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,083
[KAGAMI]
Easy, tiger.

4
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,416
No one's gonna
hurt you. I promise.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,541
Let go of me!

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,750
You're a criminal!

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,250
You're supposed to be
in Gokumonjo prison!

8
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,500
[KAGAMI]
Hey.

9
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,416
Is it true your
big brother's dead?

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,083
No! It's a big lie!

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,916
Tenny's alive, he's just hiding!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,708
That's why I'm looking for him!

13
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,666
Now let go!

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,000
[KAGAMI]
Huh.

15
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,750
You'd think he'd make
himself easier to find,

16
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,041
wouldn't ya?

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,833
You're clearly frantic.

18
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,958
Why doesn't he come out
and put your mind at ease?

19
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,208
Seems kinda heartless.

20
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,166
Shut up!

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,916
Come on. Level with me.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,333
You know what happened.

23
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,916
Your brother was killed.

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,166
What? This is news?

25
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,583
He was the Orochi's vessel,
so the government

26
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,333
had to have him executed.

27
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,083
[CHUTARO]
I don't understand.

28
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,875
Sora said the exact same thing.

29
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,041
But it doesn't make any sense!

30
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,666
What is the stupid Orochi?

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,541
What's it got
to do with Tenny?

32
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,166
[KAGAMI]
Pay attention, kid.

33
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,333
Your brother was possessed
by an evil spirit.

34
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,666
The only way to stop that spirit
from taking over everything

35
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,791
was for the powers that be to
step in and do what they do.

36
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:20,833
[CHUTARO]
Huh?

37
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,541
You understand?

38
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,625
Your beloved Tenny
was a sacrifice.

39
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,666
[CHUTARO]
Tenny--

40
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,291
Tenny was--

41
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,458
Ah!

42
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,875
No!

43
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,041
[crying]

44
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,291
This hardly bodes
well, Commander.

45
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,041
It's been over two weeks, sir.

46
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,500
Yet the skies
over Lake Biwa--

47
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:48,000
weren't the clouds meant to
depart once the Orochi perished?

48
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,083
[SOSEI] There is, in my
opinion, but one explanation.

49
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,791
We were wrong.

50
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,458
Tenka Kumoh was not
the Orochi's vessel.

51
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,666
If this is true, then Tenka's
death was without cause!

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,958
[SOSEI] I am well aware
of that, thank you.

53
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,666
It suggests the Shiga police
are hiding something.

54
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,875
The question is what, exactly.

55
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,625
[CHUTARO]
No!

56
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,041
He didn't deserve
to be made a sacrifice!

57
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,125
Not him! Not him!

58
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,500
[KAGAMI]
That's the worst part, huh?

59
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,000
[CHUTARO cries]

60
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,166
[KAGAMI] He did absolutely
nothing wrong, and they knew it.

61
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,541
[CHUTARO]
Stop.

62
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,458
[KAGAMI] Don't you want
Tenny's murderers to pay?

63
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,500
Yes! Yes!

64
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,291
[KAGAMI]
Don't you want 'em to die?

65
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,833
[CHUTARO]
I do.

66
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,000
Then why not make it happen?

67
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,083
Kill them.

68
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,583
I could, couldn't I?

69
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,708
[KAGAMI]
Make 'em reap what they've sown.

70
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,541
Put your brother's
soul at peace.

71
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,291
Take back the Kumoh pride.

72
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,708
Revenge is sweet.

73
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,458
And it only costs your life.

74
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,791
[birds chirping]

75
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,000
[SHIRASU]
Try not to worry.

76
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,458
He hasn't been gone
as long as all that.

77
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,375
[sighs]

78
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,666
It's how he copes.

79
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,333
He'll come back
when he's hungry.

80
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,541
[door opens]

81
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,750
Okay. Let's hear it then.

82
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,208
Those looks on your faces
are making me uncomfortable.

83
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,125
[KITAMURA]
Uh.

84
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,708
We just saw a man
in the forest.

85
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,000
Naoto Kagami.

86
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,625
Wait! The crazy guy?

87
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,125
But wasn't he--?

88
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,750
How in heaven's name does
a man like that escape prison?

89
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,500
[TSUCHIYA] Every effort was made
to apprehend him, I'm told.

90
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,375
But his speed is ungodly.

91
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,625
That's not why we're here.

92
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,375
When we saw him,
he wasn't alone.

93
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,333
[SORAMARU]
What?

94
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,583
Well, he was with your brother.

95
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,083
He has Chutaro?

96
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,083
Wait, please. Calm yourself.

97
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,916
How can you expect
me to stay calm?

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,041
Stay here.

99
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,666
It would be better
if I handled this.

100
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,333
I'm coming with you!

101
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,958
[SHIRASU]
Tenka is no more.

102
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,458
That leaves you in
charge of the shrine.

103
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,125
Do you understand?

104
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,166
Soramaru.

105
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,208
You have your responsibilities,

106
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,875
and I have mine.

107
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,375
I'll bring Chutaro back.

108
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,458
Please, just don't
let him get hurt.

109
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:03,958
Ten, gen, myou, shin,

110
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:10,000
kai, ou, jin, tsuu, ryou.

111
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,208
Ten, gen, myou.

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,666
It's not like you
to drop in on me, sir.

113
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,958
Something must be
seriously off.

114
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,916
An astute observation,

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,958
as expected of an onmyo mage,
especially one of your pedigree.

116
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,000
Strange words from a man
descended from Abe.

117
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,166
[SOSEI]
Alas, magic isn't my forte.

118
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,583
I chose the sword.

119
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,250
Naturally.

120
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,458
[ASHIYA]
Right.

121
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,666
What can I do
for you, Commander?

122
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,708
[SOSEI]
I am in need of your familiars.

123
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,875
[ASHIYA]
What for?

124
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,583
[SOSEI]
Infiltration.

125
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,333
Gokumonjo.

126
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,791
I see.

127
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,125
[SOSEI] It's been the eye
of many a storm lately.

128
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,625
Just today, in fact,

129
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,500
the second Kumoh brother
reported an escaped prisoner.

130
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,500
Yet my personal inquiry into
the matter yielded nothing.

131
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,166
Their officials denied
any such incident.

132
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,375
[ASHIYA]
Business as usual.

133
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,625
[SOSEI]
The opium, however, is not.

134
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,666
[ASHIYA] I'll put the girls
on it right away, sir.

135
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,708
[SOSEI]
Thank you.

136
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,333
The information
about the escapee

137
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,416
came from Soramaru, didn't it?

138
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,625
So he hasn't been told, then?

139
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,250
About the Orochi?

140
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,500
Do you think he should?

141
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,291
Well, if my big bro was
strung up for no good reason,

142
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,208
I'd wanna know.

143
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,791
But that's just me.

144
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,041
Indeed it is.

145
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,375
Bear that in mind.

146
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,541
What does your clan
know of the sealing spell?

147
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,916
Do they, in their wisdom, feel
its properties were genuine?

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,708
[ASHIYA] Hard to say when
all you've got to go on

149
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,208
are old stories.

150
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,708
What I know is that the familiar
they summoned to enact it

151
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,458
represented everything
the Abe mages

152
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,625
had in their bag of tricks.

153
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,416
The spell is said to
have been so potent,

154
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,625
only she could wield it.

155
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,666
[SOSEI] And yet the
spell was lost during

156
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,958
the Orochi's manifestation
three centuries ago.

157
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,666
[ASHIYA]
Yeah. That's a damn shame.

158
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,166
Nonetheless. Her knowledge of
the Serpent would be a boon.

159
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,750
Do you want her summoned?

160
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,000
[SOSEI]
Can you?

161
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,708
[ASHIYA] You did hear
the part about her being

162
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,708
the alpha and omega of

00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,833
There was a townsman beside him.

324
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,708
It occurred near here.

325
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,916
[gasps]

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,333
[grunts]

327
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,541
You hear that? He was attacked
in your own backyard!

328
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,833
And on your watch!

329
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,375
Damn it, aren't you supposed
to protect people?

330
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,666
What are the Brothers
of the Cloud good for?

331
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,750
You're weak!

332
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,375
You're weak and you're a fraud!

333
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,666
Takeda, enough. Please.

334
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,625
I take it you've not
told the other members?

335
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,833
[TAKEDA]
No, sir.

336
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,166
I thought it best
to come to you first.

337
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,916
[SOSEI]
Inform them immediately.

338
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,541
Someone able to cut down
a man of Takamine's stature

339
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,916
cannot be trifled with.

340
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,250
I want him found.

341
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,791
Yes, sir.

342
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,625
[KAGAMI] Am I out of
shape or am I out of shape?

343
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:20,125
Time is a rat, kid, don't
expect it to treat you too well.

344
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,500
But, whatever, at least
my blade had a little drink.

345
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,208
So, uh, the person
you tested it on?

346
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,166
Is halfway across
the threshold of

347
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,125
the sweet hereafter
right about now.

348
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,375
This is yours.

349
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,916
Get ready.

350
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,875
Uh-oh.

351
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,875
Somebody gettin' cold feet?

352
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,458
Turn on the waterworks
for me, why don't'cha?

353
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,958
Cry loud enough
and maybe darling

354
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,958
Tenny'll come to the rescue.

355
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,625
[laughs]

356
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,500
[ASHIYA] You are some
piece of work, ma'am.

357
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,208
Three hundred years'
worth of scholarship

358
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,125
and nobody made the connection.

359
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,750
[BOTAN]
Oh. I have excellent sources.

360
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,041
Believe me.

361
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:03,333
In ancient times, the Orochi was
sealed through ritual magic.

362
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,250
In its last incarnation,
three centuries ago, however,

363
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,916
the serpent succeeded
in devouring the spell.

364
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,333
In the belly of the beast,

365
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,333
the incantation
was lost to time.

366
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,916
But, along with
the sealing spell,

367
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,083
two precious artifacts
were also swallowed.

368
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,583
[ASHIYA]
And those would be the Swords

369
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,791
of the Kumoh family, yes?

370
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,291
We will only know for sure if
you confirm it with your magic.

371
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,583
Master Ashiya, if you would.

372
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,333
Please.

373
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,208
[ASHIYA]
Yeah, yeah. C'mon.

374
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,041
What was I supposed to do?
Tell a legendary familiar "no"?

375
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,541
I would also ask that
you keep this a secret.

376
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,250
[ASHIYA]
Even from the Commander?

377
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,250
I'll tell him, at a
time of my choosing.

378
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,125
[ASHIYA] Look, I don't
pretend to know what went on

379
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,625
between you and the Abe.

380
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,833
But my boss is their
direct descendant.

381
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,833
He finds out I'm
keepin' this from him,

382
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,958
there's gonna be hell to pay.

383
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,416
Though, I suspect he's
got his hands full dealing

384
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,750
with whatever's going
on at Gokumonjo.

385
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,083
[BOTAN]
Does he really?

386
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,291
[ASHIYA] Lot of issues
with that place recently.

387
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,125
Even sent in my familiars.

388
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,541
Haven't heard a
peep from 'em yet.

389
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,000
Generally not a good sign.

390
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,958
Hope I'm not
bein' too forward,

391
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,833
but you'd do well
to be careful.

392
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,125
Excuse me.

393
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,208
Shirasu.

394
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,708
Please forgive me,
I thought you were

395
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,333
still out looking for Chutaro.

396
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,875
I was successful.
He's been found.

397
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,083
That's excellent news.

398
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,750
[SHIRASU]
Found, but not retrieved.

399
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,291
I will need help.

400
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,500
Whatever the Kumoh
need of me, my friend.

401
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,125
My apologies for the intrusion.

402
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,583
Master Ashiya,

403
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,208
might we pick up tomorrow
where we've left off today?

404
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,458
[ASHIYA]
No problem.

405
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,666
Time is short.

406
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,625
Right.

407
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,875
Listen to me!

408
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,708
True strength is laughing
in the face of your pain!

409
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,125
[laughing]

410
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,833
Oh, no. How the--?

411
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,750
[heartbeat]

412
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,750
What the--? What was that?

413
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,416
[gags]

414
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,958
[heartbeat continues]

415
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,833
[SOSEI] Historically there
have been vessels only

416
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,375
too well aware of their fate,

417
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,833
while others had no idea.

418
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,333
No.

419
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,625
[gasps]

420
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,083
[SOSEI]
The Orochi is a malign spirit.

421
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,666
To be its host...

422
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,416
is to subjugate
one's memories.

423
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,666
One's sense of self.

424
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,833
Little by little, until
the evil within prevails.

425
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,375
[gasping]

426
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,750
We must protect
the boys at all costs!

427
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,041
It was Tenka's
final charge to us!

428
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,416
Far be it from us to
disappoint the man,

429
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,958
even in death.

430
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,166
Say what you will, he was
an expert manipulator.

431
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,625
[BOTAN]
This is the least we can do.

432
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,458
To that end, I believe
I've found a way to

433
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,916
prevent the
Orochi's resurrection.

434
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,125
[SHIRASU]
Prevent it?

435
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,583
[BOTAN]
Exactly,

436
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,375
I think there is a way
to spare the vessel.

437
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,958
The Kumoh family swords.

438
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,375
If I'm right, they may
possess the means to dispel

439
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,375
the Serpent from
his chosen host.

440
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,750
[SHIRASU]
Is that possible?

441
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,208
[BOTAN] Those swords were
devoured by the Orochi

442
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,250
three hundred years ago,

443
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,791
along with the sealing spell.

444
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,458
They were later recovered.
The spell was not.

445
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,708
I believe the spell
fused with the swords

446
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,666
while inside the
Serpent's belly.

447
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,166
[SHIRASU] So the Kumoh
blades can seal the Orochi?

448
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,083
Shirasu?

449
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,708
I am impressed.

450
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,208
Clearly I underestimated you.

451
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,583
Can it be you have
a favorable opinion of me?

452
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,958
[blade puncturing flesh]

453
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, yes. Though, honestly I'd
have rather killed you long ago.

454
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,875
[grunts]

455
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,291
[SHIRASU]
Nothing personal.

456
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,375
I cannot allow you
to interfere.

457
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,125
[gasps]

458
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,458
It's over.

459
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,083
Do you understand?

460
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,416
[breath quivering]

461
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,666
[SHIRASU]
Lord Orochi will rise again.
