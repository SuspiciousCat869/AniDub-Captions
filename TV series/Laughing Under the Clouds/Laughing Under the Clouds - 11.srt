You saved Tenka's life

Y'see, the government had

from Orochi cells.

Why'd you see fit

but I'm told the likelihood
of relapse is very high.

to redouble a human being's
healing capabilities.

It is Shi's opinion that
Tenka Kumoh may have been used

developing the treatment.

Gerokichi? Is that you?

324
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,250
[GEROKICHI grunts]

325
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,500
When did you get so--?

326
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,791
Hey, be careful how you stop!

327
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,875
[grunting]

328
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,041
[CHUTARO]
Are you all right?

329
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,416
Hey, our swords!

330
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,125
[clattering]

331
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,833
Huh? Sora?

332
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,041
The swords you
requested, Miss Botan.

333
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,541
We are all in your
debt. I thank you.

334
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,708
Go!

335
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,916
Flee into the canal
tunnel while we can!

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,791
--We must go!
--I don't understand.

337
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,291
What the heck is going
on here, ma'am?

338
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,333
Get on Poko.

339
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,250
I'll explain to you as we ride.

340
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,125
[growling]

341
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,625
Uh, ma'am?

342
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,125
Sora's keeping up with us.

343
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,416
That isn't your brother.

344
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,416
He's been possessed
by the Orochi.

345
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,541
Seriously?

346
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,625
Listen to me very
carefully, Chutaro.

347
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,666
You must take the Kumoh swords
and lure the Serpent

348
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,416
through the canal
tunnel into Kyoto.

349
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,833
He'll be fine.
All you have to do is

350
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,125
lead him into the sunlight.

351
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,375
You've ever served this
family well, Poko.

352
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,750
I'm counting on you!

353
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,958
[grunting]

354
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,333
Stand your ground.

355
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,333
So, the leader
makes an appearance.

356
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,083
Knock it off!
What are you doing?

357
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,041
Miss Botan.

358
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,708
Where's Master Soramaru?

359
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,041
He's chasing his brave little
brother through the tunnel

360
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,750
beneath Shiga.

361
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,333
[leaves rustling]

362
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,041
[birds chirping]

363
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,375
There's no graver sin than
to turn one's back on blood.

364
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,000
[heavy footsteps]

365
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,666
We should almost be
there by now--

366
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,375
Ah!

367
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,375
Oh, no! It's a dead end!

368
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,625
[growling]

369
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,500
[crunching]

370
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,416
[screaming]

371
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,958
One can see why
he leads, I suppose.

372
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,833
Something tells me this
is going to be difficult.

373
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,083
[SHIRASU] I do hope you ladies
are prepared to meet your end.

374
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,000
[electricity crackling]

375
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,750
My name is Chutaro Kumoh
and I am the third son!

376
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,458
And I am the brother
of Tenka and Soramaru!

377
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,708
[grunting]

378
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,875
Please, you gotta
snap out of this!

379
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,458
It's time for us to go home!

380
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,375
[grunting]

381
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,166
[TENKA]
Chutaro!

382
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,791
Soramaru!

383
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,916
Enough of this screwin' around.

384
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,208
You're alive!

385
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,916
[growls]

386
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,833
[laughs]

387
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,041
[SHI QIAN-LANG]
History is forged

388
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,541
when the wisdom of old age

389
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,958
braids itself to
the fire of adolescence.

390
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,000
Youth shall be blacksmiths
of the coming era.

391
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,875
Seize the bellows
and craft steel!
