1
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:04,067
I will be the wife of a CEO.

2
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,400
The most loyal dog ever!

3
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,858
Who are you talking about?

4
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,733
You'd have more luck with
a single-lens reflex camera

5
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:09,983
and a telephoto lens.

6
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,067
Good to see you, Sis!

7
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,358
Hi! It's nice to meet you.

8
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:14,317
My name is Sakura Usada.

9
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:08,733
[YOKO]
Yamaji? Yamaji?

10
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:09,775
[YAMAJI]
You called, Miss Yoko?

11
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:11,358
How may I be of service?

12
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:13,608
[YOKO] I've invited some of my
classmates to visit tomorrow.

13
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:15,067
We shall be playing
in the garden.

14
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,525
[YAMAJI]
What a wonderful idea!

15
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:18,192
Begin preparations at once.

16
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,275
Your wish is always
my command, Miss Yoko.

17
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:21,608
[YOKO laughs]

18
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,775
I'm simply delighted
you could be here!

19
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,733
If it's agreeable to you,
I thought we might play house.

20
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,483
Yes, that sounds delightful.

21
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,692
Indeed!

22
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:41,817
I will be the wife of a CEO.

23
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,775
I will be the wife
of a top lawyer.

24
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:46,150
And I will be the wife
of a real estate tycoon.

25
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,317
I'm crazed today!

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,025
I have a massage
and a mani-pedi,

27
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:51,692
and Snookums must get
to the groomer for a trim.

28
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:53,817
I still can't decide
between foie gras or shrimp

29
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,567
for tonight's dinner party!

30
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,817
Now ladies, take care not
to work yourselves too hard!

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,983
[laughing]

32
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,400
And that's just one of
the many adorable moments

33
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:09,817
from Miss Yoko's
childhood I still cherish.

34
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,233
If you keep this up,
you're going to embarrass me!

35
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,233
Were you literally
born with a silver spoon

36
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,567
in your mouth?

37
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,608
It doesn't sound like
you two have changed much.

38
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:19,192
I'm curious...

39
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,275
Was Sonobe weird back then, too?

40
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:22,858
[HAYAMA] You didn't say
anything about her.

41
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:25,650
[YAMAJI] Honestly, she hasn't
changed that much either.

42
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,025
What about you?

43
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,442
What were you like
when you were little?

44
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,775
When I was a kid...

45
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,525
Hi, Mom! I'm home!

46
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:37,608
You have fun at school?

47
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,025
Sure! What's for snack?

48
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:40,442
How about some
nice white bread?

49
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:41,608
Sounds good!

50
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:43,858
--[FUTABA'S MOM laughs]
--[FUTABA] Yummy!

51
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:45,275
[FUTABA]
I was pretty energetic.

52
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,442
Always playing or eating.

53
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,900
[HAYAMA]
Sounds about right.

54
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:50,317
It's your turn, Hayama!

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,942
Oh, do I have to?

56
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,317
[HAYAMA crying]

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,150
[KOU] Aww, what's the matter?
Why are you crying?

58
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,608
[HAYAMA]
Santa doesn't like me!

59
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,400
He brought me the wrong present!

60
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:02,733
[KOU]
I'm sure that's not true.

61
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,192
What's wrong with it?

62
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,025
I told him I
wanted a white tiger,

63
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:07,775
and this is what he gave me!

64
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:09,692
This stupid pink cat!

65
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,317
I even gave him options!

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,108
I said that my second
choice was a puma,

67
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,858
my third choice
was a snow leopard,

68
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,983
and my fourth choice
was a saber-tooth tiger!

69
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,233
Well, Mr. Santa obviously
isn't doing his job

70
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:21,650
'cause you deserve to
have whatever you want!

71
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:26,275
[KOU]
Cheer up, Teru.

72
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:27,900
There's always next year!

73
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,275
[HAYAMA]
I know, but...

74
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:32,775
...what if it's my fault
things turned out this way?

75
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:34,608
[HAYAMA] Santa didn't
get me what I wanted

76
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,608
because I was a bad girl.

77
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:38,733
I have to be good from now on.

78
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:41,400
I'll study hard
and say nice things.

79
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:42,942
I'll be a perfect student.

80
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:45,275
No one has to know
I'm pretending.

81
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,025
Especially Santa.

82
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:51,858
That's when the demon
within you awakened!

83
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,233
I don't know what you mean.

84
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,108
I think it's sweet
how your sister

85
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,775
has always looked out for you.

86
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,733
Man, it must be awesome
to have a big sister.

87
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:01,067
I'm super jealous.

88
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,608
[KOU]
Um, hello?

89
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,900
[HAYAMA]
And there she is.

90
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,358
I wanted to join
you all for lunch,

91
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,775
but you practically need
a map to find this place!

92
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:11,025
We're actually done eating,

93
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,483
but we can stick around
a little longer.

94
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,108
[KOU]
Anyone want some bitter melon?

95
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:15,858
[FUTABA]
Ooh! Like in a stir-fry?

96
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,233
Nope, just raw. Yum!

97
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,942
[HAYAMA, FUTABA, YOKO]
Ugh!

98
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,650
So you still jealous?

99
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:29,192
Hey! Tomorrow's the big day.
Are you excited?

100
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:30,067
A big day?

101
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,317
Uh-huh!

102
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,358
Well, in the cat world.

103
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,692
[NISHIYAMA]
You've gotta be kidding me!

104
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:39,275
My kitty is so much
cuter than any of these.

105
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:42,067
Its coat is silkier.
Its eyes are prettier.

106
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,483
Anyone can see it's just
more adorable in every way!

107
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,483
Wait!

108
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,108
[KONDO]
Hey, good morning!

109
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,775
Hello? Earth to Nishiyama!

110
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:51,650
What magazine are you reading?

111
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:53,942
Something wrong?

112
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,067
[NISHIYAMA]
I'm so sick of this!

113
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,942
How does she always beat me?!

114
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:01,900
[HAYAMA]
You should calm down.

115
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,608
None of these kitties deserve
that kind of treatment.

116
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,150
Is that what Kou
was talking about?

117
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,608
[HAYAMA chuckling]

118
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,192
You mean the picture of
my pwecious widdle kitty cat?

119
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,317
[meows]

120
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,025
Which one is it?
There are so many of them,

121
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:21,442
and they all
kinda look the same.

122
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:22,692
[HAYAMA]
What?!

123
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,358
He's obviously the most
beautiful one of all!

124
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:26,192
Are you blind?

125
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,483
[FUTABA] Yeah, he's a
special little snowflake.

126
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,358
[NISHIYAMA]
So it's true.

127
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:33,858
That really was your
cat's picture I saw.

128
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:35,483
I'll admit he is a cute one.

129
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,525
Mine's still much cuter, though.

130
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:39,650
[KITTEN meows]

131
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,192
Yes, the kitten you got
from me is adorable.

132
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:43,650
But let's be honest
with each other.

133
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,275
Mine is by far the
cuter of the two.

134
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,858
[BOTH growling]

135
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,067
[NISHIYAMA]
Yeah, you're right.

136
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,817
Little Bel is pretty cute.

137
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,608
[HAYAMA]
Aw, so is yours!

138
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:58,275
Just look at that sweet face!

139
00:06:58,358 --> 00:06:59,275
[NISHIYAMA]
Here, kitty.

140
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,817
[HAYAMA]
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

141
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,108
Aw kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

142
00:07:03,192 --> 00:07:05,567
Ugh! Cat people!

143
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,275
[giggling]

144
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:10,317
Congratulations, Hayama.
Your cat is really adorable!

145
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,650
I wish I could have a pet.

146
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,400
Living on my own
might not be so lonely

147
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:16,067
if I had a little friend
to keep me company.

148
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,775
But my apartment
doesn't allow it.

149
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:19,067
Then maybe you
should move someplace

150
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,525
that will let you have one.

151
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,233
I don't have the
means to relocate.

152
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,150
Well, you do kind
of have a pet already.

153
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,775
The most loyal dog ever!

154
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:28,442
Who are you talking about?

155
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,525
Oh, you shouldn't
compare Yamaji to a dog!

156
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:33,192
That's terrible. He's my friend.

157
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,233
Do me a favor.

158
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,400
What?

159
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:36,400
Take this stick and
throw it over there.

160
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:37,775
Then say "fetch."

161
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,275
Just trust me.

164

You're seriously creepy,
you know that?!

165
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,275
No, I'm not!

166
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:53,067
[NISHIYAMA]
I'll show her.

167
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,067
I can do it too!
It can't be that hard.

168
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,567
[NISHIYAMA] I'll take the most
squee-inducing picture

169
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,192
in the history of cat magazines!

00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:11,275

[KITTEN meows]

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,233
Hey! Come back!

174
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,358
One shot!

175
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:19,483
That's all I need. Just one!

176
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:21,983
Will you just hold still?!

177
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,067

[NISHIYAMA growls]

179
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,400
Everything okay?

180
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,733
[NISHIYAMA]
I have a newfound respect

181
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,192
for animal photographers.

182
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,442
[HAYAMA]
You need better gear.

183
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,733
You'd have more luck with
a single-lens reflex camera

184
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:45,317
and a telephoto lens.

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,692
Oh, yeah?

186
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,567
You're not really
gonna buy that stuff?

187
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,650
You don't really own
that stuff, do you?

188
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,108
I guess owning
all that stuff means

189
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:55,400
photography's your hobby?

190
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:58,775
Oh, no. More of a duty,
really. Really.

191
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:00,025
[FUTABA]
Geez!

192
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:01,983
There must be something
you do for fun, right?

193
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,525
I dunno, I keep pretty
busy most of the time.

194
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:05,900
I do enjoy reading.

195
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:08,025
Like what, international
guides to torture?

196
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,733
Actually, I finished
reading most of those

197
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:10,650
in middle school.

198
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,483
Right. How silly of me.

199
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,817
What about you, Futaba?

200
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,358
Is eating your hobby?

201
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:17,108
[FUTABA]
How can eating be a hobby?

202
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,692
I eat to survive,
just like everybody else.

203
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,817
[HAYAMA]
Yeah, sure. Hmm...

204
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,067
Would you please stop
staring at me like that?!

205
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,858
So if eating enough
to feed a small army

206
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,608
isn't your hobby, what is?

207
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,525
I don't eat that much!
You're just being mean!

208
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,192
What is my hobby, though?

209
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,692
I really like to cook.

210
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,483
Can you stop playing
around for one second

211
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,525
and give us a straight answer?
I told you mine.

212
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:39,650
What?

213
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,275
You know reheating
food's not cooking.

214
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,317
Neither's opening a package
or making a sandwich.

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,942
I know what cooking is,
thank you very much!

216
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:47,650
I like to eat,
so I like to cook!

217
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,650
I don't see why that concept is
so hard for you to understand!

218
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,275
[HAYAMA]
Just tell us your real hobby!

219
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,192
Do you listen when I talk?

220
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,025
If I have something
good at a restaurant,

221
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:57,692
I wanna recreate the experience,

222
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:59,942
so I'll try to make
it myself at home.

223
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,067
So it is more
about eating, then.

224
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,900
Fine, why don't we just say
that eating out is my hobby?!

225
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:06,442
Well, in that case...

226
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:12,192
If you two don't mind
I have a small request.

227
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:13,775
[YOKO] I've wanted to see
what this place was like

228
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,400
for a long time.

229
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,400
I would wistfully imagine
dropping by with friends

230
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,983
on the way home from school.

231
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:19,983
Now I'm here!

232
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,567
It's not exactly
five-star dining,

233
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,025
but they make good fries.

234
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:24,650
It popped into my
head when Futaba said

235
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,067
her hobby was eating out.

236
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,483
I thought we could grab a bite.

237
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,442
Let's get this party started!

238
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:31,067
[YOKO]
Oh! Just look at it!

239
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,692
This is exactly the
meal I've dreamed of!

240
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,608
Way to dream big there, Yoko!

241
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:36,983
But to complete
the experience,

242
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,275
we must talk endlessly
about vague and silly things

243
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,400
whilst we eat.

244
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:41,608
Go ahead!

245
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,108
I'm not really sure
what you want me to say.

246
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,900
I've nothing
particular in mind.

247
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:47,233
The usual chatter regarding
animals and food

248
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,483
should be just fine if you--

249
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,025
Those are not vague
and silly things!

250
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,817
Everything you
hoped it would be?

251
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,275
Actually, I can't
help but feel like

252
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,650
there's something missing.

253
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,317
But I'm sure a little
dollop of mayonnaise

254
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,608
would make it much better.

255
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,900
Should we be concerned
about your mayo habit?

256
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,983
Um, I have a question.

257
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,400
This might not be
the right place,

258
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:09,983
and it's not about
something silly.

259
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,692
But I feel like we've
gotten to know each other

260
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:13,192
well enough that I can ask.

261
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:14,858
This sounds serious.

262
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,858
I was just wondering
why you're living alone.

263
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,608
What are your parents doing?

264
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,692
I can't answer that.

265
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,400
My mother has been
gone a long time.

266
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,275
She passed away
when I was quite young.

267
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:28,733
As for my father...

268
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:30,067
[HAYAMA]
What about him?

269
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,733
[YOKO] After he lost everything,
he didn't give up.

270
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,067
He decided that he
was going to start over.

271
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,358
He came to me and said...

272
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:38,108
"Don't worry, dear.
It'll be all right.

273
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,150
Daddy's gonna do something big!"

274
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,233
I don't know where he is
now or what he's doing,

275
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,608
but he sends money regularly,

276
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:48,150
so I'm sure he must
be working hard.

277
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,483
You've had a pretty
rough go of it lately, huh?

278
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:51,942
Hence the bread
crusts and mayo.

279
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,858
[FUTABA] This must be
a huge change for you.

280
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:54,900
Yes.

281
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,983
If you ever need anything,
feel free to ask us.

282
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,150
We're here to help.

283
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,025
That's the whole point
of having friends.

284
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,567
[YOKO]
This was amazing!

285
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,567
Thank you for making
my dream come true.

286
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,025
[HAYAMA]
It was no big deal.

287
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,733
I'm happy to hang out
any time you want,

288
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,067
just lemme know.

289
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,733
As long as it's something
involving food, right?

290
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,817
[YU]
Is that you, Yoko?

291
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,650
Wow, I was right!
Good to see you, Sis!

292
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,650
Did he just call you "Sis"?

293
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,900
You never mentioned having
a little brother before.

294
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,442
Uh, I don't.
He's not my brother.

295
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:32,900
My name is Yu Takezono,

296
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,983
and Yoko and I
aren't related by blood.

297
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,442
We're promised to each other.

298
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:37,650
You're what?!

299
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,525
Promised to each other?
Are you kidding me?

300
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,442
That sounds like something
rich people would do.

301
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:42,983
Wait, you're getting
the wrong idea.

302
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,483
I've known him
since we were little.

303
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,692
Our families are close.

304
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,900
The betrothal's not
formal or anything.

305
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,233
Well, it's formal to me!

306
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,358
Okay, okay.

307
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:51,483
I see.

308
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,983
That's a lot less gross, then.

309
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,317
I've got enough
money to make sure

310
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,483
you're very well cared for!

311
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,817
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Oh, yeah?

312
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,483
I seem to have let the
time get away from me.

313
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,900
I must go now.
But may I see you again?

314
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:04,733
[YOKO]
Sure.

315
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,442
Yoko is a very special girl,

316
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,775
so I ask you treat her
like the treasure she is.

317
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,358
--[HAYAMA] Got it!
--[FUTABA] Of course!

318
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,775
I'm off then, but
we'll meet again soon!

319
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:17,483
[YU grunts]

320
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,733
Young Master Takezono.

321
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,233
Haven't seen you in a long time.

322
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,567
You used to work
for the Nishikawas.

323
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,983
Yamaji, right?
What are you doing here?

324
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,817
On my way to bring something
to Miss Yoko, actually.

325
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,067
Jeez, are you still
pretending to be her servant?

326
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,233
How pathetic.

327
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,400
You don't need to
worry about her anymore,

328
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:36,108
because I'll be taking
care of her.

329
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,317
Psycho stalker.

330
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,983
[YAMAJI]
Ack!

331
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,067
[YU]
Humph.

332
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,442
[YAMAJI]
He's just a child.

333
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:46,108
A harmless little child.

334
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,483
[HAYAMA] Let's talk about
that kid from yesterday.

335
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,192
Sure, what about him?

336
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:52,733
He's more than a little
attached to you, eh?

337
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,108
Yeah.

338
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,108
[YOKO] Like I said, our
families are old friends.

339
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:57,650
It was nice running into him.

340
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,692
[HAYAMA] I'll bet he's
a real sweetheart.

341
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:02,025
[FUTABA] Rich, too.
Nothing wrong with that, right?

342
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,067
[YAMAJI crying]

343
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,233
Oh yeah, I forgot.

344
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,650
I won't be able to
walk home with you guys

345
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,775
after school today.

346
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:08,650
Why?

347
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,400
You got something better to do?

348
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,733
It's a family thing.

349
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,483
My cousin's gonna be
staying with us for a week.

350
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:16,025
So it's my job to pick
her up and escort her home.

351
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,483
I didn't know
you had a cousin.

352
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,650
Oh, how nice!

353
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:19,942
I'd love to meet her
while she's in town.

354
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,442
Uh, really?

355
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,650
'Cause honestly, I wouldn't
mind having a little backup.

356
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,692
What do you need backup for?

357
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:31,817
[FUTABA]
Sakura!

358
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,483
Oh! Glad you made it!

359
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,608
[FUTABA] Sorry, were you
waiting a long time?

360
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,900
Yeah! Do you know
how late you are?

361
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,067
Let me introduce you.

362
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,358
These are my good friends,
Yoko and Hayama.

363
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:42,650
It's very nice to meet you.

364
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,233
Hey, how's it going?

365
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,275
[FUTABA] And this is my
little cousin Sakura.

366
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:47,567
Hi! It's nice to meet you.

367
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,442
My name is Sakura Usuda.

368
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,983
[YOKO] You are just
the cutest little thing.

369
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,025
I'm aware of that, but thanks!

370
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,525
[FUTABA laughs]
Uh, sorry.

371
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:00,233
She's got a weird
sense of humor.

372
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,733
Oh, that's all right.

373
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,192
It's nice to meet a young lady
with such self-confidence.

374
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:07,275
Out of curiosity,
what's with all the luggage?

375
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:08,650
You don't expect me to travel

376
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,442
without a proper
wardrobe, do you?

377
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:13,900
I like to be prepared.
What's so weird about that?

378
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,025
This is why you
wanted some backup.

379
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:18,775
[FUTABA] Maybe we could
use a little more, hm?

380
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:24,525
You summoned me?

381
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:27,567
Seriously, dude!
Will you stop doing that?

382
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,483
[SAKURA] I'm not saying I'm
perfect, but I am up there.

383
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,983
I don't see any point
in denying it, do you?

384
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,483
I don't know.

385
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,567
Anyway, I have my
life all planned out.

386
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,025
[SAKURA]
When I turn 14,

387
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,608
I'll be discovered by a talent
scout and become a celebrity.

388
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:46,567
I'll star in several movies
and TV shows

389
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,650
before getting married
at age 23.

390
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,525
At 25, I'll have a baby boy.

391
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:53,692
At 28 I'll revive my career
by becoming a model,

392
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:56,733
and at 50 I'll move overseas
and spend my remaining years

393
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,733
in carefree relaxation.

394
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:01,067
Pretty sweet plan,
don't you think?

395
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,025
[YOKO] Just remember: you never
know what life might bring.

396
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:05,442
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Aw, how sad.

397
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:07,150
That guy's kind of handsome.

398
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,442
I wouldn't reject him
because he's a servant.

399
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,067
I'm magnanimous like that.

400
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,567
He's actually not a servant.

401
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,233
Yeah, more like a
stalker who pretends

402
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,067
to have legitimate employment.

403
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,900
Hey!

404
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,192
Oh, really? I'll pass, then.

405
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:22,192
You're welcome to keep
carrying my bags, though.

406
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:23,483
[YAMAJI]
You are magnanimous.

407
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,775
[YU]
Hello again!

408
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,733
Yu!

409
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:29,692
I was hoping I might
run into you today.

410
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,442
Take this. It's wagyu beef
we got as a gift.

411
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,650
Wagyu beef?

412
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:34,942
[YU]
There's too much for us to eat,

413
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,692
so I wanted you to have some.

414
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:38,358
Only the best for you.

415
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,483
Yu! [laughs]

416
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,608
[YU grunts]

417
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,858
[YU]
Usuda! What are you doing here?

418
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:49,275
[FUTABA] Hold on... do you
two know each other?

419
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:50,858
[SAKURA] Yeah, we're
in the same class.

420
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:54,400
Right now he's the top candidate
to be my husband someday.

421
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,525
[YU]
Uh, don't I get a say in this?

422
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,983
[SAKURA]
Aw, you're just embarrassed.

423
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,108
[YU]
I am not!

424
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,275
[HAYAMA]
What's the problem?

425
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:01,442
You'd make a cute couple.

426
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,983
[SAKURA]
You think so too?

427
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,025
[YU]
No! It's never going to happen!

428
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,275
Yoko's the one I'm promised to!

429
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,858
[SAKURA] What do you
mean "promised to"?

430
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:09,983
You're joking, right?

431
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:11,192
[FUTABA]
Let's all calm down.

432
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:12,192
[SAKURA]
Is it over between us?

433
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:13,650
I thought we had something!

434
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,650
It's something they talked
about when they were kids.

435
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:16,858
Nothing formal, you know?

436
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:19,067
I mean, Yoko isn't
even serious about it.

437
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,525
Isn't that right? Yoko?

438
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:26,192
Wagyu beef for me! Wagyu beef!

439
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,692
No one's home right now.

440
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:30,817
--[YU] Goodbye.
--[SAKURA] Wait, Yu! Come back!

441
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,067
[HAYAMA]
Think we should stop 'em?

442
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,400
[FUTABA]
Nah, I say let 'em go.

443
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:34,858
[YOKO]
Beef for me!

444
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,442
So, how did it turn out?

445
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,483
Did the wagyu beef
live up to expectations?

446
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:44,900
I'm sure it was mind-blowing,

447
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:46,942
but I wanna hear about
every juicy detail!

448
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,775
Oh, I'm so jealous!

449
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,025
Huh?

450
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:52,108
I don't think everything
went as planned, okay?

451
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:53,317
What do you mean?

452
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,275
So much meat.
So much beautiful meat.

453
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,900
Come, now. You can
rise to the challenge.

454
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,983
You can cook this beef, Yoko!

455
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:14,692
It's so simple. All you need
to do is lightly fry it.

456
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:17,317
[laughing]

457
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:32,983
Although the outside
was burnt to a crisp,

458
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,942
the inside was completely raw.

459
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:35,942
Aw, that sucks.

460
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,025
Cooking meat right
can be tricky.

461
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:41,025
It can be, but you've still got
a little bit left, don't you?

462
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:42,775
Not that it does me any good.

463
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,900
Well, if you let me cook
the rest of it, it will.

464
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:45,858
What?

465
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:47,192
I told you cooking
is my hobby,

466
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,358
so I gotta show off my skills!

467
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,150
It's high quality meat,

468
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:01,608
so the important
thing to remember

469
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:04,192
is not to cook it for too long.

470
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,567
Okay.

471
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:09,233
[HAYAMA]
Ah.

472
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,900
[FUTABA]
Well, here we go!

473
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,733
Oh, it seems too
good to be true.

474
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,442
I'm not dreaming.

475
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,067
[FUTABA] I still can't believe
you didn't think I could cook.

476
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,317
Don't you have any
faith in me at all?

477
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,983
And considering how
much I like to eat,

478
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:27,733
I'd be pretty screwed if I
couldn't cook, don't you think?

479
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:29,442
You kinda come across
as the type of person

480
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,150
who knows how to eat
and not much else.

481
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,650
That's not nice!

482
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:34,567
You know what,
forget about all that.

483
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,025
We don't want to keep
good beef waiting, do we?

484
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,233
Time to eat, everyone!

485
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:43,483
[ALL]
Mmm!

486
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:44,733
[HAYAMA]
This is delicious!

487
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,900
[FUTABA]
It's tender, tasty, and juicy!

488
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:50,192
[YOKO] Ah! This is what meat
is supposed to taste like.

489
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,317
I gotta say, you have
some pretty impressive skills

490
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,525
in the kitchen.

491
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:48,483
Aw, I don't usually
make much fancy stuff

492
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,025
since I can't really afford
to eat it on a regular basis.

493
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:52,692
Actually, my specialty's
a little something

494
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,400
I like to call mama's cooking!

495
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:55,942
Ah!

496
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:56,817
Mama!

497
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,067
I humbly accept your worship.

498
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,400
Yes, what is it about
a mother's cooking?

499
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:04,442
There's something comforting
about it, isn't there?

500
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:06,025
I remember my mother
used to make

501
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:08,067
the most wonderful
veal spareribs braised

502
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,525
and then simmered
with chickpeas.

503
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:10,775
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Veal, huh?

504
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,983
It's still one of the best
things I have ever tasted.

505
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,900
In fact, the only
meal I've eaten

506
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:20,692
that came close
was this one.

507
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:22,275
Thank you so much.

508
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,733
It's been too long
a time since I've had

509
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:30,025
a home-cooked meal with
people I truly care about.

510
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:31,733
We're glad we could be here.

511
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,067
So who's up for seconds?

512
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,733
I say we fry up every last
bit of meat that's left!

513
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:41,983
Well, if you don't mind.

514
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,775
Of course not, because
eating delicious food

515
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:45,358
makes people happy
and can soften

516
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:47,942
even the hardest of hearts!

517
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:49,608
So from now on,
we need to make sure

518
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:52,025
you get all the yummy
food you can handle!

519
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:53,733
Sorry, what are you implying?

520
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:54,733
You've inspired me!

521
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:56,317
I'm going to learn
how to cook too.

522
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,108
And I'll invite both of you over
to sample my culinary delights!

523
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,858
I'll be there with bells on!

524
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:02,525
So what are you
going to make first?

525
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,900
I was envisioning lightly
toasted bread crusts

526
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:08,025
topped with braised wagyu beef
and freshly-squeezed mayonnaise.

527
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:09,775
Perhaps you might
consider dusting them

528
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:12,483
with some pink codfish flakes
and then flambéing them.

529
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,858
I'll take mine on the
crunchy side, with the works!

530
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:19,608
[ALL laughing]

531
00:23:50,442 --> 00:23:51,775
[FUTABA]
I'll do it!

532
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:54,608
I'll sell delicious steak for
cheaper than this place!

533
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:56,650
[FUTABA] And so, the
cooking showdown began.

534
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,942
Futaba went about
to find ingredients.

535
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:00,858
I think something like
that'll happen next.

536
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:02,650
[YOKO]
My, that would be good.

537
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,858
A cooking story
needs a taste tester!
