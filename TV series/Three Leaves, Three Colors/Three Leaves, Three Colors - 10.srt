1
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,067
What could be
better than a day

2
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,942
to gorge on chicken and cake?

3
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,483
[HAYAMA]
You've been acting weird.

4
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,983
And I want to know the reason.

5
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,567
[KOU giggling]

6
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,608
You are amazing in
every way, Miss Yoko.

7
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:15,150
Why would anybody put
a cat in a swimming pool?

8
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:55,525
[DAUGHTER 10A] Look at that
tree, Mommy! It's so pretty!

9
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,192
[MOTHER 10A]
It sure is!

10
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,400
I thought it would
never get here,

11
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:00,025
but it's finally the season!

12
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:01,900
Yes, it is, isn't it?

13
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,608
The season of astronomically
high heating bills.

14
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,900
That wasn't really
what I meant.

15
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:09,567
It has gotten
pretty cold, though.

16
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,025
I could barely bring
myself to get out

17
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,775
from under the
covers this morning.

18
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:14,275
That gives me an idea!

19
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,608
[FUTABA]
Huh?

20
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:16,817
[YOKO] I'll wrap myself in
blankets when I'm home

21
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,317
instead of turning up the heat.

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,233
That should save a lot of money!

23
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,358
Well, that's one way to do it.

24
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:24,692
Please, Miss Yoko!

25
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:25,858
[screams]

26
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,108
[YAMAJI] If you let me
buy you a heater,

27
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:28,483
then you'll never be cold again!

28
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:29,983
[WOMAN 10A]
Excuse me.

29
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,400
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

30
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:32,567
Here you go.

31
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,900
Now, Miss Yoko!

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,525
Well, anyway,

33
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:38,192
what I was trying to
say before was that

34
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,317
Christmas is almost here.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,317
Oh, I guess it is
that season, too.

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,942
[FUTABA] Christmas is
very important, y'know.

37
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:48,025
What could be better than a day
to gorge on chicken and cake?

38
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:50,192
That's not actually
what Christmas is about.

39
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:52,400
[FUTABA] Wha--? If it's not
about stuffing your face,

40
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:54,775
then why does everyone do it?

41
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:57,858
I guess these days it is mostly
about chicken and cake, huh?

42
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,275
[FUTABA] Hey, whaddaya
think about throwing

43
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:00,983
our very own Christmas party?

44
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,233
That sounds like
a fantastic idea!

45
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,650
Yay!

46
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,442
We're gonna need a lot of
chicken and a lot of cake!

47
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,025
[YOKO] It takes more than
chicken and cake

48
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:10,317
to throw a good party.

49
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,942
A Christmas party. Fun!

50
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,858
[FUTABA]
Yoko, wait up!

51
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:21,733
Good morning.

52
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:22,900
I'll walk with you.

53
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,900
Did Hayama go to
school early today?

54
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,442
Yep.

55
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,650
Apparently she had some class
rep duties to take care of.

56
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,192
She sure is busy, huh?

57
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:32,733
All that sucking up she does...
It takes a lot of effort.

58
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:35,233
Anyway, I've been thinking
about the Christmas party.

59
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:37,192
I decided that I'm
gonna bake the cake.

60
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,983
Great! Sounds perfect!

61
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,317
[FUTABA]
We'll have it at your place,

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,275
and Hayama will be
in charge of snacks.

63
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:45,025
It's gonna be so much fun!

64
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:48,067
[KOU giggling]

65
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:53,775
Did I just overhear you girls
talking about Christmas plans?

66
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,983
Yeah. The three of us
decided to have a little party.

67
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,858
I have some information
you might be interested in.

68
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,233
The 25th is a big day.

69
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:04,900
It's not just Christmas.

70
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:07,733
It's also my sister's birthday!

71
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:13,942
[YOKO, FUTABA]
What?!

72
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:31,067
What's up with you two?
You're acting kinda funny.

73
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,108
[overlapping chatter]

74
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,233
[YOKO] I can't believe
that Hayama's birthday

75
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,108
is on Christmas.

76
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,150
[FUTABA]
Wait, so that means...

77
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:53,233
[HAYAMA laughs evilly]

78
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:55,817
[FUTABA] A demon was
born on a holy day!

79
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
[YOKO]
Such a contradictory occurrence.

80
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,858
[overlapping chatter]

81
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:12,442
[HAYAMA] What are you
even talking about?!

82
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,608
[HAYAMA]
You've been acting weird.

83
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,150
And I want to know the reason.

84
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,192
[BOTH gasp]

85
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,525
[FUTABA]
We have to go.

86
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,525
Earlier, Yoko said there's
something she needed

87
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,400
to discuss with me
and nobody else.

88
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,233
What? I didn't say
anything like that.

89
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:27,900
[FUTABA]
Sure ya did. Come on!

90
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:31,942
[YOKO] Wait, will you at least
tell me where we're going?

91
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:34,858
We need to get a grip or she's
gonna know that something's up.

92
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,567
She's really suspicious.

93
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,233
What do you think we should do
about the Christmas party?

94
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:41,608
Hey, I know!

95
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:42,900
We'll still have a party,

96
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:45,317
only now it'll be a
birthday party for Hayama.

97
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,775
[YOKO] Huh?
How will that work, exactly?

98
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,817
We'll keep planning, and
whenever we talk to her,

99
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,650
we'll act like it's for
the Christmas party.

100
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,483
Think how surprised she'll
be when she finds out

101
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,192
it's actually for her birthday!

102
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:56,442
Oh!

103
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:59,483
So we're going to set
a trap and ambush her?

104
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,275
Not really how I'd put it.

105
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,483
The important thing to remember
is to keep it a secret

106
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,525
from Hayama.

107
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:05,942
I won't breathe
a word to her.

108
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:07,275
[ALL gasp]

109
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,983
Where did you come from,
and what are you doing here?

110
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,650
[SHINO] I'm passing out flyers
for Christmas cakes.

111
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,775
[YOKO] I thought I told you not
to do that here anymore.

112
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,692
[SHINO] Are you sure?
That's a shame.

113
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,400
If our sales were to go up,
I might be able

114
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:20,483
to afford to give you a raise.

115
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,192
I refuse to be tempted.

116
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:26,317
You and your flyers
will leave at once!

117
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,108
Cake shops must be
busy this time of year,

118
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,400
what with all the parties.

119
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,317
We have been
working quite hard.

120
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,983
On top of normal business,
there are orders

121
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,983
for specialty cakes
and holiday pastries,

122
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,692
so we've been baking nonstop.

123
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:37,942
Wait, "we"?

124
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:39,608
Do you mean you actually
help with the baking?

125
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:43,442
I measure out ingredients
and sprinkle things on top.

126
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,150
She is an expert sprinkler.

127
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,692
I don't know how I would
survive the busy holiday season

128
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,858
without her assistance.

129
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,400
You look so shocked,
but as you can see,

130
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,692
my help is essential.

131
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:54,233
You are amazing in
every way, Miss Yoko.

132
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:57,650
So, we done with
this conversation yet?

133
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:58,733
Hold on...

134
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,317
If you're so vital
to the cake shop,

135
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,983
does that mean you'll have
to work on Christmas?

136
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,608
I give you permission
to take the day off.

137
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,733
After a life of loneliness,
you finally have friends.

138
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:11,150
I will work from dawn
until dusk without rest,

139
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:14,067
so you may celebrate
your friend's birthday.

140
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,733
Thank you so much!

141
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,317
Despite her lack
of experience,

142
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,983
she's somehow
slightly more useful

143
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,442
than a cat in a swimming pool.

144
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:21,650
You'll make me blush!

145
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,025
'Kay, seriously.
Can we be done now?

146
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:26,483
[HAYAMA]
Hold on just one minute!

147
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,983
Why would anybody put
a cat in a swimming pool?

148
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,442
Oh, we didn't see you there!

149
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:31,733
Whatcha doin'?

150
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,192
[HAYAMA] I want to know
what the two of you

151
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,900
have to say that I'm
not allowed to hear.

152
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:37,275
I must confess.

153
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,192
We have been keeping
a secret from you.

154
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,317
Uh, Sonobe...

155
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,025
I hope you can handle it.

156
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,567
The truth is I'm planning to
add bear and cat-shaped cakes

157
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,192
to the shop menu
sometime in the near future.

158
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:48,108
[FUTABA, YOKO]
What?

159
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,275
How cute!

160
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:51,900
[SHINO] I asked the others
to keep it a secret

161
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,858
because I wanted
to surprise you.

162
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:56,817
[HAYAMA] Aww! I'm sorry
I spoiled the surprise!

163
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,275
I can't wait to see 'em!

164
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,025
That maid's more
useful than she looks.

165
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,817
We owe Sonobe for
getting us out of that one.

166
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,817
[NISHIYAMA]
I love Christmastime.

167
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,525
The streets are so pretty,
and people look so happy.

168
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:16,108
And it's so much fun
to pick out presents!

169
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,358
[NISHIYAMA] I wonder which
one would look better.

170
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:27,150
Pink's nice, but the red
one's really pretty, too.

171
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,233
[chuckles]

172
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,400
[NISHIYAMA] I spent an hour
deciding and wound up

173
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:32,692
getting both.

174
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,317
It cost my whole allowance,
but I don't care.

175
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,358
My sweet Eternal
is worth twice that!

176
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:39,942
Things are really starting
to come together, aren't they?

177
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:41,483
Yes, and I'm very excited.

178
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,525
I've never had the chance
to throw a birthday party

179
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,025
for a friend before!

180
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,317
[FUTABA] We have to make sure
it's the best party ever.

181
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,275
Since it's Christmas and
Hayama's birthday.

182
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,567
Hey, hold on a sec!

183
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,442
[FUTABA]
What's up, Nishiyama?

184
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,942
What was that about just now?

185
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,525
You were saying something
about Hayama's birthday.

186
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,525
[FUTABA]
Oh, you heard that, did ya?

187
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,025
We were talking about
Hayama's birthday

188
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,317
and the fact that it
falls on Christmas.

189
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,067
We're throwing her a party,
but it's a surprise,

190
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,192
so don't say anything
about it, okay?

191
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,733
[YOKO]
We appreciate it.

192
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:10,150
[BOY 10A]
Okay!

193
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,942
Will you tell him that I
want a bike and a video game...

194
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:14,108
[NISHIYAMA]
No, that's too crazy.

195
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:21,442
[KONDO humming "Jingle Bells"]

196
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,317
[KONDO]
Nishiyama?

197
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,442
Why are you sitting
down there?

198
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,900
It's almost Christmas.

199
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,817
Best day of the year.

200
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,900
Yeah.

201
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:34,025
I know how much you
like Christmas,

202
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,567
so I thought that
this year, maybe--

203
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,608
[NISHIYAMA]
I don't care.

204
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:37,567
[KONDO]
Huh?

205
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,942
[NISHIYAMA]
It's not special.

206
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,650
Just another day.

207
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,150
What's gotten into you?

208
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,192
You're always so happy
this time of year!

209
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,942
Maybe a Christmas party
will cheer you up!

210
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,400
[NISHIYAMA]
No, thanks.

211
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,483
I think I'll just get
some take-out instead.

212
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,067
Maybe a nice curry or something.

213
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,150
No way!

214
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:56,317
I don't know what
your problem is,

215
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,525
but you and I are having
a Christmas party!

216
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,275
Now come on, get up!

217
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,442
Stop being such a grump and
let's go pick out a cake

218
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,900
for our party.

219
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,858
[HAYAMA] I'm taking off!
See you later!

220
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,025
[KOU]
Hold on a sec.

221
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:36,233
I've got something for you.

222

[KOU giggles]

223
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,192
You are gonna love this!

224
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:45,067
I spent all night making this
special stew for your party!

225
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,900
[HAYAMA]
Special, or scary?

226
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,442
[KOU] I hope you three
have fun tonight!

227
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,942
I can't decide. Where do
you think should I put this?

228
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,733
Anywhere, just pick a place.

229
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,483
She's gonna be here
any minute now.

--Hey, I'm here!

Merry Christmas!
And happy birthday!

00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,608
Wow, that was terrifying!

235
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,608
I really thought you
were gonna shoot me!

236
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:14,108
Of course not!

237
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,858
You're mean sometimes, but
we wouldn't shoot you for it!

238
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,942
[HAYAMA]
Ah...

239
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,150
I guess my sister
must have told you.

240
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,067
I didn't mention it
'cause I didn't want you

241
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,192
to feel obligated
to do anything.

242
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,192
[YOKO]
It's not about obligation!

243
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,650
[HAYAMA]
I usually just celebrate it

244
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,317
along with Christmas anyway,

245
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,608
so I'm used to my
birthday being secondary.

246
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:35,900
It's no big deal.

247
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:37,900
That's kinda sad, actually.

248
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,275
Thanks for this, though.

249
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:41,442
It's been years since
I've had a birthday party

250
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,067
with more than just family.

251
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,900
[YOKO laughs]

252
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,858
Want some cake?
I baked it myself!

253
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:48,025
Sounds yummy, thanks.

254
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,275
I helped out by
measuring ingredients

255
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,108
and sprinkling things on top.

256
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:54,358
Well it looks
expertly sprinkled.

257
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:57,108
I almost forgot, I brought
something with me, too.

258
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,900
My sister made this.

259
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:04,608
I can't let food go to waste!

00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:05,525
[FUTABA]
Whoa!

261
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,733
We don't know
that it is food!

[YOKO gagging]

263
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,400
[HAYAMA]
Uh...

264
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:15,150
Um, maybe you should stop.

265
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,983
[FUTABA]
You can do it, Yoko!

266
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,442
[HAYAMA]
Are you okay?

267
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,442
Oh my, how amazing!

268
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,900
I almost feel like I could
run a marathon right now!

269
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,442
Should we call a doctor?

270
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:35,192
[HAYAMA] I guess I
shouldn't have brought it.

Whoops.

[KONDO]
Ya know, at some point,

274
00:12:41,942 --> 00:12:43,692
you're gonna have
to let this go.

It's like some sort
of cruel joke.

How can Christmas be my
favorite day of the year

277
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,442
if it's her birthday?

Was your Christmas
festive and full of joy?

Go away!

brought into the world, right?

I want you to apologize to
Christmas right this instant!

I don't see why
I should do that.

When the streets are
decorated so prettily

285
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,067
to celebrate my advent.

286
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,442
You're horrible!

You're a nasty,
evil Christmas-ruiner!

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,067
[YOKO] I can't believe how
much has piled up already.

293
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,900
It's only the first
snow of the winter.

294
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:42,942
[YAMAJI]
Yeah, it is unusual.

295
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,858
I find the feel of
freshly fallen snow

296
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,400
to be invigorating.

297

[YOKO] Invigorating or not,
we can't open the shop

until it's all cleared away.

[SHINO sighs]
I suppose you're right.

300
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:01,358
It's freezing out here.
And my back's starting to hurt.

301
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:02,983
[YAMAJI]
Miss Yoko is too delicate.

302
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:05,525
She shouldn't be
forced to shovel snow.

303
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:08,442
I bet this is your fault!
You made it snow, didn't you?

304
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,192
[SHINO] You've accused me
of a lot of things,

305
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,775
but that's a new one.

It doesn't seem to be stopping.

307
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,858
You're right, it doesn't.

308
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:19,275
Won't we be slow?
I can't imagine that many people

00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,192
will want to come out
in this weather.

[SHINO]
That's not necessarily true.

311
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,483
It's a known fact that many
people love blizzards

312
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,983
and will be more eager than
normal to venture out.

Really? I've never heard that.

[SHINO]
See?

317
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,983
Honestly, I'm surprised even
you came on a day like today.

318
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,025
[FUTABA]
Well...

319
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,317
I was lookin' outside
at the snow,

320
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,567
and it gave me the
strongest craving for cake.

321
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,275
[YOKO] So, something with
whipped cream for you, then?

322
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:45,817
[FUTABA]
Tiramisu, chocolate ganache,

323
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,733
and opera cake please!

324
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,692
Were you looking at snow
or at the mud puddles

325
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:52,650
left behind after
it's melted away?

326
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,233
[KOU]
Hey, Teru!

327
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,108
It's snowing like crazy!

328
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:58,067
Let's go outside and play!

329
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,233
Not a chance.

330
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,775
[KOU gasps]

331
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,942
But we can't let a
beautiful blanket of snow

332
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:04,733
go to waste, can we?

333
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,692
The best way to spend
a cold, snowy day

334
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:09,025
is inside with a warm,
snuggly cat on your lap.

335
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,400
[KOU]
Oh, come on!

336
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:13,358
Let's go. Just for a little,
I promise! It'll be fun!

337
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:16,317
[HAYAMA]
No! I don't wanna!

338
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,483
[BEELZEBUB meows]

339
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:21,608
[KOU] Ta-da!
Check out the igloo I made!

340
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:22,775
[HAYAMA]
Wow!

341
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,858
Were you out here
all night or something?

342
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,067
[KOU]
Isn't it amazing?

343
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,942
And it's even warm inside, too.

344
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,317
Go on, see what it's like!

345
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,775
I'll be back in a second.

346
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,067
I'm going to get us
something hot to drink.

347
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:40,817
She wasn't lying.
It is warm in here.

348
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,108
[HAYAMA]
How strange.

349
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:47,275
Who knew that snow could
hold in so much warmth?

350
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,400
[KOU]
Uh-oh!

351
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:55,650
[FUTABA laughs]

352
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,233
[phone chimes]

353
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,317
Oh no!

354
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,150
It looks like Hayama got buried
in some kind of avalanche!

355
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,400
Is she okay?

356
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,817
[HAYAMA shivering]

357
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,692
This is what happens when
you go outside on a snow day.

358
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:12,525
[FUTABA]
Teru, hey!

359
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:15,983
You wanna come out and play?

360
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,400
Teru, hey!

361
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,317
You wanna come out and... play?

362
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,733
What do you want?!

363
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,150
Just checkin' in on you.

364
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,858
I got a message saying
that you were in trouble.

365
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:30,108
[HAYAMA] There's this
thing called a doorbell.

366
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,942
[YOKO] I can't believe
it still hasn't stopped.

367
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,275
Seriously.

368
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:38,483
It looks like it's gonna
snow the rest of the year.

369
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:39,900
So what are you
doing for New Year's?

370
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:41,150
Any big plans?

371
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,067
I don't know if
I'll do anything.

372
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,567
[HAYAMA] You mean you're
gonna be spending it alone?

373
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,608
Yes.

374
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,025
Unacceptable!
I will not allow it!

375
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,983
[YOKO] I don't have
anyone to spend it with.

376
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,192
It's just an idea,

377
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:56,400
but why don't the three
of you do something?

378
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,775
[SHINO]
That is, of course,

379
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:59,900
assuming that Hayama and
Futaba would be interested.

380
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,150
Sounds good to me.

381
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,567
You can count me in, too.

382
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,317
New Year's is more fun if
you spend it with friends.

383
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,067
Thank you both so much!

384
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,442
[YAMAJI yells]

385
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:12,233
With that decided, I suggest
you have a pajama party.

386
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:14,067
[YOKO]
But what's... that?

387
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,275
Something that girls do.
Similar to a rite of passage.

388
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:20,358
A recent study on the
prevalence of pajama parties

389
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,900
revealed that more
than 80% of all girls

390
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:24,900
will have attended
at least one by the time

391
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:26,483
they graduate high school.

392
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,358
I know you just made that up.

393
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,192
But perhaps you're
intimidated by the thought

394
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:33,400
of hosting such an
important gathering.

395
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:35,567
[YOKO] Nothing intimidates
a Nishikawa daughter!

396
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,233
I will host a pajama party, and
I will do it in grand fashion!

397
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:40,650
Is that all right with you two?

398
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:41,525
Sure.

399
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,275
That sounds a good time to me.

400
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:45,108
Then we will need
decorations, hor d'oeuvres,

401
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:47,192
and of course a tiered cake
to mark the occasion.

402
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:50,275
Actually, pajama parties tend
to be a little more relaxed.

403
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:51,733
We basically just
hang out in bed

404
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:55,067
wearing pj's and
talk about stuff.

405
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,192
That's not like any kind
of party I've ever heard of.

406
00:17:58,275 --> 00:17:59,692
[HAYAMA]
We need a lot of blankets.

407
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:01,192
Do you think you have
enough at your place,

408
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,317
or should we bring some
with us when we come over?

409
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,775
Um, blankets...?
I don't know.

410
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,150
We all have blankets.
What are we supposed to do now?

411
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,483
This is the part
where we're supposed

412
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,108
to talk about being
in love and stuff.

413
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,150
All right. Let's discuss.

414
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,775
I love rice and bread too!

415
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:56,900
Carbs are the best!
I could eat them forever!

416
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,692
I love cats, and dogs too!

417
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:01,275
I can't choose between them!
Please don't make me!

418
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:13,317
[YOKO]
So this is a pajama party?

419
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,983
Oh! I almost forgot.
I brought snacks for us.

420
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,483
Okay! I shall make some tea.

421
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:19,858
[YOKO yelps]

422
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:21,025
That looked painful!

423
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:21,983
Are you okay?

424
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,358
[yelping]

425
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:28,692
[overlapping chatter]

426
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,650
This is completely unacceptable.

427
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,942
A real pajama party
should involve a lot more

428
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:35,025
girlish squealing and giggling.

429
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,400
You orchestrated this.
What are you up to?

430
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:39,150
I'm not up to
anything, thank you.

431
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,358
I simply want Miss Yoko
to have the experiences

432
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:43,067
any normal girl her age does.

433
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,358
Is that so wrong?

434
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:46,942
Why are you recording it?

435
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:48,733
To preserve the memories.

436
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,817
[YAMAJI]
Deranged old hag.

437
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,317
[SHINO]
Creepy stalker.

438
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,942
[YAMAJI]
Well, at least she won't spend

439
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,650
her New Year's alone.

440
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,233
That's what matters.

441
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:34,692
Wow, I can hardly believe
it's already morning.

442
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,025
It's not just morning.
It's a whole new year.

443
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,775
Happy New Year, Yoko.

444
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:40,900
Right!

445
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:44,275
Happy New Year
to you as well, Hayama.

446
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:46,650
I would say our pajama
party was a success,

447
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:47,400
wouldn't you?

448
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:48,650
A total success!

449
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:50,358
[chopping noise]

450
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,358
Food's almost ready
for ya, girls!

451
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:57,317
Mama!

452
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,108
Thank you, Mama!

453
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:02,358
Yes, yes. Anything
for you, my sweetcakes.

454
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:04,525
Now, get ready to
pound some mochi!

455
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,983
To do what?!

456
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,233
[YOKO]
What's this?

457
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:09,483
[HAYAMA]
No idea.

458
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,483
It's a mochi pounding machine.

459
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,775
When you said
"pounding mochi,"

460
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:24,942
I was imagining a mortar
and pestle type situation.

461
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,483
So was I.

462
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:29,317
Cool, huh? I asked
for it for my birthday.

463
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:32,775
[HAYAMA, YOKO]
Wow!

464
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,275
And now to eat! Woo!

465
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:37,692
High school girls enjoying
a post pajama party

466
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:39,150
breakfast of mochi.

467
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:43,108
What an extremely rare
and beautiful sight.

468
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:45,233
[YAMAJI] What have I told
you about recording them?

469
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,483
[SHINO]
It's for preservation!

470
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:53,108
Yummy!

471
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,858
I think I'm in heaven!

472
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:56,858
It's delicious,
and so fresh, too!

473
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,067
Yeah!

474
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,317
[FUTABA] Pan-fried with
soy sauce and served

475
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,900
with your choice
of edamame paste,

476
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:03,192
fermented soy bean
paste, or walnuts!

477
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:04,733
How many dozens should I make?

478
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,942
--What?
--Did you just say "dozens"?

479
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,900
Mochi's the most important
part of New Year's!

480
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:12,983
Go on ladies, enjoy yourselves,
go wild, try one!

481
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:15,692
This is breakfast, not one
of your big-eater challenges.

482
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,525

[YOKO]
An event in February?

485
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,358
That must be--

486
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:54,608
[YAMAJI] Yes, the
Festival of Broken Needles!

487
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:55,942
An event where
a memorial service

488
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:57,442
is held for broken needles.

489
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:59,608
It's an event geared
towards women.

Valenti--
