1
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,375
[HAYAMA] Do you want
some rolled omelet?

2
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,375
[YOKO]
Oh, no.

3
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,541
Thank you very
much for offering,

4
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,041
but I couldn't, really.

5
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,041
I am so sick and tired of that
smug little teacher's pet!

6
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,541
Sorry. We haven't met before.

7
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,000
Are you a friend of Hayama's?

8
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,208
[STUDENT 2A]
Okay, everyone. It's lunchtime!

9
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,416
See you all back here
after the break.

10
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,916
[STUDENT 2B]
So what'd you bring for lunch?

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,458
[STUDENT 2C]
I'm buying today, actually.

12
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,208
[STUDENT 2D]
Let's hurry. I'm starving!

13
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,208
[YOKO]
My name is Yoko Nishikawa,

14
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,041
and I come from
a wealthy family.

15
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,250
Unfortunately, my father's
company fell on hard times.

16
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,666
It went bankrupt, and now I have
to live like an ordinary girl.

17
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,291
But it might not be
as bad as I thought.

18
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,041
The other day, something
wonderful happened.

19
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,291
I made two new friends!

20
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,666
[HAYAMA] Hey. Do you want
some rolled omelet?

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,666
[YOKO]
Oh... No.

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,791
Thank you very
much for offering,

23
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,291
but I couldn't, really.

24
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,916
Come on. Just have some.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
But if I do that, there
will be less left for you.

26
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,708
[HAYAMA]
Don't worry about it.

27
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,875
[YOKO] No, it's your lunch.
I really can't.

28
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,125
[HAYAMA]
Sure you can.

29
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,500
[YOKO]
No, I can't.

30
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,458
--[FUTABA] That's enough!
--[HAYAMA] Yes, you can.

31
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,000
[FUTABA]
This is ridiculous!

32
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,666
You're being so polite you'd
think you'd never met before!

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,666
Can't we all just relax?

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,750
Sure. What'd you have in mind?

35
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,333
Well...

36
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,333
For starters, we could come up
with nicknames for each other.

37
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,625
That's the kinda
thing friends do.

38
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,833
Oh, that's right.
We are friends.

39
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,041
[HAYAMA] Are we really
good enough friends

40
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,125
for nicknames, though?

41
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,333
[FUTABA]
That's a good point.

42
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,583
Nah, maybe not.
It's way too early

43
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,750
[HAYAMA laughs]

44
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,541
It's okay, Yoko,
we're just teasing. Sorry!

45
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,416
[rustling]

46
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,958
Uh, something wrong?

[CAT meows]

[CAT meows]

49
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,708
Hey, a cat.

50
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,416
I suppose it must be a stray.

51
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,750
[HAYAMA squealing]

52
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,833
You all right?

53
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,916
[CAT meows]

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,083
[HAYAMA]
Can't breathe! It's too cute!

55
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,625
[HAYAMA] What's the matter,
widdle kitty?

56
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,375
Is poor widdle kitty wost?

57
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,541
[laughs]

58
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,625
You're so cute!

59
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,166
I don't think I've ever seen
her enjoy herself like this.

60
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,166
Freaky, isn't it?

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,833
She's kinda got
a thing for cats.

62
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,083
Actually, I love cats,
dogs, cows, horses,

63
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,000
bunnies, and even
little birdies, too.

64
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,416
My dream is to gather up
as many animals as I can find

65
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,208
and open Hayama Park,
my island sanctuary!

66
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,541
[YOKO]
What an amazing idea!

67
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,208
It's almost like
she has a heart!

68
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,708
[HAYAMA] Well, at least
I have a brain, piggy.

69
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,583
I had no idea you
liked animals so much.

70
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,125
Do you have any pets at home?

71
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,541
[HAYAMA] Yeah. We have a sweet
little kitty cat named Bel.

72
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,875
How nice!

73
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,166
He's the most adorable
thing in the whole world.

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,333
Bel is short for
Mister Beelzebub.

75
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,416
Is that so?

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,708
[YOKO]
"Beelzebub! A prince of demons.

77
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,666
Also known as Lord of the Flies.

78
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,041
A demon who takes
the form of a fly!"

79
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,833
That's her pet?!

80
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,125
The poor little baby was
just swarming with flies

81
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,041
when we took him in.

82
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,875
That's where he got his name.

83
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,041
[TEACHER 2A] Hayama,
can I borrow you a minute?

84
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,875
Oh, yes, of course.

85
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,208
If you make sure
that everyone gets

86
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,333
one of these before
next class, that'd be great.

87
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,833
[HAYAMA]
Okay.

88
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,041
[TEACHER 2A] Can you also
collect homework during break?

89
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,333
Everyone should have
a notebook to turn in.

90
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,041
[FUTABA]
Man, that's a lot of worksheets!

91
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,250
[YOKO]
What was I thinking?

92
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,750
I must have been crazy!

93
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,375
Hayama is such a good student.
Obviously she's no demon!

94
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,958
It seems like it
must be awfully difficult

95
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,375
to be the class representative.

96
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,541
There's a lot to do.

97
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,166
Honestly, I didn't
want to take the job.

98
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,958
The teachers insisted,
though, so...

99
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,500
But if you didn't want to,
couldn't you have refused?

100
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,125
Mm... Well, even though
I kinda hate doing

101
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,041
all the extra work all the time,

102
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,583
It's gonna look amazing
on my resume, so here I am!

You're tenth in our grade.

There's much more
to you than that!

Look on the bright side!

You're ranked a lot higher
than you were in middle school!

is you're improving!

I can't take it anymore!

122
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,625
I wanted to be class rep, but
of course they gave it to her!

Yeah, that was harsh.

You wanted it so much.

[NISHIYAMA] I mean, why did
they choose her, anyway?

126
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,416
Just because she looks the part?

[FUTABA]
Yeah.

128

I'm sure it's not because
she's smart and responsible.

was going to my head!

[P.E. TEACHER 2A]
C'mon, move!

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,041
Run like you mean it, or I'll
have you doing laps all day!

160
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,166
[HAYAMA]
Don't say anything.

161
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,750
You can't talk
back to a teacher.

162
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,541
Just keep it all inside.

163
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,916
[FUTABA whines]

164
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,750
[HAYAMA pants]
I'm gonna die!

165
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,750
[FUTABA]
Hey, are you okay?

166
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,708
[HAYAMA]
How could I be? She's evil!

167
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,833
She was trying to
run us to death!

168
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,750
[NISHIYAMA]
How the mighty have fallen.

169
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,916
Even the great Hayama
has a weakness, huh?

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
[HAYAMA]
Nishiyama.

171
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,041
Quit being a jerk.

172
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,708
[HAYAMA]
It's okay. Don't mind her.

173
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,625
The poor little thing
only looks down on people

174
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,208
to make herself feel better.

175
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,291
She deserves our pity
more than our anger.

176
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,541
I don't need anybody's pity!

177
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,041
Of course you don't!
You're not little!

178
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,375
You've got a great figure.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

179
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,375
[NISHIYAMA] Why are we
talking about my figure?

180
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,750
But, well...

181
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,041
I do think it's important to
take care of your body.

182
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,708
A balanced diet and proper
exercise can do wonders.

183
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,208
[NISHIYAMA]
Booyah!

184
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,708
[HAYAMA]
That must be tough.

185
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,708
You have to watch what you
eat and work out all the time

186
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,916
to maintain your weight?

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,541
I thought that only
happened to old people.

188
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,666
[NISHIYAMA]
That's not it!

189
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,958
That's not what I was saying!

190
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,833
Why do you always
twist my words?

191
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,458
[HAYAMA]
What? I don't do that!

192
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,083
She does have skills.

193
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,250
[STUDENT 2K]
Bye!

194
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,375
[STUDENT 2J]
See you tomorrow!

195
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,166
[HAYAMA] I still feel
like I'm gonna vomit.

196
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,708
[YOKO] You really don't
like running, do you?

197
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,958
I just don't have the stamina
to go on and on like that.

198
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,875
Ugh, I don't think I
could run another step.

199
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,750
Is something wrong?

200
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,583
So much for not
running another step!

201
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,458
[KITTENS meow]

202
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,291
[YOKO] Were they abandoned?
Whaddaya think we should do?

203
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,875
[HAYAMA]
I can't believe it.

204
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,500
Look at how tiny
and helpless they are.

205
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,875
It's terrible.

206
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,708
How could anybody
abandon them like this?

207
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,041
[YOKO]
She may hide it,

208
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,375
but Hayama actually has
a kind and gentle spirit.

209
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,041
[HAYAMA]
"Please take care of us"?

210
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,625
Oh, really?

211
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,416
I'm gonna take care of whoever
abandoned these poor kitties!

212
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,125
I'll take care of them so well,

213
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,166
they'll wish they
had never been born!

214
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,000
[HAYAMA laughing]

215
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,583
[YOKO, FUTABA]
Yup, she's a demon.

216
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,958
[HAYAMA] I was able to find
homes for two of them.

217
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,750
That leaves one more, though.

218
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,875
Well, it won't be easy,
but maybe I can take it.

219
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,291
But I'll have to move somewhere
that allows pets first.

220
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,875
Slow down, now!

221
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,708
Ugh. I can't be the only person
at this school who loves cats.

222
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,958
[KONDO]
Did you say cats?

223
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,750
[HAYAMA]
Yes, I did.

224
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,416
[KONDO] I don't know
if it helps, but Nishiyama

225
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,875
used to have a cat.

226
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,541
[NISHIYAMA]
A cat?

227
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,791
I don't know why you care,
but yes I had one.

228
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,000
It passed away
about three years ago.

229
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,333
[KONDO]
Your family had that cat since

230
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,333
before you were born, right?

231
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,875
You must've really loved it.

232
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,541
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore, okay?

233
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,708
[HAYAMA]
Oh, Nishiyama!

234
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,583
I never, ever thought
I would say this,

235
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,750
but you're actually
good for something!

236
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,500
If you were aiming for
a compliment, you missed!

237
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:10,083
[NISHIYAMA]
Welcome to your new home.

238

[NISHIYAMA gasps]

239
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,791
I can't believe
I agreed to this.

240
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,041
[NISHIYAMA] Well, it's not
like I had much of a choice.

241
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,875
And this has nothing
to do with Hayama.

242
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,791
It's only for the kitten's sake.

We need to find a
name for you, huh?

248
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,875
[NISHIYAMA] You're gonna be
around a long time, I know it.

249
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,625
All right, girls.
Let's get down to business!

250
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,416
[BOTH]
Huh?

251
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,750
Ugh! We have to
come up with nicknames

252
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,833
for each other, remember?

253
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,666
It slipped my mind.

254
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,083
Yes, I remember.

255
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,791
It's something we need to do!

256
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,291
What are we waiting for?

257
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,916
We can't be real friends until
we have nicknames, right?

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm not exactly sure
that's how it works.

259
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,500
I humbly ask this favor.

260
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,666
As a sign of our friendship,

261
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,541
will you please
give me a nickname?

262
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,000
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Well, uh...

263
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:42,833
Loco Yoko!

264
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,000
Purple Princess!

265
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,125
[YOKO]
Not approved!

266
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,291
[FUTABA]
What, you don't like either one?

267
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,250
[YOKO]
Ugh! No, no, no, no, no!

268
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,041
They are entirely unacceptable!

269
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,000
You should be striving for
something noble, intellectual,

270
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,416
something that connotes beauty,
grace, and magnanimity!

271
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,250
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Uh...

--Former Rich Chick!
--Purple Princess!

[YOKO growls]
Did you even hear me?!

274
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,000
[YAMAJI] Please address
Miss Yoko as "Miss Yoko."

275
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,291
[FUTABA] Hey, look who's popping
out of the bushes again!

276
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,458
[HAYAMA] You appeared so
suddenly without making a sound.

277
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,166
I thought you were
a stalker or something!

278
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,583
[YAMAJI]
A stalker? Me?

279
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,833
But anyway, the only name
that truly fits Miss Yoko

280
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,958
is "Miss Yoko."

281
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:17,791
[YOKO]
Wha--?!

282
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:18,750
Yeah, that's a great idea.

283
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,666
Sure!

284
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,375
What do you say, Miss Yoko?

285
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,958
Like your new nickname?

286
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,208
Well, I had thought my nickname
would be something different,

287
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,416
not the name I've
always been called by.

288
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,000
So, that's settled.

289
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,958
Yoko is officially
Miss Yoko now.

290
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,416
You're next, Hayama.

291
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
[FUTABA]
Wait a sec!

292
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,208
I don't actually
know your first name.

293
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,541
[FUTABA] I mean, mine's
Futaba, hers is Yoko.

294
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,541
But yours is some big
mystery for some reason.

295
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,375
[HAYAMA]
Isn't this nice?

296
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,250
If you ask me, there's nothing
like a picnic on a sunny day!

297
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,041
[FUTABA]
Aw, c'mon. It's only fair.

298
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,666
You know our first names;
you should tell us yours!

299
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,875
Seriously, stop stonewalling
and tell us already!

300
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,000
Anyway, what are you
doing after school?

301
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,083
Uh, I'm not really sure--

302
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,791
Ugh! Out with it!

303
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,500
I don't understand why
you're making such a big deal

304
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,833
out of this.

305
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,416
--Just tell us your first name!
--[KOU] Hey, Teru!

00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,333

308
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,625
Who's that?

309
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,416
That's your name?!

[YOKO, FUTABA gasp]

311
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,916
There, you know.
Are you happy?

Teru. Terry? Ter-Bear?

Leave me alone!

318
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,458
I forgot to pack chopsticks
with my lunch this morning,

319
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,833
and I don't know
what to do about it.

320
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,375
[HAYAMA] I'm sure they
have disposable ones

321
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,833
in the cafeteria.

322
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,625
Oh. Yeah, you're right!

323
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,583
I knew you were
the person to ask!

324
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,541
Thanks a lot.
I'd be totally lost without you.

325
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,000
Sorry. We haven't met before.

326
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,791
Are you a friend of Hayama's?

327
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,916
Actually I'm more
than just a friend.

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,125
I'm Teru's older sister!

329
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,375
Her sister?!

330
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,000
Are you for real?

331
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,083
[YOKO] Is it truly possible
they're related?

332
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,625
A demon and an angel.

333
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,333
You know April Fool's Day
has come and gone, don't ya?

334
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,416
Just drop it.

335
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,250
Well, anyway,
it's nice to meet you.

336
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,083
Like I said, I'm
Teru's older sister.

337
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,291
My name's Kou.

Oh, yes, hello!
It's a pleasure to meet you.

[KOU] Hold on a second,
are you Yoko?

I am.

[KOU]
Ha, I knew it!

342

Wait here and
I'll be right back!

343
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,583
Where's she going?

344
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,916
[KOU] Here, take one.
I made them from scratch!

Oh, okay!

Down the hatch!

What happened to her?

351
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,916
[KOU] This candy really packs
a punch of nutrients!

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,083
It's made from fermented beans!

353
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:55,916
[YOKO]
Okay...

Please take one.

A girl can't live on bread
crusts alone, ya know?

356
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,041
I know my sister.

357
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,041
She seems sweet, but she's
not always the nicest person.

358
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,875
I hope you'll stay friends
with her anyway.

[YOKO]
What?

360
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,625
Never mind what she says.

361
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,750
She has a pretty bad habit
of running her mouth

362
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,625
before her brain gets involved.

363
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,166
Kind of a ditz, but harmless.

364
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,375
What's a ditz?

365
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,916
Hey, look at the time!

366
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,208
If you don't hurry up, you won't
get to eat any lunch at all!

367
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,791
[KOU]
Well, see you later!

368
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,000
The candies were good,

369
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,666
but I think they can
be better, don't you?

370
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,916
Maybe I'll try a different
recipe next time.

enough time together lately,

00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,125
[KOU]
I'm exhausted!

471
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,541
It was really nice of Yoko and
Futaba to take the heavy things.

472
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,916
I'll give the hot springs
vacation to Mom and Dad.

473
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,125
They'll love it!

474
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,041
[gasps]

475
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,208
What is it?

476
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,375
I totally forgot to
go to the bookstore!

477
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,083
Why even bother
buying a cookbook?

478
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,791
It's not like you're gonna
follow the recipes, anyway.

479
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,583
[KOU] Yeah, but I wish
I'd got a photo album.

480
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,791
[HAYAMA]
Why do you need that?

481
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,375
Well, I was looking
through the closet,

482
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,916
and I found a bunch
of old pictures.

483
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,375
They brought back
so many memories

484
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,208
from when we were little.

485
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,375
[HAYAMA]
Be careful up there!

486
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,375
Please don't fall, okay?

487
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,791
Don't worry so much!

488
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,041
You know I'm a
real good climber!

489
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,583
[KOU]
A little further. Almost there!

490
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,958
I've just gotta
catch this butterfly.

491
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,625
Teru's gonna love it!

492
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,333
[KOU screams]

493
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,041
That was kinda dumb

494
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,291
Oh, no! Are you okay?

495
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,458
[KOU]
I don't know if you remember,

496
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,666
but when we were younger,

497
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,708
you used to get sick
and hurt really easily.

498
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,166
[HAYAMA]
Yeah, I know.

499
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,041
I'm pretty healthy now, though.

500
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,083
But you should still
take care of yourself,

501
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,125
and make sure you're getting
lots of vitamins and minerals.

502
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,500
[HAYAMA]
Is that it?

503
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,791
Is that why she's always going
on and on about nutrients?

504
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,291
[KOU]
It's fine!

505
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,541
I'll try to make something
nutritious, and tasty!

506
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,208
[HAYAMA]
Because she's worried about me?

507
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,583
Thanks a lot, Sis.

508
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,416
[HAYAMA]
Kou made these as thanks

509
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,458
for helping us out yesterday.

510
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,375
[KOU]
Homemade rice balls!

511
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,250
Stuffed with liver, white roe,
and bitter melon.

512
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,625
Really?

513
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,500
But what about all the
stuff you bought yesterday?

514
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,541
I'm all about staying healthy,

515
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,541
but this is taking things
a little too far!

516
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,458
[YOKO] I'm sure Hayama's
sister put in a lot of time

517
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,333
and effort into
making these for us.

518
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,958
We owe it to her
to at least eat one.

519
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,333
Here goes!

520
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,208
[FUTABA]
Oh my gosh!

521
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,541
[HAYAMA]
She's choking it down!

522
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,458
[FUTABA] Thanks for taking
one for the team, Yoko!

523
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,208
How could you allow
Miss Yoko to ingest

524
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,125
such a vile thing?!

525
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,666
Uh... You really
don't have to eat it!

526
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,541
Although I gotta admit, your
dedication is very impressive.

527
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,291
[HAYAMA] Stop that!
Don't encourage her!

528
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,250
[YOKO choking]

529
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,666
[KOU] Well, maybe they're
right when they say

530
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,208
nothing good for you is tasty!

531
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,625
[FUTABA]
This must be great for you!

532
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,250
[HAYAMA]
Don't encourage her, either!

533
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,541
[YAMAJI]
Miss Yoko!

534
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,083
[YOKO] Being rich is
not all that wonderful.

535
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,250
But that does not mean
my current life is great.

536
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,541
[FUTABA] You wouldn't
be green after eating

537
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,125
a strange rice ball, either.

538
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,875
[YOKO, FUTABA] But, all of us
being able to eat the rice balls

539
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,291
that Hayama's sister
made for us...

540
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,541
[HAYAMA]
...makes us happy.

541
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,916
[FUTABA] Your real
thoughts are leaking out.

542
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,416
[YAMAJI]
Miss Yoko!
