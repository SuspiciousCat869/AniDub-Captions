1
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:03,442
A way of expressing gratitude.

2
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,233
I can sense that
I am needed elsewhere!

3
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,192
It's my way of repaying you!

4
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,858
Did I really lose?

5
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:10,192
But how many would bind him

6
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:11,650
with a scarf made
with embedded wires?

7
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,650
[snoring]

8
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:14,608
[NISHIYAMA]
She's asleep!

9
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:00,900
Well, I guess it's
finally the season, huh?

10
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:03,150
Yes, it is, isn't it?

11
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:05,108
The season when
it's almost time...

12
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,442
Any month now my heating
bill will finally decrease.

13
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:09,733
Not what I meant!

14
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,067
Just me, or is anyone else

15
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,900
having a bit of a
déjà vu moment?

16
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:14,400
[FUTABA]
It's almost Valentines!

17
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:17,317
That's an extremely
important day, y'know...?

18
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,650
A day meant for
gorging on chocolate!

19
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:22,108
[YOKO] That's not
actually what it's about...

20
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,525
[HAYAMA thinking]
Definitely a déjà vu moment.

21
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:26,608
So, Yoko, what are your plans?

22
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:29,150
Do you think you'll give
chocolate to anyone?

23
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,358
Well, no... I doubt it.

24
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,275
[FUTABA] It doesn't have
to be anything romantic...

25
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:34,400
You can give someone chocolate

26
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,317
just 'cause you're
thankful to them.

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,317
I see. A way of
expressing gratitude.

28
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:51,442
Oh, I just remembered!

29
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,442
Something happened
the other day...

30
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,442
[mewling sounds]

31
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:58,650
Aww... That poor kitty...!

32
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:01,817
I don't think he can
get down all by himself

33
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,692
But... what should I do...?

34
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,108
It's really high up.

35
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:07,108
And I don't know if that
tree will take my weight

36
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:09,317
if I try to climb it.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,025
Still... I need to
rescue it somehow.

38
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:15,650
[YAMAJI] I can sense that
I am urgently needed elsewhere!

39
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,650
I have more important
things to do than this!

40
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,067
[SHINO]
More important than cake?

41
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,358
[YOKO]
He dropped everything...

42
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:24,192
rushed right over to
help me rescue the cat...

43
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:25,317
Wasn't that sweet?

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,942
Huh... That kinda
seems like something

45
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,567
that should've happened to me.

46
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,858
Why is that?

47
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,108
[FUTABA] So, anyway,
what happened to the cat?

48
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,275
We got it down...

49
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:35,192
...but it ran away
before I had the chance

50
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,942
to pet it or anything.

51
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,608
[HAYAMA]
That's how the story ends...?

52
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:40,192
That's all you can offer?

53
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:43,192
Well, forgive me if I
couldn't meet your expectations.

54
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,192
[FUTABA] I wonder if it
will come back to repay you.

55
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,775
The cat, repay me?

56
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:50,692
Yeah, you know,
the thing from stories

57
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,858
where animals repay
people who help them.

58
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,067
I'm not entirely certain
what a grateful kitten

59
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,733
would look like, but it sounds
rather adorable, doesn't it?

60
00:03:57,817 --> 00:03:59,025
[FUTABA]
Well, maybe...

61
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,483
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

62
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:01,733
[FUTABA]
Thanks for the help, human.

63
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,525
I got you some fish.

64
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:05,775
[YOKO]
Er, salmon?

65
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:10,817
[FUTABA]
Thank you for the help.

66
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,317
I got you some money.

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,900
[YOKO]
That's better!

68
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,025
[HAYAMA]
As a sign of my gratitude,

69
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,983
I suppose I will let
you stroke my paw pads

70
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,400
just this once, fortunate human.

71
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,983
[YOKO]
That's all?

72
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,817
[FUTABA] Doesn't sound like a
very grateful cat if you ask me.

73
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,650
Huh?! Where's Yamaji?

74
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,483
Oh. He's probabl--

75
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,067
I am at your service.

76
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,483
[sighs]
I have a request...

77
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,983
Uh. Yes...? Go on...

78
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,817
[HAYAMA] Well...
this might sound... weird...

79
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,317
...but if the kitten comes
back... to repay you...

80
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,900
...do me a favor...? Please...

81
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,233
Capture the moment on this

82
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:51,900
so that it can be
immortalized for all eternity...

83
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,525
[YAMAJI]
I'm not sure I understand.

84
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:55,567
[HAYAMA]
Please, I beg you!

85
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:04,442
[BEL]
Teru. Teru!

86
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,275
Huh?! Bel?!

87
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:19,525
Hey, thanks a lot...!

88
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:21,650
You've been a great human!

89
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,358
I'm thankful to you
for taking me in

90
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:26,858
and looking out for me.
You've been so kind.

91
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:30,025
So, here... Take this...

92
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:33,067
It's my way of repaying you!

93
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,775
That felt like Bel
was saying goodbye

94
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,983
and leaving and
never coming back!

95
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:40,025
Oh, cause of that
story Yoko told us.

96
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:43,983
Still... it was
just a dream, right?

97
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,275
Meow!

98
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:49,400
[HAYAMA]
Oh, um... thanks, Bel.

99
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,025
Yeah, so that was my morning...

100
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,192
Wow.

101
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:56,067
You see, it's just
like the stories say...

102
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,942
Bel repayed you after all.

103
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,733
You're right, thanks.

104
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,150
[HAYAMA] Of course, cats
show love very differently

105
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,525
than humans do.

106
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:06,733
And... I guess your
ability to receive that love

107
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:09,900
is a good measure of
your success as a pet owner.

108
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,358
[FUTABA] Hey, if anyone
knows about pets, it's you!

109
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:14,358
[YOKO]
You're a model pet owner!

110
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,900
Oh come on,
you've gotta be kidding me!

111
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,317
Just because she likes animals

112
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,983
doesn't make her
a good pet owner!

113
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,983
There's more to it than that!

114
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:23,233
I'm sure there is a lot

115
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,942
that you can teach me
in that department...!

116
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:27,358
Your sweet one must have
given you so many gifts.

117
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:29,733
[NISHIYAMA] Uh?!
Of course she has!

118
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:32,525
But the only gift that really
matters to me in the end

119
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,525
is having Eternal by my side...

120
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:37,233
I don't know who could
ask for more than that.

121
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:39,608
Yeah?

122
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,983
Let's all calm down.

123
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,442
Hey, I know!

124
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:48,108
You could have a competition
to see who cats like more.

125
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,400
[FUTABA] You're all
about kitty pictures, right?

126
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,650
So why don't we just agree

127
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:54,067
that whoever takes
the better picture wins?

128
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,650
[HAYAMA]
Come on, Bel... Stay still.

129
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:13,775
Wait...! No...! Hold on...!

130
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,733
We can snuggle later!

131
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,233
My wrists were about to collapse

132
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,942
from holding this
camera for hours

133
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:27,608
and now suddenly,
they feel completely healed!

134
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,608
I worship you, Beelzebub!

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,358
How'm I supposed to pick one
when they're all so cute?!

136
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:43,983
It's freakin' impossible!

137
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,858
[NISHIYAMA]
I brought my picture.

138
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:51,442
[HAYAMA]
Me too. This is my best shot.

139
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:54,108
The three of us will
be in charge of judging.

140
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,067
[FUTABA]
Well, they are cute.

141
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,692
[KONDO]
Yeah they are!

142
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,900
Both kitties are adorable...

143
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,192
but... it's a bit like comparing
two peas from the same pod.

144
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:07,817
[HAYAMA]
Huh?!

145
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,317
What do you mean?

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,025
That obviously isn't true!

147
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,400
I guess Beelzebub
is pretty cute.

148
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:24,233
Eternal is, too,
so I can see why

149
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,525
they'd have a hard time
picking just one of them.

150
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:27,775
D'you think I could keep this?

151
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,650
How about we
just make it a trade?

152
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,275
[FUTABA sighs]
I honestly don't know

153
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:34,233
if I'll ever
understand cat lovers.

154
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,067
Some competition.

155
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,150
That was nothing but a
big waste of time if you ask me.

156
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,858
I got a cute new kitty
picture out of it,

157
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,275
so I'd say it went fine.

158
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,692
Huh?! If it's a competition
you're looking for...

159
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:49,400
Futaba Odagiri!

160
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:50,525
We've got a volunteer.

161
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:51,775
Tsuji alert.

162
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,608
Lemme guess:
you're here to challenge me

163
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,025
to an eating competition...?

164
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,275
Not this time,

165
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:58,692
cause today I'm gonna be
the one challenging you!

166
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,442
What?!

167
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,067
Whaddaya say
to jumbo hamburgers?

168
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,192
[HAJIME]
Uh... You're on!

169
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:14,442
No fair! They wouldn't
even let me sit down!

170
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:15,983
I take it this was
one of the places

171
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,692
that had the good
sense to ban you?

172
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,192
That's the reason?!

173
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:22,358
You had actually forgotten that?

174
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:25,483
[HAJIME] Ha ha ha! They let
me in no questions asked...

175
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:28,150
I believe that would make
me the winner by default.

176
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,317
[gasps]

177
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,150
[HAJIME]
Tsuji 1... Odagiri zero!

178
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:36,942
Ha ha! You suck! Woo-hoo!

179
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:38,983
Hehe! Woo-hoo...! Boo-ya!

180
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,233
Did... I really lose?

181
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,317
[HAYAMA]
I'm not so sure.

182
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,067
Let's think about
this for a second.

183
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,025
[gasps]
Hey, you're right, Hayama...!

184
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,317
They wouldn't let me in

185
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,775
because I'm a bigger
threat to them than he is,

186
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,067
and therefore that makes me
the winner by default...!

187
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,275
Stop dancing, you little monkey!

188
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:58,650
So... I suppose some
congratulations are in order?

189
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,108
I recognize you...
What's your name again...?

190
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:04,150
Errrr... Nishi-something?

191
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:05,942
I don't understand
how you would know my name.

192
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:08,025
[HAYAMA] Technically,
he only knows half of it.

193
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,275
It's "Nishikawa"...!
To you that's Miss Nishikawa...

194
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:12,858
Never forget to
use the honorific...!

195
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:14,358
You'd better learn
to show some respect

196
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:15,692
to your superiors, boy!

197
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:18,192
Yamaji...! Be quiet right now!

198
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:22,858
Huh? That is a cool trick...
Just like Sasame told me about.

199
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:24,983
Right... you know
her from your sister.

200
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,442
Yup...

201
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,525
She told me that you're one
of her friends from class.

202
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,942
Me?!

203
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:31,317
[HAJIME] Well, anyway,
thanks for looking out for her.

204
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,108
She can be kinda
fragile sometimes.

205
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:36,733
Oh...! Well,
I don't think... Uh...

206
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:39,733
I'm happy she thinks
of me as a friend.

207
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:43,192
[YAMAJI gasps and thinks]
That smile! I may go blind!

208
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,108
[HAJIME]
Sasame!

209
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:49,233
Guess what...!
I won against Odagiri.

210
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,442
I wouldn't call that winning...

211
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:55,275
You can't win if the other
person doesn't enter the fight.

212
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:57,525
Yuh-huh...!
There were witnesses;

213
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,608
that friend of yours
even congratulated me...

214
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,483
You know... that girl...

215
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:07,442
Nishi... hara...? Kawa...?
Something like that.

216
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,192
It's Yoko Nishikawa.

217
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,067
That's it, she's
the one I talked to...!

218
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,775
Don't worry,
I was totally polite

219
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:14,817
and told her thanks for
looking out for my sister.

220
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,692
[SASAME]
What?!

221
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,192
Sounds pretty mature, huh...?

222
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,817
Yep... Just like a
big brother should be.

223
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,483
You are you such an idiot!

224
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,233
Jeez...! How could
you say something

225
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,733
so embarrassing like that...?

226
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,442
I bet you made her feel super
awkward and uncomfortable.

227
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,983
Think it's a normal thing
to say for most people.

228
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,567
[SASAME] Maybe if we'd been
friends for a really long time.

229
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,942
It's not like Nishikawa and I
are childhood friends,

230
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,692
so we're not nearly
that close yet.

231
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:37,442
[HAJIME]
Really?

232
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,775
Idiot...! I hate you!

233
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:42,108
She's going to think
I'm a total loser now!

234
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:45,608
I don't get why it's such
a big deal. Just calm down!

235
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,233
[SAKURA]
Help me here, I need ideas.

236
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,150
When I give him the
chocolates, I want it to be

237
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:56,108
the most memorable experience
that he's ever had!

238
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,858
Not asking for much, are ya?

239
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,567
I wonder how much
chocolate I can buy

240
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,775
with my allowance this year.

241
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:02,358
I've been dreaming
about this for months.

242
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:04,817
[SAKURA] Hello, we're
talking about me, not you!

243
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,692
I think if you
knitted him a scarf

244
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:08,150
and made some
chocolates from scratch,

245
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:09,442
that would be pretty impressive.

246
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,817
[FUTABA] Really?
Don't plenty of people do that?

247
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,067
[HAYAMA]
Sure.

248
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,775
But how many would
bind him with a scarf made

249
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:17,067
with embedded wires and then
force-feed him chocolates

250
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,525
drugged with an exceptionally
powerful aphrodisiac?

251
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,233
You're my hero!

252
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:23,317
They aren't serious, are they?

253
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,483
[SAKURA]
I have to get going.

254
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,983
There are a lot of
preparations to make!

255
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:28,400
[HAYAMA]
Careful walking home!

256
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,317
I'm off to trap my man!

257
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:34,567
[YAMAJI] That sounds
like quite an elaborate plan.

258
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,567
I'm sure that the young
master will be surprised...

259
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,608
He's in for a
lovely Valentine's.

260
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,983
And... I have
also been thinking...

261
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:42,942
Hmm?

262
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,317
This Valentine's...

263
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,817
I believe I would like
to make chocolates as well.

264
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,525
Sorry could you
say that again...?

265
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,817
My hearing seems
to be a little bit off.

266
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,983
I said chocolates...!

267
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,733
I want to attempt
making chocolates.

268
00:12:57,817 --> 00:12:59,275
Ah, I think I understand now.

269
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,733
You wish to stockpile it
for emergency rations.

270
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:04,358
[YOKO]
No, for Valentine's!

271
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:07,442
And may I ask who will be the
recipient of said chocolates?

272
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,900
There's my friends, of
course, and I'd like to send

273
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:11,983
a whole mountain of
them to my father, too.

274
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:14,567
What were we
talking about again?

275
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,692
[YOKO]
Valentine's!

276
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,150
Guess what...?

277
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,858
I've decided that I am going
to try to make chocolates!

278
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:22,483
Good... This time of year
is as busy as Christmas,

279
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,275
so I'll gladly take
all the help I can get,

280
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:25,983
even if it comes from you.

281
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,692
I didn't mean make
them for the shop...!

282
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,233
I want to create
delicious chocolates

283
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:31,608
and give them to the people
in my life I'm thankful for.

284
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:34,858
It won't interfere with
my duties here, I promise

285
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:37,900
[SHINO thinking] Miss Yoko
making chocolates from scratch?

286
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,150
She'll start out
energetically enough.

287
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,692
But disaster will strike,

288
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,108
and she'll wind up
exhausting herself.

289
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:46,733
Then she'll end up sick
in bed, unable to work,

290
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,358
and I'll be understaffed at
the busiest time of the year!

291
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:50,692
It's horrible!

292
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,358
[SHINO]
That's my situation.

293
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:57,108
Please, say you'll help...!
I'll be lost without you!

294
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:58,317
No way!

295
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,150
And I don't see why
you want me so badly...

296
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,108
Can't you just
ask somebody else?

297
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:03,525
I feel like you're
the perfect person

298
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:04,858
for the job, that's all.

299
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,067
[NISHIYAMA]
Why?!

300
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,817
Because I'm assuming
you don't have any plans

301
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,775
for valentine's day.

302
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:11,483
Now you're insulting me?

303
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,483
[YOKO]
What are you doing here, Sonobe?

304
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:14,650
[SHINO]
I was asking Nishiyama

305
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,233
if she would give me
a hand at the shop.

306
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:18,942
Ooh, pick me! I can help.
I know how to do everything,

307
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,358
and you won't have
to pay me, either.

308
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,900
You can compensate
me with cakes.

309
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,775
If I do that, there
won't be any more goods

310
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,192
to sell to the customers,
so I have to pay you

311
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:29,442
Fine... suit yourself.

312
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,442
[SHINO] I would
appreciate your help, too.

313
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,400
[HAYAMA] I'm willing to do it
as long as I don't have to wear

314
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,067
that maid getup.

315
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,483
Well... I don't know, I mean,

316
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:37,942
it's kinda like a "my house,
my rules" situation...

317
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,442
[HAYAMA]
I can't hear you!

318
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:49,775
All right...!

319
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,692
Is everybody ready
to sell some cake?

320
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:52,525
Yes!

321
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,858
[SHINO]
Please, Miss Yoko,

322
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:56,358
I really think you should
conserve your strength.

323
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:59,275
[HAYAMA]
Hey! I thought we had a deal...!

324
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,483
Why am I wearing this?

325
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,692
[SHINO] Oh, good...
It fits you perfectly.

326
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:05,400
[HAYAMA] This is a direct
violation of our agreement!

327
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:07,233
[SHINO] As I recall,
you said you did not wish

328
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:08,483
to wear this maid outfit,

329
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:11,400
and so I made
you a different one.

330
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,525
[FUTABA]
Calm down, it looks good on you!

331
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,025
[YOKO]
Lovely...

332
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,692
I had really hoped
that I would be able

333
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:18,483
to make some for
the two of you, as well...

334
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,108
...but I just
didn't have the time.

335
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:21,150
I didn't know getting ready

336
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,067
for Valentine's Day
was so intense.

337
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,775
I stayed up
forty-eight hours straight

338
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,192
trying to make Hayama's
new outfit for the occasion.

339
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:28,900
Ugh! That's your fault!

340
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,650
Thank you for waiting.

341
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,108
As you can see,
we are quite crowded today,

342
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:37,858
but I promise we will help
everyone as quickly as we can.

343
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:39,317
[NISHIYAMA]
Welcome to Secret Garden...!

344
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,900
Please decide what
you would like to order,

345
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,942
and I'll be happy to ring you up
right here once you're ready.

346
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:46,358
Ugh! I still don't get
why she made me come!

347
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:48,525
We're gonna need
all hands on deck today...

348
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:50,067
Just look at how busy it is.

349
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,192
Where's that other guy...?

350
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,817
You know,
the creepy butler dude.

351
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,192
[YAMAJI]
Sorry, I can't help right now.

352
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:57,942
I'm busy making this special
chocolate cake for Miss Yoko,

353
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,067
and I don't know how
much longer it's going to take.

354
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,900
That can wait 'til later...
Tell him, Sonobe!

355
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:09,608
[snoring]

356
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:10,858
[NISHIYAMA]
She's asleep!

357
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,358
[FUTABA] She has been up
for two days straight.

358
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:13,483
We need her help.

359
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,317
How can she sleep
when it's this busy?

360
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,525
[FUTABA]
It'll be alright...

361
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,900
With you here, I'm sure
we can pull through!

362
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,983
Absolutely! Let's get to it!

363
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,817
Welcome to Secret Garden!

364
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,608
[FUTABA]
It's almost too easy.

365
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,483
[YOKO]
Thanks for your patience.

366
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,275
I'm sorry for the wait!

367
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:37,150
Don't worry... I expected you
to be busy... It's Valentine's!

368
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:40,150
[gasps]
That's so kind!

369
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,025
Awwww...

370
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:44,900
Man... I'm getting tired.

371
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,942
Sonobe! We need you to wake up!

372
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,400
Come on! Sonobe...!

373
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:50,983
What's the matter, Hayama?

374
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:53,650
Running out of steam already...?
It's a little early for that.

375
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,567
If only I were
as tireless as you.

376
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,817
Too bad...!
I've got hours left in me!

377
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,317
[HAYAMA]
Well, in that case...

378
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,900
...I'm sure you won't mind
if I just take a quick break.

379
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:04,650
Wha--!

380
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,900
Excuse me.

381
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,275
Sorry, how can I help you?

382
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:11,275
Thanks, Nishiyama. I know
I can always count on you!

383
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,942
[YOKO thinking] She could make
life a lot easier on herself.

384
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:18,317
Thank you very much,
and have a nice day!

385
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,067
One limited edition
Gâteau Chocolat, please.

386
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,442
Sure, one Gâteau Chocolat
coming right up!

387
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,567
It's the Tsuji twins again...!
What are you doing here?

388
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,358
Stop looking at me like that...!

389
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:31,192
Guys can buy cakes on
Valentine's Day too, y'know.

390
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:33,483
Of course they can!
It's totally no big deal!

391
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,817
There are lots of special,
limited edition items

392
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,275
during Valentine's
and Christmas.

393
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:41,150
He saves up money especially
for this time of year.

394
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,775
I know it's no big deal,
but it's still a bit unusual;

395
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:45,942
I bet you get weird
looks from some people.

396
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,275
[HAJIME]
I don't care...

397
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,733
I get plenty of chocolate
from girls at school,

398
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,108
so it's not like
I'm really worried

399
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:51,817
about my reputation or anything.

400
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,608
Wow... seriously?

401
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,108
That's right...

402
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:57,358
I don't know why you look so
surprised that he's popular.

403
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:58,525
Yeah, and you know,

404
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:00,192
I'm even the mascot
for my school club.

405
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:01,983
How cool is that?

406
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,358
Way cool...

407
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:09,858
[NISHIYAMA]
Thank you so much for coming...

408
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,400
I hope we'll see you again soon!

409
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,400
[KONDO]
Hey there!

410
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:22,108
Sorry, but I just
couldn't pass up

411
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:23,692
the chance to see
you hard at work!

412
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,983
Sounds like a waste of time
to me, but suit yourself.

413
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,567
[SHINO] You could
start working here, too.

414
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,608
I'm sure I could find
a position for you.

415
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,858
[NISHIYAMA]
She's awake?!

416
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:35,442
Oh... that's not really
my thing, but thank you.

417
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:36,900
[NISHIYAMA thinking]
What's not her thing?

418
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,483

Goodbye! Thanks for coming!

419

[SHINO]
Listen.

420
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:44,942
I want to thank all
of you very much

421
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,317
for your hard work today...

422
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,525
I would have been completely
lost without your help.

423
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:49,775
The best part of it is,

424
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:52,275
after that nap I feel
about ten years younger!

425
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,108
[YOKO grunts]
Sonobe...! I could kill you!

426
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:04,650
[sighs]

427
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,650
Yesterday was exhausting, huh?

428
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,567
Yknow, after seeing
you in that maid outfit

429
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,358
I kinda wanna try one myself...

430
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,275
Maybe I should ask Sonobe
if she would make one for me.

431
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,275
That isn't gonna work.

432
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:16,817
Yoko said she only seems to like

433
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,400
making people wear them
if they don't actually want to,

434
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:20,942
which isn't too surprising.

435
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,483
Yeah... sounds like her...

436
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:26,150
I guess that's why
Nishiyama's a maid, too.

437
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,400
[GIRL STUDENT 11A]
Nishiyama... a maid...?

438
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:28,858
There's no way.

439
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:30,900
It was the uniform that she
asked me to wear, okay...?

440
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:33,358
She didn't have anything
else so what could I do?

441
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:36,900
I... I wasn't wearing
it because I wanted to!

442
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:38,650
Sure... of course not.

443
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,775
It's true, whether
you believe it or not.

444
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,983
I never want to wear
that outfit again...

445
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,650
Really, I would rather die.
It was totally hideous.

446
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,900
Yeah, I completely
agree...! I mean,

447
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:51,067
it fit you well enough, but it
wasn't exactly flattering.

448
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,150
It might work for someone else,

449
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,692
but you looked so
uncomfortable...

450
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,900
...that's probably the reason

451
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:57,025
you always pick such
boring outfits. Right?

452
00:19:57,108 --> 00:20:00,150
Well, I don't know if I would
call my clothes boring, but--

453
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,067
Uh...

454
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,275
I dunno, I actually thought
it looked pretty cute on you.

455
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:08,858
Uh?! Uh... You're
always making fun of me!

456
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,817
Ahh... Nishiyama!

457
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,317
I was being serious,
why'd she get mad?

458
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,858
I don't think you can blame her
for being a little suspicious.

459
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,900
It was so nice of you to
help out in the shop yesterday.

460
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,400
And I... I wanted
to say thank you...

For that and for
everything else you do.

Here!

463
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:35,775
I'd been hoping someone'd
give me a bag of rocks.

00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:39,192
They're Valentine's Day truffles

00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:47,108
Homemade truffles.
That's pretty ambitious.

469
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:57,400
[FUTABA] They're not
what I'd call "melty,"

470
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:58,650
but they're edible.

471
00:20:58,733 --> 00:20:59,900
There, you see...!

472
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:02,025
I can make some things
if I put my mind to it.

473
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,192
Well done, Yoko...
Quite impressive!

474
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:10,942
[HAYAMA]
Is it melting at all?

475
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:12,400
No, Not so far.

476
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,317
[YOKO]
Oh, Tsuji!

477
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Huh?

478
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,108
I have a little
something... For you.

479
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:22,025
What?! Chocolates...?
Are they really for me?

480
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:25,733
Yes... I hope you like them.

481
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,233
[SASAME thinking]
Nishikawa gave me chocolates?

482
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:29,275
What should
I give her in return?

483
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,650
I-I-I I don't know
how to thank her...

484
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,983
What would be appropriate?

485
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:37,442
[SASAME thinking]
Something really awesome...

486
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:41,525
Like a puppy... or a car...
or a house, maybe?!

487
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:43,400
Yamaji... I made these for you.

488
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:44,608
What...?!

489
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:47,025
A beautiful girl made
chocolates for me?!

490
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:48,817
Thank you so very much...!

491
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,733
I will put these on the
family altar immediately!

492
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:53,317
Or maybe you
could just eat them...

493
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,900
There should be
a big batch of them

494
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:56,608
arriving for father
today, as well...

495
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,192
So I guess all of my
Valentine's work is done!

496
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,483
[SHINO thinking]
What? That's it...?

497
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,608
That's all of them?

498
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,108
[SHINO thinking]
What about me?

499
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:09,025
I don't get any
Valentine's Day chocolates?

500
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:10,692
Miss Yoko?!

501
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,775
[YOKO] The next
"Three Leaves, Three Colors"

502
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:52,983
is the last episode!

503
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:55,692
[HAYAMA] Let's have
Miss Yoko say the title.

504
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,067
[YOKO]
Okay, I will.

505
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,733
Next time is, "I Am
Graduating from Bread Crusts."

506
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:01,275
I hope you enjoy it.

507
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,608
[FUTABA]
Well, that's not happening.

508
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:03,442
[HAYAMA]
Nope.

509
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,900
[YOKO]
It will!
