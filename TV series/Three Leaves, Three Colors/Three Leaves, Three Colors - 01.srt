1
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,333
[YOKO] It's not because nobody
else was willing to eat with me,

2
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,333
all right?

3
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,666
[FUTABA] 
We didn't think it was.

4
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,166
Wait, hold on. Do you not
have any friends at all?

5
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,625
[YOKO]
Are you always this direct?

6
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,166
The poor thing was
crying pretty hard

7
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,416
by the time it was over, though.

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,458
I wonder if it was
something I said.

9
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,041
[STUDENT 1A]
I'm starving!

10
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,541
Can we eat already?

11
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,041
[STUDENT 1B]
Sorry I'm late!

12
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,125
[STUDENT 1E]
I swear, it's true!

13
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,083
[STUDENTS laughing]

14
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,083
[STUDENT 1H]
Did he really say that?

15
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,000
[STUDENT 1I]
Yep, word for word!

16
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,000
[STUDENT 1H]
Wow, that's hilarious!

17
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,583
What'd you tell him?

18
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,583
[HAYAMA]
Oh, no, I don't mind at all.

19
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,416
I just want to do the best
I can as class representative.

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,916
[STUDENTS chattering]

21
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,000
[STUDENT 1M]
Slow down. Wait for me!

22
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,000
[STUDENT 1L]
C'mon, just hurry up!

23
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:49,708
[HAYAMA]
Huh?

24
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,041
[CAT meows]

25
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,125
[HAYAMA squeals]

26
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,791
[FUTABA] Move, people!
Out of the way!

27
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,458
Whoops, sorry! Coming through!

28
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,708
Ugh! I'm so hungry!

29
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,125
If I don't eat soon,
I'm gonna pass out.

30
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,041
And then I'll miss
my next class!

31
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,583
[laughs] I'll just
have to get creative.

32
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,333
There has gotta be a shortcut
around here I can take.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,541
[HAYAMA laughing]

34
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,791
[FUTABA, HAYAMA gasp]

35
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,333
Excuse you!

36
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,916
Hey, hey, hey!
What are those you're eating?

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,708
Well, what do they look like?

38
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,541
These are bread crusts,
thank you!

39
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,541
[HAYAMA]
Wow, pig out much?

40
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,125
That's a lot of food!

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,458
[FUTABA]
It's not that much!

42
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,291
I'm actually being kind
of restrained today.

43
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,708
Oh yeah?

44
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,250
[FUTABA] Personally, I wonder
how you can eat so little.

45
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,541
Is that really enough to keep
you going all day long?

46
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,208
[HAYAMA] My body is just
more efficient than yours.

47
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,541
I don't need all this.
Do you want some?

48
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,541
Yeah, I do! Woo-hoo!

49
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,041
You can have some too,
if you want.

50
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,041
What's the matter with you?
Don't you have any manners?

51
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't recall asking either
of you to join me for lunch.

52
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,166
Honestly, how rude!

53
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,291
Ah! That was amazing!

54
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,750
Oh, come on,
say it again!

55
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,375
Please? You sound like
a perfect little rich girl!

56
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,916
[FUTABA laughing]

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,958
Easy, now.
Practice restraint, remember?

58
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,166
[YOKO]
Are you joking?

59
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,583
I don't even know how
to respond to that!

60
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,291
Guess we are being rude.

61
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,041
We haven't even introduced
ourselves yet, have we?

62
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,583
My name is Hayama.

63
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm doing Class 3 the favor
of being their representative.

64
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,833
Is that so? Lucky them.

65
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,208
And this is Futaba Odagiri,
Class 3's glutton.

66
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,708
How's it goin'?

67
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,750
Well it's a pleasure
to meet you.

68
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,166
My name is Yoko Nishikawa,
and I'm in Class 2.

69
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,208
Yeah, we know.

70
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,875
Everyone here does.
You're famous.

71
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,250
[YOKO gasps]
Famous?

72
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,958
So... I may have told someone to
keep their filthy hands off me,

73
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,458
but last I checked
it wasn't a crime

74
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,958
to value one's personal space!

75
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,333
Actually, that's the first time
I've heard this story.

76
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,333
And however it looks,

77
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,875
I'm eating alone
because I want to.

78
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,041
It's not because nobody else
was willing to eat with me,

79
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:18,916
all right?

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,583
Okay. We didn't think it was.

81
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,666
Wait, hold on.

82
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,958
Do you not have
any friends at all?

83
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,208
[YOKO]
Are you always this direct?

84
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,625
I don't have much in common
with the other students.

85
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,208
We're just too different.

86
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,541
How can I talk to anybody if I
don't know what to talk about?

87
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,333
[laughs] It can't be that hard.

88
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,833
We're talking
just fine right now.

89
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,041
[FUTABA]
Uh-huh.

90
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,333
That breeze...
This is really great.

91
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,500
I'd forgotten how lovely
it can be to eat outside.

92
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,125
Well, maybe--

93
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,250
--[bell rings]
--Oh, there goes the bell.

94
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,375
Oh no!

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,541
[FUTABA]
Okay, all done!

96
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,625
See you around, Yoko!

97
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,958
[HAYAMA]
Catch you later!

98
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,791
Oh. Yeah. All right.

99
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,125
Hey, just so you know,
bread crusts are really yummy

100
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,708
when you deep fry 'em and
sprinkle some sugar on top.

101
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,375
You just fry them in oil?

102
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,875
And add sugar?

103
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,083
I never thought of that.

104
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,291
Could you write
down the recipe--

105
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,875
[FUTABA]
Sorry, we gotta get going!

106
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,083
[HAYAMA] Our teacher gets super
angry whenever people are late!

107
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,583
--English is next.
--[STUDENT 1T] Yup.

108
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,500
How was the homework?
Did you get it done?

109
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,666
[YOKO]
Those girls were so strange.

110
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm not sure what
to make of them.

111
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,083
But still...

112
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,916
They were nice enough
in their own way, I suppose.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,416
And that was the first time
I haven't eaten lunch alone

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,541
since I came to this school.

115
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,125
[YOKO]
Class 3. So this is theirs.

116
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,208
I could barely
keep my eyes open.

117
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,541
Yeah, I hear you.

118
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,416
[STUDENT 1W]
Is that Nishikawa?

119
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,791
[STUDENT 1V]
What's wrong with her?

120
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,083
[YOKO sighs] I'm so glad I
made it before the sale ended.

121
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,583
Look at all this food!

122
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,625
Hey. Just so you know,

123
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,500
bread crusts are really yummy
when you deep fry them

124
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,416
and sprinkle some sugar on top.

125
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,541
[YOKO]
Let's see...

126
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,125
I'll need oil, and
hopefully I have some sugar.

127
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,916
[bell ringing]

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,083
[FUTABA]
Finally, lunchtime!

129
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,708
I thought I was gonna starve!

130
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,083
Watch yourself!

131
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,958
I think being class rep
is going to your head.

132
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,416
Sorry, Nishiyama.
I don't know what you mean.

133
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,666
Yes, you do.

134
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,208
Or did you forget about
how you badmouthed Kondo

135
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,375
to the teacher yesterday?

136
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,000
There must be
a misunderstanding.

137
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,166
All I did was deliver
the printouts he wanted.

138
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,458
I'm not exactly sure why
Kondo didn't do it,

139
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,708
since she was the one on duty.

140
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,000
[laughs nervously]

141
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,375
Well... that doesn't matter.

142
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,083
I still think we should settle
this with a little private chat.

143
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,666
Follow me.

144
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,250
[HAYAMA]
Sure, if that's what you want.

145
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,708
Try not to be
too hard on her.

146
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,625
Whatever. I don't take
orders from you, okay?

147
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,333
[FUTABA] Um... I was
actually talking to Hayama,

148
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,500
but never mind.

149
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,791
[HAYAMA laughs]

150
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,500
[YOKO]
It was a bit of a challenge,

151
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,000
but I hope they like it!

152
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,625
[YOKO shrieks]

153
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,875
I'm here! And I
brought a surprise.

154
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,458
Well, it's not like we
actually agreed to meet again.

155
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,666
And now I can go back
to enjoying a solitary meal,

156
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,416
just like before.

157
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,541
I like it this way. Really.

158
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,416
[rustling]

159
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,791
[FUTABA]
That was a stupid way to go.

160
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,875
I'm all scratched up!

161
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,166
What a surprise. It's you.

162
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,666
You're the one who
insisted we take a shortcut.

163
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,625
Well I didn't want to keep
Yoko waiting for too long.

164
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,833
I thought you'd
forgotten about me.

Did you have to wait long?

166
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,958
[HAYAMA]
I'm so sorry.

167
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,708
Yes. It's been five minutes!

168
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,500
I hope you have a valid excuse!

169
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,875
I do, actually.

170
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,000
Someone decided they
wanted to pick a fight with me.

00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,875
What? Oh no!
Are you all right?

172
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,958
Yep!

173
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,291
The poor thing was
crying pretty hard

174
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,541
by the time it was over though.

175
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,333
I wonder if it
was something I said.

[FUTABA]
Trust me on this.

177

It's best not to ask.

Huh? Who's in there?

00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,500
I bet it's some freaky stalker.

181

They go around hiding
in bushes, right?

[YOKO]
I do. He's my former servant.

[YAMAJI] Please,
forgive me for intruding!

Okay...

189
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,500
Calm down. Explain yourself.

190
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,500
[YAMAJI] I'm sorry, but I had to
know for sure what I'd seen.

191
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,708
Was yesterday's encounter
fleeting or would it endure?

192
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,000
So you were in the
bushes yesterday too?

193
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,250
Yes, and I admit I was
shocked by what I saw.

194
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,041
I was convinced that
it would take a miracle

195
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,958
for Miss Yoko to make friends.

196
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,291
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?

197
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,125
[YAMAJI] With your family
company's bankruptcy,

198
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,250
you're a shadow of the rich
young lady you once were!

199
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,458
Even so, your upbringing
makes it difficult

200
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,291
for you to forsake the
upper-class attitudes

201
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,833
you've embraced all your life.

202
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,750
So for you to befriend
the everyday folk

203
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,291
who attend your new school...

204
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,125
It must surely be a miracle!

205
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,125
Wow...

206
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,500
It's not like that at all.

207
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,708
Yamaji, you're
obviously exaggerating!

208
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,958
[YAMAJI]
I beg you!

209
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,375
Look after Miss Yoko as
she starts her new life!

210
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,583
Be her true friends!

211

Boy, that was fascinating!

Should we eat?

213
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:45,666
But I...

214
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,958
You know I'm down.

215
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,208
Listen, I can explain.

216
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,291
What Yamaji said
may be partially true.

[HAYAMA]
It's so nice out today.

Surrounded by nature.

219
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,750
Are you ignoring me?

220
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,208
Oh. I was right!

221
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,166
I knew you would never really
be able to make friends!

222
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,041
--That's enough, Yamaji!

Honestly!

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,916
Must they insist on
making all this noise?

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,166
I mean, we are here
to learn, aren't we?

228
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,750
But it's impossible with
all this constant chatter.

229
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,416
I couldn't imagine
trying to make friends

230
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,791
with girls like these.

231

So loud and unladylike.

Hey, over here, Yoko!

What's up?

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,750
Oh, hi!
What are you doing here?

235
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,333
Ugh! Think we could
take it down a notch?

[YOKO] What did you
want to talk to me about?

I need a favor.

238
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,125
I sorta left my
math book at home.

239
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,375
Maybe you could
let me borrow yours?

240
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,458
I do wish I could help,

241
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,375
but my class doesn't
have math today,

242
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,458
so I didn't bring it.

Really? That's too bad!

I'm sorry! Forgive me!

I promise, if my means
weren't so badly diminished,

246
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,666
I would have a servant
fetch it for you.

not that big a deal.

No, no! It's my bad for
not bringing it with me.

Not having her book
isn't going to make

that big of a difference
to Little Miss ADD

255

when you're being mean,

or do you just talk
before you think?

telling the truth.

This is called bread.

I know what bread is.

265
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,500
What I don't get is why
you're eating a whole loaf.

Are you having bread
crusts again today?

Yeah! You can get
so many of them

When I first saw
these in the store,

too good to be true.

something to solve that problem.

You know if you keep trespassing
on school grounds like this

00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,458
I'll have to call the police.

Oh, I'm not trespassing.

I'm in charge of refilling

That's basically the definition!

When he passed away,
I took over for him,

and then the company
went bankrupt.

So taking care of her
is my family's legacy.

00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,833
a lot of money to spare.

319
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,166
Truly, I don't know
what's the matter with him.

320
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,833
Does he really think
I want all this stuff?

321
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,125
Well, he couldn't be
more wrong about that!

322
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,416
Hey, you're kinda glowing.

323
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,541
[YOKO] Every time I start
to feel more at ease,

324
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,833
Yamaji shows up
and humiliates me.

325
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,750
I've finally made
some friends here.

326
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,375
I don't want anything
to scare them away!

327
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,500
[YAMAJI]
Here you go.

328
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,416
Today's expired
vending machine goods.

329
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,666
They're all yours.

330
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,708
[YOKO] Couldn't he at least find
a more private time to do this?

331
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,708
Fine! If you insist,
I'll take them

332
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,708
Excellent. I'm off then. Bye!

333
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,708
[YOKO]
Stay calm, Yoko, stay calm.

334
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,125
No matter what you see,
don't squeal with delight.

335
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,208
They'll think you
have no self-control.

336
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,750
[YOKO squeals]
Do you see that? It's cheese!

337
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:28,958
Wow, that's exciting.

338
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,458
I'm happy for you.

339
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,666
Yeah, cheese is healthier
than a lot of that other stuff.

340
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,333
[HAYAMA]
I've got a question.

341
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,875
If you had to eat one food every
day, what would you choose?

342
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,791
White rice.

343
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,500
I'd assumed you
would say bread.

344
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,958
I guess I kinda consider
bread more like a snack.

345
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,208
Rice is good 'cause it goes
with just about anything.

346
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,458
Then why don't you pack
something with rice?

347
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,500
I don't have enough time
for that in the morning.

348
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,041
Okay, What's your favorite?

349
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,750
Me? Oh, that's easy!

350
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:59,500
I... love... mille-feuille!

351
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,958
[HAYAMA] Ugh! Fine!
It's salty fish paste.

352
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,166
You got a problem with that?

353
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,375
No. No problem at all.

354
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,666
Oh! Yeah, that
stuff is delicious.

355
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,791
It goes really well with rice!

356
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,916
What about you, Yoko?

357
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,375
I bet it's cheese.

358
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,291
[YOKO]
I need to be careful.

359
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,583
I have to choose an answer
they won't think is strange.

360
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,875
Something pedestrian.

361
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,833
Something regular people like.

362
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,416
Flan's delicious,
don't you think?

363
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,583
Ew, no way!

364
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,375
But flan would be
totally gross with rice!

365
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,833
Does that matter?

366
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,541
[YOKO] Is that what
normal people like?

367
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,541
Foods that pair well with rice?

368
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,541
I need to try a
different answer.

369
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,708
Uh... pink codfish
flakes sure are tasty.

370
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,416
[FUTABA]
Codfish flakes?

371
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,666
I know! Mayonnaise!

372
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,666
Well, at least that
sounds more like the truth.

373
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,833
Don't take this the wrong way,

374
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,416
but are you sure
you used to be rich?

375
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,291
Well, I uh...

376
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,375
[YOKO]
It's hopeless.

377
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,291
I can't seem to say
the right thing.

378
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,750
What if they start to hate me?
I'll have to eat alone again.

379
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,208
[rice cooker beeping]

380
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,916
[YOKO] I shouldn't worry.
It'll be fine.

381
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,625
[YOKO] After all,
They were impressed with

382
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,125
the fried bread crusts.

383
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,208
I'm sure they'll like these too.

384
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,583
Come on, ladies!
Aren't you ready for lunch?

385
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,375
I have a surprise for you!

386
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,041
Presenting my very
first batch of rice balls.

387
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,791
[BOTH]
Whoa!

388
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,750
[FUTABA] I thought she lived
on a diet of bread crusts.

389
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,625
Who knew all this time
I've had hidden culinary skills?

390
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,958
I can't make 'em.

391
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,833
I'm impressed you were
able to learn so quickly.

392
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,875
It was simple,
and there're plenty here,

393
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,916
so feel free to dig in!

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,500
Do you think she means
balls of just rice?

395
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,291
No. No way.

396
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,208
Those look like plain
balls of rice to me.

397
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,000
You mentioned yesterday
how much you loved it,

398
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,791
so I thought these
would be perfect.

399
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,916
That's true.
Rice is my favorite.

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,750
What I like most about it
is how versatile it is.

401
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,666
Like how rice balls can have
so many different fillings.

402
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,083
I didn't realize they were
supposed to have filling.

403
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,250
Really?

404
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,916
I thought about adding
salted fish paste,

405
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,458
since Hayama likes it so much,
but it was expensive.

406
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,041
You were gonna do that
just for me?

407
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,583
That would have been an
interesting choice, all right.

408
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,125
The trickiest part
about making them

409
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,166
is getting the
perfect salt level.

410
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,000
[YOKO gasps]
The salt!

411
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,416
I was afraid I'd
forgotten something!

412
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,291
[YOKO]
Oh no. I did it again.

413
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,125
I made a fool of myself.

414
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,583
I thought I was making
something really special.

415
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,208
Stupid Yoko.

416
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,583
[FUTABA]
Are we gonna eat or not?

417
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,208
Thanks for cooking.
That was sweet of you.

418
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,166
[FUTABA]
Mind if I have another one?

419
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,375
You don't have to.

420
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,875
Please don't eat them
just to make me feel better.

421
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,083
Hey, I told you
rice is my favorite!

422
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,375
Well, in that case...
Have as much as you want!

423
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,250
[stomach growls]

424
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,916
[laughing]

425
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
[FUTABA]
Come on, Yoko!

426
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,375
It sounds like you
need to eat, too.

427
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,833
[HAYAMA] Would you like one
of my Vienna sausages?

428
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,708
[YOKO] Thank you,
that sounds wonderful!

429
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,291
[FUTABA] Just one more,
then I'll stop!

430
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,333
[HAYAMA snorts, laughs] 

431
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,875
[YOKO] You don't have to
do anything to thank me

432
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,916
for cooking.

433
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,750
I was happy to do it.
I wanted to.

434
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,875
Because we're friends.

435
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,166
Don't be so shy.
Not around us.

436
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,916
Loosen up, since we're
friends and all!

437
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,250
If it makes you feel better,
they were free tickets.

438
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,333
I kinda have something of a hook
up for random stuff like this.

439
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,500
Here we are!

440
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,541
[YOKO]
A bathhouse!

441
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,166
[ALL]
Ahh!

442
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,375
Nothing like a nice
hot bath to ease the mind

443
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,916
and relax the body.

444
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,875
I hear ya.
And it smells wonderful.

445
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,708
This is absolutely amazing!

446
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,208
I can barely remember
the last time I had a bath

447
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,458
that was this luxurious!

448
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,708
Wait!

449
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,208
It must take a lot of
energy to heat enough water

450
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,708
for a bath this big.

451
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,708
I can't even imagine how high
the utility bills must be!

452
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,750
Relax already!

453
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,708
[YOKO]
I lost it a little. Sorry.

454
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,750
[HAYAMA, FUTABA laugh]

455
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,166
[YAMAJI]
A little spa time!

456
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,333
If that's not girl bonding,
than I don't know what is!

457
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,041
I was worried, but
it looks like Miss Yoko

458
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,375
will be okay.

459
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,208
I think it might be
time for you to get out.

460
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,375
[YOKO] But it was so kind
of Hayama to bring me here.

461
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,458
I don't want to waste it.

462
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,458
Don't worry about it!

463
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,958
It was free, remember?

464
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,708
I should stay an hour longer.

465
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,375
No. Maybe a whole day longer.

466
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,208
If you're not careful,
you'll pass out!

467
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,458
Yeah!

468
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,375
You're gonna turn into
Yoko soup pretty soon!

469
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,583
Ahh... No, really I'm good.

470
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,000
[FUTABA, HAYAMA]
Yoko!

471
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,500
[YOKO] And so my
tumultuous school life began.

472
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,083
This new dog eat dog
world is full of trials,

473
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,333
such as understanding
how to spend break time!
