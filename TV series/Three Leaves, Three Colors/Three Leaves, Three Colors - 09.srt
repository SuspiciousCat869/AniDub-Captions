1
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,400
[SHINO] The answer
is school uniforms.

2
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:05,442
You can leave the curry
to me, Fearless Leader!

3
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,525
We're gonna go visit Hanako!

4
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,733
Look, people are
even running for it!

5
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:10,942
I won't be a ghost, though.

6
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:12,692
I shall be playing
the part of a zombie.

7
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:14,525
I will see what
advice she can offer.

8
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:59,942
I think we should
do a restaurant.

9
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:01,817
Yeah, and we can cosplay!

10
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,650
We could make a
haunted house.

11
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,150
How about fortune telling?

12
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,400
I like that!

13
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:07,733
Ugh, how boring.

14
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:10,650
So what do you
think we should do?

15
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,942
I bet you've got
some amazing ideas.

16
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:15,192
Don't hold back.
What are they?

17
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,775
Well, a cat café.

18
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:19,692
[CAT meows]

19
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:20,567
Maybe.

20
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,858
A cat café?

21
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,775
Or we could do dogs instead.

22
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:26,358
I think cats would probably
be more popular, though.

23
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:28,858
Right, everyone.

24
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,650
Let's hear what you've
all come up with.

25
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,025
And be sure to
explain your entire plan

26
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,983
including decorations
and materials,

27
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,150
an ordering system
if you're serving food,

28
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,400
costume production, work shifts,
and tear-down process.

29
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:44,692
Who would like to share first?

30
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,442
Come on, don't be shy.

31
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:51,400
So, a presentation
on the merits

32
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:53,192
of different cell phones.

33
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:54,692
Do we have any other ideas?

34
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,150
How the heck are we
supposed to come up

35
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,692
with all those details?

36
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:58,817
[STUDENT 9B]
Right?

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,775
[STUDENT 9C]
Yeah.

38
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,067
[STUDENT 9D]
This is too hard!

39
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,192
[FUTABA]
I know! Pick me! Over here!

40
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:04,900
[HAYAMA]
Okay, Odagiri! What do you got?

41
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,442
A curry shop!

42
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,692
Since the cultural festival
only happens once a year,

43
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,775
I think we should do
something really cool!

44
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:19,733
[HAYAMA]
All right. A curry shop.

45
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,317
Are we going to have costumes?

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,025
We should pick something
that'll be easy to make.

47
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:26,650
[SHINO]
The answer is school uniforms.

48
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,025
Think about it: curry
made by high school girls

49
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,317
wearing uniforms
and cute aprons.

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,650
No one will be able
to resist that.

51
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,900
Costumes wouldn't be effective
if they were cheap-looking

52
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,692
and hastily thrown together.

53
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,567
So we'll just work
with what we have.

54
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,317
Uniforms are the way to go.

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,067
What do you say,
ladies of Class 3?

56
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,358
Are you with me?

57
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:50,150
[SHINO chuckles]

58
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,608
Hey! She's from the cake shop!

59
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,358
Huh? No, that's impossible!

60
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,275
It's not her. She can't be here!

61
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:57,775
Good idea!

62
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:00,858
Totally! Why bother making
costumes if we don't have to?

63
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,400
So all we need are aprons.

64
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,692
I've already got one of those!

65
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:05,858
Hold on a sec.

66
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:08,150
Is that girl even in our class?

67
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:11,442
[STUDENT 9C]
Where did she go?

68
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,233
She's so tiny that
all she has to do

69
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,733
is put on a school uniform,
and she blends right in.

70
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:20,400
[NISHIYAMA]
She shows up everywhere!

71
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:23,067
Is no place safe?

72
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,025
[FUTABA] So that's how we
decided to wear our uniforms

73
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,275
instead of making costumes.

74
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,483
Sonobe...

75
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,233
I think a curry
shop's a good idea,

76
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,733
since so many people like it
and it's easy enough to make.

77
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,483
[FUTABA]
And it smells so yummy!

78
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,067
Do you have to do
a lot of extra work

79
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,608
since you're the
class representative?

80
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,233
Not as much as you'd think.

81
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:41,483
I have Nishiyama
to thank for that.

82
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,775
All I had to do was
stroke her ego a bit,

83
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:45,400
and she was eager to help out.

84
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:46,775
[YOKO]
Wow!

85
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,775
[FUTABA] It's sad how
easy she is to flatter.

86
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,108
She likes feeling important,

87
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:51,983
so give her that,
and she'll do anything.

88
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,275
So what's your class
gonna do for the festival?

89
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:56,192
We decided to put
together a haunted house.

90
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,650
Doesn't that sound like fun?

91
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,983
Not to me it doesn't.

92
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,025
I've never done
one before, though.

93
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:03,108
I was hoping you
could tell me about them.

94
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:06,567
Don't look at me!
I don't do haunted houses!

95
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,108
Are you all right?

96
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:09,317
Aw, what's wrong?

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,358
Is poor wittle Futaba
scared of ghosties?

98
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:13,025
Yeah! Ghosts are totally creepy.

99
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:14,692
You can't see
them or touch them,

100
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,650
so you can't punch them
if they attack you.

101
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,942
I won't be a ghost, though.

102
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,775
I shall be playing
the part of a zombie.

103
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:20,983
A zombie?

104
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,567
That's better, right?
You can punch those.

105
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,233
But they're gross!

106
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:33,608
[NISHIYAMA] I decided it
makes the most sense

107
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:35,692
to use our desks as tables,
but we don't want them

108
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:36,942
to get covered in curry,

109
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:39,192
so we need to use
something to protect them.

110
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:40,692
Tablecloths are hard to clean,

111
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,858
so I went with paper
placemats instead.

112
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,483
You always come up with
the most brilliant ideas.

113
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,400
Whenever we have one of
these big school events,

114
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,608
I'm always glad I don't
have to be in charge.

115
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:53,067
I think that everyone's glad
you don't have to be in charge.

116
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,733
Where would we be
without Nishiyama,

117
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:55,817
our fearless leader?

118
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,650
Are you making fun of me?

119
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,900
I wanna help, too.

120
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,567
You can leave the curry
to me, Fearless Leader!

121
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:07,317
[FUTABA] Today's extra-large
challenge is curry?

122
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,483
[SHOP OWNER] All right.
Let's see what you can do!

123
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,025
[chuckling]

124
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:12,983
[FUTABA]
I'mma crush this bowl, for one!

125
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,525
Just watch me!

126
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,025
[SHOP OWNER]
Ready, go!

127
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,150
[SHOP OWNER]
Okay, that's it. Time's up!

128
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:35,108
[FUTABA]
I couldn't finish.

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,983
There's no way anyone
could finish that!

130
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,608
It's too spicy!

131
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,275
Somebody won the
challenge yesterday,

132
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,442
so I was starting to think
it must be too easy.

133
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,108
I figured you could
do it for sure.

134
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,275
What?!

135
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,442
I guess if you don't have a
soul, you also can't feel pain.

136
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:54,483
[HAJIME laughs]

137
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:57,317
The curry's too spicy for you?
Wow, what a baby!

138
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,775
What?

139
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,525
I never have trouble eating
spicy food; know why?

140
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,817
'Cause I'm not a
pathetic baby like you!

141
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,692
Let me show you how it's done!

142
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,567
[HAJIME]
Aww!

143
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,025
Poor thing.

144
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:12,733
My mouth's on fire!

145
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,108
That's strange.

146
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,900
Well, I dunno what went wrong.

147
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:18,442
Guess I'll have to go back to
the drawing board on that one.

148
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,025
It's not free since
you didn't finish,

149
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,275
but you're both regulars,

150
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,483
so I'll just charge
you 50% for the curry.

151
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,692
Really? Thank you!

152
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,817
I'd hate to waste this,
so I'll take it to-go.

153
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,358
Yeah! Me, too!

154
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,275
[FUTABA]
What a week!

155
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,567
Yesterday I did a whole
bunch of curry research.

156
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,733
Did you steal that pot
from the Stuffed Hut?

157
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:37,900
[FUTABA]
It's really spicy,

158
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,317
but if I add more
veggies and stuff,

159
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
that might tone it down.

160
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,858
[HAYAMA] I'm not eating
your old curry.

161

Everybody knows curry tastes
better on the second day!

The cultural festival is
still days away, though.

163
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,775
Well, I can at least use Mr.
Stuffed's curry as a reference.

164
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,192
That way I'll know
what spices to put in it.

165
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:55,358
No need to get carried away.

166
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,817
We don't have the budget for
a bunch of gourmet spices,

167
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,817
and it'll just be easier if
we go with a store-bought roux.

It's a school festival,

169
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,108
so people won't
expect much, right?

00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:08,150
That's the spirit!

171
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,233
Mediocre curry
will be good enough!

We'll be serving
in disposable dishes.

So it should be--

I'm still a little
nervous, though.

177
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,442
I've made curry a ton of times,

178
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,400
but never in such a
large amount at once.

00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:21,775
for a long time.

475
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:32,275
At first I was worried that
I wouldn't do a good job.

476
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,817
I thought the most
important thing

477
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,067
was a convincing
costume and makeup.

478
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,567
But in the end,
what really mattered

479
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,525
is that everyone
had a lot of fun.

480
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:46,692
Including me.
It was a great festival!

481
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,442
It really was!

482
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,067
Best ever!

483
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,525
Agreed!

484
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:08,067
[FUTABA]
Yoko, I was just wondering.

485
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,442
[YOKO]
Yes?

486
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:10,858
[FUTABA] When are you going
to take that makeup off?

487
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,900
[YOKO] I was just going
to wait until I got home.

488
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:14,233
[FUTABA]
You should take it off now!

489
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:16,525
If a kid saw you,
they could be traumatized!

490
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:18,067
Think of the children,
Miss Yoko!

491
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,567
Think of the children!

492
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:52,275
[YOKO]
Yes, I have it every day.

493
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,317
I used to be worried
about my dry hair.

494
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,608
[FUTABA] Everything
changed after I drank it!

495
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:58,567
The world became brighter.

496
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,317
[HAYAMA]
It cleansed my ugly heart.

497
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,108
[KOU] These are some
of the great things

498
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,150
that people are saying about it.
