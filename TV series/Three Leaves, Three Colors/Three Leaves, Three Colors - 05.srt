1
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,041
[SHINO] I cannot help
but feel responsible.

2
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,583
True, my story is
an inspiring one.

3
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,958
She's not really what you'd
call an adventurous dresser.

4
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,166
--More of a plain Jane.
--Huh?!

5
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,958
Welcome to Secret Garden!

6
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,916
Hello! Welcome to Secret Garden!

7
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:00,500
Teru, hey!

8
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,791
You wanna come
out and play?

9
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,875
Teru, hey! You wanna
come out and play?

10
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:20,166
Teru, hey! Wanna come out play?

11
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,875
Teru, hey!
Wanna come out and play?

12
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,875
Haven't you ever
heard of a doorbell?

13
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,291
Hey, what's up?

14
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,416
I brought some cards.
You wanna play?

15
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,541
It's like a billion
degrees outside,

16
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,583
and you walked over here
to play a card game?

17
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,500
Yeah, why not?
We'll play Go Fish!

18
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,541
[HAYAMA]
That's the lamest game ever!

19
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,708
If we're gonna hang out,

20
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,833
let's at least
go somewhere cooler!

21
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,666
[FUTABA]
Ah! Blessed air conditioning!

22
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,250
Amen, sister!

23
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,458
[FUTABA] Have you done
the homework we got

24
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,958
for summer break yet?

25
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,625
[HAYAMA]
Yeah, most of it.

26
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,083
I'll take a wild guess
and say that you haven't?

27
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,541
[FUTABA]
Nope.

28
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,833
I figured I could just copy
yours when you were done.

29
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,333
[HAYAMA] Do your own work,
you lazy mooch!

30
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:14,416
No fair! How 'bout you, Yoko?

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,375
[HAYAMA]
Is she sleeping?

32
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,208
[FUTABA]
Sure looks like it.

33
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,500
[HAYAMA]
Um, is your face okay?

34
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,541
Keep your filthy
hands off of me!

35
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,375
How dare you?

36
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,875
[HAYAMA laughs awkwardly]

37
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,458
Don't mind us. Just a little
joke between girlfriends.

38
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,458
[laughs awkwardly]

39
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,041
[FUTABA] So... What's up
with you, sleeping beauty?

40
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,791
I'm really sorry; it's not
that I wasn't having fun.

41
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,083
The cool air is so relaxing, I
guess I dozed off for a second.

42
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,875
You getting sick?
You aren't usually this tired.

43
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,875
I'm okay. I've just
been working a lot.

44
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,375
Still at the cake place, right?

45
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,833
With the weirdly
young-looking maid?

46
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,958
Yeah. I remember now.

47
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,000
You said you were going
to pick up extra shifts

48
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,541
during the break.

49
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,458
I'd probably be there now if
it wasn't closed for the day.

50
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,583
Don't you think maybe you're
working yourself too hard?

51
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,541
Most folks lie down to sleep.

52
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,333
No. I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

53
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,416
[HAYAMA]
Whoa! That looks so painful!

54
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,833
Not to mention gigantic!

55
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,166
[SHINO]
You fell asleep at the table?

56
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,250
That's both sad and amusing.

57
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,375
I don't think you can work in
the front of the shop today.

58
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,416
Your face might scare
off the customers.

59
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,458
Come on.
It's not really that bad, is it?

60
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,625
It happened 'cause
she's working too much.

61
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,333
[YAMAJI gasps]
This is a travesty!

62
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,583
How could you let
Miss Yoko get injured?!

63
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,208
And on her forehead!
Her lovely face!

64
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,750
Her perfect
aristocratic visage!

65
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,333
What if it leaves a scar?
Have you thought about that?

66
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,833
This is terrible!

67
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,833
You must see a doctor
at once, Miss Yoko!

68
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,166
You're the one who needs help.

69
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,458
But I think he needs a
different kind of doctor.

70
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,416
[YAMAJI]
Ah! The work force is no place

71
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,291
for a delicate flower like her.

72
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,500
You're too soft.

73
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,250
It's time to stop
coddling Miss Yoko.

74
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,416
She's not a child anymore.

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,458
[YAMAJI] This is your
fault, devil-woman!

76
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,958
[SHINO]
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,500
We've known each other for
a long time, but work is work.

78
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,208
I can't give you
special treatment.

79
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,750
I haven't asked
for any, have I?

80
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,291
[SHINO]
I'm glad you understand.

81
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,625
Now, I would appreciate it if
you'd go into the back room

82
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,583
and get some rest.

83
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,541
[YOKO]
Huh?

84
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,708
That's an order.

85
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,416
I prefer my employees
to be well rested.

86
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,125
But I'm all right.

87
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,250
[SHINO] I cannot help
but feel responsible.

88
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,291
True, my story
is an inspiring one.

89
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,208
A humble servant turned
successful business tycoon.

90
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,375
But not everybody has
the strength of character

91
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,958
to travel the path I did.

92
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,333
I blame myself.

93
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,916
In seeking to emulate me,
you came to harm!

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,083
Did you hit your head
on something, too?

95
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,291
Hey! Let go!

96
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,083
Your boss said to rest,
so off you go.

97
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,375
No arguing!

98
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,625
What about the shop?

99
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,750
Aren't you going to be
short-handed without her?

100
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,041
You okay?

101
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,750
[SHINO]
What do I do now?

102
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,833
There's no way I can run
this place all by myself!

103
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,583
If it's that big a deal,
why'd you give Yoko the day off?

104
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,541
Hey. I've got an idea.

105
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,625
Why don't you help?

106
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
You could take Yoko's
place for a day.

107
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,125
[HAYAMA]
What? Why me?

108
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,208
Come on, it's not like you've
got anything better to do.

109
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,458
[HAYAMA] Says the girl who
wanted to play Go Fish!

110
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,333
Why not volunteer yourself?

111
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,375
We're short on time,
so let's get started.

112
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,791
But those clothes have to go!

113
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,708
Huh?!

114
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,958
[HAYAMA]
Hey! Stop! Get off me!

115
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,500
Nobody said anything
about maid cosplay!

116
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,416
What's wrong?
I thought it would be fun.

117
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,333
Well, it's not! I wanna change.

118
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,000
Why can't I just wear
the same thing Yoko does?

119
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,250
It looks good on you.

120
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,791
That is so not the point!

121
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,208
Are you finished
changing, too?

122
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,375
We should really
be getting to work.

123
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,625
[HAYAMA] This might be worth
the humiliation after all

124
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,333
if I get to see Futaba
in these stupid clothes!

125
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,500
--Ready to go, boss!
--[HAYAMA] Hey!

126
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,708
[SHINO]
My clothes didn't fit her,

127
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,083
so we had to go
with something else.

128
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,375
[HAYAMA]
What didn't fit?

129
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,333
[SHINO] Well, the bust
and hip areas were snug.

130
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,750
I'm not saying she's got
a killer body or anything.

131
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,708
I've always been a bit
on the smaller side.

132
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,916
I'm sure you'll fill
out though, don't worry.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,166
[HAYAMA]
Who said I was worried?

134
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,791
[SHINO]
Oops. I hit a nerve.

135
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,791
It's okay. I'm kind of
a special case.

136
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,333
I haven't grown
since junior high.

137
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,666
Well, to be honest, it was
more like elementary school.

138
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,416
Saying that I have the
body of a 10-year-old

139
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,666
isn't reassuring!

140
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,291
Look on the bright side!

141
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,541
If you stop growing, you won't
have to diet when you get older.

142
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,333
Can we just drop it already?!

143
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,208
Welcome to Secret Garden!

144
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,083
Oh. Where's the usual girl?

145
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,375
Does she have the day off?

146
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,791
Yes ma'am.
We're filling in for her today.

147
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,916
So many young
girls working here.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,916
I bet it makes the
job more fun, huh?

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,958
[HAYAMA laughs]

150
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,625
Definitely!
So what can we get you?

151
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,375
Anything in particular
you'd recommend?

152
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,083
Yeah, there's plenty!

153
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,500
Everything's good, really.

154
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,750
I have to say, though, I
especially like this roll cake.

155
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,250
It's simple and light,
made from an airy sponge

156
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,125
wrapped around
luscious buttercream

157
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,416
and infused with the just the
right amount of green tea.

158
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,416
Then of course,
there's the gateau chocolat.

159
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,083
Its refined sweetness pairs
perfectly with a cup

160
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,666
of dark coffee.

161
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,583
The chocolate is sinfully rich,
with just a hint of bitterness.

162
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,583
Finally, the strawberry
mousse cake.

163
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,291
This confection pairs the tangy
sweetness of strawberries

164
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,875
with the lush richness of cream,

165
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,041
creating an explosion of flavor
that will leave you gasping!

166
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,916
You make it so hard to decide!

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,791
I guess I'll have
to take all three.

168
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,583
I'll box 'em up right away.

169
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,250
Wow. That was hot.

170
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,916
She makes it sound like
a smutty romance novel.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,666
So... you're up next, then.

172
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,250
Uh, really?

173
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,250
[HAYAMA] It's not like I'm
threatened by Futaba,

174
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,166
but I don't want Sonobe
to think I can't do my job.

175
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,666
Welco--

176
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,166
Welcome to Secret Garden!

177
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,541
Which of our mouthwatering
cakes can I get for you today?

178
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:53,000
Wow! You really are
dressed up like a maid!

179
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,291
Look at you! You're adorable!

180
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,500
Yeah! I know, right?
Isn't it perfect on her?

181
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,833
You're looking pretty
chic today, yourself!

182
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,750
[FUTABA laughs]

183
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,041
[HAYAMA]
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,083
I told her you were cosplaying.

185
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,083
You make a great maid, Teru.
Keep up the good work!

186
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,458
Here's some candy
to keep you going!

187
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,666
Oh, what kind of candy is it?

188
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,541
[SHINO] It was very nice
of you to come and visit.

189
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,291
[FUTABA]
She knew just by looking at it!

190
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,416
[HAYAMA] Vampires have
heightened senses, don't they?

191
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,708
[KOU]
Oh, hey!

192
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,000
Maybe I can help bake!

193
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,083
I'll make yummy desserts
with a healthy twist!

194
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,416
I think it'll be perfect!
What d'you say?

195
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,416
Um, maybe.

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,666
This is our new gelée.

197
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,666
Its combination of
vitamin C-packed fruit

198
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,041
and collagen make it
great for your skin.

199
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,750
I haven't been able to come up
with a name for it yet, though.

200
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,791
Maybe you can help me
choose something appealing?

201
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,166
[FUTABA]
I'm at a loss.

202
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,250
[HAYAMA] Not sure how
to make it sound appealing.

203
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,166
[KOU]
I know! Gelée de Pork!

204
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,458
[FUTABA]
Gelée de Pork?!

205
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,125
That sounds disgusting, Kou!

206
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,916
Even if it is
scientifically accurate.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,125
Oh!

208
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,666
You mean 'cause collagen
comes from pig skin?

209
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,625
Aw, really? I thought it
had a nice ring to it.

210
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,458
[SHINO] I think I'll
just name it myself.

211
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,625

212
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,750
Yoko! Where are you?

I heard you're working here.
Is it true?

Oh, I recognize him!

[YU]
I know you!

216
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,791
Yes, I was the
Nishikawas' maid.

217
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,625
Young Master Takezono.

218

Will you people please
keep it down out here?

219
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,583
Miss Yoko will never get her
rest with all this commotion.

Well aren't you
a cute little thing.

221

You said you're
here to see Yoko?

222
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,166
Yes. I just want to
make sure she's okay.

223
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,291
And, you know, stuff like that.

[SHINO]
That's very sweet of you.

225

You always were a nice boy.

And adorable, too.

Look at your cute

I see that your birthmarks
have already faded.

You freakin' weirdo!

I don't care if you
used to be Yoko's maid!

232
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,291
I can't let her work in
a creepy shop like this!

233
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,625
You're gross and you're
old and I don't like you.

Hush! That's not nice.

Good little boys
don't talk like that!

238

It would hurt your
feelings if somebody said

to you, right? Well?

Yes. It would.

thing for older women!

00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,375
[KONDO]
That's exactly what we wanted!

315
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,000
[NISHIYAMA] Well, maybe
we should just leave.

316
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,916
[SHINO] Oh, are these ladies
acquaintances of yours, Hayama?

317
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,791
Yeah, we all go
to the same school!

318
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,416
Yes. Yes, we do.

319
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,583
This is quite a surprise;
I had no idea you worked here.

320
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,041
Do you enjoy it?

321
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,583
Yes, very much.

322
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,375
[SHINO] They're both smiling,
so why does it feel like

323
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,875
they're about to
stab each other?

324
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,333
Whoa! Look at that outfit!
You're dressed like a maid!

325
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,875
Uh... Well, yeah.

326
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,958
So is it like a cosplay thing?

327
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,125
Hey, lemme try!

328
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,500
"Here, master.
I've brought your cake."

329
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,208
This is a uniform,
and therefore not cosplay.

330
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,500
[KONDO] Come on!
It's totally cosplay!

331
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,791
[HAYAMA]
Read my lips, Kondo!

332
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,583
[SHINO]
Stop! Don't poke the bear!

333
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,875
But I saw something
like this on TV before.

334
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,791
Anyway, I don't work here.
I'm just helping out.

335
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,791
Sonobe needed a
couple of extra servers,

336
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,291
so we volunteered.

337
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,708
They're lifesavers, really!

338
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,583
I don't know what we
would do without them.

339
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,125
That's nice of you.

340
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,833
[SHINO] I'm so glad
to have Hayama's help.

341
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,291
She's amazing.

342
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,791
The customers
absolutely adore her.

343
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,208
She works quickly
and efficiently

344
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,625
and can think on her feet.

345
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,541
I don't know if I've
ever met anyone her age

346
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,250
who's that competent.

347
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,416
Aw, you're too kind. Stop.

348
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,375
Please! Working the
counter at a cake shop

349
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,833
is something anyone could do.

350
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,333
I mean, it's not exactly
rocket science, now is it?

351
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,083
I guess it must
be easy to say that

352
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,583
when you've never
done it before.

353
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,875
And I don't know if you could.

354
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,375
You've got so much
pride to swallow,

355
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,041
I'm afraid you might
actually choke on it.

356
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,625
Yes, you're right.

357
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,041
Maybe I'm not cut out for a job
in customer service like you,

358
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,583
since I'm not brave enough
wear an outfit like that.

359
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,166
Yep, it's true!

360
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,791
She's not really what you'd
call an adventurous dresser.

361
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,083
More of a plain Jane.

362
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't you ever know
when to shut your mouth?!

363
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,791
And stop acting like an expert!
It's been what, a day?!

364
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,958
[HAYAMA] That sort of
emotional outburst is why

365
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,333
I don't think you
could handle this job.

366
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,166
[SHINO] There's an
easy way to settle this.

367
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,666
Why don't you give it a shot?

368
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,416
Unless you're too chicken.

369
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,583
[NISHIYAMA gasps]

370
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,666
[YAMAJI]
Whoops, I'm sorry about that!

371
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,708
I guess my hand slipped.

372
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,333
It slipped five times?

373
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,375
[YAMAJI] Can't you find another
way to amuse yourself

374
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,250
besides toying with people?

375
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,625
[SHINO]
What?

376
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,375
I don't know what you mean.
My motives were pure.

377
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,708
Is everyone here crazy?!

378
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,666
[NISHIYAMA] No matter what I do,
I can't get away from her.

379
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,666
Let's go back to your
house and stuff our faces!

380
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,291
[HAYAMA] Hold on!
I have something for you.

381
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,208
Really? What?

382
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,833
[HAYAMA]
Go ahead. Take 'em.

383
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,291
Leftovers from a special
order I made myself.

384
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,375
All-natural, organic pet treats!

385
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,916
A gift for your kitty.

386
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,666
Wow, this is good!

387
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,708
[NISHIYAMA]
You're right.

388
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,416
It might be the
best bakery in town.

389
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,250
[KONDO] I can't believe
Hayama works there!

390
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,416
I mean, isn't that crazy?

391
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,750
[KITTEN meows]

392
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,250
You like the treats, huh?

393
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,416
[KITTEN meows]

394
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,083
I'm sorry. I don't
have any more for you.

395
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,833
The shop isn't open yet.

396
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,375
[NISHIYAMA gasps]

397
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,000
[SHINO] Does this mean you've
decided to come work for me

398
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:33,791
after all?

399
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:34,916
[NISHIYAMA]
What? No!

400
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,291
I was right!

401
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,791
I had a feeling you
might have a change of heart.

402
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,875
Don't worry,
everything's ready for you!

403
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,166
[NISHIYAMA]
Oh, god. What am I wearing?

404
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,333
Remember to smile!

405
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,916
That's the most
important part of the job.

406
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,333
I can't believe this
is my life right now.

407
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,875
Hayama has a great smile.

408
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,291
Really, it just brightens
up the whole room!

409
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,791
I won't ask you to match that,

410
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,291
but you could be
a little friendlier.

411
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,333
I'll show you!

412
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,791
If Hayama can do it,
then so can I!

413
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,291
Hello! Welcome
to Secret Garden!

414
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,916
Well?

415
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,458
Hey! Why are you
taking pictures?

416
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,666
Your "welcome" doesn't
sound very welcoming.

417
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,708
There's something very forced
and unnatural about it.

418
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,125
[NISHIYAMA]
Huh?!

419
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,750
Hmm... Hayama told me
you have a kitty at home.

420
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,916
According to her, you're
extraordinarily fond of it.

421
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,083
I guess so.

422
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,000
Why not imagine
yourself playing with it?

423
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,750
That should help
you look happier.

424
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,500
[NISHIYAMA]
Playing with my kitty?

425
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,041
[NISHIYAMA giggling]

426
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,250
No, never mind.

427
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,125
That would probably
just scare people away.

428
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,416
Wait, let me see!
What did I look like?

429
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,916
[NISHIYAMA]
I'm sorry! Just a minute.

430
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,041
[NISHIYAMA]
Aw! This sucks!

431
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,208
It's fine, don't worry.
There's no rush.

432
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,500
Thanks! The ribbon's
a little tricky.

433
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,166
Is it your first day here?

434
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,833
You must love wearing
such a cute uniform!

435
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,541
[SHINO] I can see through
that tough exterior

436
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,375
of yours, Nishiyama.

437
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:16,041
You pretended not to like it,
but that was an act.

438
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:20,041
You felt special getting dressed
up in your sweet little outfit.

439
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,791
Nice! Keep up the
good work, Nishiyama!

440
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,166
I'm so proud!

441
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,833
[NISHIYAMA] Thanks!
That kinda came outta nowhere.

442
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,791
[NISHIYAMA] I'll take it,
though. Praise is praise.

443
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,208
I shouldn't be surprised.

444
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,875
After all,
anything Hayama can do

445
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,000
should be simple
enough for me.

446
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,541
Yes! I am strong!

447
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,833
I can do anything!

448
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,625
Welcome to Secret Ga--

449
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,375
[FUTABA]
Uh, is that who I think it is?

450
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,333
[NISHIYAMA]
Oh, crap!

451
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,750
I should've seen this coming!

452
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,041
Of course they'd drop by.
They work here!

453
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,000
And now they've
all seen me in this.

454
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,291
Is it too late to duck
behind the counter?

455
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,083
We'll take one dozen
financiers, please.

456
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,416
[NISHIYAMA]
Why's she being nice?

457
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,375
What's going on, Sonobe?

458
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,000
I was wondering why you
suddenly gave me the day off.

459
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,875
Are you replacing
me or something?

460
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,833
Well, Nishiyama has a
massive inferiority complex,

461
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,208
and I thought I might be able
to help her out with that.

462
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,041
[NISHIYAMA]
What? That's not true!

463
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,708
Nice uniform.

464
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,750
Did you just whip
that up last night?

465
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,583
[SHINO]
No.

466
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,125
The truth is I'd
originally designed it

467
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,708
with Miss Yoko in mind.

468
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,083
[YOKO]
Me?

469
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,625
I decided it would be
too tight in the chest area

470
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,958
for her to wear, but it was
the perfect size for Nishiyama.

471
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,083
Ah!

472
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,791
[CUSTOMER 5D]
Excuse me!

473
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,125
Oh! I'll be right there!

474
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,708
[NISHIYAMA]
Man, this place is packed.

475
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,250
I can't keep up.

476
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,625
What'll I do?

477
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,333
[YOKO]
Here, let me help.

478
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,708
It's difficult for anyone
until you get used to it.

479
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,208
So that's a strawberry
mousse, a roll cake,

480
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,125
and a gateau chocolat, right?

481
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,166
[HAYAMA] I'm so sorry.
Thank you for waiting.

482
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,916
We'll take care of
you soon, I promise.

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,750
I think you're really
gonna love this one!

484
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,875
It's new and super tasty!

485
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,250
[laughs]

486
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,541
Ooh!

487
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,000
High school girls bonding,
smiling, making nice!

488
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,666
I'm getting younger
by the second!

489
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,958
[NISHIYAMA]
I'm so sorry!

490
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,916
We're all sold out
of Gelée de Pork.

491
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,125
But maybe you'd like to try this
green tea roll cake instead?

492
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,041
Great! You'll love it!

493
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,750
[sighs] Man, I'm not used
to working that hard.

494
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,500
[NISHIYAMA]
Oh, well. It was worth it.

495
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,708
I got these kitty treats.

496
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,250
And now...

497
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,541
[SHINO]
Hello.

498
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,416
It's a small world, huh?
What are you doing here?

499
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,250
[NISHIYAMA] I'm just looking
around for a good camera

500
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,333
so I can take better--[gasps]

501
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,333
That's me!

502
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,916
Why are you printing those out?

503
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,875
[SHINO] I thought they'd
make nice mementos.

504
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,750
I don't need them!

505
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,291
You mean you don't
need mementos

506
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,166
because you're going
to keep working for me?

507
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,291
What?! Never mind!

508
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,166
Just delete those
from your phone!

509
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,208
I mean it! Right now!

510
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,291
[SHINO]
This is Shino...

511
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,541
[NISHIYAMA] ...and Selina's
next episode preview!

512
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,208
[SHINO] Nishiyama,
you're a capable woman,

513
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,541
so I leave this to you.

514
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:55,500
Thank you.

515
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,708
[NISHIYAMA]
What? Well, fine.

516
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,708
Next time:
"Veggies, Meat, Meat, Meat,

517
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,166
Meat, Meat, Meat and Fish."

518
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,500
Please watch!

519
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,458
You made me do it,
so what's with that reaction?
