1
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,083
Can either of you
think of the kind of job

2
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,625
that I might be qualified for?

3
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,750
Let's ask Yamaji.
I bet he'll have some ideas.

4
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,166
[YOKO] I could be wrong,
but I think it's blood.

5
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,000
[ALL scream]

6
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,875
[SHOP OWNER 3A]
Thank you. Come again soon!

7
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,583
[WOMAN 3A]
Oh, good morning, Yamaji.

8
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,291
Just making sure
Yoko's doors are secure?

9
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,916
Oh... yeah.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,333
Is your back
still bothering you?

11
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,791
Lemme help with that.

12
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,916
[FUTABA, HAYAMA]
Miss Yoko!

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,291
--Good morning!
--Wait for us!

14
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,458
Hold on a second!

15
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,583
Hello, you two.

16
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,833
Come on! Let's walk together.

17
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,083
It's perfect weather
for a picnic today.

18
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,625
It is lovely out, isn't it?

19
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,041
[HAYAMA]
I don't know for how long.

20
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,041
I heard there's
a typhoon coming.

21
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,250
[ALL gasp]

22
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,791
[YAMAJI]
That wind...

23
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,625
Something about it
makes me uneasy.

24
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,416
[HAYAMA]
This is nice.

25
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,458
Much better than that awful
weather we had last week.

26
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,083
Yes, it was terrible, wasn't it?

27
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,666
But I'm glad we're able
to eat outside again!

28
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,458
[FUTABA sighs]

29
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,125
Is something wrong?

30
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,041
This is usually your
favorite time of day.

31
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,041
[YOKO]
That's strange.

32
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,166
You brought your own lunch?

33
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,750
Don't you prefer to buy it?

34
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,583
Yep, but I burned
through my lunch allowance

35
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,541
for the month already, so
this is what I'm stuck with.

36
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,000
[YOKO]
What did you spend it on?

37
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,208
Well I developed a
pretty expensive habit.

38
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,916
I got hooked on sea urchin.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,166
Oh.

40
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,875
They say all it takes
is just a little taste.

41
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,666
[FUTABA]
Man! Being broke is the worst.

42
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,583
Maybe I should get
a job or something.

43
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,416
[gasps] Like where you do manual
labor in exchange for money?

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,916
[HAYAMA]
Well, that's the gist.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,625
I wonder what kind of
job would be best for me.

46
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,666
I could work at a cake shop.
Or maybe a bakery.

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,583
Or a café! That could be nice.

48
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,958
Are you hoping that
they're going to pay you

49
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,541
with money or with food?

50
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,833
Either will work, really.
I'm not picky.

51
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,708
[YOKO]
That gives me an idea!

52
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,958
Instead of being destitute,

53
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,083
I may have to consider
getting a job myself!

54
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,791
Can either of you
think of the kind of job

55
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,750
that I might be qualified for?

56
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,125
Huh...

57
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,791
Miss Yoko wants to work?
How would that go?

58
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,916
[YOKO]
Here's your menu.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,791
Don't take too long deciding.

60
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,291
Excuse me!

61
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,666
Who do you think you are,
ordering me around like that?

62
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,166
Do I look like a servant to you?

63
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,250
If you want coffee so
badly, refill it yourself!

64
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,416
Not so good.

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,625
Not good at all. Nope.

66
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,125
Oh! Hey, I know!

67
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,750
Let's ask Yamaji.
I bet he'll have some ideas.

68
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,083
Hello?

69
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,833
Shouldn't he pop out of his
stalker hiding place about now?

70
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,541
"My poor Miss Yoko!" Right?
[grunts]

71
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,750
[YOKO]
Futaba?

72
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,708
What is this?

73
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,791
[FUTABA] Wow!
Did we get lucky or what?

74
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,000
I've heard about this place.

75
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,208
It hasn't been open that long,

76
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,500
but I've really been
wanting to try it out.

77
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,208
An adorable little cake shop.

78
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,083
Doesn't that sound perfect?

79
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,250
I mean, really!

80
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,791
What could be better
than this, you guys?

81
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,333
I'm gonna have my
cake and eat it too!

82
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,041
You know it's a job,
not a buffet.

83
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,583
I'm not so sure about this.

84
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,333
Maybe you two should
go on without me.

85
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,625
You want a job, don't you?
This is your chance.

86
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,208
And we'll be with you,
so don't worry.

87
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,083
[FUTABA]
What a cute little shop!

88
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,875
Ah! So yummy!

89
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,333
Oh, wow. I haven't
had cake in so long!

90
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,458
Excuse me! Is anyone here?

91
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,500
[HAYAMA]
What is that?

92
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,750
I could be wrong,
but I think it's blood.

93
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,416
Ah! I was afraid
you would say that!

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,916
Looks like it leads
into the hallway.

95
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,958
I don't see anybody in here.

96
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,041
Let's just go back!

97
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,458
[YOKO] The trail disappears
behind this door.

98
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,625
[ALL scream]

99
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,083
[YOKO]
This is simply horrific!

100
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,375
[HAYAMA]
Is that a real body?

101
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,541
[FUTABA whimpering]

102
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,083
Wait a moment.

103
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,583
I think her hand just moved!

104
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,916
It's a zombie invasion!

105
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,833
[screaming]

106
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,875
Whoops. That was
very careless of me.

107
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,208
[HAYAMA]
Uh...

108
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,916
I had a severe
craving for sweets,

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,958
and I thought this berry
jam would be just the thing

110
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,208
to satisfy it.

111
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,125
I must've fallen asleep
while eating again.

112
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,333
You were sleeping?

113
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,250
Standing up with
your eyes wide open?

114
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,583
It really is you, Sonobe!

115
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,375
But what in the world
are you doing here?

116
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,083
Oh. Hello, Miss Yoko.

117
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,458
It's been a while, hasn't it?

118
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,791
Wait, you know each other?

119
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,041
[YOKO]
Yes.

120
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,708
She worked for my family
before, well, you know.

121
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,458
My name is Shino Sonobe.

122
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,291
I used to be the
Nishikawa family's maid.

123
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,916
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Seriously?

124
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,125
[SHINO]
I enjoy making sweets.

125
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,708
In fact, it's one of the
few things I'm good at.

126
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,916
Losing my maid position
gave me a new opportunity.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,291
I was able to further
my abilities as a baker

128
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,333
and open my very own shop.

129
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,833
[YOKO]
That's excellent!

130
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,125
You know, I don't think I've
ever met a real maid before.

131
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,750
So you went from
working for them

132
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,750
to owning your own business?

133
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,583
I don't believe we
have been introduced.

134
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,791
I'd like you to meet
my two new friends!

135
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,166
I'm Hayama.

136
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,125
Nice to meet you.
I'm Futaba.

137
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,166
Sonobe?

138
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,000
Uh, what's the matter?

139
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,958
I'm sorry, that was
just quite a shock.

140
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,833
It seems like everyone
who knows "Miss Yoko"

141
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,625
is surprised that
she has friends.

142
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,333
You've got a funny way
of showing you're surprised.

143
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,041
The idea of working
at a place owned by

144
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,833
someone you know must
make you feel better.

145
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,208
[YOKO]
It certainly does!

146
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,250
You're suggesting Miss Yoko
would work at my shop?

147
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,791
[YOKO]
Yes! That is...

148
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,291
...if you think I'm qualified
for the position, of course.

149
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,458
Oh, absolutely.

150
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,833
In fact, Miss Yoko,
I'm counting on you!

151
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,875
[gasps]

152
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,166
[YOKO]
Somebody is counting on me!

153
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,583
[echoes]

154
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,625
[FUTABA]
Don't forget me!

155
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,250
I want a job here, too!

156
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,375
[SHINO]
Oh, yes!

157
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,833
I'd be happy to hire you!

158
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,750
A friend of Miss Yoko's
would be very amu--

159
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,333
I mean, very dependable.

160
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,708
Are you here for a job, too?

161
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,875
Me? No, I'm good. But thank you.

162
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,833
What was that?
Milk bottle caps?

163
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,250
What do you think
you're doing, Sonobe?

164
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,958
[ALL]
Yamaji!

165
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,750
Good. Our milk delivery is here.

166
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,583
You can just put it all
in the refrigerator.

167
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,958
[YAMAJI]
Don't change the subject.

168
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,416
You haven't answered
my question.

169
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,916
Miss Yoko isn't like us.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,750
She can't have a job!

171
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,666
My stomach hurts
just thinking about it.

172
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,916
Okay...

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
[HAYAMA] I'm a little
worried too, actually.

174
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,583
I'm already having
a hard enough time

175
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,500
arranging my schedule so
I can keep an eye on her!

176
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,083
I don't need you
complicating things!

177
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,333
[SHINO]
By the way, Mitsugu,

178
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,750
thanks for helping me
find this property.

179
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,333
It's perfect.

180
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,125
[YOKO] You helped her
get this shop set up?

181
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,333
Yeah.

182
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,250
I had a job at a real
estate agency, and--

183
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,500
Never mind!

184
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,250
You can't possibly force
Miss Yoko to work here!

185
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,458
I want her to!

186
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,041
Besides, Sonobe says
she's counting on me!

187
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,583
Don't do it.

188
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,291
No disrespect, but you don't
know that you're getting into.

189
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,875
[YAMAJI grunts]

190
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,416
Careful, you might accidentally
hurt somebody, Sonobe.

191
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,541
I was only swatting at a fly.

192
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,916
I understand.

193
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,083
It seems there are a
lot of flies around here!

194
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,958
[yelling]

195
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,583
Stop this despicable
display this instant!

196
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,500
Put those utensils down
and behave yourselves,

197
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,875
do you hear me?

198
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,916
[FUTABA] Jeez. That was
kinda scary, wasn't it?

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,375
It doesn't seem like the most
nurturing work environment.

200
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,208
I'm terribly sorry you had
to see them act so shamefully.

201
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,583
Maybe we should
try looking around

202
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,333
for a different place to work.

203
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,125
And who knows,
there might be other ways

204
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,250
for you to make money
besides working.

205
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,541
[SHOP OWNER 3A]
Thank you. Come again soon!

206
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,041
Ah! Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

207
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,500
[FUTABA] I ate a mountain of
dumplings and got paid for it.

208
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,583
What could be better?

209
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,708
Maybe I'll make it
through this month

210
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,875
without getting a job after all.

211
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,041
[HAYAMA]
I figured you could do it,

212
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,375
but I had no idea
it would be that easy.

213
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,500
[YOKO] I have to admit,
I'm a little jealous.

214
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,791
I've been thinking about it,

215
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,875
and there's nothing
I'm particularly good at.

216
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,833
Come on!
I'm sure that's not true.

217
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,666
Yeah, don't beat
yourself up so much.

218
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,125
There are plenty of
things that you're good at.

219
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,208
Do you know what kind of job

220
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,833
would be right for
somebody like me?

221
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:08,833
Yeah.

222
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,500
Well, uh...

223
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,958
[giggling]

224
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,708
You could work as a waitress.

225
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,541
At a themed restaurant!

226
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,958
What's that?

227
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,375
[HAYAMA] You know, a place
where the servers all act

228
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,791
a certain way.

229
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,625
Like a cafe where the
waitresses are really snobby.

230
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,916
[FUTABA] Is that a thing?
Do they really have those?

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,208
[HAYAMA]
I'm sure they do somewhere.

232
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,791
Guys like weird stuff.

233
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,708
[YOKO]
Hold on... I'm snobby?

234
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,750
[FUTABA]
Really, I mean it.

235
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,458
You make the best dumplings!

236
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,791
[SHOP OWNER 3A]
Thank you. Come again soon!

237
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,875
[HAYAMA]
I shouldn't be surprised.

238
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,250
Oh, hey, Hayama!

239
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,041
[HAYAMA]
You'll bankrupt that poor man.

240
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,250
[FUTABA laughs]

241
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,875
Nobody's forcing him
to offer prize money.

242
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,125
All right!

243
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,583
Now I'm gonna take this
and buy something yummy!

244
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,041
You're still hungry?

245
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,541
Ooh! I know where to go.

246
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,958
How 'bout the maid's place?

247
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,500
Our last experience
there wasn't the best.

248
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,208
But I'm not gonna lie...

249
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,541
The cakes she gave us
were pretty good.

250
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,416
[FUTABA]
They were more than good!

251
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,083
How can I describe it?

252
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,708
It was like having
a taste of maid!

253
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,041
I don't even know
what that means.

254
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,833
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Hello!

255
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,791
Welcome to Secret Garden!

256
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,958
[BOTH gasp]

257
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,083
Oh, hi!

258
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,541
I didn't expect to
see you here today.

259
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,750
[HAYAMA]
Wha--

260
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,583
You're not wearing
a maid outfit?

261
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,208
That's what you ask?

262
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,166
It's not a uniform.
I just like wearing it.

263
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,250
[FUTABA, HAYAMA gasp]

264
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,333
[YOKO] It seemed far
less daunting for me

265
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,208
to work for somebody
who I already know.

266
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,416
And when I found out Yamaji
would be working here, too,

267
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,625
I knew I would feel
right at home!

268
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,875
[FUTABA]
Of course he is.

269
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,125
[HAYAMA] I wonder how
his stomach is doing.

270
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,625
I think it's great
you got a job here.

271
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,791
Working for a friend
sounds like a lot of fun!

272
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,583
Sonobe seems really young
to own her own business.

273
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,500
I guess she must be
some kind of prodigy.

274
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,041
What is she, 18?

275
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,583
I don't blame you for thinking
that, given her appearance.

276
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,583
But you're way off the mark!

277
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,833
In fact, I think she's
in her early thirties.

278
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,916
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
You're kidding!

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,833
Excuse me.

280
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,250
[ALL gasp]

281
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,083
There seems to be an
empty spot at the table,

282
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,625
so I'll join you.

283
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,708
[HAYAMA]
So, anyway...

284
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,500
Hey, is it true you're
really in your thirties?

285
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,500
Getting a job is
a big step for Yoko.

286
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,958
Is she doing well here?

287
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:23,791
Yes.

288
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:24,875
Since it's a small shop,

289
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,708
the menu wasn't
too difficult to learn.

290
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,333
The customers are very friendly.
And the food is delicious!

291
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,708
I suppose I should go
and check on things.

292
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,833
I'll be back out soon.

293
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,708
She's actually a good worker!

294
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,333
I gotta admit I'm
pretty impressed.

295
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,833
Not everybody gets the
opportunity to hire someone

296
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,208
who once hired them.

297
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,208
You have no idea what a
thrilling experience it is.

298
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,833
[YOKO] The look on their
faces when they walked in!

299
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,625
I wonder what they
thought when they saw me.

300
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,583
I bet they were surprised!

301
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,375
Well, it was nice
to see you again.

302
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,291
We should be going.

303
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,625
Please...

304
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,000
You're welcome to stay
as long as you would like.

305
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,583
Don't rush on my account.

306
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,875
I have some freshly baked
treats if you're interested.

307
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,166
[HAYAMA]
Oh... sure.

308
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah! I'll take two!

309
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,333
[SHINO] The presence of young
people is invigorating.

310
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,541
I feel as if I
can eat so much more.

311
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,916
Like it vicariously
raises my metabolism.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,500
Yeah? That's cool!

313
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,208
[HAYAMA]
Um, she's joking, right?

314
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,541
Because that's the
most ridiculous thing

315
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,875
I've ever heard.

316
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,250
[YAMAJI]
Oh.

317
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,041
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised to find you here.

318
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,541
[FUTABA]
Oh, hey!

319
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,041
Yeah, we've kinda been hanging
out for a little while.

320
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,250
What, have you been
hiding somewhere?

321
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,708
No.

322
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,958
I only come in the morning
to help bake the first cakes

323
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:38,750
of the day.

324
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,958
I'm not here all the time.

325
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,833
Ah, that explains it.

326
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,875
Well, I just stopped by to
see how things were going.

327
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,791
Miss Yoko? Are you all right?

328
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,958
May I be of any assistance?

329
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,125
Another job?

330
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,000
He must be one of
those crazy workaholics.

331
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,833
He's exactly the same as always.

332
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,791
Shows up without any warning,
gets everything done,

333
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,458
and then moves on
to the next place.

334
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,583
Yeah, that sounds
just like him all right.

335
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,333
Just between us, I honestly
can't stand people like that.

336
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,458
They make me sick to my stomach.

337
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,208
[HAYAMA]
Uh...

338
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,916
[SHINO] But anyway, tell
me about high school life.

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,583
It must be fun. Is it fun?

340
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,708
Kinda. Lunch is fun, anyway.

341
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,250
That's what I look forward to.

342
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,916
But mainly, we're all
going there to learn.

343
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,291
[SHINO]
Fascinating.

344
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,708
[SHINO]
Miss Yoko.

345
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,333
Since you've worked
so hard today,

346
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,958
you can end your
shift a bit early.

347
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,041
Really?

348
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,708
Mitsugu is still here
if I need help.

349
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,375
I'm not really here.
I just work in the mornings.

350
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,250
Oh, cool! We can walk
home together, then.

351
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,458
Yeah!

352
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,500
[YOKO sighs]

353
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,833
It's surprising how
exhausted you can get

354
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,416
just from standing.

355
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,583
You're doing a whole lot
more than just standing,

356
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,000
aren't you?

357
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,500
Is it weird to serve customers
after being waited on

358
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,375
your whole life?

359
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,625
[YOKO]
Uh...

360
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,500
Well, it's difficult,
but I manage somehow.

361
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,750
Why, did you think I would
yell at them or something?

362
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,583
[FUTABA, HAYAMA laugh]

363
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,666
[FUTABA] So you're raking
in the big bucks now.

364
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,541
What are you gonna spend it on?

365
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,833
[HAYAMA] Maybe you can eliminate
bread crusts from your diet.

366
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,916
[YOKO]
Why would I want to do that?

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,375
They're cheap and plentiful.

368
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,833
Not to mention delicious
when topped with mayonnaise.

369
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,500
[FUTABA, HAYAMA]
Of course.

370
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,708
I'll be seeing you
ladies again very soon.

371
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,458
Aww... I'm gonna
starve to death.

372
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,375
One more class to go
before lunch, so you'll live.

373
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:34,666
[SHINO]
Futaba! Hayama! Futaba!

374
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,166
Is somebody calling us?

375
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,666
Wait, that voice.
I know it from somewhere.

376
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,458
[SHINO] Turn around. I'm
standing right behind you.

377
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,000
Do you think I could borrow a
moment of your time, please?

378
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,291
[BOTH yell] 

379
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,708
[HAYAMA]
Wha--Wha--Wha...?!

380
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,208
[FUTABA] What in the
world are you doing here?

381
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,875
[SHINO giggles]
Oops. Did I startle you?

382
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,833
That isn't the problem!
Now, where did you get that?

383
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,291
[SHINO]
Oh, this?

384
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,458
I made it after
you left yesterday.

385
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,166
It wasn't too difficult, really.

386
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,250
The pattern itself is
a very simplistic one.

387
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,291
[HAYAMA]
You know, never mind.

388
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,083
I think I asked
the wrong question.

389
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,916
Start by telling us
what you're doing here!

390
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,083
[FUTABA]
That's right!

391
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,375
And why aren't you
wearing the maid outfit?

392
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,833
You're really not helping!

393
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,541
I change clothes
sometimes, you know.

394
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,083
[HAYAMA]
Can we focus, please?

395
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,458
This is what I would
like to know.

396
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,541
What are you doing
at our school?

397
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,625
I don't mean any harm.

398
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,083
I'm simply trying
to be of service.

399
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,458
What, fan service?

400
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,625
[FUTABA] That would work
better with the maid getup.

401
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,791
Can we drop that already?

402
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,625
Well, anyway, there's something
I want to give Miss Yoko.

403
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,375
Oh? And what would that be?

404
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,416
[SHINO] I went overboard
with my prep today.

405
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,666
I thought she might enjoy it,

406
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,708
so I boxed some of the
extra food up for her.

407
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,416
Ooh, you made her lunch?

408
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,791
[SHINO]
There, you see.

409
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,583
I have a perfectly good
explanation for being here.

410
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,958
[chuckling]

411
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,708
Nope. There's just
no good explanation

412
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,458
for a woman in her thirties
trying to masquerade

413
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,791
as a high school student.

414
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,583
[bell rings]

415
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,833
There goes the bell.
We should get to class.

416
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,333
Well, Sonobe,
what are you going to--

417
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,416
[FUTABA]
Hey! She disappeared!

418
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,333
[HAYAMA]
She's a poltergeist.

419
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,000
Since I have to wait until
lunchtime to give this to her, 

420
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,583
I guess I'll just explore
the school until then.

421
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,083
[SHINO]
The feel of a linoleum floor!

422
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,208
Ah!

423
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:33,250
The scent of youth!
So, so, delicious!

424
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,791
Ah, what a lovely view!

425
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,083
[SHINO]
I love being up this high!

426
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,166
It's so empowering!

427
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,208
And school uniforms
are perfectly designed

428
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,750
to catch this breeze.

429
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,750
[TEACHER 3A] The subjunctive
mood is easily identified

430
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,208
by the use of a clause
beginning in "if."

431
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,625
It is used to express...

432
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,875
[SHINO yelling]

433
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,208
Um, is it just me,
or does it sound like

434
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,416
the school's being
attacked by Tarzan?

435
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,541
It's the poltergeist.

436
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,333
[P.E. TEACHER 2A] All right!
Everybody pair off!

437
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,083
Get those stretches done!

438
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,166
Come on!
Stop all the chit-chat!

439
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,458
[HAYAMA]
I don't know what to do.

440
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,583
Well, first things first,
we need to find Sonobe--

441
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,083
'Kay, found her!

442
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,458
[SHINO] So it appears that
you are schoolmates,

443
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,208
but not actually classmates
with Miss Yoko.

444
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,375
[FUTABA]
Uh...

445
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,750
I don't understand
why you're here.

446
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,041
I wanted to eat
lunch with you,

447
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,208
so I made a uniform
and came to your school.

448
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,791
[HAYAMA]
Which is crazy, right?

449
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,125
[FUTABA] Yoko doesn't
seem too fazed by it.

450
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,375
When one works with Sonobe,

451
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,125
one accepts that
strange things happen.

452
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,791
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Yeah?

453
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,916
[SHINO]
There's plenty.

454
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,291
Help yourselves to
whatever you want.

455
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,541
Sounds great!
Don't mind if I do!

456
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,291
[SHINO]
I made potato salad,

457
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,875
with a generous amount
of mayonnaise, naturally.

458
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,166
[YOKO] You do know
what I like, Sonobe.

459
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,500
[HAYAMA]
'Kay, you handed over her lunch.

460
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,666
Maybe you can
just get going now.

461
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,916
It was so nice of you
to think of me!

462
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,125
[SHINO]
Here you are, Miss Yoko.

463
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,416
It's from your father.

464
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,541
[YOKO laughs]

465
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,291
Aww!

466
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,958
Did you draw these
cute little pictures?

467
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,166
Yes.

468
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,291
I thought the letter
would be more enjoyable

469
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,916
if it were illustrated.

470
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,291
Thanks!
That's very sweet of you!

471
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,208
[FUTABA]
Careful, Hayama.

472
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,125
You want to make sure
you're having balanced meals!

473
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:39,916
[HAYAMA]
Give me a break!

474
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,125
Like you're one to talk!

475
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,625
I don't know what you mean.

476
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,125
I eat plenty of bread, rice,
meat, and veggies every day!

477
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,291
[HAYAMA] Sure, but you're
not supposed to eat

478
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,375
truckloads of 'em!

479
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,916
[FUTABA gasps]
I don't eat that much!

480
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,291
Thank you for your time.

481
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,625
I need to get back to
the shop, so I'm going now.

482
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,041
You're going already?

483
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,875
[SHINO] Hayama, Futaba,
I leave Miss Yoko to you.

484
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,750
Please take good care of her.

485
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,208
Sonobe...

486
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,916
[YAMAJI]
What is the meaning of this?!

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,875
[YOKO]
Yamaji?

488
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,708
How dare you!

489
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,750
Prancing about in a uniform.

490
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,541
[SHINO laughing]

491
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,041
[YAMAJI]
Get back here!

492
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,416
[ALL]
Uh...

493
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,250
I wasn't sure at first,
but I think she came here

494
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,208
because she was
worried about you.

495
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,666
Yeah, I think so too.

496
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,583
She's pretty weird, but she
seems like a good person.

497
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,500
[YOKO]
Yes, she is.

498
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,041
[SHINO]
Here you go. Here you go.

499
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,458
Here you go. Please take one.

500
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,583
Here you go.

501
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,041
Delicious cakes.
New specials every day!

502
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,791
Please, take a flier with you.

503
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,375
[YOKO]
Sonobe?

504
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,750
[SHINO]
Miss Yoko.

505
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,291
Would you mind
telling me what exactly

506
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,375
you think you're doing out here?

507
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,583
Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you like one too?

508
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,333
[YOKO] No, I wouldn't!
That's not the issue!

509
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,625
[FUTABA]
Easy now.

510
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,041
[HAYAMA] Maybe you should
take a deep breath.

511
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,041
[YOKO] You really think
it's okay to be doing this?

512
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,416
Yes, absolutely.

513
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,583
I'm quite confident
that nobody can tell.

514
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,083
[YOKO]
Can tell what?

515
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,083
That you're a grown woman
hanging out at a high school?

516
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,041
[SHINO]
No, this uniform is perfect.

517
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,791
[YOKO]
That isn't the issue either.

518
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,166
Wait! Come back!

519
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,416
Hold on! Sonobe!

520
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,083
[SHINO]
This is Maid Angel Super Shino!

521
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,791
I'm so happy you enjoyed this!

522
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,791
From this week on, I'll be here
to put a smile on your faces!

523
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,666
Please support me!
You will, right?

524
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,125
I will fight
with what I have!

525
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,541
Perish! Unpaid overtime!
Illegal uploading!

526
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,583
[YAMAJI]
What year are you in?

527
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,125
[SHINO]
2016.
