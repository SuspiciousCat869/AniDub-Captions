1
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,666
Fall's special.
I eat like five times as much.

2
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,875
What challenge are you
here to compete in today?

3
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,208
Futaba Odagiri!

4
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,625
[SASAME]
You stay away from me!

5
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,166
Big jerkface!

6
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,916
[YOKO]
What is going on here?

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,833
I've been given a gift.
Is that so wrong?

8
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,458
It's starting to feel
like fall, isn't it?

9
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,500
It's definitely getting
a lot cooler out these days.

10
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,000
The fall means grapes.

11
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,625
And chestnuts!
And mushrooms!

12
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,833
And pretty, pretty maple leaves!

13
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,500
Huh? What good
are maple leaves?

14
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,791
I mean, really,
what's the point?

15
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:13,958
Are they even edible?

16
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,583
I don't know if
they taste good,

17
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,875
but you could probably eat them
if you were desperate enough.

18
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,875
Ah! Fall is the ultimate
eating season.

19
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,208
Correct me if I'm wrong,

20
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,333
but aren't they all technically
"eating seasons"?

21
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,083
Fall's special.
I eat like five times as much.

22
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,291
And what about you two?

23
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,083
What kind of season
is it for you?

24
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,500
The season of reading?

25
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,458
The season of thriftiness!

26
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,708
So we're all basically
the same year-round, huh?

27
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,666
Yeah, we are
pretty predictable.

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,583
Futaba Odagiri!

29
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,541
Huh?

30
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,541
Okay, well, that was weird.

31
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,583
[HAYAMA] Any idea why that
boy was yelling at you?

32
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,625
It was kind of scary.
Do you know him?

33
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,583
Nope, never seen him before.

34
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,333
What right does a
complete stranger have

35
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,833
to yell at you like that?

36
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,500
His behavior was
worse than rude.

37
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,708
It was threatening.

38
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,000
As your friend,
I won't stand for this!

39
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,541
It's my duty to protect you,
and that's what I'll do.

40
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,166
I'll find him and make him pay!

41
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,791
There's no need to hurt anybody.

42
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,916
Especially since
he's just a kid.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,041
I don't think he is a kid.

44
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,666
He was wearing
East High's uniform.

45
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,750
[FUTABA]
No way! He's in high school?

46
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,500
I thought he was
like 12 or something.

47
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,958
But... You're right.

48
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,583
It was pretty freaky the way
he screamed my full name.

49
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,375
I wonder how he knows who I am.

50
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,583
[SHOP OWNER] All right,
here you are young lady.

51
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,166
[FUTABA squeals]

52
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,500
[SHOP OWNER] Your very own
bucket of almond jelly.

53
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,791
Enjoy.

54
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,500
Aw, yeah!

55
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,458
Like a train wreck.

56
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,291
Totally horrifying,
but you just can't look away.

57
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,458
There's no way you're
gonna pull this one off!

58
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,958
Sorry kid!

59
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,125
I'm down for a refill
if you've got more!

60
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,583
No! You beat me again?

61
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,750
Of course, because
she's a freak of nature.

62
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,250
Way to go, girl!
That was amazing.

63
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,666
So amazing that I
kind of want to vomit.

64
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,041
I didn't realize you'd
done so many challenges.

65
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,875
You really are gonna
put him out of business

66
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:29,791
if you're not careful.

67
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,166
It's not just this place.

68
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,250
I do challenges
at other shops, too.

69
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,375
Oh, yeah?

70
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,208
[SHOP OWNER]
You know the drill.

71
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,041
We need a photo
to put up on the wall.

72
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,666
Say "bucket of jelly."

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,083
Okay! Ready?

74
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,833
Bucket of jelly!

75
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,166
[laughs]

76
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,708
It doesn't matter
how cute and dainty

77
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,083
she looks on the outside.

78
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,125
That girl just slurped down
a whole bucket of jelly.

79
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,708
--[FUTABA] Here, how's this?
--[SHOP OWNER] Good.

80
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,000
[HAYAMA] And there's a wall of
photos with her name on them.

81
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,958
[FUTABA]
That's right. My name.

82
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,708
It makes sense, doesn't it?

83
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,000
That guy could've
learned my name

84
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,125
by looking at the photos
on the restaurant wall.

85
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,500
But that doesn't explain
what he was so mad about.

86
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,916
Yeah, you're right.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,833
Maybe it was the crazed
adoration of a die-hard fan.

88
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,875
Uh... I'm gonna go
with no on that one.

89
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,500
Futaba Odagiri!

90
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not crazy...
You saw that, right?

91
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,083
I think it was
a girl this time.

92
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,708
[YOKO]
It's happened twice now?

93
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,750
That's it! He really
is going to pay!

94
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,916
[FUTABA] It was a different
person this time.

95
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,625
It was a different
person, right?

96
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,416
Like I said,
I think it was a girl.

97
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,083
They did look almost
exactly alike, though.

98
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,750
[FUTABA] I don't get it.
Why would he dress like a girl?

99
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,541
[YOKO]
What is going on here?

100
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,708
Maybe I should get
Yamaji to look into it.

101
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,208
I want some answers!

102
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,875
[SASAME gasps]

103
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,750
Oh, whoops! I'm sorry.

104
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,166
[SASAME]
No, it's my fault.

105
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,916
I wasn't paying attention.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,875
[YOKO]
Hey! Wait a second.

107
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,541
She looks familiar.

108
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:19,083
This must be the girl Futaba and
Hayama were talking about!

109
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,500
[SASAME]
What's wrong?

110
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,416
Why is she staring at me?

111
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,333
You--! You know what?

112
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,125
I want to talk to you later.
Will you meet me after school?

113
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,208
Huh?

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,791
[SASAME]
Well, I'm here.

115
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,458
I wonder what she
wants to talk about.

116
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,958
Nishikawa!

117
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:45,500
She's so pretty, and smart,
and athletic, and confident.

118
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,583
I think she's amazing!

119
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,500
I've always been too
scared to go up to her,

120
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,250
but now she wants to talk to me!

121
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,666
[FUTABA]
Yep, that's her all right.

122
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,958
Wow.

123
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,125
She really does just
look like him in a skirt.

124
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,833
I know, It's almost like
they're twins or something.

125
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,500
[FUTABA] Think she's
gonna yell at us again?

126
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,625
Sasame Tsuji from Class 2.

127
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,916
Does that sound
right to you, Yoko?

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,291
There are a lot of
people in my class,

129
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,291
so it's kinda hard for me to
know everybody's name.

130
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,625
I mean, I haven't had a
chance to talk to all of them.

131
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,625
You said you wanted
to talk, so I came.

132
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,291
But why'd you
bring her with you?

133
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,958
'Cause we're friends.
Is that a problem?

134
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,333
[SASAME]
What?

135
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,625
[SASAME] I finally had a
chance to talk to Nishikawa,

136
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,708
and now she's ruined it!

137
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,208
I'm glad you're here!

138
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,250
There's something I want to
say to you, Futaba Odagiri!

139
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,291
Stay out of my brother's way,
or you'll answer to me!

140
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,916
That guy's your brother?

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,791
I called it. They are twins.

142
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,583
Why do people always say that?
He's a year older than me!

143
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,625
[FUTABA]
Are you sure?

144
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,166
[YOKO]
You're basically identical.

145
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,583
[FUTABA]
But how am I in his way?

146
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,208
I didn't do anything.

147
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,791
Oh yes, you did!

148
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,875
Or have you forgotten all the
food challenges you've entered?

149
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,708
So that's what all
this fuss is about.

150
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,416
Your brother's a gluttonous
pig just like Futaba?

151
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,083
He's tried the Stuffed Hut
challenges so many times.

152
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,333
But it's no use.

153
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,291
All he ever wins from
them is a stomachache.

154
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,375
That's gotta be tough.

155
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:09,291
He's stubborn, and he
hates losing so much.

156
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,708
I know he'll keep trying,

157
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,375
which means he'll keep
making himself sick.

158
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,791
[FUTABA]
Don't worry.

159
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,125
He'll stop entering challenges.

160
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,750
I'm gonna beat him
till he gives up!

161
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,041
[chuckles]

162
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,416
You stay away from me!

163
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,875
Big jerkface!

[whining]

165
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,750
I just love to eat.

166
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,500
It's not like I'm
trying to hurt anybody.

167
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,125
I've been given a gift.
Is that so wrong?

168
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,750
Somebody better
call the wahhmbulance.

169
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,791
[FUTABA]
Maybe I overdid it.

170
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,083
But regular portions
aren't enough for me.

171
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,458
And besides, I'm dead broke.

172

[SHOP OWNER]
Welcome to the Stuffed Hut!

173
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,916
Ah, Futaba! Is that you?

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,791
What challenge are you
here to compete in today?

175
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,208
You're not kicking me out?

176
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,083
I'll just eat something
normal, Mr. Stuffed.

177
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,625
I don't wanna risk being
banned from here too.

178
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,416
Really? Are you sure?

179
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,666
[FUTABA]
Yep.

180
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,250
I'll have a large curry
topped with egg, corn,

181
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,666
cheese, onions, potatoes,
croquette, sausage,

182
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,958
and chicken cutlet please.

183
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,458
[HAJIME]
That's not normal!

184
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,375
It's a Tsuji.
The boy this time.

185
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,541
[HAJIME]
Mister!

186
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,583
I'll have the same thing
as Futaba Odagiri.

187
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,208
Oh yeah. I'm not
giving up, you got that?

188
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,416
I'm gonna take you
down if it kills me!

189
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,791
[SHOP OWNER]
All right, kids. Here ya go.

190
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,458
Thanks, it looks totally yummy!

191
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,875
Okay. I can do this.

192
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,083
Mmm! Delicious!

193
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,375
[HAJIME] I have to win.
I can't let her beat me!

194
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,291
I did it!

195
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,000
I beat her! I beat her!

196
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,500
I'm the champion!

197
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,166
[laughing]

198
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,500
I finished faster than you,

199
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,458
which means I'm the winner
and you're the loser.

200
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,833
So how does failure taste?

201
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,583
Hey, Mr. Stuffed,
the curry tastes different.

202
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,333
Did you change up your recipe?

203
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,916
[SHOP OWNER]
I knew you'd be able to tell!

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,958
I tweaked the spice
ratios a little bit.

205
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,875
Don't you get it?
I finished first!

206
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,083
[FUTABA]
There's no point rushing through

207
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,458
a delicious curry if
it's not a competition.

208
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,458
I'd rather take my time and
savor every single bite.

209
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,000
[HAJIME]
Big jerkface!

210
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,875
I'll remember this!

211
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,500
One of these days
I'm gonna beat you!

212
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,041
[SASAME]
I won't forgive you for this!

213
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,166
I hate you, Futaba Odagiri!

214
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,833
[SASAME]
She's here!

215
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
[KOU]
Teru!

216
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,833
Hey, Sis, what's up?

217
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,291
Nothing, really.
Just thought I'd walk with you.

218
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,083
[SASAME]
I wonder what she's up to.

219
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,041
If they're going to a shop so
she can do a food challenge,

220
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,708
I have to find
a way to stop her!

221
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:28,375
Except, if I get in their way,
Nishikawa might get mad.

222
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,083
Then she wouldn't
like me anymore.

223
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,916
Uh... What should I do?

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,958
[KOU] Ah. So that boy's into
food challenges, too?

225
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,708
How's it feel to have a rival?

226
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,333
I only do them for the food,
so it's a one sided rivalry.

227
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,875
I don't know if she
could beat Futaba,

228
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,541
but my sister eats a lot too.

229
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,208
Does she do it competitively?

230
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,333
[HAYAMA] No, but ya know
how she's kind of spacey?

231
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,250
She'll completely
zone out and keep eating

232
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,875
without realizing it.

233
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,458
It's pretty amazing, actually.

234
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,333
She can eat her way
through several courses

235
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,333
before finally
noticing she's full.

236
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,875
She's that spacey? Wow.

237
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,458
You feel that?

00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,125

Hm?

Oh, hey there, Yamaji.

Just when you thought
he couldn't get creepier.

245
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,166
Can't you just say hello
like a normal person?

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,583
That's weird. I must've
been imagining things.

00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,000
I thought there was
someone ahead of us,

248

but I guess it was just Yamaji.

super stealth skills,

I was coming from.

Yeah, you're a real ninja.

Can we get going now?

Hey, that's Tsuji.

who keeps losing to Futaba?

How did you know
that it was a trap?

Are you serious?

Come on, who would fall
for something like that?

263

This isn't a cartoon, y'know.

But I catch my brother
like this all the time!

Hey, now...

266
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,708
I'd appreciate it if you
wouldn't compare me to him.

267
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,416
I knew that I
needed to find a way

268
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,125
to keep you from
competing in any more

big-eater challenges.

270
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,666
But I didn't want
Nishikawa to get mad at me,

271
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,750
so I tried to do it without
revealing my identity.

272
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,250
Obviously, that worked
out pretty well didn't it?

273
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,916
I can't believe anybody
would stoop so low

274
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,583
as to try to trap a person
like a common animal!

275
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,750
It is completely despicable!

[SASAME gasps]

277
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,541
[SASAME] This is all your
fault, Futaba Odagiri!

Well those two sure are
good at running away.

279
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,208
Setting a trap like that
takes planning.

280
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,375
Futaba, you have to
be extremely careful!

281
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,916
She may be trying to kill you!

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,833
I think I'll take my chances.

283
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,958
Maybe you should've been
nicer to her, though.

284
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,666
But what does that have
to do with anything?

285
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,000
Well, no offense, but...

286
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,833
You don't seem like you're
the most popular girl

287
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,500
in your class, so you
might wanna consider

288
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,333
actually talking to some
of the other students.

289

She has a valid point.

290
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,750
I've never seen you talk to
anyone else in your class,

291
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,916
and believe me,
I've been watching.

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,750
You can come off as
aloof and condescending,

293
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,458
and your classmates
tend to avoid you,

294
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,000
so maybe you shouldn't
make an enemy

of the one person
who actually likes you.

he's giving up anytime soon.

299
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,000
Which means we'll probably
be seeing a lot of him

300
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,041
till he finally wins something.

301
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,375
I'll take care of it.

[HAYAMA] Yeah, that's
one way to handle it.

305
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,833
Or maybe you could try
making friends with him

306
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,625
instead of breaking his spirit.

307

something in common.

Can I have my book back?

316
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,166
[FUTABA] So this is the
kinda thing you like?

317
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,666
Doesn't exactly fit your image.

318
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,333
It isn't mine.
I borrowed it from somebody.

319
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,375
[KONDO]
Oh, hey, Nishiyama.

320
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,958
Is that the book I lent you?

321
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,458
See, it's just like I said.

322
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,791
She always insists on
borrowing my copies.

323
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,458
We've both been huge
fans of the series

324
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,833
ever since elementary school,

325
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,416
but she tends to get
a little obsessive

326
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,750
when a new one comes out!

327
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,958
You can stop talking now!

328
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,291
[HAYAMA]
It's all right.

329
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,625
We all have our
own guilty pleasures.

330
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,458
No one's judging you.

331
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,625
[NISHIYAMA] I'll wipe that
smirk off your stupid face!

332
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,000
[HAYAMA]
No, it's fine!

333
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,291
Don't be embarrassed.

334
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,208
It's cute and fun and simple.

335
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,500
These days, plenty of people
don't even read at all.

336
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,333
Why are you so mean?!

337
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,125
Is it just me, or is there
a lot of that going on lately?

338
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,666
You'd see less of it if you
were nicer to Tsuji's brother.

339
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,291
Or do you like when
people run away from you

340
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,666
screaming and crying?

341
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,833
If you're telling me to
be nice, I've got problems.

342
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,250
[HAYAMA]
Well, no offense, but...

343
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,375
You don't seem like you're the
most popular girl in your class,

344
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,291
so you might wanna
consider actually talking

345
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,500
to some of the other students .

346
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,083
[YOKO] That's true, but how
am I supposed to be nice to her

347
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,458
after the way she's
treated Futaba?

348
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,083
[YOKO]
Oops. Excuse me.

349
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,208
[gasps]

350
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,750
Um... I'm sorry.

351
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,583
I should watch where I'm going.

352
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,958
I'll leave now!

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,375
[CAT screeches]

354
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,041
[SASAME yelps]

355
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,625
Are you all right?
That looked like it hurt.

356
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,250
[SASAME]
Yeah, it kinda did.

357
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,458
Oh! My purse spilled.

358
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,958
It's okay, I'll help you.

359
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,666
Here we go.

360
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,500
There are some more over here.

361
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,000
That's really nice of you.

362
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,875
[SASAME]
Aw, looks like I'm 10 yen short.

363
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,416
Guess I'll have to skip
the strawberry milk today.

364
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,625
No!

365
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,541
We won't stop looking
until we find it!

366
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,708
It's okay.

367
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,333
It's not that big of
a deal; just 10 yen.

368
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,583
Excuse me!
Did you say "just 10 yen"?

369
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,166
I'm sorry! I take it back!

370
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,125
[HAYAMA]
Oh. Hey, Yoko.

371
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,583
What are you doing?

372
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,916
You're that other friend
of Futaba Odagiri's.

373
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,041
What's your name?

374
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,166
It's Hayama. I'm in Class 3.

375
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,916
Tsuji fell and
dropped all her coins.

376
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,833
I'm helping her find them.

377
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,375
Did you drop them around here?

378
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,791
[SASAME]
I can't believe this!

379
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,875
I'm surrounded
by Futaba's friends.

380
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,541
How did this happen?

381
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,708
What do I do?

382
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,250
Was it a lot of money?

383
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes. I feel awful.

384
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,166
She's still missing 10 yen.

385
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,500
Ten yen?

386
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,666
[HAYAMA]
Here.

387
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,458
Go ahead, take it.

388
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,958
And don't worry 
about paying me back.

389
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,416
Ten yen isn't exactly
going to break the bank.

390
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,041
[HAYAMA]
See ya!

391
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,125
I'm really sorry.

392
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,208
I hope you enjoy your
strawberry milk.

393
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,291
Um, thank you.

394
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,750
[SASAME]
Great, now what?

395
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,791
I don't want to be in debt
to one of her friends.

396
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,958
Still, at least I got to talk
to Nishikawa for a little bit.

397
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,333
And Hayama, too.
She seemed nice.

398
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,000
[SASAME] I'm just gonna
give this back to her.

399
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,375
[FUTABA]
Yeah. That's classic Yoko.

400
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,708
She had that look on her face.

401
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,458
You know, the super
serious one she gets

402
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,875
when money's involved?

403
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,250
I know exactly what kinda
look you're talking about.

404
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,000
Honestly, I'm surprised
she hasn't loosened up

405
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,708
about money yet since
she's been working

406
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,125
for quite some time.

407
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,791
[SASAME]
Nishikawa has a job?

408
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:44,541
[HAYAMA]
Huh?

409
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,750
Tsuji alert.

410
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,750
She doesn't seem like
the type who'd work.

411
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,750
What kind of place is it?

412
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,291
She works at a
cake shop over in

413
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,791
the Central Shopping Arcade.

414
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,666
It's a little place
called Secret Garden.

415
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,416
You've probably seen the fliers.

416
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,458
Oh.

417
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,333
I should quit stalling
and just go in.

418
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,541
[SASAME]
Oh, wow! That is so cool!

419
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,791
A girl in a maid's uniform!

420
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,458
And there's a butler too?

421
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,875
It makes sense.

422
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,791
This place would have
to be pretty high class

423
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,625
for Nishikawa to work here.

424
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,791
--[YOKO] Tsuji?
--[SASAME gasps]

425
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,416
Didn't think you'd
come this quickly.

426
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,875
I was just in the area.

427
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,250
There's no time for excuses!

428
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,625
Let's go in already!

429
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,791
So, uh...

430
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,541
Ah! Smells good.

431
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,083
I've been waiting
all day for this!

432
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,750
I haven't eaten practically
anything for hours.

433
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,500
[SASAME]
This is so weird...

434
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,041
How did this happen?

435
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,625
I'm at a tea party
with Futaba Odagiri!

436
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,875
Have you tried it yet?

437
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,041
Go on, drink while it's hot.

438
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,750
Yeah, it smells wonderful.

439
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,625
And it tastes delicious!

440
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,708
You like it, then? Good!

441
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,416
We carry a lot of teas,
but this is my favorite.

442
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,875
I see why.

443
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,583
The rest of your order is ready.

444
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,166
[FUTABA]
Hand 'em over!

445
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,750
The whole reason
we're here is to try out

446
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,083
the new cake on the menu!

447
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,166
Whoa, did you order
one for me, too?

448
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,375
Why, what's the problem?
Don't you like cake?

449
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,625
Dibs on her piece!

450
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,250
No! I'll eat it! I'll eat it!

451
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,416
[FUTABA]
It's okay. You don't have to.

452
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,250
I want to!

453
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,458
[FUTABA]
Really?

454
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,916
[SHINO] I'm very happy
for you, Miss Yoko.

455
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,541
You've made friends with
another of your schoolmates.

456
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,458
Open up!

457
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,958
[YOKO]
Friends? I don't know.

458
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,291
We haven't known
each other long,

459
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,250
so it's hard to say.

460
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,791
[YAMAJI] It was a miracle just
to have Hayama and Futaba.

461
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,041
Now this?

462
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,375
[SHINO] Having another
high school girl around

463
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,041
will make the shop
feel even more youthful.

464
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,750
I'm quite excited about it.

465
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,625
[YAMAJI] Isn't it nice to
know you can make friends

466
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,000
without buying them?

467
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,375
[SHINO] It's a good
thing you're poor now.

468
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,916
People like you a lot
better than when you were

469
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,125
rich and snobby.

470
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,125
[YOKO] Hey! I don't
have to listen to this!

471
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,083
Be quiet, both of you!

472
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,708
[YOKO] I can't believe Tsuji
actually came to visit the shop.

473
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,500
[STUDENT 1V] I think I'm gonna
see a movie this weekend.

474
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,958
[YOKO] Are they right?
Is she my friend?

475
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,708
I don't know. How do you figure
out something like that?

476
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,166
[whistle]

477
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,666
[P.E. TEACHER] All right.
Let's partner up, everybody!

478
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,750
I have to find a partner!

479
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,416
[SASAME]
Hey, Nishikawa!

480
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,250
[YOKO] Wait, did she
just say my name?

481
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,708
Nobody ever wants
to team up with me.

482
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,083
I'm always the
last person picked.

483
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,458
Half the time I just
end up with the teacher.

484
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,958
Does she really
want to be my partner?

485
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,041
Um, do you...

486
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,083
Are you sure we're
doing this right?

487
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,416
[YOKO yells]

488
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,000
[SHINO] Now, next week's <i>Three</i>
<i>Leaves Three Colors</i> will be:

489
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,125
[SASAME]
It's Sasame. Um...

490
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,916
Oh, next time will
be these three:

491
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,916
"The Cursed Sword, Place of
Death, and Red Spider Lily."

492
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,583
[SHINO]
Rock, paper, scissors!

493
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,916
[chuckling]
