1
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,375
[YOKO]
It's not so... bad.

2
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,458
I thought it was kind of
a weird name to begin with.

3
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,250
[YAMAJI] And if any boys so
much as look at Miss Yoko

4
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,125
--the wrong way...
--[YU] Yoko!

5
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,750
[YAMAJI] ...they'll have
to answer to my trusty bat.

6
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,625
[FUTABA]
Look, there it is! The ocean!

7
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,125
[YOKO]
It's so beautiful!

8
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,000
[FUTABA] It's not really summer
until you go to the beach.

9
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,250
[HAYAMA] This was so
worth waking up early.

10
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,625
I've never taken a
train to the beach before.

11
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,875
It makes it feel more like we're
on an adventure or something.

12
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,625
You usually get here by limo?

13
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,416
Or helicopter?

14
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,208
What'll we do
once we're there?

15
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,500
Lie on the beach and
look up at the clouds!

16
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,875
Make sandcastles and
catch up on some reading!

17
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,875
Eat ice cream and watermelon!

18
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:40,583
[ALL laugh]

19
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,750
Or maybe not.

20
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,333
Not so much.

21
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,666
[FUTABA]
Well, ladies...

22
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,833
I guess it's time
for us to get to work.

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,291
[SHINO] It's summer.
Summer means the ocean.

24
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,833
The ocean means a good
old fashioned beach hut.

25
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,458
So I present to you,
Secret Garden, beach hut style.

26
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,000
Have a bite of paradise.

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,458
[ALL sigh]

28
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,750
I can't believe we traveled
all this way just to work.

29
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,750
At least the
scenery's nicer here.

30
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,166
[SHINO]
We should be pretty busy.

31
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,041
Thanks to Mitsugu, I was
able to get a prime location.

32
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,291
[FUTABA]
Of course it was him.

33
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,708
[HAYAMA]
He does "live to serve," eh?

34
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,875
[SHINO]
We're still setting things up,

35
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,708
but it should be ready
to open tomorrow.

36
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,375
[HAYAMA]
Awesome. Can't wait.

37
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,791
[FUTABA]
I'm curious, though.

38
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,208
What are you going to call
it now that it's out here?

39
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,458
'Cause it's not really
a garden anymore, right?

40
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,416
Secret Garden: Beach-Hut Style!

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,041
[FUTABA, HAYAMA]
Well... Uh...

42
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,958
[HAYAMA]
I'm not so sure about that.

43
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,458
Doesn't have a great ring to it.

44
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,250
Do you think it's
a good name, Yoko?

45
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,791
Be nice or it's back
to the bread crust diet.

46
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,916
Uh, well... It's not so bad...

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,708
I mean, to be totally honest,

48
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,666
I thought it was kind of
a weird name to begin with.

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,375
It is a classic story,
and I can't believe

50
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,791
you've never heard of it.

51
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,625
Well, if that's
what you're going for,

52
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,041
<i>Little Shop of Horrors</i>
might be more appropriate.

53
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,583
Or maybe <i>Little Women</i> .

54
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,583
Very funny.

55
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,208
Can we all please move on now?

56
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,083
We were only
trying to be helpful.

57
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,125
Yes, that's all.

58
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,708
I don't need
your help, thank you.

59
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:17,833
[YAMAJI laughs]

60
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,333
You can forget about
changing her mind,

61
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,375
because she's as
stubborn as she is tiny.

62
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,916
Oh, Yamaji.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,791
So you're not a fan
of the name either?

64
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,791
No.

65
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,250
It's always seemed
strange to me.

66
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,500
I never got what a garden
had to do with cakes.

67
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,958
Let's just drop it.

68
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,833
We're opening the beach hut
version of Secret Garden,

69
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,250
and that's that.

70
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,583
[YOKO]
Um... Sorry.

71
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,708
I do still have one question,
if you don't mind.

72
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,666
You keep saying "beach hut."

73
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,708
What's that?

74
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,750
[BOTH gasp]

75
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,375
[HAYAMA]
Are you serious?

76
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,208
[FUTABA] You've never
heard of a beach hut?

77
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,541
[YAMAJI]
Let's be nice!

78
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,500
It's not her fault she
doesn't know these things.

79
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:54,208
[SHINO] The rich are oblivious
to the world around them.

80
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,083
It's not that I've never
heard of a beach hut before.

81
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,166
I simply don't know
what one is exactly,

82
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,708
or how it's supposed to look.

83
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,416
It's up to you to tell me
precisely what a beach hut is!

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,541
Using interpretive dance!

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,833
I am waves.

86
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,541
I am wind.

87
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,833
This is hopeless.

88
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,041
I can't form a
picture in my mind.

89
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,583
How can I work at a
place I don't understand?

90
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,791
[SHINO]
Sand! I am the sand.

91
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,000
[HAYAMA]
I'm totally lost.

92
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,541
[FUTABA] Just when you thought
she couldn't get weirder.

93
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,750
Well, um, we came
all the way out here

94
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,000
to work, right?

95
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,458
I don't know about you two,

96
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,625
but I was kind of looking
forward to the extra money.

97
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,541
I suppose I'll just
do my best, then.

98
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,833
[HAYAMA] Now that that's
settled, let's get changed.

99
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,125
[YOKO]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

100
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,375
[FUTABA]
I brought some cute outfits!

101
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,791
I gotta tell ya, I'm not
totally the biggest fan

102
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,041
of this stupid beach
hut idea of yours.

103
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,958
I don't see what's
so great about sunburns

104
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,625
and sand in your shoes.

105
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,791
And if any boys so much
as look at Miss Yoko

106
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,125
the wrong way, they'll have to
answer to my trusty bat!

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,750
Will they?
I'm sure they're terrified.

108
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,250
I dunno, what do you think?

109
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,083
What should I do?

110
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
[FUTABA]
Yum! What is this?

111
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,708
It's delicious! Wow!

112
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,541
It's like a party in my mouth!

113
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,958
Mmm! I don't know.

114
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,458
Should I try the melon
or the orange next?

115
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,083
It's impossible to decide.
I want them all!

116
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,000
I wonder what that
girl's eating over there.

117
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,250
[GIRL 6A]
Whatever it is, I want some!

118
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,333
Please! Could she
be any more obvious?

119
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,041
You should have let me
be the fake customer.

120
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,000
I would've done a better
job than that ham.

121
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,958
I appreciate her enthusiasm.

122
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,833
[YAMAJI] There are bound to
be a bunch of handsy boys

123
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,041
flocking to Miss Yoko.

124
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,333
I'm going to need
all the help I can get

125
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,833
keeping them at a safe distance.

126
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,250
Somehow, I don't think
that's gonna be an issue.

127
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,208
[SHINO sighs]

128
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,625
[YOKO]
That was a pretty big sigh.

129
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,083
Is something bothering you?

130
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,583
Well, you don't
exactly look like

131
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,958
I thought you were going to.

132
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,500
[YOKO]
I don't?

133
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,125
No. I was thinking more...

134
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,500
[SHINO]
Summer!

135
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,750
Splashing under the bright sun!

136
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,833
Three girls reveling in
their youthful bodies!

137
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,125
[SHINO] The sweet lure
of unblemished flesh.

138
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:31,541
Rivaled only by the sweetness
of the shop's wares.

139
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,666
Secret Garden, beach hut-style!

140
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,958
Open this summer.

141
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:39,041
Come and join the fun! Mwah!

142
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,333
You know, something like that.

143
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,666
[YOKO]
No way!

144
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,375
As if I would let you
flaunt her body like that!

145
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,875
And that whole
disguise bit at the end

146
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,375
was just plain embarrassing.

147
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,250
Could you at least wear
a cute little tank top

148
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,541
or shorts, maybe?

149
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,375
[YOKO] And wind up with
funny-looking tan lines?

150
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,833
I'll pass.

151
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,083
Someone needs to
compensate for the lack of skin

152
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,375
Miss Yoko is showing.

153
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,625
Hayama, I'm changing your
uniform to a bikini!

154
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,666
[HAYAMA] If it's so important,
change your own outfit!

155
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,166
[FUTABA] You keep calling
this place a beach hut,

156
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,250
but it feels more
like a fancy café.

157
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,833
[SHINO] Beach-hut inspired,
with a more elevated cuisine.

158
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,500
Gelato, frappes, and
other fancy desserts.

159
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,666
[FUTABA]
What about ramen?

160
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,708
And curry! And fried noodles?

161
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,375
[SHINO] That would be silly.
We're a dessert shop.

162
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,500
I eat fried noodles
for dessert all the time.

163
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,041
[SHINO]
You would.

164
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,500
[YOKO] Come to Secret Garden:
Beach-Hut Style!

165
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,875
[HAYAMA] Open today!
Secret Garden: Beach-Hut Style!

166
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,208
[FUTABA] Secret Garden:
Beach-Hut Style!

167
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,000
Drop on in!

168
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:33,875
[FUTABA]
Ah, man.

169
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,291
The name's just too complicated.

170
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,125
No wonder people
aren't interested.

171
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,291
Maybe we should try
a different spot?

172
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,666
[FUTABA]
What's that?

173
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,833
[YU]
Yoko! I'm coming!

174
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,208
Yoko!

175
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,000
[GIRLS]
Uh...

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,125
[GIRLS shriek]

177
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,666
[YU]
Yoko!

178
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,666
Why're you here?

179
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,375
I heard you were
working at a beach hut,

180
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,333
and I wanted to show my support,
so I came as fast as I could.

181
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,375
I'll take one of
everything, please!

182
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,791
I don't know if
you want to do that.

183
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,041
There's a big menu and it's
all frozen desserts.

184
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,958
[YU]
Oh, really?

185
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,500
I dunno if I could eat it all.

186
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,958
[FUTABA]
I can help you with that!

187
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,416
She's not kidding.
She eats like a pig.

188
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,708
[YU yells]

189
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,166
Is there such thing as
a permanent brain freeze?

190
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,416
Why not take a break?
You don't have to finish it all.

191
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,458
No!

192
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,708
You made this with
your own hands

193
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,791
and I won't let all your
hard work go to waste!

194
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,250
Sorry it took a little
longer than expected.

195
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,500
It was you?

196
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,083
But I thought Yoko was
making all the desserts.

197
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,000
Nope.

198
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,416
[FUTABA]
What a child.

199
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,041
Messing with a little kid
like that is so immature.

200
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,583
[YAMAJI]
I dunno.

201
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,416
If you ask me, there are worse
things than being immature.

202
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,291
Like being tiny and
evil, for example.

203
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,750
Or like being a stalker.

204
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,916
Or an obsessive
creep with no life.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,750
[SHINO] Since today was
only our soft opening,

206
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,791
I decided to close
the shop early.

207
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,833
Thank you all for
your hard work.

208
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,875
I was happy with our sales,

209
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,083
especially considering
it was just a half-day.

210
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,708
Working on the beach is harder
than I thought it would be.

211
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,875
It's so hot, too!

212
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,000
Stylish turtleneck, by the way.

213
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,166
[SHINO] I thought it would be
nice to celebrate our success

214
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,208
and keep our spirits
high for tomorrow.

215
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,583
How does a barbecue
sound to everybody?

216
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,375
Awesome!

217
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,375
Yeah, thanks!

218
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,708
[YU]
Sure, count me in.

219
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,791
You think that's the
best idea at this point?

220
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,041
[YU]
I'm a man.

221
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,500
This much food is
nothing to me. It's fine.

222
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,458
Especially if you're the one
doing the cooking this time.

223
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,291
All right, everybody!
It's time to eat! Who's hungry?

224
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,625
Jerk!

225
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,708
I think a little barbecue
will brighten your mood.

226
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,125
You really are a jerk.

227
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,750
What was that, ladies?
Did you say something?

228
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,791
If my cooking isn't to
your liking, Master Yu,

229
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,375
I'd be happy to whip
something else up.

230
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,791
[YU] No, don't bother.
I'll just sit this one out.

231
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,708
One more bite and I'd
probably puke, anyway.

232
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,458
Well, I say
bring on the meat!

233
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,541
What about you two?

234
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,708
Absolutely! Bring it on!

235
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,083
[YOKO] There's nothing
better than a good meal

236
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,375
after working all day!

237
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,791
[HAYAMA]
Mm-hmm!

238
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,083
All right, Yamaji! Load me
up with some more veggies,

239
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,708
meat, meat, meat, meat,
meat, meat, and fish!

240
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,666
[YAMAJI groans]

241
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,458
So much for today's profits.

242
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,916
[KOU]
Teru!

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Wow, you're grilling?
That looks like fun!

244
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,458
[HAYAMA]
Why are you here?

245
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,291
I figured it must be hard
work getting a new business

246
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,541
up and running.

247
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,666
So I thought I'd come
and offer to help out.

248
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,583
We're done already.

249
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,666
That was nice of her to come
and check in on us, though.

250
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,875
[SHINO] Would you like Mitsugu
to put together a plate for you?

251
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,791
[KOU]
That would be great. Thanks!

252
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,166
The little cutie's here!

253
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,375
[YU]
Hi again!

254
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,625
You're not eating anything?
That's not good.

255
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,500
A young boy like you
needs plenty of food

256
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,208
to keep your strength up.

257
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,833
I know! You wait here.
I'll make some for you!

258
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,708
[stomach gurgling]

259
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,791
Uh... Thanks.
That sounds great.

260
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:55,916
Poor thing.

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,666
I think this might
be what breaks him.

262
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,208
[FUTABA] Eh, it's just
a little barbecue.

263
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,916
I'm sure he'll be fine.

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,500
[YAMAJI laughs nervously]

265
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,625
[KOU] It's actually better
to eat meat raw.

266
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,458
You get more vitamins that way.

267
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,333
[ALL]
Ugh!

268
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,833
[YAMAJI] I'll call an ambulance
and have them on standby.

269
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:25,541
[FUTABA] Come and cool off at
Secret Garden: Beach-Hut Style!

270
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,291
[HAYAMA]
One mango frappé.

271
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,000
Can I get you anything else?

272
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,125
Our last day of work.

273
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,583
I didn't think we
were gonna make it.

274
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,666
[HAYAMA] It was tough,
but we survived.

275
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,291
[FUTABA] It sucks that
we didn't get to relax

276
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,458
while we were here.

277
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,875
I mean, it's the beach!

278
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,125
We didn't come for a vacation.
We came to work.

279
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,375
It would've been a lot
harder without you two here,

280
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,250
so thanks for letting
me drag you along.

281
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,166
No problem.
Glad we could help.

282
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,125
[YOKO]
Wow, Futaba. You sure are tan.

283
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,625
[HAYAMA]
I was gonna go with "burned."

284
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,208
Well, it's summer, isn't it?

285
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,708
[YOKO]
So what?

286
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,958
Summer means curry, right?
And now I kinda look like curry.

287
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,666
[HAYAMA] You say that
like it's a good thing...

288
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,625
[FUTABA] Anyway, I've got
a farmer's tan now,

289
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,083
and I want to even it out.

290
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,500
Since we won't
be working tomorrow,

291
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,625
I say we go hang out
on the beach!

292
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,500
We haven't been swimming
even once since we came here,

293
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,041
and that's just plain
unacceptable if you ask me!

294
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,500
[YOKO]
That's a great idea!

295
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,166
[HAYAMA] I'm pretty much
done with my homework,

296
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,166
so I'm ready to chill
for the rest of the summer.

297
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,833
Uh, homework?
What is this mysterious word?

298
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,291
I don't think I've
heard it before.

299
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,375
Of course not.

300
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,625
You'd have to pay
attention in class

301
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,791
to be familiar
with that concept.

302
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,833
[SHINO] Since you'll be enjoying
your day off tomorrow,

303
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,416
why don't I make
lunch as a thank you

304
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,708
for all your hard work?

305
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,125
[FUTABA]
Really?

306
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,458
[SHINO] Is there anything
in particular you'd like?

307
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,000
[FUTABA]
Barbecue!

308
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,750
[HAYAMA] We already had that
the first day we were out here.

309
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,291
[FUTABA] What's the
beach without barbecue?

310
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,541
They're a classic pair!

311
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,333
[HAYAMA] Well, there's
the sand and the ocean.

312
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,750
[FUTABA]
Fine, then curry.

313
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,416
[HAYAMA] Not after that
comparison you made earlier.

314
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,958
Leave it to me.

315
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,708
I'm sure I can come up with
something everybody will like.

316
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,041
[FUTABA]
Aw!

317
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,291
Let's just focus on
enjoying the ocean tomorrow.

318
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,416
Good idea!

319
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,375
I bet I can catch me
a fat fish or two.

320
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,500
Not the point!

321
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,208
Woo-hoo! Tomorrow is
gonna be awesome!

322
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,291
Ocean, here we come!

323
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,875
Huh...

324
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,208
Shark can be tricky,

325
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,833
but if it's fresh and
you've got a hot grill...

326
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,250
You're crazy, aren't you?

327
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,500
[FUTABA]
No fair! Go away, shark!

328
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,791
I wanna go swimming!

329
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,208
This really is too bad.

330
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,416
It would have been so much
nicer if it was a dolphin

331
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,708
instead of a shark.

332
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,666
[HAYAMA]
Yep, sure would.

333
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,708
[YU]
Hey, Yoko!

334
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:30,708
[YOKO]
Yu!

335
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,958
You're not working
anymore, right?

336
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,708
So does that mean you
can have a little fun?

337
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,583
We were hoping to,
but the beach is closed.

338
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,583
Shark sighting.

339
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,958
[YU]
No problem!

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,416
[YU] I can get us
into the hotel pool.

341
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,625
How 'bout it? Wanna come?

342
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,250
[YOKO]
If you're sure it's all right.

343
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,416
[YU]
Yeah!

344
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,041
What about lunch?
Can we barbecue there?

345
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,458
You look like you've
already been barbecued.

346
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,958
--[HAYAMA, YOKO] Wow!
--[FUTABA] Wow! It's huge!

347
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,333
[HAYAMA]
And so pretty!

348
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,250
[YOKO] Thanks for bringing us,
Yu. This is perfect!

349
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,458
[YU] Not the ocean,
but it's still nice, right?

350
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,041
[KOU]
This'll be fun!

351
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,958
How long has it been since we've
gone swimming together, Teru?

352
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,291
[HAYAMA]
Um, awhile.

353
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,916
Remember, no running or
diving in the shallow end.

354
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,125
Here's your floatie!

355
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,791
Y'know, suddenly I'm
not so jealous anymore.

356
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,833
[FUTABA] Does anybody
know where Sonobe is?

357
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,375
[YOKO] I guess the cooking's
taking longer than expected.

358
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,875
She said she'd meet
us by lunch, though.

359
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,958
'Kay, last one in the
pool's a rotten egg!

360
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,166
[SAKURA]
Futaba!

361
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,208
[SAKURA]
Hi!

362
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,291
That's Sakura.

363
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,000
Y'know, suddenly
I don't feel so good.

364
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,083
Yeah, I bet you don't.

365
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,166
She kinda has that
effect on people.

366
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,208
My parents took me
here on vacation.

367
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,000
How about you?

368
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,833
Hey!

369
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:42,250
Hi, hunk! Smooch!

370
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,833
I think the damage was more
psychological than physical.

371
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,041
I hope it's nothing
serious, poor kid.

372
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,500
[FUTABA]
Wait, where's Sakura?

373
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,666
She didn't go with him, did she?

374
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,791
He's been through a lot.

375
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,000
Next time you see him,

376
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,333
give 'em a kiss on the
cheek or something.

377
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,958
[YOKO] I guess I owe
him that much.

378
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,583
Okay, there's a big,
beautiful pool waiting for us.

379
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,916
Let's go!

380
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,208
[YOKO]
Right!

381
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,958
[YOKO]
In honor of our fallen warrior.

382
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,916
[KONDO]
Woohoo!

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,625
Can you believe
how awesome this is?

384
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,166
Hotel pools are the best!

385
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,750
Would you stop the
running and squealing?

386
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,916
It's embarrassing.

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,958
[KONDO] If you stop
being a party pooper

388
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,500
and have a little fun!

389
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,958
I mean, you are dressed like
you're ready for a good time!

390
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,625
This? It's just something
I had laying around.

391
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,708
Anyway, thanks for inviting me.

392
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,500
It's pretty cool that you
were able to score tickets

393
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,500
to this place.

394
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,875
[KONDO]
Someone gave them to me.

395
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,333
Oh, really? Who?

396
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,041
[KONDO]
Hayama's older sister Kou.

397
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,791
[NISHIYAMA] But why would she
give them to you of all people?

398
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,666
It was kinda random.

399
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,708
[bell ringing]

400
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,583
How am I gonna
carry all this?

401
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,416
[KONDO]
Excuse me.

402
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,125
I can help if you need it.

403
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,958
That's so sweet!

404
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,875
You helped Hayama's sister.

405
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,291
[KONDO] Yep, and then she
gave me some tickets she'd won.

406
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,666
[NISHIYAMA] How am I
supposed to enjoy myself

407
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,000
knowing that's how you got them?

408
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,833
Well at least it isn't like
the evil one herself is here.

409
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,875
Hey, look.
That's Hayama over there.

410
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,708
Are you kidding me?!

411
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,416
It seems like they're
having a lotta fun.

412
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,750
Who cares? Ignore them.

413
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,291
[KONDO]
Maybe we should say hi.

414
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,708
[NISHIYAMA]
Not a chance.

415
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,541
Look what I found down there!

416
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,500
What are you doing, you idiot?!

417
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,416
Whoa, where'd you come from?

418
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm practicing.

419
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,416
In case I ever go
deep sea fishing.

420
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,333
[NISHIYAMA] How is that
like deep sea fishing?

421
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,875
And, you know,
you might get in trouble

422
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,666
if the hotel people
see you doing that.

423
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,208
Well, that wouldn't be so bad!

424
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,708
[YOKO]
It's your friend, Hayama.

425
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,083
What are you doing here?

426
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,625
You always show up
wherever I am.

427
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,208
Are you following me?

428
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,750
Sorry, but I don't
like you that way.

429
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,500
I'd rather go out with
a rabid dog than you.

430
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,958
[KOU] Hey! You're the nice
girl who helped me before!

431
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,666
Thanks again for the tickets!
This place rules!

432
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,000
It's a freakin' party.

433
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,583
[KOU] I don't think you've
mentioned this friend

434
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,000
before, Teru.

435
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,333
This is Nishiyama. I'd consider
her more of a classmate.

436
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,833
How great!

437
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,041
Since you're here too, why
don't we all hang out together?

438
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,541
Uh... No! I can't!

439
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,208
There're already some
friends here I have to meet.

440
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,791
You've got other friends?

441
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,291
[NISHIYAMA]
Come on, let's get out of here.

442
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,625
[KONDO]
Wait for me!

443
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,708
Well, I guess I can go
finish my sandcastle now.

444
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,625
Come on, Teru!

445
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,833
Don't you want to take a
dip in the pool real quick?

446
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,041
[HAYAMA] No, I don't.
And you should know why!

447
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,375
[FUTABA]
That explains the floatie!

448
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,750
You can't swim.

449
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,208
[YOKO]
I never would've guessed that.

450
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,333
Swimming's a pretty
important skill to have.

451
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,125
Like, what if you're
on a boat and it sinks

452
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,875
in the middle of the
ocean or something?

453
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,416
That's a good point!

454
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,958
Why don't you let us help you
work on your swimming today?

455
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,375
You never know when
it might come in handy.

456
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,791
When do you think it
might come in handy?

457
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,458
Now!

458
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,625
Thanks a lot, Sis!

459
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,583
[screaming]

460
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,708
Huh...

461
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,958
They're so different,
yet so similar.

462
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,333
[HAYAMA panting]

463
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,583
[KOU] Get back in there
and keep on trying.

464
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,458
You'll get better if
you give it some time.

465
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,666
[HAYAMA]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

466
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,250
I just don't
understand why anyone

467
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,750
would hate the water so much.

468
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,791
[HAYAMA]
Mainly because it can kill me!

469
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,083
I've lasted this long not
knowing how to swim.

470
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,125
And I really don't see
any particular reason

471
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,875
to change that now,
because I think

472
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,750
I'm perfectly fine
just the way I am.

473
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,083
Of course you are.

474
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,458
Totally.

475
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,125
[KOU] Come on! We'll go
practice in the kiddie pool.

476
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,375
[HAYAMA]
No!

477
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,291
[FUTABA]
Good luck!

478
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,541
[YOKO]
I know you can do it!

479
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,791
[SHINO]
Hey, everyone!

480
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,166
[KOU]
Hi!

481
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,166
[SHINO] Hope you're hungry.
I come bearing lunch.

482
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,583
I've never been so relieved!

483
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,708
[YOKO] You took a lot
longer than expected.

484
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,875
[SHINO]
I know, I'm sorry.

485
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,541
I was working with
some new ingredients,

486
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,666
so I needed a little extra time.

487
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,291
Here you are.
I hope you enjoy it.

488
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,916
[FUTABA]
This is so exciting!

489
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,833
[YAMAJI] It was my first
time too, and I gotta say,

490
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,458
it was pretty exciting.

491
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,458
[HAYAMA] Y'know... you guys
aren't looking so good.

492
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,625
What happened to you?

493
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,875
What can I say?
It was a pretty wild ride.

494
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,208
And harder than expected.

495
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,500
But we were able to get
hold of a rare ingredient,

496
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,916
so it was worth it in the end.

497
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,791
What do you mean by
a rare ingredient?

498
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,333
[YAMAJI] Let's just say
I don't think that shark

499
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,791
will be bothering us anymore.

500
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,125
I would still skip
the swimming, though.

501
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,208
Tons of jellyfish out there.

502
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,000
Hold on, I'm still confused.

503
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,750
Are you saying...?

504
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,083
--Yummy!
--Did you really just eat that?

505
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,083
[FUTABA gasps]

506
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,750
I think I got a fin.

507
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,666
That's cute, isn't it?

508
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,291
Being in the sun all day
can really wear you out.

509
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,416
You can use me as
a pillow if you want.

510
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,916
I don't mind.
That's what big sisters are for.

511
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,791
Thanks for the offer,
but I'm good.

512
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,500
And what about you?
Want a shoulder to lean on?

513
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,291
I would feel silly sleeping
in public like that.

514
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,041
Fine, just one more bite.

515
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,000
[giggles]
I'm not surprised.

516
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,250
[YOKO]
Was she sleep talking?

517
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,666
Oh, sure.

518
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,583
She's probably having a feast
in her dream right now.

519
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,500
If I go to sleep, will I get
to dream about having a feast?

520
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,041
[HAYAMA]
That's not really how it works.

521
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,000
Go to sleep, Yoko.
Close your eyes and sleep.

522
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,458
Go to sleep.

523
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,708
I don't think it'll work
if you're trying that hard.

524
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,625
Sleep's kinda more
about relaxing, ya know?

525
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,083
[YOKO]
You must sleep.

526
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,833
[HAYAMA]
Um, Yoko...

527
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:16,083
[YOKO] You must sleep now.
Eyes closed. Deep breath.

528
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,125
Sleep. Go to sleep!

529
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,791
[FUTABA]
I can't eat another bite.

530
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,791
But I can. Probably.

531
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:54,875
[HAYAMA]
Seriously?

532
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,791
[YOKO] I cannot.
I cannot eat anymore.

533
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,708
I will take the rest to-go.

534
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,291
I cannot?
[whines]

535
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,416
[HAYAMA]
A nightmare.
