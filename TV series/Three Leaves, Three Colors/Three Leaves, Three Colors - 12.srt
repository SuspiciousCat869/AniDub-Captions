1
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,416
[YOKO]
Off to school!

2
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,166
[FUTABA]
Good morning!

3
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,166
[YOKO]
Oh... good morning, Futaba...

4
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,041
...how are... you?

5
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:49,916
I'm doing great...
Thank you so much for asking!

6
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,666
[FUTABA]
It's gorgeous out.

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,083
But on the forecast,

8
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,833
they said there's a good
chance of rain this afternoon...

9
00:00:58,916 --> 00:00:59,916
Can you believe that?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,750
I'm super bummed about it.

11
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,458
Hey, that hurts.
What are you doing?

12
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,583
Ow...

13
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,916
You... are behaving
very strangely...

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,333
What's wrong with you?

15
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,250
Uh... what's wrong with me...?

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,458
You're the one who's
acting weird, Yoko.

17
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,041
[YOKO]
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,541
[HAYAMA]
Wait up. Coming.

19
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,541
Man, I am definitely gonna
fall asleep in class...

20
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,166
I almost slept through my alarm,

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,041
so it's lucky I'm even
going to school at all.

22
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,750
Heh. Well, I had to skip
breakfast, but we can't be late!

23
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,208
What are you saying?!

24
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:32,833
All right...

25
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,166
Game's up...
I know what this is.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,250
[BOTH]
What what is?

27
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,791
I've heard of
these pranks before...

28
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,500
It's a hidden
camera type of thing...

29
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,958
You've had your fun...
but that's enough...

30
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,916
As they say "the jig is up."

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,375
Honestly, you two...

32
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,916
How long did you think you
would be able to fool me...?

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Your acting skills leave a
lot to be desired, you know.

34
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,500
[laughs]

35
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,000
Hayama, I'm scared...

36
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,041
Why's Yoko acting
so strangely...?

37
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,125
Do you think she's sick?

38
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,416
Should we get help?

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,875
[YOKO]
I'm not being weird, okay?!

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,708
It took two months,

41
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,458
but I finished crocheting
my lace yesterday...

42
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,666
I'm so excited!
Do you want to see it?

43
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,791
Sounds like a
waste of time to me...

44
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,625
If you want lace so bad,
then just buy it.

45
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,333
[FUTABA]
Aw... Don't tease me!

46
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,833
you know this is my hobby...

47
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,958
Look at it. Isn't it the cutest?

48
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,000
Nope, sorry...

49
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,000
that's the lamest hobby ever.

50
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,333
Oh, hi!

51
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,291
Why're you hiding?
Is something wrong?

52
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,791
[YOKO]
So even when I'm not around,

53
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,083
they're still like this...

54
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,291
What is going on with those two?

55
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,750
[BOTH]
Huh?

56
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,958
[NISHIYAMA]
Um... Excuse me.

57
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,833
I... well...

58
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,833
I was wondering...
um... I just...

59
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,291
Jeez, spit it out already.

60
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,666
What's the deal?

61
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,875
Well... you haven't
turned the worksheet in yet...

62
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,125
I've collected everybody
else's already...

63
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,333
...and... since I have to give
them to the teacher all at once,

64
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,708
can I have yours, please?

65
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,750
Whoops...

66
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,916
I guess I forgot
to do it, sorry...

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,750
Why don'tcha just take
care of it for me, kay?

68
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,166
Since you're class rep and all.

69
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,791
[NISHIYAMA]
Uh! But... I can't...

70
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,041
[YOKO]
Ah. I get it now...

71
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,708
This is all just a dream.

72
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,083
You should turn it in so
Nishiyama can do her job

73
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,375
and you don't get in trouble
with the teacher... Please!

74
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,500
Jeez...

75
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,750
You look like
you're about to cry...

76
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,833
Fine, I'll take care of it.

77
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,666
[YOKO]
What an awful, awful dream.

78
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,625
[NISHIYAMA]
I hate Hayama so much...!

79
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:24,041
I hate her, I hate
her, I hate her...

80
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,583
She's a
good-for-nothin' troublemaker

81
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,958
who doesn't care about
anyone but herself,

82
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,708
and one of these days,
she's gonna pay...

83
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,625
I'll teach her to
treat me with respect!

84
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,458
She's different, too.

85
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,625
[KONDO]
That's enough slacking off!

86
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,666
Look how upset
you've made Nishiyama...

87
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,000
Now hurry up and
turn your work in already!

88
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,125
Calm down, will ya?

89
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,125
I'm doing it right now.

90
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,625
You should be nicer to her.

91
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,416
It's not like she's class rep
because she wants to be!

92
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,625
Nobody else felt like
having all the extra work

93
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,916
and responsibility,
so poor, timid Nishiyama

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,916
got stuck with the job...

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,083
She can't speak up for herself,

96
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,875
so when the teacher asked,
she just agreed.

97
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,583
I guess nothing
will change the way

98
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,625
those two feel about each other.

99
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,500
So tired...!

100
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,041
I could take a nap right here.

101
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,458
You can't do that...!

102
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,958
If you fall asleep now,
you'll miss afternoon classes.

103
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,666
[HAYAMA]
Just five minutes.

104
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,666
[YOKO]
This is too strange...

105
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,541
I don't know how
long I can take it.

106
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,875
They probably
aren't the only ones

107
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,250
who are different...

108
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,541
I wonder what everyone
else is like in this dream.

109
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,791
[laughing]

110
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,250
Whee...! I hate
the world so much!

111
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,583
It's full of nothing
but anger and despair.

112
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,791
Maybe I should
just take this bat

113
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,750
and break all the
windows in the school...

114
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,375
Or I could steal a motorcycle,

115
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,083
except I don't know how to drive
one so I'd probably just die.

116
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,833
Oh, well!

117
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,416
Wow, your sister
is always getting

118
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,708
into all kinds of trouble.

119
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,208
She's got such a bad girl
streak, doesn't she?

120
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,291
Of course.

121
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,625
She totally knows
how to let loose,

122
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,708
unlike some people.

123
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,208
Is that...? Yamaji!

124
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,833
Excuse me, Nishikawa...

125
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,208
Is that how you
address a teacher?

126
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,666
Uh.

127
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,333
I'm so shocked,
I don't know what to say.

128
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,541
What are you doing...?

129
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,875
Have you lost your mind...?

130
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,666
You just punched a teacher!

131
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,583
Oh, whoops... My hand slipped.

132
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,333
I can't believe
you just did that!

133
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,541
And as a matter of fact,
I didn't punch him...

134
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,083
That was clearly a slap.

135
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,666
There is a difference, you know.

136
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,458
That's what we're
gonna focus on?

137
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,708
Inexcusable...!

138
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,208
That kind of violence
is not tolerated here...

139
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,333
Report to the principal's
office immediately.

140
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,041
If somebody has a problem,
they're welcome to come to me.

141
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,083
[YAMAJI] You're only getting
yourself into more trouble.

142
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:41,958
He's right!

143
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,041
You have to stop! This is crazy!

144
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,083
[SHINO] Now, now...
What's all the fuss about?

145
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,291
[SHINO]
Class will be starting soon...

146
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,708
Return to your rooms at once...

147
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,291
Unless what
you really want--is...

148
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,416
...to experience the
kind of punishment

149
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,875
only Ms. Shino can offer.

150
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,125
[SHINO] That's it.
That's where it ended.

151
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,375
Such a good dream!

152
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,958
[BOTH]
You call that a good dream?!

153
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,791
Where do you come up
with these things...?

154
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,708
Everyone knows
how nice I am to Yamaji.

155
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,791
I would never mistreat
him in such a way.

156
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,416
No... 'course not.

157
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,583
Too bad I woke up right
at the best part...

158
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,833
Maybe if I try really hard,

159
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,041
I can have the same
dream again tonight.

160
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,333
I hafta say...

161
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,666
I'm not a big fan of
the way I came off in it.

162
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,333
It's a dream, nothing personal.

163
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,583
You were weird,

164
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,166
but I wasn't too
different from the real me...

165
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,666
Least I wasn't violent.

166
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,958
I didn't think you were
even in the dream, were you?

167
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:37,666
Oh, come on!

168
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,041
That was obviously me!

169
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,500
[HAYAMA]
It does sound kinda fun

170
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,875
to be a different version
of yourself, doesn't it?

171
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,458
Especially for you,

172
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,625
since you're usually hiding
your real personality, right?

173
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,583
Eh, heh...

174
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,791
[SAKURA] Oh, there you are...!
Wait up, wait up!

175
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,541
[FUTABA]
Sakura!

176
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,291
[SAKURA]
Well, what do you think...?

177
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,916
Isn't it awesome?
I gave myself a total makeover!

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,208
You look adorable.

179
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,041
I know, right?

180
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,250
That's what I was going for,

181
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,208
and I think I totally
nailed it, too...!

182
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,958
So... you know how I'm
gonna be a famous pop idol

183
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,375
when I grow up, right?

184
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,291
Oh yeah...

185
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,708
How could we forget?

186
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,708
I thought maybe you could
listen to one of my songs

187
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,583
if you're not busy right now.

188
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,416
I need to practice
singing in front of people

189
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,416
so I don't get stage fright.

190
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,791
So young and pretty,
like a flower in the spring!

191
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,541
If you want to keep me,
you'd better buy a ring!

192
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,166
Do you know how lucky you
are to have me in your life?

193
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,416
My love will pierce
you like the sharpest knife!

194
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,375
You must know that someday,
I will be your wife!

195
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,958
You will never look at another
girl for as long as you live!

196
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,083
[FUTABA]
Ugh... my poor ears...!

197
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,375
[HAYAMA] Compared
to the way this girl sings,

198
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,375
my sister's actually on key.

199
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,875
[FUTABA]
Please... you gotta stop this!

200
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,750
[HAYAMA] You might want to
practice a little more alone

201
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,750
before performing
in front of people.

202
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,125
[FUTABA]
Yeah...

203
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,250
I heard once that if you're
tone-deaf you can put

204
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,875
a bucket over your
head and it'll help.

205
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,458
[HAYAMA]
Do that!

206
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,583
[HAYAMA]
Oh-kay...

207
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,833
[FUTABA]
She's really doing it...

208
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,208
[SAKURA]
I found a bucket...

209
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,166
So I sing like this?

210
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,875
[FUTABA]
Yeah... I guess.

211
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,041
I've never really
seen it done before.

212
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,541
[SAKURA]
So young and pretty, like--!

213
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,375
[SAKURA]
So young and pretty, like a--!

214
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,208
[YOKO]
Are you all right?

215
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,166
[SAKURA]
I'm... not so sure about that...

216
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,166
I think I might throw up.

217
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,041
[FUTABA] Good thing
we have a bucket then, huh?

218
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,250
[FUTABA]
I don't know...

219
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,541
[YOKO] I tried to do it
like Sakura had hers.

220
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,541
Hey...! I have an idea.

221
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,291
How about like this? Well?

222
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,833
This would keep it from getting
in my way all the time.

223
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,916
It's missing something,

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,583
but I can't put
my finger on what...

225
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,250
Oh I got it...! Glasses, please.

226
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,791
Glasses aren't some
kind of requirement

227
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,208
for wearing braids, you know.

228
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,166
[YOKO] Hmmm... Maybe I should
stop trying different styles

229
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,333
and just cut it shorter.

230
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,166
Why would you do
something like that...?!

231
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,666
Cutting your gorgeous
locks would be a tragedy!

232
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,041
I don't know, I think it might
make for a nice change...

233
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,083
and with all these split-ends,

234
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,500
it would look a
lot healthier, too.

235
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,000
Besides, long hair
requires a lot

236
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,791
of shampoo and conditioner,
and that can get expensive.

237
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,500
No...! You can't do it!

238
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,000
Just think of all the years
of effort that will be wasted

239
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,291
if you cut it...

240
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,750
I mean, you've been
growing your hair out ever

241
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,291
since you were a little girl.

242
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,375
[FUTABA]
Yamaji's right...

243
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,750
You shouldn't do it.

244
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,916
[HAYAMA]
What if you cut it

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,583
and then you didn't
like how it looked?

246
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,791
I've always thought your hair
was pretty much perfect,

247
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,708
so, you don't need to
change a thing about it.

248
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,125
You really think it suits me?

249
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,916
Even girls who used
to be rich like you,

250
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,041
can always rock
a princess haircut.

251
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,333
Does what actually looks
good factor in anywhere?

252
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,583
[YOKO] Thanks for coming.
Have a good day!

253
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,083
I've got this down...

254
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,208
Don't you think I've honed
my skills as a cashier...?

255
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,625
I'd consider myself a
professional at this point.

256
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,666
[YAMAJI] You're
absolutely magnificent...!

257
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,083
The best in the world
at anything you do...!

258
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,000
Definitely a professional!

259
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,041
[FUTABA]
Yeah it's very... impressive.

260
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,833
Well... I was shocked when she
got a job in the first place,

261
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,125
so I guess I should
be impressed.

262
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,000
She's like a flower
that grows quickly

263
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,875
when watered with
praise and adoration.

264
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,208
[HIYORI] Look, here it is...!
We found it...

265
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,833
This is the shop
I was telling you about,

266
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,625
the one from the flyer.

267
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,166
[bell chimes]

268
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,458
Welcome! How can I
help you today?

269
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,458
Wow!

270
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,500
What should I get?

271
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,375
They all look so yummy!

272
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,333
[YOKO]
Uh...

273
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,791
What's up? Is something wrong?

274
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,000
Um...

275
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,875
[inaudible]

276
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,208
[SEI]
Nishikawa...? Hi.

277
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,291
Hey, who's that?

278
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,958
[YAMAJI]
A school friend... from before.

279
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,791
It's nice to see you, Osakabe!

280
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,500
Uh! You know her?

281
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,833
Uh. I do, actually...

282
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,458
We were in the same grade
at my previous school.

283
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,916
Ooh... Mannenro
Girls' Academy, right...?

284
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,708
The school where
all the rich girls go.

285
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,916
I didn't know that rich girls
had after-school jobs...

286
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Wait... are you doing it
to learn about the real world?

287
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,791
Actually... my
circumstances changed,

288
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,458
and I'm not what anyone
would call a rich girl now...

289
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,125
I took this job because
I really needed the money.

290
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,000
Ahhhhh...

291
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,541
[YOKO]
We have a large selection,

292
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,125
but these two cakes are our
seasonal recommendations.

293
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,791
[HIYORI] Great.
I'll take one of each, please!

294
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,250
You're right, Yamaji...

295
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,500
I've never seen anything

296
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,166
that was more professional
in my whole life.

297
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,916
Hey, you know...

298
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,125
[SEI] You can give me
a call if you'd like...

299
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,333
Here's my number.

300
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,125
I'd be happy to help
if you ever need it,

301
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,500
so please feel free
to get in touch.

302
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,083
Keep up the hard work,

303
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,125
and I'm sure
everything will be fine.

304
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,333
Thanks for coming.
Have a nice day!

305
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,500
[ALL]
Miss Yoko, are you okay?!

306
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,500
[FUTABA]
Take it easy for now.

307
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,916
You were amazing!

308
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,125
A total professional!
No one could have done better!

309
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,083
Please, it couldn't
have been easier.

310
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,750
Only an amateur would
let something like

311
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,625
that trip them up.

312
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,166
[YOKO] I don't know why
you all seem so surprised.

313
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,375
I told you, I'm a
professional...

314
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,958
[SHINO] Nothing is
more important to you

315
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,291
than your pride,

316
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,958
but you didn't even flinch
when it was threatened!

317
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,625
Now... if you will excuse me,

318
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,458
I believe I will
take a short break...

319
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,375
I'm a bit thirsty,
so I could use a drink.

320
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,875
That's mayonnaise!

321
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,250
[HAYAMA] Heard you had
a rough day yesterday.

322
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,083
It wasn't so awful, really.

323
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,500
It is difficult to have
people from my former life

324
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,291
see my reduced circumstances,

325
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,291
but the fact is, I can't
go back to being who I was.

326
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:19,125
This is the person I am now,
and I think I can accept that.

327
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,083
Wow, that's mature!

328
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,916
[FUTABA]
Good morning!

329
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,166
Isn't the weather
today beautiful?

330
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,916
So bright and sunshiny!

331
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,875
So what's new?!

332
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,875
Hey, that hurts.
What are you doing?

333
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,000
That's exactly what
you did to her in the dream!

334
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,416
[SAKURA]
You're such a slob!

335
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,708
You need more feminine charm.

336
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,416
Really...?

337
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,833
Why would you say that?

338
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,541
For starters, you're
shoveling food into your face

339
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,125
like a starving monkey!

340
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,208
I spend half the day
with a bucket on my head

341
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,083
because I'm committed
to my dream...!

342
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,041
Maybe you should try putting
effort into something.

343
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,708
Can you believe
she said that to me?

344
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,500
Well...

345
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,291
I never realized
that I was lacking

346
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,875
in the feminine
charm department...

347
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,583
So I decided that
I would prove to everyone

348
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,791
how dainty and girly I can be...

349
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,958
Tee-hee!

350
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,625
You've really
inspired me, Miss Yoko...

351
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,708
I'm going to work
just as hard as you have!

352
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,500
I know you can do it!

353
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,958
Cute...!

354
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,250
Look at the pretty little
birdies having a nice chat.

355
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,000
You're breaking
out in spots all over...!

356
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,583
I think you have hives!

357
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,791
These are really delicious!

358
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:29,833
Yeah, they sure are.

359
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:30,625
Hey...!

360
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,875
You want a piece, Odagiri?

361
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,208
Oh, no thank you...

362
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,458
I really appreciate the
generous offer, though...

363
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,958
Tee-hee!

364
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,416
[KONDO]
Uh... are you feeling okay?

365
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,958
Maybe you should go
to the nurse's office.

366
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,291
It's almost lunchtime...

367
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,833
I shouldn't have
sweets right now.

368
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,208
[NISHIYAMA]
You sure you don't want one...?

369
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,708
They're burnt milk caramels.

370
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,166
It's okay. Really, I'll pass.

371
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,125
[KONDO]
You know you're drooling?

372
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,125
[KONDO] So... you don't
think you're girly enough?

373
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,625
If you're looking for pointers,

374
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,666
that's something I should be
able to help you out with...

375
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,625
I maintain a strict beauty
regimen, and it does wonders.

376
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,250
Yeah? What kinda
stuff do you do?

377
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,500
I take rose supplements

378
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,625
and wear perfume to keep
myself smelling nice...

379
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,375
I do stretches to keep
myself limber and flexible...

380
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,041
I do crunches and leg-lifts--

381
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,250
which keeps my figure
trim and well-toned...

382
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,500
I moisturize and exfoliate and
do the occasional chemical peel.

383
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,958
How do you find
time to sleep?

384
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,958
Amazing...! You must spend hours

385
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,000
every day trying to
improve your appearance!

386
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,916
Well, yeah... I want
to better myself...

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,125
You got a problem with that?!

388
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,583
[FUTABA]
My lucky number is three...

389
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,208
My lucky color is yellow.

390
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,875
What is that, your horoscope?

391
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,500
That's pretty girly,
isn't it...?

392
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,625
I think I heard before
that girls like looking

393
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,791
at their horoscopes.

394
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,208
[HAYAMA]
We sure do.

395
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,833
[HAJIME]
Hey, where are you going?

396
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,791
I thought you'd be stopping
by Mr. Stuffed's for sure today.

397
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:47,958
[FUTABA]
Huh?

398
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:48,875
I can't believe you
haven't heard about

399
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,416
his new yellow
curry challenge!

400
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,708
All you gotta do is eat three
kilos and your meal is free!

401
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,000
Yellow! And three?!

402
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,041
[HAYAMA, YOKO]
Just let it go.

403
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,500
No... I can't.

404
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,500
[HAJIME]
What?!

405
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't think I
could ever finish

406
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,750
three kilograms
of food at once...

407
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,375
I'm a dainty little girl.

408
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,125
[HAJIME] What are you doing,
trying to make a fool of me?!

409
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,583
You're Futaba Odagiri!

410
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,791
Don't give up on a challenge
without even trying...!

411
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,333
It's disrespectful to all
those who have lost to you!

412
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,708
Just be yourself...
Go stuff your face.

413
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,958
I second that...

414
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,833
I think the best version
of you is the one

415
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,375
that's smiling the brightest.

416
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,708
[FUTABA gasping]
Okay!

417
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,458
Yum!

418
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,041
Feminine charm level: zero.

419
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,541
[FUTABA]
Thanks for the grub. See ya!

420
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,833
[HAJIME] One of these
days, I'll beat you!

421
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,416
[KOU] Futaba! I heard you were
trying to become more girly...

422
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,875
How's it going so far?

423
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,166
[FUTABA]
Uh... well... you know...

424
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,916
After Teru told me about
it, I made this for you.

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,791
[FUTABA]
Stop right there!

426
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,166
I don't want any soup made

427
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,666
from scary, disgusting,
unpronounceable ingredients!

428
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,000
[KOU]
Uh...

429
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,708
It's not soup...
See, it's a drink.

430
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,333
[FUTABA] I think you're
missing the point.

431
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,625
Here.

432
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,208
[HAYAMA]
Drink up... Better you than me.

433
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,875
I brought enough for everybody.

434
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,958
[YU] What happened?
You look different.

435
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,208
You think it worked?

436
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,625
Have our feminine charm
levels really increased?

437
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,208
[YOKO] I didn't think
that we had plans

438
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,625
to meet up today... did we?

439
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,416
[YU] I just had
something to tell you...

440
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,000
My dad said he has
a job for your dad.

441
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,916
Really?! He's going
to hire my father?

442
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,125
That's awesome!
I'm so happy for you.

443
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,666
I'm sure he's gonna want
something in return.

444
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,500
Thank you so, so much...

445
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,416
I don't know how
I can ever repay you.

446
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,708
[YU gasps]
Oh, I dunno...

447
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,166
Maybe you could sign a marriage
application or something.

448
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,708
Well, y'know...

449
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,458
It's not like it would be real
or anything, just for fun...

450
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,833
Like playing pretend.

451
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,916
Hey... that sounds
like a great game.

452
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,333
Let's go play right now!

453
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,625
If anyone needs us,

454
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,875
we'll be submitting
our marriage application.

455
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,791
Ahh! Let me go!

456
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,916
[SAKURA] Did you know I've
been practicing my singing...?

457
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,583
--You wanna hear some?
--[YU] No!

458
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,291
[SAKURA] So young and
pretty, like a flower...!

459
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,833
He's a pushy little guy...

460
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,000
But I don't think he stands
a chance against Sakura.

461
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,750
I am Yoko...

462
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,541
Daughter of the
Nishikawa family.

463
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,791
My father will soon
be gainfully employed

464
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,250
at a respectable company.

465
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,583
[FUTABA]
Whoa!

466
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,583
[HAYAMA]
How fantastically normal!

467
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,583
This is going to change
everything for me!

468
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,708
I won't have to be such
a miser or salivate

469
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,125
over every little scrap of food.

470
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,875
[SASAME]
Um... hi...

471
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,916
I kinda have
something for you...

472
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,333
It's a gift... from me!

473
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,333
For the Valentine's chocolates.

474
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,666
[gasps]

475
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,291
[SASAME] I had a hard time
deciding what to get...

476
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,291
I thought cookies
would be a good idea,

477
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,375
but I wanted the gift
to be useful, too.

478
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,708
You mean... They're mine?
They're all for me?

479
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,958
Yep, that's our Yoko.

480
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,083
It'll take her some
time to adjust.

481
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,583
[HAYAMA] Hold on...
Isn't White Day next week?

482
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,166
What?!

483
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,416
[YOKO sighs]

484
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,208
Still thinking about
them, aren't ya?

485
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,958
I know, I am absolutely
pitiful, aren't I...?

486
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,500
How long have we
been friends now,

487
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,083
and I haven't changed a bit
since the day I met you two.

488
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,375
Are you kidding me?
You've changed a ton!

489
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,958
You really think I have?

490
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,958
Do you remember what
you said when we met?

491
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,041
"I don't recall asking
you to join me...!

492
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,541
Honestly, how rude!"

493
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:28,166
You sounded just like
a stereotypical rich girl.

494
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,958
A rare and dangerous species...!

495
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,458
So special!

496
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,541
What?

497
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,416
What are you even talking about?

498
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,333
Do you mean endangered species?

499
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,333
Right...

500
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,500
...is that what they call it

501
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,250
when there aren't
very many left of them?

502
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,708
I don't understand why

503
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,708
we're talking about animals
all of a sudden... Sorry.

504
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,250
Hey, do they call
them endangered

505
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,458
'cause they're in
danger of going extinct?

506
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,916
Yup, that's why it's so
important to protect them.

507
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,416
I'm lost...

508
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,375
I honestly don't get what
this has to do with anything.

509
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,916
[BOTH laughing]

510
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,166
[FUTABA] Uh! Another
endangered species!

511
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,166
Huh?!

512
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,416
[HAYAMA]
Good thing...

513
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,875
The world doesn't need
any more of those in it.

514
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,000
The world doesn't need
any more of what?!

515
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,875
I'm pretty sure they were
talking about you.

516
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,208
Me, why?

517
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,333
That species is already
being protected, though...

518
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,833
...by Kondo.

519
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,625
[YAMAJI]
Why are you wearing that again?!

520
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,041
Come back here!

521
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,750
A strange and fearsome beast.

522
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,833
I don't think we should
get too close to it...

523
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:21,875
Sonobe!

524
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,708
C'mon! We need to
get out of here.

525
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,208
I hear they'll charge
if you make eye contact.

526
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,250
[HAYAMA]
Another one!

527
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,833
[FUTABA] This one's poisonous...
Beware its venom!

528
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,791
Run away!

529
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,791
[YOKO] Where are you going...?
Wait for me!

530
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,541
[YOKO]
What's gotten into you?

531
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,625
[ALL laughing]

532
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,041
[YOKO]
I thought you should know,

533
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,291
I am graduating
from bread crusts.

534
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,750
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Yeah...?!

535
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,166
Today I thought I would try

536
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,208
a bowl of instant
<i>yakisoba</i> noodles.

537
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,041
[HAYAMA, FUTABA]
Wow!

538
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,791
[FUTABA screams]

539
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,083
[FUTABA]
No... I couldn't stop her!

540
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:10,583
It's all over now. She
put the sauce in first.

541
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:15,416
You can't eat it like that...!
It's a total noodle fail!

542
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,916
[YOKO]
Huh?

543
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,375
[FUTABA]
Aww, look at her.

544
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,083
[HAYAMA]
She's so cute when she pouts.

545
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,541
[YOKO]
I don't care if they're ruined.

546
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,291
It's not like I enjoy
instant noodles, anyway.

547
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,208
They're such a hassle.

548
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,250
[YOKO] Bread crusts are
inexpensive, abundant,

549
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,125
and delicious.

550
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,000
[FUTABA]
You brought some?

551
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,958
[YOKO]
Mm-hm.

552
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,458
[BOTH laugh]

553
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
[laughs]
