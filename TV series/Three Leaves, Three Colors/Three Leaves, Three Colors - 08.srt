00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,416
[HAYAMA]
Why is Nishiyama here?

2
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,916
[NISHIYAMA]
Why is Hayama here?

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,541
[NISHIYAMA] Are those tears?
Hayama's crying?

4
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,041
[YOKO]
That was strange.

5
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,125
She's all alone.
I wonder what's going on.

6
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,250
[SHINO]
Here!

7
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:54,083
[NISHIYAMA cooing, giggling]

8
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,250
Now, now. Let's all
play nice, okay?

9
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,583
I've got plenty of
love for everybody.

10
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,708
Nishiyama, your drink's
ready whenever you are.

11
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,166
Oh, thanks!

12
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,791
Kono's gotten
so big, hasn't she?

13
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,500
[laughs] She's quite the
little troublemaker now.

14
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,875
[door opens]

15
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,291
Welcome to Tricky Cat!
Is a counter seat all right?

16
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,416
[KOU]
Sure!

17
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,083
[KOU]
Hey, sleepyhead! You awake?

18
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,916
I've got a surprise for you!

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,666
[HAYAMA yawns]

20
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,541
[KOU giggling]

21
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,833
[KOU] I found a shop I
think you're gonna like.

22
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,291
It should be just up ahead.

23
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,541
Yeah? What kind
of place is it?

24
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,166
Oh, you'll see.

25
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,375
I think it's absolutely
perfect for you.

26
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,208
Come on, let's go in!

27
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,041
No! I can't!

28
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,791
I would be cheating on Bel!

29
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,333
It's cruel to
tempt me like that!

30
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,125
Relax. We'll just hang
out for a little bit.

31
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,958
You know you want to.

32
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,416
[HAYAMA]
Here. Might as well use this.

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,708
So you were already
planning to come here.

34
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:20,166
I heard about it a while ago.

35
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,916
I wish you had told me this
was where we were going.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,041
I couldn't.

37
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,958
I wanted it to be
a surprise for you.

38
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,250
[HAYAMA]
I don't have my camera,

39
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,375
so I'll have to use my
potato of a cellphone.

40
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,291
Poor baby!

41
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,541
[HAYAMA]
Why is Nishiyama here?

42
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,291
[NISHIYAMA]
Why is Hayama here?

43
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,458
[HAYAMA] This was supposed to
be a special experience.

44
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,500
She's going to ruin it!

45
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,583
Look! It's your friend.
The one we saw at the beach.

46
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,916
Oh, hello.
Nice to see you again.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,333
That's Nishiyama.
And she's just a classmate.

48
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,875
Hey!

49
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,708
Weren't you one of the people
who helped Teru out before?

50
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,458
You adopted one of
the abandoned kittens

51
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,708
that she found, right?

52
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,333
Uh, yeah?

53
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,541
That's so sweet!

54
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,125
So what did you
end up naming her?

55
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh. I guess I forgot to ask.

56
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,791
Gimme a break. Like you care.

57
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,458
We named ours
Little Beelzebub.

58
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,916
You know, like the
lord of the flies,

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,458
'cause the poor thing
was swarming with them

60
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,416
when we found it.

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,916
It's Bel for short, though.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,625
I wanted my little one
to have a name

63
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,250
that reflects my undying love,

64
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,083
so I decided to call her
Eternal. She's "El" for short.

65
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,916
--[HAYAMA giggles]
--[NISHIYAMA] What?!

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,791
Nothing. That's a
very creative name.

67
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:25,750
Yep. I can just imagine you
pouring through a thesaurus.

68
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,333
[KOU]
Hey, Teru.

69
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,041
Have you heard the names of all
the kitties they've got here?

70
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,083
Princess Konohana Sakuya,

71
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:36,250
Lakshmi, Viracocha,
and Teutates.

72
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,541
Well, that's a little much.

73
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,666
I like their names.

74
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,625
I think they're
refined and regal.

75
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,750
Or ridiculous.
Think about it for a sec.

76
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you wanna be out in public
talking about your cat

77
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,875
"Princess Konohana Sakuya"?

78
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,833
Well, you can think
whatever you want.

79
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,166
It's not like I came here
to talk to you anyway.

80
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,041
I've got better things to do.

81
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,208
Like play with
sweet little kitties!

82
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,750
[SHOP WORKER]
Hey Nishiyama!

83
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,833
It's good to see you again.
How are you?

84
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,041
Good, thank you.

85
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,875
I'm really glad
to see Mi here today.

86
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,083
I've missed her.

87
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,583
She wasn't around
the last time I came,

88
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,000
so I was getting worried.

89
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,250
[SHOP WORKER]
It's so sweet of you to worry.

90
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,666
Listen to that.

91
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,916
It sounds like she's kind
of a regular around here.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,208
[HAYAMA] I'm not jealous.
Not even a little bit!

93
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,083
[FUTABA]
Oh, yeah?

94
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,208
That's kinda random.

95
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,250
I mean, running
into her like that.

96
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,208
It isn't that surprising.

97
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,125
[HAYAMA] Hmm... I wonder
how I could convince her

98
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,625
to send me those pictures.

99
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,125
[FUTABA]
I have something for you,

100
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,583
but if you've already gotten
your fix at the cat café...

101
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,000
[HAYAMA]
What is it?

102
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,291
A ticket to Animal Town.
Y'know, that petting zoo place?

103
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,291
[HAYAMA]
What?!

104
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,333
Give it to me!
I'll do anything!

105
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,958
[FUTABA]
Okay, calm down. It's yours.

106
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,125
Sakura's mom actually
gave it to me.

107
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,541
I figured you'd appreciate
it a lot more than I would.

108
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,791
[HAYAMA]
This is awesome! Thanks!

109
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,541
Oh, hey, it says it's
good for two people.

110
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,875
So when do you
think we should go?

111
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,416
Huh? Looks like it's
good till Sunday.

112
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,750
We'll have to buy one ticket,
since there are three of us.

113
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,333
I wasn't gonna go.

114
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,250
I don't like animals
all that much.

115
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,375
What?!

116
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,416
I can't go either. I'm working.

117
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,125
[HAYAMA]
Really? You too?

118
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,208
Hey, maybe you could
bring your sister along.

119
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,208
I dunno about that.

120
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,958
Yay! Let's have some fun!

121
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,458
Are you ready, Teru?

122
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,166
Sis, calm down.

123
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,708
Aw! Who's a little cutie?

124
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,750
You have to be gentler
with the little ones!

125
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,916
This one is adorable!

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,583
Aw! And so is that one!

127
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,833
Take a deep breath.

128
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,041
Slow down and adore
them one at a time!

129
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,625
Going with Kou would
be too exhausting.

130
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,708
I'd have to protect all
the animals from her.

131
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,791
Hey! I know!

132
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,541
[NISHIYAMA]
Animal Town?

133
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,000
[FUTABA]
Yeah.

134
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,041
Yoko and I can't go, but we
thought you might want to.

135
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,083
What do ya say?

136
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,041
Me? Really?

137
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,750
Hold on!

138
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,250
What are you doing?
I don't wanna go with her!

139
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,791
Well, I think she'd like it.
Don't you?

140
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,458
Besides, you went to
the cat café together.

141
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,708
[HAYAMA] We definitely
did not go there together!

142
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,833
[NISHIYAMA] I have a feeling
this isn't going to end well.

143
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,458
Morning.

144
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,750
Back at ya!

145
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,041
[FUTABA] Nishiyama showed!
I can't believe it.

146
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,541
I thought Hayama had
scared her off for sure.

147
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,250
Their love for animals
must be stronger

148
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,916
than their hatred for each other

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,333
You came too?

150
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,541
Checking up on them?

151
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,250
[KONDO] Well, yeah.
You know how they are.

152
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,666
They're going in!

153
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,500
I gotta see how this ends.

154
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,458
Welcome to Animal Town!

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,583
[FUTABA groans]

156
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,958
This is gonna be a
long day, isn't it?

157
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,666
[NISHIYAMA]
Hey sweetie! Look over here!

158
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,916
[NISHIYAMA squeals]

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,583
You pups have a very

184

I don't know why
so many people

185

they could have dogs.

little too far, don't you?

Things could get violent.

Well, Hayama will

She won't start a fight.

How do you know that?

194
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,500
Because she made a vow
to exercise self-discipline.

195
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,916
What does that mean?

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,458
She said she wants
to open herself up

197
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,375
to new experiences by being
more tolerant of others.

198
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,791
And I think there was
something about inner peace.

199
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,625
Okay, sure.
I'll pretend that makes sense.

If Nishiyama deliberately
provokes her,

202
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't know what could happen.

203
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,750

I decided to get tea instead.

216

I don't think juice is healthy
because of all the sugar in it.

Yoko!

[FUTABA]
What's going on?

324
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,875
Wake up!

325
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,583
Thank goodness you're back!

00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,250
You had me really worried
for a second there.

327
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,958
What happened to you?
Did you pass out or something?

328
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,083
[YOKO]
That was strange.

329
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,041
Were those memories?

330
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,458
Thank you.

331
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,250
That was "River of Three
Crossings," sung by Kou Hayama.

332
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,833
[FUTABA]
So depressing!

333
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,333
Why sing about the river people
cross to reach the afterlife?

334
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,375
[KOU]
Oh, come on.

335
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,791
Haven't you ever
just started singing

336
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,333
without thinking about it?

337
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,833
I do it all the time.

338
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,291
Like when I'm cooking
or doing chores.

339
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,083
Nishiyama, you know
what I mean.

340
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,875
You sing songs
dedicated to Eternal

341
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,666
when you're alone in
your room, don't you?

342
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,083
No way! I don't do that!

343
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,875
Ooh! I wanna hear one!
Sing one for us, please!

344
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,916
I'm telling you,
there aren't any songs!

345
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,291
Nishiyama! Nishiyama!

346
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,250
Stop it! People are
starting to stare.

347
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,666
[KONDO] Nishiyama! Nishiyama,
yeah! Nishiyama, whoo!

348
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,375
Nishiyama, hey! Nishiyama, go!

349
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,000
Nishiyama got
so mad yesterday,

350
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,875
I thought she was
gonna punch someone.

351
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,041
Yeah, I kinda felt bad for her.

352
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,666
After what you said
to her at Animal Town,

353
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,250
I find that pretty
hard to believe.

354
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,250
Hey, look.

355
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,000
Do you see that?

356
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,791
[FUTABA]
Yeah. It's Kondo.

357
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,333
I don't think I've ever
see her all by herself.

358
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,041
She's usually glued
to Nishiyama's side.

359
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:06,375
[YOKO] She's all alone.
I wonder what's going on.

360
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,125
Did she and Nishiyama
get into a fight

361
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,291
because of what
happened yesterday?

362
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,833
She's been abandoned
by her best friend.

363
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,041
It breaks my heart!

364
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,666
[HAYAMA] But you always
eat bread for lunch.

365
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,000
[FUTABA] I've told you before,
rice is my favorite food.

366
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,250
[KONDO]
Seriously? Rice?

367
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,708
Oh, Kondo.

368
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,291
Yep.

369
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,125
She's gonna have lunch with us
today if that's okay with you.

370
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,500
She was walking around
like a lost little puppy.

371
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,083
So I figured I'd invite her.

372
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,916
What a wonderful idea!

373
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,083
A jerk who would
abandon you like that

374
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,750
doesn't deserve your friendship!

375
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,916
Don't worry.
We'll be your friends now!

376
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,083
What?

377
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,208
[FUTABA] Do you think
maybe she's being

378
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,791
a little too welcoming?

379
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,125
[HAYAMA] Miss Yoko does know a
thing or two about being alone.

380
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,500
Nishiyama's my best friend,
and she's not a jerk.

381
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,041
She's actually really nice.

382
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,750
Once you get to
know her, anyway.

383
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,375
She just has a
very fragile ego.

384
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,041
Well, anyway,
why don't we eat?

385
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,166
Sound good?

386
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,833
[FUTABA]
Elementary school, huh?

387
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,875
So you two have known
each other a long time.

388
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:03,583
[KONDO]
Mm-hmm.

389
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,000
Since the third grade.

390
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,541
We ended up in the same
group during a field trip.

391
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,250
She was our group leader.

392
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,166
Whenever she saw me
starting to fall behind,

393
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,666
she would come to help me.

394
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,291
So you're saying
she's always liked

395
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,791
being the one in charge.

396
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,791
Yeah, pretty much.

397
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,208
I gotta admit...

398
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,583
She wasn't always as
difficult as she is now.

399
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,083
It's high school, right?

400
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,750
You gotta learn
to go with the flow.

401
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,500
Plus, these days there's always
somebody getting in her way.

402
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,666
Oh, dear. Do you mean me?

403
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,500
[laughing]

404
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,375
[FUTABA] If Nishiyama
could just be more careful

405
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,083
about what she says out loud,

406
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,583
I bet she and Hayama
could actually get along.

407
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,375
They have so much in common.

408
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,791
You could teach her a lot.

409
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,458
I bet she could even be class
representative someday.

410
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,333
But that's only if she
could pretend to be nice

411
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,750
the way that you do.

412
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,916
Uh...

413
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,666
You could work on
that too, actually.

414
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,083
You come off so
prickly and snobby.

415
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,666
Try talking to the people
in your class sometime.

416
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,666
Huh?!

417
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,333
The problem is
you're too pretty.

418
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,750
So it's your job to
start conversations.

419
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,791
Really? You think I'm pretty?

420
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,958
Yeah, totally!
If a pretty girl...

What the heck's going on?

422
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,458
[HAYAMA]
Is she being nice?

423
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,000
Being mean?
Or just plain oblivious?

424
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,125
Basically, you should
try harder to talk to people.

Hey.

I was hoping you would
come with me somewhere

447
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,375

Hello. Wait, I know her.

00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,083
You're never too old
for cosplaying, right?

451
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,500
Yes, how could I forget?

452
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,791
Nishiyama's friend
who has no tact.

453
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,958
Perhaps you can help us.

454
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,750
Kondo wants to pick out
something special

455
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,541
for Nishiyama to
help them make up.

456
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,875
What do you mean "make up"?

457
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,958
Yes. I have just the thing!

[SHINO]
Here!

459
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,291
[YOKO]
Why did you bring that out?

460
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,083
[SHINO]
It's something Nishiyama likes.

461
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,208
[KONDO]
Hey! I recognize that!

462
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,875
It's the uniform Nishiyama
wore when she worked here.

463
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,166
A cake, Sonobe!
We want a cake she likes!

464
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,416
[KONDO laughs]

465
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,958
I gotta say, that was
really funny, though!

466
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,958
I'm so glad I was
able to amuse you.

467
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,083
Is it really true that
you used to be a servant

468
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,500
and you worked for
Nishikawa's family?

469
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,666
[SHINO]
It is.

470
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,125
So she was a
rich girl once,

471
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,250
just like everybody's
always saying.

472
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,333
That explains a lot
about her personality.

473
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,916
Like how overbearing
and stand-offish she is.

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,666
She really has no
filter, does she?

475
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,041
Hope she doesn't
try that with me.

476
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,916
[YOKO] I think this is
really big of you, Kondo.

477
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,583
[KONDO]
Huh? What do you mean?

478
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,083
She's the one who
should apologize

479
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,458
for blowing things
out of proportion,

480
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,333
and yet here you are,
going out of your way

481
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,083
to heal the rift between you.

482
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,208
Uh...

483
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,916
Uh, Yoko...

484
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,958
I'm sorry, but I think you
misunderstood what's going on.

485
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,083
[HAYAMA] Kondo wasn't alone
because she and Nishiyama

486
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,875
got into a fight or anything.

487
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,041
Nishiyama's sick.

488
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,416
So she had to stay home
from school today.

489
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,041
What?!

490
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,208
I... I just--

491
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,375
Well... I just assumed.

492
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,708
[KONDO]
Here. Take a look.

493
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,541
I sent her a ton of
emails this morning

494
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,875
to see how she was doing.

495
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,000
[YOKO]
No!

496
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,208
But all the things I've said!
I feel like an idiot!

497
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,708
It's all right.
These things happen.

498
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,875
Don't worry about it.

499
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,291
It's kinda your fault, too.

500
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,750
You weren't all that clear
about the situation, so...

501
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,666
[NISHIYAMA]
What's the deal with her?

502
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,000
Why did she suddenly stop
emailing me after lunch?

503
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,791
She sent so many this
morning I couldn't sleep.

Kou was right.

512
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,083
She's singing a song
dedicated to her cat!

513
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,333
We finally get to hear it!

go in or come back later?

Oh, really?

Then, why don't you sing a
character song or something?
