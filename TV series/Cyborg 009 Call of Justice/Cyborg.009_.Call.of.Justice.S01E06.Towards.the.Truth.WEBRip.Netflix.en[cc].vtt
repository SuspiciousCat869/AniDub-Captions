You might modify our bodies,

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:17.216  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.886  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If I'm going to save

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.931  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
then both this body

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.351  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.188  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:33.148  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:51.250  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So his power must be...

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:55.045  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
To shine a light
on the doubts in one's heart

308
00:20:55.128 --> 00:20:58.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and, through mere illusions,
to lead one to one's choice.

00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:02.594  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So even the pain I felt,
that was an illusion.

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.638  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And if so...

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:21.238  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
009, his power
can't be explained

00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:23.824  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
simply because he's equipped
with an Accelerator.
