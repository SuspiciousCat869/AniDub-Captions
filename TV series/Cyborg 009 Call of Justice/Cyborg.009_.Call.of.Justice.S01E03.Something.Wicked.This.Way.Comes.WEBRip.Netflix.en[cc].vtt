00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.256  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:48.019  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you're saying just because

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.648  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If that's true,
then we need to find out

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.484  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

if we should be taking them on.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.545  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.344  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
was brush away the sparks

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:25.348  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Unless they're recognized

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:28.893  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't think we should make
any moves against them.

41
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:31.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'd have to agree
with Joe on this.

42
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

you're disappointed,

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.025  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but if we take any action,

44
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.278  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it would cause an incident
the world couldn't ignore.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.947  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

You've been fighting for justice
all this time, right?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:54.043  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What you call justice may not be
the same thing as our justice.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:58.756  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right now, all we want
is to live normal lives.

your answer, Ms. Davenport.

action is out of the question.

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:19.902  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
