00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.532  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Are you trying to tell me Ivan
left of his own free will?

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.450  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Yes.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:01.037  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He told me
he was intrigued by The Blessed.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:04.958  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Heinrich] Wait. do you mean
he chose The Blessed over us?

7
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.669  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Chang] That's just
so unbelievable.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:10.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Geronimo] Maybe he had
some kind of ulterior motive.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:12.799  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:23.434  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But he did say there was
something we all needed to do.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's something we need to do?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.980  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What do you think that is?

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.901  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Looks like our only option
is to ask that woman.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.453  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
At the moment, I have no reason
to fight you people at all,

16
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
not that you'd have reason
to believe what I say.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.210  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Joe] Not true.
We do believe you.

[Catalina] You really are
a hopeless pushover.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Catalina, first of all,

21
00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.097  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
would you mind telling everyone
about your powers?

22
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.849  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'd like for you
to reassure them.

23
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.561  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I am telepathic.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:09.147  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The effect of my powers
is limited to the ones

25
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you call The Blessed,
but I conduct

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
multiple telepathic
transmissions simultaneously.

27
00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.196  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, in other words,
what you're saying

28
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
is that by using you
as a conduit,

29
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.659  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
everyone tuning in
can communicate.

30
00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.328  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Correct.

31
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
By connecting a link with me,
no matter where they are,

32
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
our comrades are able to share
their thoughts and plans

33
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:30.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
on an immediate basis.

34
00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.671  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's why you're called Linker.

35
00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:37.008  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And as such, I'm privy
to every single conversation

36
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.676  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that used me as a conduit,

37
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
meaning that of course I know
everything there is to know

38
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.223  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
about the Emperor's scheme.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:46.434  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I know who you're referring to.

40
00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.478  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tell us what you know, Catalina.

41
00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.106  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Tell us what he's
intending to do.

42
00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:09.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What I want, Ivan, is to rule
this species called "humans."

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.638  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They really are
such foolish creatures.

00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.390  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:43.241  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The Emperor has concluded
that implementing this plan

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.015  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Success rate is only at 5%?

00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:11.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We can't allow that.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.313  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The 5% they're talking about

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.606  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
means that over
6 billion people will perish.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.858  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.111  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.616  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that is a human response.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:31.122  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's a idea we can
ill afford to overlook.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Obviously. Precisely the reason

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.585  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:40.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Then Ivan, he was telling us
we should thwart this intention?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.390  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Do you have anything convincing

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.925  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A worthwhile reason
you'd tip us off?

105
00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:09.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Only that an unforeseen,

106
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
undetermined element

The Emperor is aware

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.603  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and apparently doesn't think
it's much of a problem,

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:20.565  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but that element has put
our plan at significant risk.

111
00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:24.110  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Even if that's true, how can you
betray them so easily?

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.239  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Those people were your comrades
until only an hour ago.

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We have

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.326  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We were only working together,

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because we had interests

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:37.039  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So once you part ways
with The Blessed,

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.125  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you have no feelings

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why would I?

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.138  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you cannot escape

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:53.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
your weak point as cyborgs.

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:57.101  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's enough out of you.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:02.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

anything to prove your story.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.485  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.697  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's all I have

Françoise,
would you take a moment

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.786  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.039  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just a second.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.334  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes. All of the launch plans
she mentioned

136
00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:22.668  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.046  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All of the rocket launches

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.550  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There was likely
a launch today as well.

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:31.427  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's correct.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:37.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Catalina] That would have been
the last of the rockets.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.728  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.272  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:51.113  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Once the station is replenished,
it will change course

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.158  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and begin dropping

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
After being dropped,
multiple reentry vehicles

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.794  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:09.090  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

It will proliferate even as it
forces its host to evolve.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.275  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.610  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it will trigger

You're saying this contagion

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.493  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Once that point is reached,
there will be no way

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.246  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
of preventing

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:43.291  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The contamination will spread

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:45.626  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:51.716  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:54.635  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Unfortunately we have no choice

Françoise, what's the status

175
00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
of the rocket

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:04.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The unmanned supply vehicle

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.939  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and is on trajectory
for the station's orbit.

178
00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:10.192  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's due to arrive

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:12.111  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We really
only have eight hours?

180
00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:13.571  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
are there any weapons

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
we can use to shoot it down?

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:18.993  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ideally I'd say no.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Catalina] I don't recommend it.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Once the station is destroyed,

186
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
the micro-drones
will scatter through its orbit

187
00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:27.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
along with the other debris.

00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:30.921  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Then of course,
they will eventually be drawn in

189
00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:32.757  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
by the Earth's
gravitational pull

190
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.759  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and rain down on the ground.

191
00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:36.010  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Gilmore] Surely many drones

192
00:10:36.093 --> 00:10:37.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
would never even breach
the atmosphere.

193
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That may be true,

194
00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:42.725  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but they threaten mankind
should any reach the ground.

195
00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:45.895  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Also, for the same reason,
it would be risky

196
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:48.397  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
to use ground-based fire
on the reentry capsules.

197
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.940  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then just what do you suggest?

198
00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:52.818  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Your best chance
is to go to the station.

199
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Once there, you could deflect
all of the virus

00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
from Earth's orbit
into the void of outer space.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You say that
like there's nothing to it.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:05.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But the Dolphin III is not able
to go beyond the atmosphere.

203
00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:09.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[groans] So you're saying
there's nothing more we can do?

204
00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:13.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. We're not
out of options yet.

[G.B.] A rocket, huh?

207
00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.183  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You mean fly
to outer space in that?

208
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Usually this device
would be used

209
00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.188  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
to intercept other missiles
at high altitude.

210
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.232  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We can uncouple the warhead,

211
00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:33.943  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
position the Dolphin III
at the proper elevation,

212
00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:35.444  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and send the missile off.

213
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:38.239  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mathematically, at least,
it should be possible

214
00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:41.075  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
to reach the station's orbit
and in time.

215
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.911  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Agreed, but in order
to reach that elevation,

216
00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:45.871  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
there will be
weight limitations.

217
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.790  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hmm. I'd say that three

218
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:50.626  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
is the most we can send
out there to the station.

219
00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:51.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Joe] Only three, huh?

220
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.380  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Jet] Since I'm the only one

221
00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:56.632  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
who can move
through outer space on his own,

222
00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:58.175  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'll go.
-[Heinrich] I'll go, too.

223
00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:01.512  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We don't know if the station
is loaded with guns.

224
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.013  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You'll need firepower.

225
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.141  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Joe] All right, then.

226
00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:08.102  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Jet, Heinrich, me...

227
00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:09.186  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
we'll go.

228
00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:10.813  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then it's settled.

229
00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.691  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Let's get started
as quickly as we can.

230
00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.151  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[cyborgs] Roger.

232
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.746  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Gilmore] All right.

233
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.207  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If we can believe
the public blueprints,

234
00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:32.751  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
by leaving
the station's core intact,

235
00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.213  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
uncoupling and releasing
all unnecessary modules,

236
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.175  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we can boost the thrust
to maximum levels,

237
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:40.634  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
attaining escape velocity.

238
00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:43.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Once it has left Earth's orbit,

239
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.306  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it will then
vector around Venus,

240
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:47.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
sufficiently changing
the trajectory

241
00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:50.728  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so that ultimately
it will plunge into the sun.

242
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.104  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Jet] Who would have guessed

243
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
they'd make
those blueprints public?

244
00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.983  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Françoise] Technically
the listing for it

245
00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:58.736  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
is a research station
for a private firm.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:00.613  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But we won't know
if it's accurate

247
00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:02.239  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
unless we go see firsthand.

248
00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:03.532  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

[Françoise]
The hangar hatch is open.

250
00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:23.719  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Joe] Catalina!

251
00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.306  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And where do you
think you're going?

252
00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:31.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who knows?

253
00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:34.605  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Weren't you supposed
to fight alongside us?

254
00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.944  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, after all,
you were the one

255
00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:42.571  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
who said we had to thwart
the Emperor's scheme.

256
00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:46.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That in itself is not
a reason to fight with you.

257
00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.910  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe not, but...

258
00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:51.497  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
009, why are you
going into space?

259
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What?

260
00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.917  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You may be a cyborg,

261
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.795  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but outer space still
holds danger for you as well.

262
00:13:57.878 --> 00:13:59.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's no guarantee
that you'll return.

263
00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hey, I knew that was the case.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.343  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Catalina] Then how
were you able to say

265
00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:06.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that you'd do so
without hesitation?

266
00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:08.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Catalina] Keep in mind
that synthetic viruses

267

have no effect on cyborgs.

268
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.477  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Even in a world
where the entire human race

269
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.854  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
has been subjected

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:19.275  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
cyborgs would certainly
survive without incident.

271
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:22.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So tell me, why would
you be willing to risk

272
00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:25.781  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
your own existence
for those miserable humans?

273
00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.742  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Joe] I can't stand by and
allow that many people to die

274
00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:32.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
without even knowing why,
and that's reason enough.

275
00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:36.166  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
On top of that,
do you have any idea

276
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.127  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
of the full extent
of your powers?

Your Accelerator
isn't merely an ability

279
00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:45.426  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that allows you to move around

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:47.761  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Regardless of how much
you accelerate,

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.264  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you must be able to control it.

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.974  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
At those physical speeds,

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:54.685  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
your senses should
not be able to keep pace,

00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:57.396  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but you still have

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.231  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and can even plan ahead.

00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:07.907  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In other words,
while you're accelerating,

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.292  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
through forced evolution,

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:22.671  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Humanity will defend itself,

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.007  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
