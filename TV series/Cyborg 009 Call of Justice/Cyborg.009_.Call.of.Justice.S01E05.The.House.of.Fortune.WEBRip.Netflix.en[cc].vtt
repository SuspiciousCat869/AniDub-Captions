00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:29.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But since none of us

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So that is the answer.

was able to find it,

00:19:58.947 --> 00:20:00.908  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:06.413  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Which is good,
since I can no longer fight.
