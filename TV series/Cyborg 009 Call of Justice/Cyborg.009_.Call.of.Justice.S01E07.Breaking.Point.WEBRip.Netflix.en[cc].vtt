00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.292  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They would have simply
done away with him by now

105
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.710  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
if that were the case.

106
00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:54.463  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It could be that they wanted
to take Ivan for something.

107
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.924  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I do not have a good feeling.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.244  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How's Jet?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Looks like
he's gonna be all right,

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:30.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
although it's going to take time
for him to recover.

111
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.255  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sorry.
I was completely useless.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:39.008  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In a situation like that,
what could you do?

113
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:43.971  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Up until now, I've done nothing
but torment every one of you.

114
00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:45.347  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Please forgive me.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.854  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you?
Don't you have anything to say?

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.856  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I do not.

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.484  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Seriously?
You've got a lot of nerve

119
00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:59.111  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
after all that time
you spent trying to kill us!

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:01.530  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My actions were based
on what I saw.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.074  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I read the situation,

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:08.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you're not even going
to pretend to apologize?

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:10.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We were misled.

00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:12.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm truly sorry.

125
00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:15.377  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I accept that I'm to blame.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:29.808  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've uncovered something
that I find very unsettling.

00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:31.143  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is something the matter?

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.397  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Françoise] No, it's nothing.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:38.984  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, if you say so, then.

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.444  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There is new information

135
00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'd like the Guardians
to know as well.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:44.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:47.117  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:49.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This is the micro-drone

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:52.081  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
A micro-drone?

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:55.417  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
After some extensive research,
I've discovered

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:58.420  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that there's a nanomachine
embedded in this bug's belly.

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:00.256  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Furthermore, I've found

143
00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:03.133  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it's a synthetic virus

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:05.010  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's designed to activate

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:08.013  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
once it enters the epidermis

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.643  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are The Blessed planning

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm getting bad vibes
from all of this.

[Joe] What is it?

150
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.112  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've found him.
I've traced Ivan's brainwaves.

00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:27.575  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He's at--

00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:29.326  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.661  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They do high-tech research.

00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:45.134  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's not all.
Their R &amp; D team is astounding.

158
00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Bleeding-edge munitions
are made there.

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:50.723  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:53.475  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.479  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:00.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
no one has actually seen
the director lately.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:05.029  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Even his most recent photograph
dates back to 30 years ago.

00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:08.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He doesn't look his age,
no matter how you slice it.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.327  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wait. I just remembered.

00:15:12.953 --> 00:15:15.289  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
he'd written something
about this director,

169
00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:18.208  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:25.466  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.512  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sure my father
tried to contact them

175
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
numerous times over the years.

176
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:35.309  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you're saying
that Dr. Davenport

177
00:15:35.392 --> 00:15:37.561  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
likely got that sample

178
00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:38.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[gasps]
-Hmm.

179
00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:40.064  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Chang] Hmm.

180
00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:43.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:46.153  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
headed in the direction

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:48.197  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
which also happens
to be a company

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
capable of creating
a man-made virus?

184
00:15:50.574 --> 00:15:52.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's all adding up so well,

185
00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.578  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
the result
almost seems like a cliché.

186
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.539  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But even if it's a trap, we go.

187
00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.334  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're right.

188
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:02.211  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll go with you.

189
00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:04.922  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The Blessed will only
bring harm to humanity,

190
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:08.133  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and that means they're an enemy
the Guardians should take down.

191
00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:11.387  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But then there's the danger

192
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.180  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
of them taking control

193
00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:16.350  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Savior tanks are equipped

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Gilmore] So by releasing
a powerful discharge,

195
00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:21.188  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it can vaporize whatever
comes into contact with it.

196
00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.607  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The A.I. running
the Savior tanks

197
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.234  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
seemed to detect no threat

198
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.528  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
as far as those capsules
are concerned,

199
00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:31.365  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but we can deal with that
by reprogramming the settings.

200
00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:32.741  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Normally it will activate

201
00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
only when a bullet
comes into contact,

202
00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:37.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but if we programmed it
to stay on...

203
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:40.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That condition
can't last very long.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.794  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
About 20 minutes at most.

00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:45.713  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hopefully that's enough.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Agreed.

00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:48.716  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
