I'll find you guys later.

163
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,541
[OFFICER B]
Quit wasting time.

164
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,250
[KURAMA] Hmph. He's doin'
well in that junker.

165
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,708
Ya know, I'm startin'
to think he would've been

166
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,291
a threat to us even
without the Arbalest.

167
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,916
Wait, what's an "Arbalest?"

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,083
Not your concern.

169
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,041
Point is, the punk's dangerous.

170
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,666
Right, but, to me,
he just looked like

171
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,333
your typical, screwed-up
former child soldier.

172
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,250
Don't take him lightly.

173
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,875
It takes skill to kill men
like Gauron and Gates.

174
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,958
And who might they be?

175
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,250
[KURAMA]
You don't know?

176
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,500
I don't.

177
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,500
No respect for history here.

178
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,625
Huh?

179
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,875
Don't worry about it.

180
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,500
Uh...

181
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,291
Well. Putting that aside.

182
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,291
We're planning to get rid of
a few of Sagara's buddies.

183
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,458
Perhaps you'd care to
watch the executions?

184
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,500
Nah, I'll pass on that.

185
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,875
I can't win in
a normal gunfight.

186
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,250
Hey. What's the deal?

187
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,583
Why isn't her car going
in the same direction?

188
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,958
[OFFICER C] That's not
something you need to know.

189
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,291
[OFFICER B]
Get out.

190
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,833
All right, fine, you
don't have to push us.

191
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,958
Where are we?

192
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,291
[RILEY]
They brought us to a pig farm.

193
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,416
[OFFICER B] Now line up
and climb the stairs.

194
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,458
No. You're kidding, right?

195
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,666
You don't really
plan to turn us--

196
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,416
[OFFICER B]
Don't make trouble.

197
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,541
You don't have to do this.

198
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,333
Just let us go,
we'll keep quiet.

199
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,166
[OFFICER B]
Sorry, can't do that.

200
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,166
I have orders.
Now line up like I said.

201
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,000
[LEMON]
There's no need for that.

202
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,541
[ASCH]
Lemon! How'd you get here?

203
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,166
Thought you were
still in jail, man.

204
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,166
[LEMON]
Tell ya later.

205
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,333
For now, just lay
down low for me.

206
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,916
I don't know who
you think you are,

207
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,250
but you just made a big mistake.

208
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,416
You're just one more body

209
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,208
that we'll have
to feed to the pigs.

210
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,250
I don't think so.

211
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,333
Do it.

212
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,625
[BARDET] The premises are
now secured, monsieur.

213
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,666
Excellent work, Bardet.

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,750
Hey, Lemon, what's goin' on?

215
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,708
Well, basically,
it's what it looks like.

216
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,333
I'm not actually a
struggling photographer.

217
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,625
These gentlemen are
all colleagues of mine.

218
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,583
I wish I could tell you more,
but you know how it is.

219
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,375
[LEMON] Sounds like Sousuke's
closing in on his objective.

220
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,166
Probably the same
objective I have.

221
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,750
Down to my last magazine.

222
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,750
He'll try to finish me off soon.

223
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,750
[SOUSUKE]
Not much ammo left.

224
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,000
And only two more HEAT hammers.

225
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,500
May as well risk it.

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,541
A little further forward. Good.

227
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:37,666
[POLICE CHIEF]
Whoa. So, it's a draw then?

228
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,791
No, I don't think so.
He planned that.

229
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,958
[gasps]

230
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,666
The M9 is high-tech,
light weight,

231
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,291
and well armored, but its
electronically driven,

232
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,000
and that's too heavy
a load for it.

233
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,875
Whereas that old Savage
has a heavy ovular frame,

234
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,583
which is resistant to pressure.

235
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,541
It also uses a hydraulic
drive, which means that,

236
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,541
even with inferior horsepower,

237
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,416
it can bust out of that
rubble pretty easily.

238
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,333
What a solid mech.

239
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,583
[KURAMA]
Heh. And he wins.

240
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,000
No way. That's impossible.

241
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,083
Who is he?

242
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,416
You do have a Plan B, right?

243
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,583
Huh?

244
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,583
Now that he knows
you're working for us,

245
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,458
he'll stop at nothing to get
to you and make you talk.

246
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,708
What? I--

247
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,291
[knocking]

248
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,666
Oh. Come in.

249
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,291
Excuse me, sir.

250
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,125
Oh, yeah. That's right,
I'll be fine.

251
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,208
I still have you!

252
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,666
[gasps]

253
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,958
I had an M9, and you
still took me down.

254
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,041
Who the hell are you, anyway?

255
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,083
[SOUSUKE] I'm the one
asking the questions.

256
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,041
Identify yourself at once.

257
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,916
I don't think so.

258
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,250
My Savage isn't running
so well after our battle.

259
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,333
I might crush you on accident.

260
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,666
Lemme go!

261
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,333
[SOUSUKE]
I bet it's hot.

262
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,375
This mech has a
shoddy cooling system.

263
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,500
The heat runs all the way
to the fingertips, too.

264
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,208
Fine, I surrender, okay?

265
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,500
I'll talk. Just let go.

266
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,500
[SOUSUKE]
State your name and affiliation.

267
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,583
The name's George Lovelock.

268
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,083
I work for Amalgam now.

269
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,250
Part of their aggressor squad.

270
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,958
Were you a Mithril
soldier at some point?

271
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,416
That I was.

272
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Wait a sec. Don't
tell me you're--

273
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,583
[SOUSUKE] I was with
the West Pacific Fleet.

274
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,000
[sighs] No wonder you
have such a good grasp

275
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,958
of the M9's weaknesses.

276
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,833
I was a pilot in the
Mediterranean Fleet.

277
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,166
[SOUSUKE]
What happened to it?

278
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,916
Our base was attacked
and wiped out

279
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,083
while I was away on a mission.

280
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,375
And when I came
back to report in.

281
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,583
Guess who was waiting for me.

282
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,541
So you surrendered on the spot.

283
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,916
Sounded better than
dying for nothing.

284
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,083
[SOUSUKE] Where are their
bases of operation?

285
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,750
Don't really know.

286
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,625
I've only seen camps,
one on the outskirts of Tripoli,

287
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,708
and another somewhere
in Sri Lanka.

288
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,083
They only sent me
out here yesterday.

289
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,291
Guy named Kurama showed
up before the fight.

290
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,333
Did you say Kurama?

291
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,833
[LOVELOCK]
Do you know him?

292
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,166
[SOUSUKE]
Where is he now?

293
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,708
In the observation bunker.

294
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,333
Kurama.

295
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,958
[beeping]

296
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,958
[SOUSUKE]
Inbound chopper.

297
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,000
They sent it to finish us off.

298
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,625
Guess this is it for us.

299
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,875
[SOUSUKE]
Go take cover.

300
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:49,916
[LOVELOCK]
What're you gonna do?

301
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,041
You're out of weapons.

302
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,625
[SOUSUKE]
Not a problem.

303
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,416
Wait a sec. You don't plan to--

304
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,916
Everything has its
breaking point.

305
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,750
[LOVELOCK]
Did that do it in?

306
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,750
It's not damaged beyond repair,
but it stopped running.

307
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,875
There's not much time.

308
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,041
You should get out of here.

309
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,666
Yeah, I will, but, don't tell me

310
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,458
you're gonna take
on Amalgam... alone.

311
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,666
Affirmative.

312
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,666
What're you, crazy? You'll
just get yourself killed!

313
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,458
[SOUSUKE] They took something
precious from me.

314
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,166
And no matter what it takes,
I plan to get it back.

315
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,500
[gasps]

316
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,208
I don't understand.

317
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,666
I mean, you and I are
just mercenaries right?

318
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,625
You may be a mercenary.

319
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,750
I'm just a man now.

320
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,041
[LOVELOCK]
Damn it!

321
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,541
Apparently, the fight's
already over.

00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,333
[GUARD B]
I heard it was an upset, too.

Heh. Bet a lotta guys

Security's tight.

00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,833
No.

327
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,791
Hey! Sagara, are you watching?

328
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,333
I know you're somewhere nearby.

329
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,583
You can come out
here and surrender,

330
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:11,166
or you can watch me put a hole
in this nice girl's head.

331
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,208
If you remember the lengths
I was willing to go to

332
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:17,041
back in Tokyo, then I think
you know I won't hesitate.

He's too far.

a countdown. From ten.

[SOUSUKE]
So many.

337
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,541
Come on.

338
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,125
That's eight!

339
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,375
