1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,083
[TESSA] I know I haven't come
to visit in a very long time.

2
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,291
So I thought I'd make it
a point to stop by today.

3
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:36,500
After all, things are only
going to get rougher.

4
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,291
[sighs]

5
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,041
[LEONARD]
Teletha.

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,208
[gasps]

7
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm surprised.
Didn't think I'd see you.

8
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,458
I'm surprised, too.
Seeing you here.

9
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,500
I wasn't sure if you even
remembered mom and dad.

10
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,583
We're all bound by memory.

11
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:59,750
I was also hoping that maybe
I could persuade you to join me.

12
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,708
Ah.

13
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:05,375
Come now. I think it's time you
stopped being so stubborn.

14
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,333
You're not a child.

15
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,750
Enough.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,916
[TESSA] Save your breath.
Because brother or not,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
you're now my enemy!

18
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,875
Very well. I can see you've
already made up your mind.

19
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,250
That's right. A long time ago.

20
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,708
I suppose I'll let it
go for today. Fowler?

21
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,875
[FOWLER]
Yes, Master Leonard?

22
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,083
Time to go.

23
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,625
[FOWLER]
As you wish, sir.

24
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,833
Farewell, Teletha,
and to him as well.

25
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,250
[SOUSUKE]
Captain, are you all right?

26
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,291
[TESSA]
I'm fine. Time to withdraw.

27
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,541
[SOUSUKE]
Roger that.

28
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,875
This is Gebo Nine.
Now descending to Point Golf.

29
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,166
Urzu Seven, prepare for docking.

30
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,666
Urzu Seven, roger that.

31
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,500
[TESSA]
I'm sorry for the trouble,

32
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,541
and with school about to start.

33
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,791
It's fine.

34
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,333
Ah.

35
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,125
[LEONARD] Mr. Kurama.
What brings you here?

36
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,833
I was in the area.
Thought I'd come see you.

37
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,500
[LEONARD]
How fortunate.

38
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,291
Rumor has it that you were
meeting with Mithril's witch.

39
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,666
[LEONARD]
My little sister?

40
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,833
[KURAMA] Apparently that
white AS was there as well.

41
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,333
Why didn't you neutralize it?
That certainly would've

42
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,208
made things easier, from here.

43
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,041
Because it most likely would
have ended in a draw.

44
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,625
I imagine they were ready
for any move we might make.

45
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,458
[KURAMA]
What about that Belial of yours?

46
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,916
Thought it was the best.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,833
The unit's still
being fine-tuned,

48
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,541
we were a little short on time.

49
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,041
[KURAMA chuckles]
I wonder,

50
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,375
is loyalty to our organization
the thing you're short on,

51
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,458
Leonard Testarossa?

52
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,583
Maybe, time will tell.

53
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,458
[KURAMA]
I don't plan on holding back.

54
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,750
I'll hunt them down,
whatever it takes.

55
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,583
Both Sousuke Sagara,
as well as this Chidori girl.

56
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,458
Do what you need to do.

57
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,208
[KURAMA] Both Gauron and
Gates played around too much.

58
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,625
I will not.

59
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:20,375
Also, your predicted Zero Hour,
is only 58 hours away.

60
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,458
Predicted? It was foreseen.

61
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,083
That doesn't matter.

62
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,000
I will continue to follow
the plan of operation.

63
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,791
Also. You better stay
out of my way from now on.

64
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,375
He's quite unpleasant.

65
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,458
[LEONARD]
He's the serious type.

66
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,125
But in that respect, I find
him more than reliable.

67
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,000
[KYOKO] Okay, the results of
the ballot count are in!

68
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,791
The numbers are clear, so
therefore, without futher ado,

69
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,708
the next student council
president will be Yui Morikawa!

70
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,625
[students cheer]

71
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,333
[KYOKO]
That's everything!

72
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,250
Which means your
final significant duty

73
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,791
has now been completed!
Hayashimizu, excellent work.

74
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,833
Thank you for your kind words,
Ms. Kagurazaka.

75
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,750
It looks like I can now
graduate without any

76
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,541
concerns for the
future of this school.

77
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,375
Of course. With your
successor chosen,

78
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,916
you can retire in peace.
We'll be in very good hands.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,250
And now you're on
your way in politics,

80
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,750
making your mark on history!

81
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,000
[chuckles]

82
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,000
I doubt it, madam.

83
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,125
Although. I certainly did
enjoy myself playing the role.

84
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,208
[ERI]
Oh really?

85
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,458
Pardon. With the
election results in,

86
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,541
should I post them on the
board in the morning, ma'am?

87
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,916
[ERI]
Yes, please do.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,791
Well, everyone, that brings
our meeting to a close.

89
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,375
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am!

90
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,583
Great work! Way to go, Kaname!

91
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,166
Thanks, Kyoko. And I'd like to
thank you for being a part

92
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,708
of the election
committee as well.

93
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,250
No sweat! I did it as a
favor to you, but I had fun!

94
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,416
[KANAME chuckles]

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,125
Uh! Wait, Kyoko,
aren't you late for work?

96
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:58,416
[gasps] I forgot! Uh-oh.
I better get going!

97
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,166
[KANAME]
Take care!

98
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,583
[KYOKO]
See ya!

99
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,375
Best of luck.

100
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,083
Our student council duties are
finally coming to an end.

101
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,750
You achieved much during
your tenure. I thank you.

102
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,458
[KANAME] Thank you
for all you've done!

103
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,125
I was never really cut out
to be vice-president, though.

104
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,000
Sagara. I appreciate
your service, too.

105
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,833
Thanks, your Excellency!

106
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,083
"Your Excellency"?

107
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,916
No. I won't be president
for much longer.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Once I'm out of office,
how will you address me?

109
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,375
As "Your Former Excellency",
of course.

110
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,333
[HAYASHIMIZU chuckles]

111
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,833
You honor me, Sagara.

112
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,833
But why don't we try something
shorter, and less flashy.

113
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,500
[SOUSUKE]
Understood, sir.

114
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,625
You guys make a
pretty good team.

115
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,041
Oh, I meant to ask you.

116
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,416
Are you ready for your
college entrance exams?

117
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,291
I have a feeling
I'll be fine.

118
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,625
Provided I don't get maimed
by a car wreck on my way

119
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,708
to the testing center.

120
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,458
How confident.

121
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,083
And here I am, scared to death
that I won't get into college.

122
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,541
Even if I spend the entirety
of the year studying for it!

123
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,666
Is that so? Because I've heard
that as far as science and

124
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,083
math are concerned, your grades
are consistently perfect.

125
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:58,833
[gasps]

126
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,083
[SOUSKE grunts]

127
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,916
Look, that's good!

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,791
So be proud! One should know
and value their own aptitudes.

129
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,375
[KANAME]
Yes! That's true.

130
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,833
[KANAME giggles]
Well, time to get going.

131
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,000
Shall we, Sousuke?

132
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,500
Sure. I'll come.

133
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,458
Hold on, Sagara. I'd like to
speak with you for a moment.

134
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,791
All right?

135
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,666
[HAYASHIMIZU]
It's been what,

136
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,125
nine months since you
transferred here?

137
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,166
[SOUSUKE]
Yes, sir.

138
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,750
[HAYASHIMIZU]
Much has transpired.

139
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,708
Strange incidents.
Dangerous ones.

140
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,125
[SOUSUKE]
Yes.

141
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,500
I doubt you can keep
it up much longer.

142
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,583
What do you mean,
"keep it up"?

143
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:39,125
The life you lead.
It's not a problem with you.

144
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,750
You've caused your
fair share of disturbances,

145
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,083
but with a little
more learning,

146
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,083
I'm certain you'll become
more or less "normal".

147
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,250
I'm afraid, she's the problem.

148
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,625
Chidori? How so?

149
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,958
I looked into that hijacking,
as well as the multitude

150
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,000
of startling incidents
that followed in its wake.

151
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,500
It's her. She's been at
the center of all of it.

152
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,041
And the same thing
happens each time.

153
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,791
You're nowhere to be found,

154
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,166
and a mysterious
armed group appears.

155
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,625
I've refrained from prying.

156
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,250
But, I fear it's only
a matter of time

157
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,416
before someone
else makes a fuss.

158
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,125
[SOUSUKE]
Well, I...

159
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,333
[HAYASHIMIZU]
I'll be graduating soon,

160
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,291
which means I won't be
around to keep defending your

161
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,500
mutual situation the
way I have been.

162
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,958
[SOUSUKE]
I... I like it here.

163
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:31,250
I feel the same. Everyone here
has been affable so far.

164
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,250
But if something
bad were to happen,

165
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,833
they will be frightened,
as well as anxious.

166
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,875
Then, they'll become cruel.

167
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,208
You're saying that
we should leave?

168
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,916
I didn't go that far.
It solves nothing.

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,208
But still, it's something
you and she should discuss

170
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,500
sooner than later.

171
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,125
[SOUSUKE]
Hm.

172
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,375
[HAYASHIMIZU chuckles]

173
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,333
[HAYASHIMIZU] And besides,
this is merely a school.

174
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,041
It's simply a way station.

175
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,291
It is?

176
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,541
[HAYASHIMIZU]
Although it's easy to forget,

177
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:07,041
life will go on from here.
Decades and decades of it.

178
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,916
[knocking]

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,166
[HAYASHIMIZU] Oh, my.
That ends our conversation.

180
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,416
I'm keeping
someone waiting, myself.

181
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,500
[KANAME]
And then, out of nowhere,

182
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,416
Shiori's boyfriend says
that he wants to break up!

183
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
[SOUSUKE grunts]

184
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,875
[KANAME] Things started getting
ugly from there, and somehow,

185
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,208
I got stuck calling her
boyfriend for her.

186
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,458
[SOUSUKE grunts]

187
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,958
[KANAME] Then when he
told me the situation,

188
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,041
I knew that it was all just a
terrible misunderstanding.

189
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,375
[SOUSUKE grunts]

190
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,208
[KANAME growls]

191
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,666
What is your problem?

192
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,791
Are you sad your job with
the student council is over,

193
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,666
or is something else
making you mopey?

194
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,166
No, I just...
It's nothing.

195
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,166
Don't give me "it's nothing".

196
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,041
Please, forget about it.

197
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,833
[KANAME grunts]
Boo.

198
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,916
[WOMAN A] And I said,
"Why are you shopping there?

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,291
The prices are so high!"

200
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,583
Listen.

201
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,041
[KANAME]
Hm?

202
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,000
[SOUSUKE]
Let's hold hands.

203
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,083
Huh?

204
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,458
So, no?

205
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:20,375
Look. I would, but I...
It's just...

206
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,916
[SOUSUKE]
Right. I see.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,250
[gasps]

208
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,083
[KANAME]
Um. It's just I... don't know...

209
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah, me too.

210
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,500
It's sudden. Strange.

211
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,750
You're right.
Is it too strange?

212
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,458
[KANAME grunts]

213
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,500
Well?

214
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,625
So hey, uh, you want
something to eat?

215
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,875
You're sure?

216
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,500
Uh, well, yeah.
I have enough ingredients.

217
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,750
We could... maybe have
a job celebration party.

218
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,166
Our own party?

219
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,291
[KANAME] Mm-hm.
Sounds fun, right? So why not?

220
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,208
[elevator beeps]

221
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:37,333
[KANAME]
Sorry. I'll have it right open.

222
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,833
Hey, perhaps we
should let go, for now.

223
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:40,500
'Kay.

224
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,875
[KANAME chuckles]

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,041
In we go.

226
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,291
[SOUSUKE]
Yeah.

227
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,208
[gasps]

228
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,500
[KANAME shouts]

229
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,625
It's you!

230
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,875
[KANAME]
What's the matter, Sousuke?

231
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,541
Why'd you--

232
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,583
[gasps]

233
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,500
Greetings, Kaname Chidori.

234
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,041
Don't move. Raise both
of your hands slowly,

235
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,291
and then stand up.
If you don't obey--

236
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,916
[LEONARD] Let me guess,
you'll gun me down?

237
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,500
The same old
diplomatic approach.

238
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,833
Give it a rest.

239
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,166
I'd find it crass, saying the
same thing to you.

240
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,041
[SOUSUKE]
What do you mean?

241
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,791
Let me show you.

242
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,250
[SOUSUKE gasps]

243
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,500
[LEONARD] The smallest AS model
in the world, the Alastor.

244
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:39,000
A gun like that, you'd be
at quite the disadvantage.

245
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,416
[SOUSUKE]
We'll see.

246
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,875
[KANAME gasps]

247
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,958
[gasps]

248
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,166
Now. Are you done?

249
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,333
I came tonight because
I wanted to talk.

250
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,541
[SOUSUKE]
Bastard.

251
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,250
I don't really care
why you've come here.

252
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,250
You can march yourself
right out of my apartment.

253
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,875
But I'm here to talk to you.

254
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,833
That's not my concern!

255
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,666
Get out!

256
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,833
Now hold on. It's a
rather simple matter.

257
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,833
No need to get so worked up.

258
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,916
Could you gather your things
and come to my place?

259
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,125
What'd you say?

260
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,416
You'll be treated with
the utmost courtesy.

261
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,791
I assure you. You'll be safe,
and free, for the most part.

262
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,708
Huh? I don't know what
you're talking about!

263
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,083
[LEONARD] Really? I thought I
explained it pretty clearly.

264
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,083
Are you making fun of me?

265
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,833
I'm not. Perhaps I'll
phrase it this way.

266
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,041
My organization is finally
taking things seriously.

267
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,750
What're you trying to say?

268
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,125
[LEONARD]
Mithril has done far too well.

269
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:42,458
Amalgam, my organization,
keeps losing to you guys.

270
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,875
And it's beginning to
become a problem.

271
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,958
That's right, and we're going
to keep making things difficult.

272
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,250
[LEONARD] What I'm trying
to tell you is simple:

273
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,083
You've gone too far. Now our
policies have changed.

274
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,833
We will crush Mithril, and take
the Whispereds by force.

275
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,583
[KANAME]
By force? You mean me?

276
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,125
[LEONARD]
That's right.

277
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,208
Amalgam has already started
to contemplate securing you,

278
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,791
even if it means having to
get rough. Do you understand?

279
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,208
So, you're saying--?

280
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,125
[SOUSUKE] You'd turn this
town into a sea of fire?

281
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,500
[gasps]

282
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,791
As things stand, yes...
Now then, with that in mind,

283
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,166
do you understand why I
came to you tonight?

284
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,333
[KANAME] To persuade
me before it happens?

285
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,458
Yes. I hoped my love
might sway you.

286
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,708
You've got some nerve!

287
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,916
[KANAME]
Hold on, Sousuke!

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,541
Huh? What for?

289
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,291
Do it.

290
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,875
That's quite kind of you,

291
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,916
but I just so happen to enjoy
my current life, the way it is.

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,708
But mostly. I would never
go anywhere with you,

293
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,958
you twisted creep!

294
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,291
I hate you! Loathe you!
Despise you!

295
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,666
[LEONARD chuckles]

296
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,541
So cold. Could it be you're
still upset with me?

297
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,083
Didn't you hear me?

298
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,833
[LEONARD]
But you said you'd forgive me.

299
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,000
[KANAME]
Get lost!

300
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,166
I'll say this in closing,
and listen well.

301
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,958
You are exceptionally gifted.

302
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,125
Yet you allow ordinary
people to boss you around.

303
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,583
It's a waste of your gift.

304
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,791
Stop talking.

305
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,875
You must've noticed
the difference by now.

306
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,458
Those around you are hopelessly
stupid when held in comparison.

307
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,833
Leave! Right now!

308
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,833
[SOUSUKE gasps]

309
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:19,041
Fine. I will then.
Consider yourself warned.

310
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,541
Oh! Also, Sousuke Sagara.

311
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,083
Yeah, what?

312
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,666
[LEONARD] A cusory investigation
has revealed that you have

313
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,583
racked up over a hundred
confimed kills in your career.

314
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,083
[KANAME, SOUSUKE gasp]

315
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,416
[LEONARD] Yet here you stand,
leading this kind of life.

316
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,083
Isn't that a little unfair?

317
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,833
[SOUSUKE breathes heavily]

318
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,125
Just saying. Goodbye.

319
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:55,500
[KANAME whimpers]

320
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,041
[SOUSUKE]
Chidori.

321
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,416
[KANAME gasps]

322
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,791
[KANAME]
Hm. I'm sorry.

323
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,208
Who cares what a
guy like that says?

324
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,916
He can't be trusted.

325
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,166
[SOUSUKE]
Yeah.

326
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,708
[KALININ]
Understood, Sergeant Sagara.

327
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,416
Try to hold out until morning.

328
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,708
We'll send a helicopter
out to meet you.

329
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,166
[SOUSUKE] But Lieutenant
Commander Kalinin,

330
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,375
tomorrow could be too late.

331
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,250
There's no telling when
they might attack!

332
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:30,250
All the more reason we can no
longer use normal channels.

333
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,875
Further communication should
be kept to an absolute minimum.

334
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,500
[SOUSUKE] Understood, sir.
Urzu Seven, signing off.

335
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:42,166
I knew this day would come, and
I knew it wasn't very far off.

336
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,583
But I never expected this.

337
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,666
[exhales]

338
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,583
It was only a matter of time.

339
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,125
Yes.

340
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,625
[KALININ] Shall we dispatch the
helicopter in the usual way?

341
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,458
No. We'll send the
Arbalest along with it.

342
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,416
The Arbalest?
Are you sure about that?

343
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,750
[TESSA]
For safety's sake.

344
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,375
An M9 should be sufficient
for a security detail.

345
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,250
Without Sergeant
Sagara as its pilot,

346
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,375
the Arbalest is no
different from an M9.

347
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,750
So we might as well
have it available to him.

348
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,166
Understood.

349
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,333
Sergeant Sagara was under
the impression that Amalgam

350
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:23,125
was starting to get serious.
Have they lost their composure?

351
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,625
Hard to say.

352
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,500
But perhaps, they've grown
quite annoyed with us.

353
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,041
I sincerely hope
that's all it is.

354
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,291
[SHINOHARA]
Captain.

355
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,333
I've made contact with
Tactical HQ in Sydney.

356
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,000
Admiral Boorda's on the line.

357
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,166
[TESSA]
Put him on.

358
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,833
Tessa? What is it?

359
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,916
Greetings, Admiral Boorda.
I thought you should know.

360
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,625
Leonard has made contact
with Kaname Chidori.

361
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,208
[BOORDA]
Is she all right?

362
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes, Sergeant Sagara
has her secured.

363
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,041
However, according to Leonard,
things are changing.

364
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,250
There's been a shift
in Amalgam's policies.

365
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,791
Elaborate.

366
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,750
[TESSA]
They'll be more aggressive.

367
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,500
We need to remain alert.

368
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:04,958
You're right. There were a
few disquieting developments.

369
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,916
Something odd is going on with
Intelligence, and I haven't been

370
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,791
able to contact Lord
Mallory since yesterday.

371
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,416
Is your location secure, sir?
Should you evacuate?

372
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,666
[BOORDA]
Good point.

373
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,333
We'll relocate operations
to our backup HQ.

374
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,625
Merely for the sake of caution,
in case of emergency.

375
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,458
[TESSA] Admiral? I'm having
trouble hearing you.

376
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:30,541
Tessa? This feed is awful,
we're losing signal strength.

377
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,666
Please, evacuate! Quickly!
Something feels wrong.

378
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,708
[BOORDA] Hurry it up,
this has never happened--

379
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,250
Uncle, please! Get out!

380
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,791
[BOORDA]
Reconnect me!

381
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,750
[MALE STAFF A]
Line A. Line D. Line V.

382
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,708
All lines have gone silent, sir!

383
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,125
[FEMALE STAFF A] It's possible
that there was an EMP attack.

384
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,916
What the hell's going on?

385
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,833
There's no time for
theories here. Signal evacua--!

386
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,291
[MALE PILOT A]
Bombing successful.

387
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,250
Commence Zero Hour.
Repeat. Bombing successful.

388
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,916
Commence Zero Hour.

389
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,083
[SHINOHARA] All standard
lines seem to be down.

390
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,833
No response from
Tactical Headquarters.

391
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,708
[MALE STAFF C]
Warning radar, weather radar,

392
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,000
most of our sensors are offline!
Trying to determine the cause.

393
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,375
[TESSA] Could this be the
result of an EMP strike?

394
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,583
[SHINOHARA]
It's similar,

395
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,291
but this seems to be an
ongoing phenomenon.

396
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,208
It's inconceivable that such
a pulse could be man-made.

397
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,791
What do you think?

398
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:29,791
The only thing left to us is to
remain vigilant. Your thoughts?

399
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,208
[TESSA]
Mr. Kalinin?

400
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,333
Yes. I am of the same opinion.

401
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,125
[TESSA] Sound the alarm.
Yellow One.

402
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,708
Yes, ma'am. Initiating alert
level Yellow One immediately.

403
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,250
[MALE STAFFD]
All hands alert! Yellow One!

404
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,208
All hands alert! Yellow One!

405
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,791
The base has come under some
kind of electro-magnetic attack.

406
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,833
All personnel, stand on alert
at your designated posts.

407
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,333
This is not a drill.
Remain vigilant, and stand by.

408
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,083
[MALE STAFF D]
All hands alert! Yellow One!

409
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,458
All hands alert! Yellow One!

410
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,166
[KURZ] An attack?
So where's it coming from?

411
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,791
Who knows? We're on standby.

412
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,166
[MALE STAFF D]
All personnel...

413
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,541
Well, damn!

414
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,458
What's this? Are you scared?

415
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,750
[KURZ] No, just blown away by
that uniform. I said da-yum!

416
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,208
[KURZ groans]

417
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,708
[MAO] Now that I'm
a Second Lieutenant,

418
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,583
I thought I'd get
used to wearing it.

419
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,208
Now quit staring and come on!

420
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,500
[KURZ groans]

421
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,916
[SOUSUKE] Urzu Seven to
Merida Island HQ. Respond.

422
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,375
This is Urzu Seven.
Merida Island, do you copy?

423
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,750
Damn! It's going
on six hours now.

424
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,750
[KANAME grunts]
What time is it?

425
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,125
Just after six.
So did you get any sleep?

426
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,125
Yeah. What about you?

427
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,333
Yeah, plenty.

428
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,875
Liar. You haven't slept!

429
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,250
I understand why we can't
stay at the apartment,

430
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,416
but how long do you plan for us
to drive around in this thing?

431
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,125
Just try to be patient
until we rendezvous

432
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,458
with Mithril's chopper.

433
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,916
[KANAME]
When will it come?

434
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,916
I don't know.

435
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,291
Huh?

436
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,000
I haven't been able to
contact HQ since last night.

437
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,416
Wraith either.

438
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,958
It seems the communication
network's been disrupted.

439
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,875
[KANAME]
Same with my phone.

440
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,291
The phones are a mess,

441
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,291
but satellite connections
are especially bad.

442
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,375
Tough luck. If you took
refuge at the Merida base,

443
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,041
we could ensure your safety.

444
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,208
Take refuge at the base?

445
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,541
[SOUSUKE]
That's right.

446
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,708
[SOUSUKE] Eat some. This might
turn into a long haul.

447
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,083
You really are a fan
of these things.

448
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,958
Do we have some
tea or anything?

449
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,250
[SOUSUKE]
Make do with water.

450
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,291
[gasps]
Hey! Great...

451
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,250
Sousuke? We will get to
come back, won't we?

452
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,000
Perhaps.

453
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,250
[gasps]
What?

454
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,625
Nothing.

455
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,125
The enemy's become more
fixated on your abilities

456
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,458
than we anticipated.

457
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,833
What, you mean the whole
"being a Whispered" thing?

458
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,666
But, those powers
are so vague. Jeez.

459
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,708
Less than you might think.

460
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,833
Hayashimizu remarked
on it yesterday.

461
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,458
Your perfect scores on
math and science tests.

462
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,458
That's not a normal thing.

463
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:28,208
But even if that's true, they're
just standard high school exams!

464
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,083
You're right, but one day you
might find yourself solving

465
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,166
the toughest equations
in the world.

466
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,541
[gasps]
I'll just keep it hidden, then.

467
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,708
[SOUSUKE] The time for that
is gone. Amalgam knows now.

468
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,541
[KANAME]
Well, what should I do?

469
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,166
Mithril has Tessa,
or rather, the Captain.

470
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,125
Her power is much like yours.

471
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,750
I'm sure you would
be welcome there.

472
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,083
[KANAME]
Who, me?

473
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,791
But, I'm nothing compared
to how amazing Tessa is.

474
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,583
Plus, I wouldn't be any
help during a war.

475
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,125
[SOUSUKE]
A war.

476
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,208
You're right. There's no way
we can fully count on Mithril

477
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,208
to be the answer
to our problems.

478
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,125
So your concerns are justified.

479
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,541
Then I still have school
to keep going to,

480
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,875
and I would miss all
of my friends there.

481
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,458
And yes, I realize I'm in no
position to talk like that.

482
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,208
Sorry.

483
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,583
[SOUSUKE] I'm well
aware of how important

484
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,000
your life here is
to you. Same here.

485
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,916
We've been living
it together. But now...

486
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,958
[SOUSUKE]
Chidori.

487
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,708
[KANAME]
Hm?

488
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,583
[SOUSUKE]
Maybe we should just...

489
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,666
[SOUSUKE]
No, never mind.

490
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,666
'Kay.

491
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,041
[radio chirps]

492
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,541
[SANTOS] Gebo Nine to
Urzu Seven. Can you hear me?

493
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,666
I'm currently holding at an
altitude of 3,000 meters

494
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,000
above Kawasaki.

495
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,375
[SOUSUKE]
It's the helicopter!

496
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:52,375
[KANAME sighs]

497
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,041
[SOUSUKE]
Urzu Seven to Gebo Nine,

498
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,833
you're garbled, but I hear you.

499
00:22:55,916 --> 00:23:00,291
[SANTOS] Urzu Seven, confirmed.
What is your current position?

500
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,166
[SOUSUKE] Gebo Nine, Urzu Seven
is currently on standby at

501
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,041
LZ Echo. I have Kaname Chidori.

502
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:10,333
[SANTOS] Gebo Nine, roger.
That's good.

503
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,041
Looks like we're at a range
where a signal will reach.

504
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,833
[SOUSUKE] Gebo Nine.
I'm unclear on the situation.

505
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,250
What's happening?

506
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,625
[SANTOS] It's wide-scale
radio interference.

507
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,208
Tactical HQ in Sydney
got knocked out.

508
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,333
Some of our other bases appear
to be under attack as well.

509
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,958
[SOUSUKE] What? Any word
on Merida Island?

510
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,041
[SANTOS] I don't know.
I'm at least going to

511
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,125
pick the two of you up,
so secure the landing zone.

512
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,083
[SOUSUKE grunts]
Roger that.

513
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,458
Current conditions at the LZ--

514
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,625
[gasps]

515
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,666
Get down right now.

516
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,541
Huh?

517
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,666
Bad guys.

518
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,833
[KANAME gasps]

519
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,291
[SOUSUKE] Gebo Nine.
This is Urzu Seven.

520
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,708
We're being surrounded.

521
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,333
Taking a quick head count.

522
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,916
At least five of
those Alastor types.

523
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,833
And at least, eight armed
enemy combatants.

524
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,625
I'll attempt to flee.

525
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58,958
[SANTOS ]
Gebo Nine, roger.

526
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,375
Do what you can
to get through this.

527
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,583
Five minutes or so.

528
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,291
I can try. Now wish us luck.

529
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,791
Sousuke?

530
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:13,291
I'm so sorry. We're in
for a long five minutes.

531
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,000
[SOUSUKE]
Next time: "Damage Control."
