00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,458
[LEMON chuckles nervously]

164
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,916
[SOUSUKE] These are all
specialized AS parts.

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,250
You can't get these
at the average shop.

166
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,583
I see.

167
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,875
You haven't been down to
the market yet, have you?

168
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:05,750
[SOUSUKE]
Market?

169
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:10,791
[PEDESTRIANS chattering]

170
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,833
[SOUSUKE]
Reminds me of Akihabara.

171
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,083
Thought that was
Tokyo's Hentai Town.

172
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,625
No. Electronics town.

173
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,208
[LEMON]
If you say so.

174
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,416
[SOUSUKE] Huh? They're selling
BMD chips for 400 these days?

175
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,708
Is that expensive?

176
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,625
[SOUSUKE] No. They were
2,000 a year ago.

177
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,833
[LEMON] Wow. That's a
serious mark down.

178
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,916
Just goes to show how
common ASes have become.

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,875
Which is odd in itself.

180
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:47,000
The increase in AS use,
it's happening almost too fast.

181
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,791
Or maybe I'm just
overthinking all this.

182
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,166
Yeah, that's my guess.

183
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,791
[SOUSUKE]
That's brutally honest.

184
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,166
Well, I'm an artist.

185
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,625
And good art doesn't try
to spare people's feelings.

186
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,041
You're really an artist?

187
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,958
[LEMON]
Yeah, and in a way at least,

188
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,375
I feel like you are too.

189
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,708
[SOUSUKE]
Huh?

190
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,708
Sure, I felt that way
after watching you fight.

191
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,916
It's graceful. It doesn't
feel like rote skill.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,500
There's art to it.

193
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,833
[SOUSUKE]
You think?

194
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,416
[LEMON]
I've watched all your matches.

195
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,625
And the way you fight
evokes something.

196
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,291
You're clearly not just
in it to make ends meet.

197
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,166
You're fighting for
something greater.

198
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,083
It's like your eyes are always
set on some distant goal.

199
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,541
Or... maybe I'm just
overthinking now.

200
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,250
I'm new to this stuff,
but that's the vibe I get.

201
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,250
Am I wrong?

202
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,583
I'm not really sure.
That said...

203
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,166
[LEMON]
That said?

204
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,875
When it comes to means of self-
expression, this is all I have.

205
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,250
What, you mean fighting?

206
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,791
[SOUSUKE]
Affirmative.

207
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,125
I wish I had some kind
of peaceful talent.

208
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,500
Like music, or drawing,
or photography.

209
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,000
But in truth,
fighting's all I'm good at.

210
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,208
Hey now, let's not
jump to conclusions.

211
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,625
You'll never know what
else you're good at

212
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,291
till you try it out.
For example...

213
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,541
I'm listening.

214
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,750
[LEMON] Hmm... You could
be a ladies' man!

215
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,125
But why would I do that?

216
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,333
[BOTH gasp]

[LEMON yelps]

219
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,166
[OFFICER A] Get down on
your knees. Nice and slow.

220
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,583
[LEMON]
Uh, officer?

221
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,958
I uh, think there must've
been some kind of mista--

222
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,291
Get down, quickly!

223
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,958
You said to do it
slowly a second ago,

224
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,750
now I'm just confused.

225

[LEMON grunts]

[SOUSUKE grunts]

227
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,500
I got a report that a couple
of no-good foreigners were

228
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,291
stealin' from some
of the businesses

229
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,291
here in our fine market.

230
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,833
Hm. Looks like our informant
was reliable, too.

231
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,791
Wow. You seem pretty certain.

232
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,666
When that Rick guy got
murdered, you said there was

233
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,041
no way you could prove anything.

234
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,208
Lemon, let it go.

You've gotta be kidding.

236

I have rights, damn it!
I wanna see a lawyer right now!

237
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,291
I'm gonna suggest that
you watch your mouth.

238
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,625
[SOUSUKE]
And who are you?

239
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,000
[POLICE CHIEF]
Heh. I'm the police chief.

240
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,083
And that's all you need to know.

241
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,000
Thank you, that's
easy to remember.

Huh? You've got some brass, kid.

243
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,791
But if you come at me with that
insolent attitude in my city--

244
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,250
Well, you can guess
how that'll go.

weapon to top it off.

you'd like me to add?

What am I adding to?

The list of charges
against you.

259
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,375
Then how about assaulting
a police chief?

Uncuff me and
I'll do it right now.

[POLICE CHIEF chuckles]

You don't seem to
understand your situation.

263
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:09,166
This room isn't just
an interrogation cell.

264
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,250
It's also a courtroom.

265
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,875
I'm your prosecutor,
judge, and jury.

266

Hell, I'll even be the man
who carries out your sentence.

267
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,000
You must be pretty
understaffed here.

[POLICE CHIEF]
Hmph.

269
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,541
What is it that you want?

270
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,000
I doubt you came here just
to tell me my prison term.

271
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,583
You're a sharp one.

272
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,666
As I'm sure you've guessed,
this is about the arena.

273
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,666
I hear that you're
on a winning streak.

274
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,250
Yeah, what about it?

275
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,708
[POLICE CHIEF] You're winning
more than you have a right to.

276
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,250
A lot of businessmen are
involved in these competitions.

277
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,750
It's big money.
And I mean really big.

278
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,083
So we have a certain, uh...

279
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,125
Well, why don't we
call it a system?

280
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,833
You're saying my
victories have cost

281
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,500
the wrong people money.

282
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,250
[POLICE CHIEF] That's right.
You really are a sharp kid.

283
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,291
So you can see
where this is going.

284
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,208
I want you to take part
in this system of ours.

285
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,958
I see. You're
rigging the matches.

286
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,458
Who's to say?

287
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,791
But as things stand, you're
lookin' at 50 years in jail.

288
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,958
[SOUSUKE] Fifty years would
be a problem. I'll cooperate.

289
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm glad to hear it.

290
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,958
[SOUSUKE] But I also want a
place where I can really fight.

291
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:13,916
Say what?

292
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,541
[SOUSUKE]
Not like the arena.

293
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,500
Take me somewhere that
I can fight for my life,

294
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,458
with far more money in play.

295
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,375
I know it exists.

296
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,291
[POLICE CHIEF]
Heh.

297
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,875
Where'd you hear that?

298
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,000
[SOUSUKE] It's how things
work in this field.

299
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,166
Do you know the details
of what's involved?

300
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,333
Of course. These live-ammo
fights are illegal.

301
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,583
So they can only be
watched by VIPs.

302
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,916
I hear these deathmatches
are quite the spectacle,

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,583
so they take place on
the city's outskirts.

304
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,125
I was also told the
payout's a lot higher.

305
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,541
About half the pilots
who compete end up dead

306
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,333
within a matter of months.

307
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,250
Were you aware of
that little fact?

308
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,125
That sounds about right.

00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,166
The money.

00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,208
[POLICE CHIEF]
Huh?

315
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,458
Well, in that case,
I'll make arrangements.

316
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,333
I think we can find
a place for you.

317
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:10,458
But until it's done, I'll keep
your friend in custody.
