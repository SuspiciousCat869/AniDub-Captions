It's an early RK-91 Savage.

00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,583
Its diesel engine is strictly
inferior to the gas turbine

engine you'd find in an RK-92.

That's the model
that replaced it.

The difference in
output isn't huge,

253
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,458
but it matters in close combat.

254
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,416
The torque control
has some quirks.

255
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,125
But that can be compensated
for with operator skill.

[SOUSUKE] Your most
pressing mechanical problem

259
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,041
is with the mech's
cooling system.

It looks like you've
been trying to repair

the original factory part.

262
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,416
I wouldn't bother. It's true
that aftermarket cooler units

263
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,958
are prone to burn out after
prolonged use, but if you only

264
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,833
run the mech for a few minutes
at a time, they'll do fine.

265
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,000
Best to save money there,

266
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,375
so you can invest in
new muscle packages.

I can't say for sure yet,

312
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,375
but he might be better
than Rick was.

313
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,458
And why's that?

314
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,166
[NAMI grunts]
Well, there's his build.

315
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,166
You see it a lot
with AS pilots.

316
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,375
The skin on his elbows and
wrists is thick. Callused.

317
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,083
And he definitely
knows his mechs.

318
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,916
[CROWD cheering]

319
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,458
[NAMI]
Not to jinx it,

320
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,291
but I think this guy
might really be an Ace.

321
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,791
[LEMON gasps]

322
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,500
[NAMI sighs]

323
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,041
[SOUSUKE]
I figured out the quirk.

324
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,041
[NAMI] Yeah, sure.
Just do your best.

325

[DAO chuckles]

326
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,125
[ANNOUNCER]
And for our next bout,

327
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,458
in the bare hands category.
First we have Ogre!

328
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,500
Operated by Quang Van Dao!

329
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:56,666
Versus Crossbow!
Operated by Sohsky Seagull!

330
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,916
You decided to name
it Crossbow, huh?

331
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's a pretty cool name,
don't you think?

332
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,708
[LEMON]
Eh...

333
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,916
[SOUSUKE]
It's a good name.

334
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,083
Although it's certainly
no Arbalest.

335
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,125
[NAMI]
What's an Arbalest?

336
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,541
It's basically
a fancy crossbow.

337
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,375
[NAMI]
Huh...

338
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,416
[CROWD cheers]

339

00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,583
[DAO]
Heh. You've got guts, pal.

341
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,250
I don't know who
you are in there,

342
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,666
but it's too late to
beg for your life.

343
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,208
[ANNOUNCER]
Fight!

344
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,208

00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,791

[ALL gasp]

348
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,666
[ANNOUNCER]
The winner is... Crossbow!

349
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,041
[CROWD cheers]

350
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,500
[LEMON]
Um, what exactly happened?

351
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,375
I think Dao must've
passed out.

352
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,416
What?

353
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,041
Mechs have shock
absorption systems,

354
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,416
but there's no protecting a
pilot against the g-forces

355
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,708
of being flipped that quickly.
It's kind of like...

356
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,833
...getting in a
nasty car accident.

357
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:28,916
[LEMON]
Whoa...

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,375
[NAMI]
But to understand that concept

359
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,208
and be able to execute it.
This guy's no average pilot.

360
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:38,916
[NAMI gulps] He's really good.
Maybe the best I've seen.

361
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,708
[LEMON]
Anyway, I take it we won?

362
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:50,750
[NAMI] Yeah. Believe it or not,
we really did it! Way to go!

363
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,250
[ASCH] That was
somethin' else. Good work.

364
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,625
Ha, I knew you'd come out
on top the whole time.

365
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,333
[KAEW] Then why were you tellin'
me that he had no chance?

366
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,375
[NAMI sighs, gasps]

367
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,583
It looks like we owe you
big time. So, thanks a million.

368
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,708
Not a problem, but If I may...

369
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,083
Yeah? What is it?

370
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,000
I'd like to work for
you more permanently.

371
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,958
All I ask is that you
provide me enough money

372
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,916
to secure a hotel and
three meals a day.

fight to watch.

Ya get any good pictures?

just watching, that I forgot!

I'll take one, too!

385

[NAMI exhales]
Everyone's so carefree.

386
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,958
It's almost like they forgot
what happened to Rick.

387
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,208
Better than being
depressed about it.

388
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,500
I guess. So by the way,

389
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,458
where did you learn how
to pilot an AS like that?

390
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,375
I trained with a
Savage I stole.

391
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:04,250
In the Helmajistan Civil war.
That was around six years ago.

392
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,125
[NAMI]
So you fought as a guerilla?

393
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,416
That doesn't make sense.

394
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
You look like you're
about the same age as me.

395
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,958
Wouldn't you have
been a kid back then?

396
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,083
[NAMI] Sorry. I'm being
kinda nosy, huh?

397
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,166
[SOUSUKE] It's fine.
May I ask you something?

398
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,416
Sure thing.

399
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
How did you come across
that Savage of yours?

400
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,708
Sure, it's an old mech,

401
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,041
but they're still not
easy to come by.

402
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:31,291
I just found it. On the
outskirts of my old village.

403
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,583
You know that this country was
at war, right? Three years ago?

404
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,125
[SOUSUKE]
Yes.

405
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, I lost my whole family
when my village was destroyed.

406
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,500
They were all killed,
and that Savage you used

407
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,375
belonged to the
people who did it.

408
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,750
It was out of fuel
and abandoned.

409
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,541
At first, I kept it hidden
in the mountains,

410
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,208
thinking I would
sell it for scrap.

411
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,958
But I've got a
dream I'm chasing.

412
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,750
An expensive one, too.
A couple people told me

413
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,125
I could make money with my
looks, but that didn't work out.

414
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,958
And so. I decided
to try the arena.

415
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,791
[SOUSUKE] How much can
someone earn there?

416
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,666
[NAMI] The sky's pretty
much the limit.

417
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,750
If you reach the top
bracket and keep winning,

418
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,083
you can more or less
live like a rock star.

419
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,291
Although I'm after a bit
more than a luxury condo.

420
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:16,250
Oh, yeah? So what
would you purchase?

421
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,416
I wanna rebuild my home village.
If I make enough money here,

422
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,166
then I can build new houses,
restore the ruined fields,

423
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,583
and fix up the roads.

424
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,000
And I'd really like to
restart my old school.

425
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,500
Your old school?

426
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,333
Yeah. It was just one building,
and the teacher died.

427
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:35,333
But it was a good little school.
I made my best memories there.

428
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,583
I can kind of relate.

429
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,583
[LEMON]
Ha, ha! You silly kids.

430
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,625
What're you makin'
those sour faces for?

00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,833
C'mon and join us,
let's get drunk!

00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,250
You say we should get drunk

00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,708
but it looks like
you're already there.

434
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,541
Well of course I am, I gotta
lead by example, right?

435
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,833
'Cause I'm the team sponsor!

436
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,375
Can you lead more quietly?

437
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,541

we got our party on!

down that way, isn't it?

Yes.

442
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,916
[NAMI]
Then we part ways here.

443
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,125
Meet me at ten AM tomorrow,
in front of the hangar, okay?

444
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,375

445
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,375
Right on. I'll see ya then.

You really took
care of me today.

450
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,541
I wanted to show
you my appreciation.

Looks like I can add
"sore loser" to the list

of things that make
you such a scumbag.

455
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,541
Now listen here, every
time you're rude to me,

456
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,125
I'm gonna give you a smack.

457
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,916
And that'll keep up till you've
learned your goddamn manners.

458
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,291
As if you're one to talk!

If you still don't
understand the rules,

then I guess I'll just
have to pound them into ya.

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,041
Stop it.

463
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,375
Oh, by the way,
that hotshot punk you hired?

464
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,083
I took care of him too.

465
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,083
