00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,958
We're closing in
on the dropzone.

159
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,833
[PILOT A] Roger that.
Good luck, Urzu 7.

160
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,416
[KANAME gasps]

161
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,750
What do you want now?

162
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,333
[LEONARD]
I want you to be prepared.

163
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,500
We'll most likely be
leaving here tonight.

164
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,708
[KANAME]
Don't tell me too much.

165
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,916
Can't have your caged bird
knowing secrets.

166
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,833
[LEONARD]
I'll explain later.

167
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,875
[KANAME]
A storm is coming.

168
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,000
[KANAME] 
A big storm.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,625
A big storm. That's convenient.

170
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,625
Is that--? Hold on.

171
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,083
That's an M9.

172
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,250
[LEMON]
An M9? One of Mithril's?

173
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,583
[SOUSUKE]
No, not with that loadout.

174
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,458
Looks like it's U.S. Military.

175
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,791
Prob'ly part of some
special ops unit.

176
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,791
Gotcha. So they're finally
putting them into combat.

177
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,916
Not to jinx it, but it looks
like they're after Amalgam, too.

178
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,541
That would be nice,
If surprising.

179

[SOUSUKE gasps]

180
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,791
[SOUSUKE]
The American mech is down.

181
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,250
So much for our surprise.
The mission's suspended.

182
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,458
Withdraw.

183
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,458
[SOUSUKE]
No. The enemy's distracted.

184
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,791
This is my chance!

185
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,291
[LEMON] It's too dangerous.
Turn back, Sousuke!

186
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,166
I don't have time.
It has to be now!

187
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,333
[SOUSUKE]
Chidori. Just a little longer.

188
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,750
[LEMON]
Sousuke!

189
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,666
[SEALS]
He turned off our com link.

190
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,375
[LEMON sighs] I'm gonna have to
pull out Bardet's support team.

191
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,791
I'm not willing to put
their lives at risk.

[CREWMAN B gasps]
Monsieur Lemon!

193
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,291
[LEMON]
Hostiles?

194
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,375
Nah, it doesn't look like it.

[MAO] Wow, that was
painful to watch.

202
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,541
What're ya doin'
in that antique?

203
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,625
[SOUSUKE]
Mao!

204
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,916
[MAO]
So that is you there, Sousuke.

205
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,458
You're still using one of
Mithril's old encryptions,

206
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,833
so we listened in on your chat.

207
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,958
[KURZ]
We heard the whole thing.

208
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,416
Your friend on the com
was all, "Sousuke! Sousuke!"

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,000
[SOUSUKE]
Kurz!

210
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,791
Yup! Glad you're still alive.
What's up, ya gloomy bastard?

211
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,291
[SOUSUKE]
But why are you here?

212
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,333
[MAO] We've got plenty
of catching up to do.

213
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,916
But there are more
bogies comin' in.

214
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,666
I'll send you the data.

215
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,500
[MAO]
Two Codarls.

216
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,375
We'll have a hell of a time
surprising them now.

217
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,416
[MAO]
You think we can beat 'em?

218
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,250
[SOUSUKE] Not a problem.
We'll take them out here.

219
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,416
Let's show these punks
how real soldiers do it.

220
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,708

That's fine by me.

somewhere to be right now?

231
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,458
What?

232
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,833
[MAO] Like I said,
we heard everything.

233
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,083
I didn't catch what it is,

234
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,041
but there's somethin'
you have to do, right?

235
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:31,416

Chidori. She's in the house.

Then go. We can handle this.

Thank you.

Good luck.

We've defeated two Codarls.

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,583
Currently engaging a third.

243
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,916
Also, upon encountering
the enemy,

244
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,833
we were assisted by
Sousuke Sagara.

245
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,333
You mean he's alive?

246

And feisty as ever.

same objective as us.

Sousuke! You all right?

258
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,625
Affirmative. I was joined by
some old friends from Mithril.

259
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,416
We took out two Codarl types.

260
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,458
Old friends of yours.
You think we can trust them?

261
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,833
[SOUSUKE]
I guarantee it.

262
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,125
[LEMON]
I have news too.

263
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,500
Someone made contact
with us earlier.

264
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,125
Huh?

265
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,708
[LEMON]
A woman named Wraith.

266
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,958
She's provided us
with a spare AS.

267
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,375
If you end up needing it,
we'll be at coordinate 41a.

Where are the Americans?

Looks like they withdrew.

276
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,875
Their morale seemed low.
Anyway I--

Hostiles? We've got incoming!

278
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,416
Just how many are there?

279
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,916
[MAO]
At least three more.

280

[CLOUSEAU] Careful. These aren't
like the ones from before.

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,458
[FOWLER]
We've been waiting.

282
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:33,666
[FOWLER chuckles]
Remnants of Mithril.

00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,041
[FOWLER] I must applaud
your strenuous efforts.

00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,125
But I think you've
come quite far enough.

00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,875
[CASPAR chuckles]

289
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,958
You'd never surrender.
So prepare to meet your end!

290
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,166
[KALININ]
You're completely surrounded.

291
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,750
Drop your weapon.

292
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,625
[SOUSUKE]
That voice. Commander?

293
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,625
This reminds me of our second
meeting, back in Helmajistan.

294
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,000
[SOUSUKE]
Commander! What's going on here?

295
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,333
[KALININ]
It's what it looks like.

296
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,500
I've defected to Amalgam.

297
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,708
Stand down, or I'll
order my men to shoot.

298
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,750
[SOUSUKE]
There's no way!

299
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,958
Just tell me if
Chidori's in there!

300
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,916
[KALININ]
You have no need to know that.

301
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,958
Drop your weapon and surrender.

302
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,458
Commander.

303
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,708
[LEONARD]
You really should do as he says.

304
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,625

305
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,166
[grunts]
Where is Chidori!

306
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,500
Oh my. Look at you.

307
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,791
You're determined, I'll give
you that much. Pathetic.

308
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,083
Mister Gold's forces will
be arriving shortly.

309
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,500
[LEONARD chuckles] He plans
to show his true colors.

310
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,583
We're short on time.

311
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:59,166
So, what do you plan to
do about this problem?

312
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,125
Dispose of it.

313
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,958
Ah. Good.

314
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,875
[KALININ] There you have it,
Sergeant Sagara.

Are you sure about this?

320
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,291
[WRAITH] Yeah. That guy's the

That's what you wanted,
