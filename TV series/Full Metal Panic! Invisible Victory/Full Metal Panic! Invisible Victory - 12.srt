Shall we pursue?

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,500
[SOUSUKE] It's outside of
this weapon's range, right?

165
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,166
[AL]
Technically, no.

166
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,125
What?

167
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,250
[AL] Demolition Gun
switching to Howitzer mode.

168
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,500
Maximum range is
30 kilometers.

169
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,750
All right, let's give it a try.

170
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,083
[SOUSUKE grunts]

171
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,916
[AL]
Direct hit. Target destroyed.

172
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,541
Airspace is clear of hostiles.

173
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,416
Good. Maintain altitude.
And take us north-northwest.

174
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:37,500
[SOLDIER B grunts]

175
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,625
Shit. What the hell have
these guys gotten us into?

176
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,750
[KANAME grunts]

177
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,833
[SOLDIER B gasps]

178
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,916
Don't move an inch.

179
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,416
[SOLDIERS gasp]

180
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,416
Whoa. Don't do
anything crazy, kid.

181
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,916
Then don't test me.
Just turn this thing around!

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,291
You're a lot livelier
than expected.

183
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,250
[KANAME]
Take us back.

184
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
If you don't. I'll kill him.

185
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,666
What do I care?

186
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,875
The man can't even keep
track of his own weapon.

187
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm not bluffing.
I really will shoot him!

188
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:17,208
Oh will you? You mean the same
way you shot Leonard Testarossa?

189
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,583
You shouldn't pick up a gun if
you're not prepared to shoot.

190
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,833
[KANAME grunts]

191
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,791
In order to enforce your will,

192
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,250
you must first be
ready to hurt others.

193
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,625
And I don't believe
that you are.

194
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,750
You've no idea what I can do.

195
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,750
I know what I can do. And I
know that you're not like me.

196
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,291
[KANAME gasps]

197
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,208
Just tell me this. Will I
ever get to see him again?

198
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,458
No, you will not.
Give me the gun.

199
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,958
[KANAME]
Then I'll do this.

200
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,416
Hold on!

201
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,625
I've had enough.

202
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,416
Just calm down. I'll do
what I can for you.

203
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,916
So turn us around.

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,583
[KALININ] I'm sorry,
but that, I can't do.

205
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,875
Leonard is still in need
of medical treatment.

206
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,083
Then there's the risk of the
enemy shooting us down.

207
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,416
Please calm yourself
and lower the gun

208
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,375
so we can talk about this.

209
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,083
Fine. Then let me say goodbye.

210
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,958
Goodbye?

211
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,500
Give me a radio.

212
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,833
[MAO chuckles]

213
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,916
[KURZ] Damn. You're tellin' me
that Sousuke did all of this?

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,083
That's crazy.

215
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,333
[MAO] It's called
the Laevatein, right?

216
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,000
That's one promising mech.

217
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,166
[KURZ] If only we had it
back at Merida Island.

218
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,708
[SOUSUKE]
What are you talking about?

219
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,291
[CLOUSEAU] We'll tell you later.
More importantly, Sagara,

220
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:14,250
I want the prisoners to see as
little of that mech as possible.

221
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,416
Yes sir.

222
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,708
Well, Al, activate ECS.
Make us invisible.

223
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,958
[AL] Not possible.
This mech is not equipped

224
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,041
with an Electronic
Concealment System.

225
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,625
Seriously?

226
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,250
[AL] Between its powerful combat
features and the Lambda driver,

227
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,083
there was no space for any
extraneous electronic equipment.

228
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,458
[SOUSUKE]
There're barely any electronics.

229
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,708
This is modern warfare.
That's crazy.

230
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,208
[AL] We'll rely on allied
support on that front.

231
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,750
Let us fight on, and not
lose heart, Sergeant.

232
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,958
[SOUSUKE] I can think of
some extraneous equipment.

233
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,291
[AL]
What might that be?

234
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,041
Well, you. If I threw
you in the trash,

235
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,416
I could fit an ECS
in here easily.

236
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,458
[AL]
That suggestion is nonsense.

237
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,500
Without me, this unit
is an utterly useless-

238
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,458
I've picked up a
new radio transmission.

239
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,291
It would appear
that it's for you.

240
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,291
For me?

241
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,666
[AL]
Shall I patch them through?

242
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,208
Do it.

243
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,041
[KANAME]
Sousuke?

244
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,583
[SOUSUKE gasps]

245
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,416
[KANAME]
Can you hear me? Come in.

246
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,416
Chidori! Are you okay?
Where are you?

247
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,791
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

248
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,375
[SOUSUKE]
Well things aren't fine.

249
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,166
A lot's happened since they took
you. It wasn't an easy journey.

250
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,250
But I came.

251
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,333
I came to save you,
and take you back to school,

252
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:26,583
just like I promised!
Where are you now? Tell me!

253
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,375
Please, Sousuke. Stop this.

254
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,166
Stop what? Coming for you?

255
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,333
[KANAME]
I get it now.

256
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,083
If I keep trying to be free,
then no matter what,

257
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,791
innocent people are
bound to get hurt.

258
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,375
I mean, just look at
what happened to Kyoko.

259
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,750
That was my fault!

260
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,500
Chidori.

261
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,333
[KANAME] I can't take
it anymore. So please...

262
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,500
...just forget about me.

263
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:54,875
[SOUSUKE]
You mean that?

264
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,000
We have to end it.
This is goodbye.

265
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:02,958
I won't ever...
hear your voice again.

266
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,583
I've changed my mind.

267
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,166
[ALL gasp]

268
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,000
Look, forget what I just said!
I don't care if I hurt someone!

269
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,500
[SOLDIERS gasp]

270
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,916
[KANAME] Don't move.
I'm not done talking.

271
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,125
Sousuke, I have
an order for you.

272
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,000
[SOUSUKE]
What is it?

273
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,041
Find me and take me home.

274
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:37,166
Rescue me, no matter what
it takes! Even if someone dies.

275
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,041
Just do it. Save me. Even if
hundreds of people die.

276
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,083
Or thousands, or millions!

277
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,375
You come and get me.
Put all of those stupid,

278
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,708
annoying, nonsense, soldier
skills of yours to use, okay?

279
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,833
No matter who you're up against,
or how strong they are.

280
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,708
You beat them up and
come hold me tight.

281
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,125
You can do that,
can't you? Well?!

282
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,375
Yes. Not a problem.

283
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,250
[KANAME whimpers]

284
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,666
Don't you worry. I'll find you.

285
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,583
Sousuke. I love you.

286
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,166
I love you, Chidori.

287
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,500
[KANAME]
I'm glad.

288
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:16,500
So. The next time I see you,
We had better kiss.

289
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,958
No holding back,
no matter who's around.

290
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,583
Kay? You promise?

291
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,000
I promise.

292
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,125
[KANAME] Oh. You know
that part about millions dying

293
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,041
was just a figure
of speech, right?

294
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:32,333
[SOUSUKE gasps]
Right... I know that.

295
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,375
[KANAME]
I'll be waiting.

296
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,666
Chidori?

297
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,875
I feel as though
you tricked me.

298
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,416
[KANAME]
What do you mean?

299
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,166
You had me thinking you
truly intended to die.

300
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,041
I wasn't acting. I did mean it.

301
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,541
That said...

302
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,041
Now, I have resolve.

303
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,791
Wow, buddy. "Sousuke,
I love you so much!"

304
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,583
And then, "Yeah, well I
love you even more, baby."

305
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,750
I could barely take it.

306
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:40,000
It's so sweet I almost
threw up in my cockpit.

307
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,625
Half a year apart and
that's what you open with?

308
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,250
I gotta say, it really
seems like you've grown.

309
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,250
You're doin' your big sis proud.

310
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,666
[SOUSUKE]
Mao...

311
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,875
Well. Anyway, it's good to
see you're still kickin'.

312
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,125
I'm sure that we'll have
a lot to talk about.

313
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,333
Sir.

314
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,333
Hey, Lemon.

315
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,208
So, you are a ladies' man.

316
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,833
Well uh... You see--

317
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,958
No sweat. You mind introducing
me to your commanding officer?

318
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,083
I feel like we're already

a while, hasn't it?

I'm glad you're all right.

Well, a lot's happened.

[SEALS] Hey nurse!
I need some TLC!

Just ignore this idiot.
I'm the one that needs care.

off me! I'm an American soldier!

I'd like to introduce Lemon.

I was just introducing
you to my commander.

You mean... this girl?
