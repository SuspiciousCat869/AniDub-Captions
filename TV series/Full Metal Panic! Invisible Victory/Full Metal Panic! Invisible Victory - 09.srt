00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,875
Fall back. Fall back!

[MARTHA gasps]

161
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,250
I knew it.

162
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,083
Wh-What do you mean?

163
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,666
You'll see soon enough.
Urzu One! Exterminate the enemy!

164
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,541
[CLOUSEAU]
Roger that, Madame Captain.

[MARTHA whimpers]

[TESSA gasps]

167
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,458
I can take him.

[grunts]

169
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,958
It's a Lambda Driver.
But hey, now I can see it.

170
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,791
This is Urzu One to the Danaan!
I'm ready for that delivery!

171
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,333
[MARDUKAS] This is the Danaan.
We're launching it now.

172
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,000
[MARDUKAS] Missile is currently
set to inertial guidance.

173
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,583
ETA is 30 seconds.

174
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,708
We'll transfer terminal
guidance to you, Urzu One.

175
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,458
[CLOUSEAU]
Urzu One, roger!

176
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,541
[DRAGONFLY]
Code confirmed.

177
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,500
Terminal guidance
is now authorized.

178
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,541
Set to explode on impact.

179
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,708
[DRAGONFLY]
Roger.

180
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,791
[CLOUSEAU]
Let's do this.

181
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,250
You'll block this, and then...

182
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,500
[CLOUSEAU]
...I'll hit you from behind!

183
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,875
[CLOUSEAU]
Urzu One to all units.

184
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,208
I've defeated the enemy AS.

185
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,916
[MAO]
Tessa, the enemy mech is down.

186
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,833
[TESSA]
Good, and Fowler?

187
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,791
Sorry, but he managed to escape.

188
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,250
[TESSA]
That's fine.

189
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,416
This mission was really just
to say hello. And besides,

190
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,750
It was half a failure as soon
as a civilian got involved.

191
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,666
I'm just glad she's okay.

192
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:45,041
[phone rings]

193
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,125
[MAO]
Be careful. It might be a trick.

194
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,250
It's all right.

195
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,208
Mr. Fowler.

196
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,000
[FOWLER]
First, allow me to say bravo.

197
00:14:56,083 --> 00:15:00,791
You wiped out my men and my AS.
I was utterly defeated.

198
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,291
I disagree.

199
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,125
If it were an utter victory,
you'd be in my custody now.

200
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,083
[FOWLER]
It was a close call.

201
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,583
[TESSA] It was my intention
to tie you up and force you

202
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,875
to tell me
everything you know.

203
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,833
Even if it meant using measures
that would've wiped that smirk

204
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,958
off your face, permanently.

205
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,500
Such dreadful words
from such a lovely voice.

206
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,625
Do you truly intend to wage
a guerilla war against Amalgam

207
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,708
with your one ship? You must
realize how outnumbered you are.

208
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,958
[TESSA]
Yes. Painfully aware.

209
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,041
[FOWLER] Yet your fighting
spirit stays strong.

210
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,750
I would love to find
out what drives you.

211
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,166
Mr. Fowler.

212
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,000
As long as we're on the phone,
may I be frank with you?

213
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,291
[FOWLER]
Feel free.

214
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,791
Put simply.
You're a piece of shit.

215
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,500
And there's nothing I hate
more than when arrogant pricks

216
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,125
like you try to talk
like they're anything

217
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,500
but selfish murderers!
So fuck you and go to hell!

218
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,541
[FOWLER]
Ha!

219
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,625
That's just about all I
have to say to you.

220
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,333
Be a good errand boy and tell
my brother to do the same.

221
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:01,833
[TESSA grunts]

222
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:08,125
[TESSA] Our work is done here.
Withdraw immediately.

223
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,125
[TESSA]
What is it?

224
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,625
That... was amazing.

225
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,791
You really called him
a piece of shit.

226
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,625
[MAO] Course she did.
Our captain's got balls.

227
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,291
Don't'cha Tess?

[ALL laugh]

229
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,708
No! I just kind
of lost my temper.

230
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,083
[CLOUSEAU] This is Urzu One.
You should hurry.

231
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,666
Police and firefighters
are on their way.

232
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,250
[TESSA]
Doctor Witt?

233
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,375
No. Please don't kill me.

234
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,125
There's no need to worry.

235
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,708
They only threatened
you to force us to act.

236
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't expect you'll
be seeing them again.

237
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,583
A bluff?

238
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,500
So you're safe now.
Even so, I'm sorry.

239
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,916
Not only did I trick you,

240
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,416
I exposed you to danger
in the process.

241
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,250
Best of luck.

242
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,750
[FOWLER] My apologies,
Master Leonard.

243
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:11,791
[LEONARD] Not at all. It's fine.
We can leave her be for a while.

244
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:17,166
[FOWLER] As you wish. Also,
she gave me a message for you.

245
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,333
The language was
rather coarse, sir... Um...

246
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,833
Go on. Let's hear it.

247
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,833
[LEONARD]
My, such strong words.

248
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,333
[FOWLER]
Pardon the rudeness, sir.

249
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,208
[LEONARD] Oh, it's good
that she has spirit.

250
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,208
Our chef doesn't
know what to do.

251
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,083
I'm told you insist on
preparing your own meals.

252
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:48,000
[KANAME] Fried rice in an
omelette is what I want to make.

253
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,250
[KANAME] But you don't
have the ingredients.

254
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,625
So it won't taste like the ones
I used to make in Japan.

255
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,333
[LEONARD]
In time, you'll forget.

256
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,083
[KANAME] Forget what? The taste
of a fried rice omelet?

257
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,166
[LEONARD] I've forgotten
what the food of my upbringing

258
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,583
tasted like. And the face of
the mother who prepared it.

259
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,291
That's cause you're heartless.

260
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,333
[LEONARD]
No, that's how time works.

261
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,333
[KANAME] So you're saying
eventually I'll forget

262
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,291
everything and fall
in love with you?

263
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,666
Well, I didn't go that far.

264
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,416
No one alive can
defy their destiny.

265
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,416
I've found a certain salvation

266
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,375
merely in accepting
that one truth.

267
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,875
That could be true. But I'm
not about to forget the taste

268
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,125
of my own mother's cooking.

269
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:35,375
Be honest with me. Did you
really forget all that?

270
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,875
It's the truth. Cross my heart.

271
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,833
[KANAME] Oh. What are
you standing there for?

272
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,666
I didn't make any for you.

273
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,541
[LEONARD]
That's too bad.

We've received word from our

It seems he's still alive.

You must mean <i>him</i> .

I was hoping you'd wake up soon.

Don't drink too fast.

What's the situation?

Say what? Oh, I get it.

288
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,250
All right, I'll tell you.

289
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,000
It's been eight weeks
since Nami's death.

290
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,458
Today is March 20th.

291
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,625
And, where are we?

292
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,791
We're on a solitary island
at the edge of Polynesia.

293
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,041
It's about 15,000
kilometers from Namsac.

294
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,583
[LEMON] There weren't many
places I could hide you,

295
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,333
on the brink of death. I chose
the one most isolated.

296
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,708
You had a lengthy surgery.

297
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,250
Almost died a few
times after that.

298
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,750
I think you'll feel
this one for a while.

299

[LEMON gasps]

[LEMON exhales]
Yeah, I'm a smoker.

301
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,125
Once your condition
seemed to be stable,

302
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,000
I went back and buried
Nami in her old village.

303
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,708
I walked a bit downwind
of the grave, lit a smoke.

304
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,875
Then came the tears.
Guess about a decade's worth.

305
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,916
I think I must've loved her.
Pushed it off 'til then.

I'm sorry.

I don't blame you personally.

And someday...

Heh. Someday. We'll both have
to face what we've done.

Let's get to business.
