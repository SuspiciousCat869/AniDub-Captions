Right. Sounds good.
So about that AS of yours.

How long can it keep jamming?

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,500
[SOUSUKE]
For up to two minutes.

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,125
And it has to be still
to keep the signal up.

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,041
[KANAME] But if the signal
covers the whole school...

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,416
[SOUSUKE]
Yes.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,666
That should stop them from
detonating the bombs.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,541
[KANAME] Yeah. So we need
to evacuate everyone,

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,583
and save Kyoko, in the
span of two minutes.

12
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,166
[SOUSUKE] How do we determine
what frequency to jam?

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,125
[KANAME]
I'll write an algorithm for it.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,916
[SOUSUKE]
In the Arbalest's programming?

15

You can do that?

16
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:52,083
[KANAME] It's written
in BAda, right? I can do it.

been ordered to kill the girl

For us to deal,

00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,041
[TESSA grunts]

318
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,000
You're hit. No! Yang!

319
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,291
[YANG grunts] You have
to run. Just leave me!

320
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,750
I won't!

321
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,833
[MALE SOLDIER B]
This is Alpha Six.

322
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,750
We've secured the
enemy commander.

323
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,958
[MALE SOLDIER C]
Stand up. Get out of the way!

324
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,791
Stop it!

325
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,500
--[gunshots]
--[MALE SOLDIERS grunt]

326
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:36,583
What a pain. These creeps are
showing up all over the place.

327
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,208
Melissa!

328
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,958
[MAO]
What's our situation?

329
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,958
[TESSA]
This base will fall soon.

330
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,208
I ordered a withdrawal
to the Danaan.

331
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,625
But I don't know
how many made it.

332
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,875
Lieutenant Commander
Kalinin stayed behind.

333
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,500
[MAO]
I see.

334
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,958
[TESSA] We haven't heard
from Captain Clouseau,

335
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:59,541
or Sergeant Weber.
I fear that they... well...

336
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:03,291
Damn it all. I'll make those
Amalgam bastards pay for this.

337
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,000
[TESSA]
I intend to, as well.

338
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,125
[MAO gasps]

339
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,041
[MAO chuckles]
Now that's the spirit.

340
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,916
That's why I love ya, Tessa.

341
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,375
[TESSA chuckles]
Same to you, Mao!

342
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,958
[MARDUKAS] We've been waiting
for you, Madame Captain.

343
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,958
The Tuatha de Danaan,
ruler of the seven seas,

344
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,958
and mightiest ship
in human history,

345
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,000
is ready to depart at any time.

346
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,583
We wait for your command.

347
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:35,833
Commander Mardukas. Mao?

348
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,416
I am astounded,
that even now,

349
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,583
you still act with
such discipline.

350
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,291
[MARDUKAS]
Of course, ma'am.

351
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,791
It's in battle that
discipline is needed most.

352
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,791
All hands, board the ship.

353
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,833
[DANA]
Performing final assessment.

354
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:56,625
Group A: complete.
Group B: complete.

355
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,166
Group C: Conditionally complete.

356
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,500
Awaiting acknowledgement
from XO.

357
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,666
[MARDUKAS] She'll make
it for now, Captain.

358
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,083
[TESSA] Very well. Set out.
One third ahead!

359
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,333
[MARDUKAS] Aye, Madame Captain.
Set out. One third ahead!

360
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,666
[MALE PROPULSION OFFICER A]
Setting out. One third ahead.

361
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,250
[TESSA] Good. Now open
all torpedo tubes.

362
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,500
[MARDUKAS] Aye, Madame Captain.
Open all torpedo tubes.

363
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,708
[FEMALE CONTROL OFFICER A]
Opening all torpedo tubes.

364
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,875
[MALE RADAR OFFICER A]
Contact!

365
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,458
Whatever this is, it's huge.
And it's dead ahead.

366
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,666
[TESSA]
That's fine.

367
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,833
Launch all of our torpedos.
And take us to full speed.

368
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,750
[MARDUKAS gasps, grunts]

369
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,250
Aye aye, Madame Captain.

370
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,791
Launch every torpedo as we
accelerate to full speed!

371
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,291
All hands, brace
yourselves for impact!

372
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,750
Do not falter. Push ahead,
no matter what!

373
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,041
[CREW grunts]

374
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,041
Who fired those shots?

375
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,416
[KURZ chuckles] Mind if
we hitch a ride, captain?

376
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,833
That was a close one,
even for us.

377
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,583
Sergeant Weber!
Captain Clouseau!

378
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,041
[MARDUKAS]
Those soldiers of ours.

379
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,250
They truly are tenacious.

380
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,708
And that's our
greatest advantage.

381
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,875
Open hatch 13 immediately.
Once we've safely recovered

382
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,958
Urzu One and Six, we'll break
through the enemy's net.

383
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,083
[MARDUKAS] Aye aye, ma'am.
Prepare to dive!

384
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,750
[ERI] Class, I know this
is a terrible situation,

385
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:35,250
but we all need to be strong.
I'm told that it's going to be

386
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,916
a while before the
school's fully repaired.

387
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,416
I now things won't seem very
normal during that time.

388
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,000
But I'm going to do my best,
and I encourage you--

389
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,458
Mister Sagara.

390
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,500
[SOUSUKE] I don't know what
you've already been told,

391
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:56,958
but it was me inside
of that white AS.

392
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,708
I am employed, by a
certain mercenary force,

393
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,708
as an active duty AS pilot.

394
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:06,333
I apologize...
for keeping that secret.

395
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,500
[ONO-D]
I don't want your apology!

396
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:12,208
Why don't you give it to the
girl you sent to the hospital?

397
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,416
Kyoko's still in there,
did you know that?

398
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,791
[SHINJI]
Ono-D, cut it out!

399
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,958
It's screwed up.
She didn't do anything!

400
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:22,541
Damn you. She would be fine
if it weren't for you!

401
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,750
[SOUSUKE gasps]

402
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,375
It should've been you!
It was your fight!

403
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:31,166
Don't just stand there!
Say something!

404
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,708
[ALL gasp]

405
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,916
[ONO-D]
We were friends, weren't we?

406
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,875
So say something.
Say something.

407
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:46,125
[ONO-D] Tell us. Why?
Why'd you come here?

408
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,458
[SOUSUKE]
I came here to say--

409
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,541
What?

410
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:53,125
[SOUSUKE]
That I'm going to find Chidori.

411
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,375
And bring her back here
where she belongs.

412
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,750
I give you my word.
I will bring her home.

413
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:05,833
So when she comes back,
please be ready to welcome her.

414
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:09,333
Thank you. That's all
I have to say.

415
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,250
[SOUSUKE] Next time:.
"Welcome to the Jungle."
