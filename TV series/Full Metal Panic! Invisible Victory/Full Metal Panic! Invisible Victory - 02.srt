it regardless, soldier.

well-fortified, but it can fall.

If those behemoths
reach the shore,

they'll eventually destroy it.

[CLOUSEAU]
It's our only means of escape.

We're on a solitary island.

00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,333
If we allow the
Danaan to go down,

300
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,291
then every one of us will
end up dead in this cave.

301
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,958
Our only option is to
defeat those behemoths.

302
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,500
So that's what we'll do.

303
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,750
Actually, there is
another option.

304
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,708
How about instead of getting
killed in a losing battle,

305
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,708
we grab some rifles and trot on
down to the command center.

306
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,250
You'd better not be saying
what I think you are.

307
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,791
I bet the enemy would go for it

308
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,041
if we promised to hand over
Tessa and her submarine

309
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,500
without putting up a fight.

310
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,208
I mean at the end of the day,
they are businesspeople.

Why wouldn't they take
a sweet deal like that?
