163
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,791
Your bearing at present suggests
that the news didn't anger him.

164
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,375
He was lenient with you.

165
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,625
You think so?

166
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,083
That man is supposedly
the only person alive

167
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,208
who can operate the ARX.

168
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,750
And in attempting
to neutralize him,

169
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,958
you've implied that he could
threaten Master Leonard.

170
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,000
But with the Belial,
Leonard's far stronger.

171
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,333
Then why the
assassination attempt?

172
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,250
Because I've found that
it's usually best

173
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,791
to nip that kind of
trouble in the bud.

174
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:36,208
I swear. You and Caspar follow
whatever whim takes you.

175
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,291
I wish you would think
to discuss these things

176
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,583
with me first.

177
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,291
When it's necessary, I shall.

178
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,958
[FOWLER]
In any case,

179
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,583
there's no longer a need
to assassinate Sagara.

180
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,833
[SABINA]
Why's that?

181
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,166
[FOWLER] Because we have
a lead on the ARX unit.

182
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,375
It's in Alaska.

183
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,750
[SABINA]
Will we seize it?

184
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,708
The order has been made.
This will be the first test

185
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:59,000
of our new friend
Mr. Kalium's capabilities.

186
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,875
It's too early to trust him.

187
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,208
[FOWLER] Never mind about that.
We should focus on the project.

188
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:10,000
Sousuke. I guess he's
still looking for me.

That idiot... Damn it.

190
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:20,500
[KANAME] The way I am now,
there's no point.

191
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,958
If they keep fighting for me,
more people will get hurt.

192
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,708
Like Kyoko was.

193
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,291
I don't want this.
Why can't they just stop?

194

This is a rarity.

00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,333
[KANAME]
Care to join me?

208

No, no thank you.

209
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,541
But if this means
you've cheered up,

210
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,250
then I'll take heart in that.

211
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,166
Don't jump the gun on that,
I'm still depressed.

212
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,458
I can do this at least.

Damn it all. I can't believe
they found us again!

Do you have any other hideouts?

No, that one was the last.

Regardless, it's clear
that my agency has a mole.

00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,000
What, do you know a

You know a former U.S. marine?

This wouldn't be the first time
he's helped me out of a bind.

First Namsac, then Polynesia.

is even hotter than

My camp not good enough for

No sir, the camp looks great.

I'm very grateful for
your help, as well.

This camp's been in

I trained here myself,
before I shipped to Nam.

Yup, this camp is old.

It's excessive.

Yet he keeps going,

251
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,208
because something is
driving him forward.

252

Any idea what that is?

253

All right, whatever you say.

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,916
But still, I'm pretty sure
this goes against

every medical theory
behind recovery training.

00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,958
If he works too hard,

00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,833
then his body won't have
the strength to keep healing.
