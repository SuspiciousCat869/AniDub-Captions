1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,333
- YUUJI, I CAN NEVER REMEMBER
WHEN THE TAIKA REFORMS WERE.

2
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,666
- WE'RE IN THIRD GRADE.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,750
YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY
NOW. YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

4
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,541
- WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
TEACH IT TO ME.

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,166
- THERE'S A SIMPLE
TRICK TO REMEMBER IT.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,083
YOU SAY, "TAIKA ALIVE
IN SIX TWENTY FIVE"

7
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,666
- TAIKA ALIVE?

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,291
- THEY CENTRALIZED POWER FOR
THE IMPERIAL COURT LIKE CHINA

9
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,958
BUT KEPT A NEWLY UNITED JAPAN
FROM DYING ON THE VINE.

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,083
"TAIKA ALIVE."

11
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,833
- TAIKA ALIVE IN
SIX TWENTY FIVE.

12
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,250
- CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT?

13
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:46,000
- I'VE GOT IT NOW.
I DON'T THINK I CAN EVER FORGET.

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,750
( theme song playing )

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,541
- Nishimura: AT FUMIZUKI ACADEMY

16
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,208
YOUR SKILLS IN THE CLASSROOM
ARE YOUR POWER

17
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,541
AND THE TEST RESULTS
ARE YOUR JUSTICE.

18
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,250
- WHAT'S UP, HIMEJI? YOU WANTED
TO TELL ME SOMETHING?

19
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,875
- ACTUALLY, IT'S MORE LIKE
A QUESTION I WANT TO ASK YOU.

20
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,500
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

21
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,750
- ( Mizuki gasping )

22
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,750
- SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. THE
VERY FIRST BATTLE OF THE TERM

23
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,041
BETWEEN THE
SECOND YEAR STUDENTS

24
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,750
ENDED UP WITH CLASS
F BEATING CLASS E.

25
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,583
- I SEE. A GOOD START
TO THE YEAR.

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,000
HOWEVER, THE LOSING CLASS
IS LIKELY DISPIRITED

27
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,458
ABOUT MOVING TO WORSE
EQUIPMENT SO EARLY ON.

28
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,041
IF THEY KEEP UP WITH THEIR
STUDIES THEY CAN JUST AS EASILY

29
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,166
TAKE IT BACK THE
NEXT TIME THEY MEET.

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,833
THE NEXT BATTLE IS ALL
WE CAN EVER PREPARE FOR IN LIFE.

31
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,333
- ACTUALLY...

32
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,916
AFTER THE BATTLE, THE STUDENTS
DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
TO TRADE EQUIPMENT.

34
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,750
AND WHAT WOULD MAKE
THEM DO THAT?

35
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,875
- MAN, THIS SUPER GLUE
IS RIDICULOUS.

36
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,541
MY DESK IS TOTALLY
FIXED ALREADY.

37
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,250
- WILL WONDERS NEVER CEASE?

38
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,541
LOOKS LIKE YOSHII
GOT HIMSELF BETTER GLUE.

39
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,208
- WE CRUSHED CLASS E.

40
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,000
IF WE CAN'T GET SOME BETTER
GLUE OUT OF THE DEAL,

41
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,166
THEN WHY BOTHER FIGHTING?

42
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,833
AND SHE'D HAVE A CLASS E DESK
NOW, IF I WERE RUNNING THINGS.

43
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,791
OKAY, EXPLAIN TO ME
ONE MORE TIME

44
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,416
WHY WE TURNED DOWN
OUR NEW DESKS?

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,791
- THEY'RE NOT NEW.

46
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,125
YOU REALLY WANT THE
CRAPPY WOODEN DESKS

47
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,583
THEY GOT IN CLASS E?

48
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,000
- IT'S BETTER THAN THESE
KINDERGARTEN TABLES

49
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,958
THAT THEY PULLED
OUT OF A DUMPSTER.

50
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,791
( grunting )

51
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,208
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

52
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,083
YOU NEVER USE IT
TO STUDY ANYWAY.

53
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,375
- BUT I DO USE IT. FOR REAL.

54
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,541
I EAT LUNCH ON IT. I SLEEP
ON IT. DRAW STUFF ON IT.

55
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,500
A DESK IS LIKE THE
TRUSTY STEED YOU RIDE

56
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,250
WHEN YOU DO BATTLE AT SCHOOL.

57
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,583
- YOSHII HAS ALREADY BECOME
ONE WITH HIS DESK.

58
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,958
- GO AHEAD AND KISS
THOSE TABLES GOODBYE.

59
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,708
WITH CLASS A
DECLARING WAR ON US,

60
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,375
WE'LL BE TRADING THEM IN TODAY.

61
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,541
I'VE GOT THIS WORKED OUT.

62
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,750
WE BEAT THOSE GUYS
AND THEIR GEAR IS OURS.

63
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,000
I'VE HAD TO CHANGE MY TIMETABLE
BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

64
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:23,083
EVERYTHING IS ROLLING ALONG JUST
AS I THOUGHT. RIGHT, HIMEJI?

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,333
- I GUESS SO.

66
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,000
- ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE CHECK OUT CLASS A?

67
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,916
- SO THIS IS CLASS A.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,708
- IT SEEMS MORE LIKE
A FOUR STAR HOTEL.

69
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,666
- NOW YOU SEE WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

70
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,083
I COULD LIKE, SO SEE MYSELF
SLEEPING IN HERE.

71
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,625
- LOOK AT THAT YOSHII,

72
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,750
IT'S LIKE A FREE COFFEE SHOP,

73
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,583
THEY CAN EAT AT
WHENEVER THEY WANT.

74
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,250
- YEAH, DON'T LET THEM THINK
YOU'RE BLOWN AWAY

75
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,791
BY THEIR AWESOMENESS

76
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,500
CAUSE THEN THEY'VE GOT YOU.
JUST TRY TO ACT CASUAL, LIKE ME.

77
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,000
- YOU'RE THE ABSOLUTE PICTURE OF
NONCHALANCE, SIR TABLEHAND.

78
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,708
- MY, MY. I DIDN'T THINK WE
STARTED TILL TOMORROW.

79
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,041
- HEY, SIS.

80
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,625
- I UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

81
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,583
- Yuuji: NAH. WE THOUGHT
WE'D CHECK OUT OUR NEW STUFF

82
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,250
BEFORE WE TAKE IT FROM YOU.

83
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,333
- Yuuko: WELL, LOOK AT THE
LITTLE NARCISSIST.

84
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,958
- THAT'S A PRETTY BIG
WORD FOR A CHICK.

85
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,666
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO MIX IT UP A BIT.

86
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,125
HAVE A REP DUEL INSTEAD.

87
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,500
- ( all gasp )

88
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,125
- Yuuko: AND YOU'RE AN IDIOT,
TOO? WOW.

89
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,250
IN WHAT WORLD COULD ANY OF YOU
POSSIBLY DUEL OUR TOP STUDENT?

90
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,416
- GETTING SCARED?
SEEMS LIKE IT.

91
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,333
SINCE YOU'RE PICKING ON
THE WEAKEST CLASS HERE

92
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,083
WHILE THEY'RE STILL RECOVERING
FROM THEIR LAST BATTLE.

93
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,041
- WE CAN DO THIS RIGHT NOW,
IF YOU LIKE.

94
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,375
- Shouko: WAIT.

95
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,750
I ACCEPT. THIS DUEL IS MINE.

96
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,750
- BUT, SHOUKO!
- ONLY...

97
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,000
I HAVE ONE CONDITION.

98
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,833
THE LOSER HAS TO DO ONE
THING THE WINNER SAYS,

99
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,333
UNCONDITIONALLY.

100
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,125
- SO THAT'S THE REASON
YOU'RE PICKING ON CLASS F

101
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,458
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

102
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,583
- DON'T BE ABSURD. IT IS
OUR DUTY TO CONFRONT YOU.

103
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,041
WE ARE CLASS A AND AS SUCH

104
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,583
REPRESENT THE HIGHEST
STANDARDS OF THIS SCHOOL.

105
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,333
YOU'VE SET SOMETHING
IN MOTION HERE.

106
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,541
WHEN BOTTOM-FEEDERS
START WARS

107
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,125
WITHOUT EVEN CRACKING
OPEN A BOOK

108
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,000
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO
TEACH THEM A LESSON.

109
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,250
- FINE BY ME. THE LOSER DOES
WHAT THE WINNER SAYS.

110
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,875
THIS SHOULD BE AN
ENTERTAINING DUEL.

111
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,666
- IT'S NOT A DUEL.
IT'S FIVE AGAINST FIVE.

112
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,166
- ( all gasp )
- BUT YUUKO...

113
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,875
- I'M CERTAIN OUR REP
WOULD EMERGE VICTORIOUS,

114
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,416
BUT THE WISE ARE ALSO PRUDENT.

115
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,583
- ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GO ALONG
WITH THIS FIVE ON FIVE DUEL,

116
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,416
AS LONG AS CLASS F GETS TO PICK
THE SUBJECTS TO BATTLE IN.

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,666
- WE'RE AGREED.

118
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,583
- Nishimura: AND WITH THAT,
THE BATTLE HAD BEEN SET.

119
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,750
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

120
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,583
WHY'D YOU AGREE WITH
THAT CREEPY PSYCHO?

121
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,166
- RELAX. THEY HAVEN'T
GOT A CHANCE AGAINST US

122
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,916
AND NOW WE'LL GET TO BOSS THEM
AROUND WHENEVER WE'RE FINISHED.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,916
- DON'T BE SO SURE.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,291
FROM WHAT I HEAR,

125
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,291
SHOUKO IS NOT REALLY THE
GIRL YOU WANT TO MESS WITH.

126
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,166
- IF YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING.
- OH, YEAH?

127
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,791
- EVERYBODY SAYS HOW
SMART AND PRETTY SHE IS.

128
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,250
BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THE
BOYS IN THIS SCHOOL DON'T WANT

129
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,958
TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR HER.

130
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,625
- THAT IS WEIRD.
GUYS LOVE THE PRETTY NUT-JOBS.

131
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,583
- WELL, APPARENTLY SHE'S A
TOTAL ICE PRINCESS TO MEN.

132
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,666
- HOW COULD SHE NOT
LIKE US GUYS, I MEAN...

133
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,208
WAIT A MINUTE.
SO, WHAT IF SHE'S AFTER...

134
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,666
- ( giggling )

135
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,458
- RIDICULOUS. THERE'S NO WAY
THAT'D EVER HAPPEN.

136
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,083
I MEAN NO JUDGMENT. BUT THAT'S
JUST STUFF THEY MAKE UP

137
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,916
FOR LATE NIGHT CABLE, RIGHT?
BACK ME UP HERE.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,666
- IT'S REAL.
- WHAT?

139
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,625
- THERE'S THIS ONE GIRL.
SHE'S ALWAYS JUMPING ME.

140
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,833
- THERE'S MY SWEET BABY.

141
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:23,958
- MIHARU.

142
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,708
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
WANT TO HURT ME?

143
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,541
YOU LEFT ME JUST SO
YOU COULD HANG AROUND

144
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,625
WITH THESE STUPID LITTLE BOYS
AND HIDE YOUR LOVE AWAY.

145
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,541
- HEY! OKAY. WOW! YOU'RE
GETTING ALL UP IN THAT.

146
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,791
- WHO'S THAT?

147
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,958
- MIHARU SHIMIZU,
SECOND YEAR, CLASS D.

148
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,708
- STOP IT! GET OFF OF ME.

149
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,375
- THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE SHY, SWEETIE.

150
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,833
I KNOW DEEP DOWN INSIDE
YOU REALLY LOVE ME

151
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,750
AND I CAN'T WAIT
'TIL YOU REALIZE IT.

152
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,041
- FOR THE LAST TIME, I TOLD YOU
I DON'T SWING THAT WAY!

153
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,875
YOSHII, A LITTLE HELP
HERE, PLEASE.

154
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,583
- I'M AFRAID SHE'S RIGHT. BUT
I CAN SEE WHY YOU'RE CONFUSED.

155
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,791
SHIMADA'S GOT SMALL BOOBS,
THAT ARE BARELY EVEN THERE,

156
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,250
A BAD TEMPER AND KINDA
JUST LOOKS LIKE A DUDE

157
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,000
IN A FIGURE FOUR LEG LOCK!

158
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,958
- I DO NOT LOOK LIKE A DUDE.
TAKE IT BACK!

159
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,708
- THAT'S RIGHT! I LOVE SHIMADA
BECAUSE SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

160
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,208
- MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

161
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,625
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
OUT OF THIS THAT EASILY.

162
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,208
NOBODY TALKS ABOUT
MY BREASTS LIKE THAT.

163
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,583
- I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY!

164
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,750
- THAT'S SO SWEET.
THEN YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME OUT.

165
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,083
I EXPECT CREPES AT LA VEDITZ
BY THE TRAIN STATION.

166
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,458
- WHAT? THAT PLACE?
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

167
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,583
- FINE!

168
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,583
- NO, OKAY. I'LL DO IT.

169
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,791
- GOOD. FROM NOW ON YOU
BETTER TRY TO BE SUPER NICE

170
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,083
AND CALL ME LADY MINAMI.

171
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,625
AND I GET TO CALL YOU AKI.

172
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,916
- ( groaning ) YES. MY LADY!

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,583
- I WANT... I WANT...

174
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:42,166
YOU SHOULD... YOU SHOULD JUST
SAY... SAY YOU LOVE ME SOMETIME.

175
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,791
- FINE. HERE GOES.

176
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,791
- NO, YOU WON'T!

177
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,791
- SAY IT!
- ( screaming in pain )

178
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,041
MOVE. MOVE. MOVE!

179
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:54,291
- SAY IT! SAY YOU LOVE ME
RIGHT NOW OR LOSE THE LEG.

180
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,333
- YES, MA'AM! "YOU LOVE ME
RIGHT NOW OR LOSE THE LEG!"

181
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,916
- ( all screaming )
- YOU IDIOT!

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,416
- ( bone snapping )

183
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,125
- THAT WAS NOT REAL
FUN FOR ME.

184
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,833
HIMEJI?

185
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,833
MUST BE AN IMPORTANT LETTER
YOU'RE WORKING ON.

186
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,916
- YOSHII, DON'T.

187
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,625
- ( gasps )

188
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,708
THAT TOTALLY LOOKS LIKE
A LOVE LETTER.

189
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,541
WHY WOULD ANYONE RISK
WRITING A LOVE LETTER

190
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,458
AT SCHOOL IN THEIR CLASSROOM?

191
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,208
- IT ISN'T LIKE THAT.

192
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,708
OKAY, YOU GOT ME, IT IS.

193
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,625
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

194
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,833
- IT'S A SILLY CURSED
CHAIN LETTER.

195
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,291
- AND NOW YOU'VE MANAGED TO MAKE
THINGS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED.

196
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,041
- IS IT TO SOMEONE
IN OUR CLASS?

197
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,166
- YES.
- OKAY.

198
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,833
THEN HOW ABOUT I TEACH YOU
HOW TO WRITE A REALLY GOOD ONE

199
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,250
THAT'LL FREAK EVERYBODY OUT?

200
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,583
- NO THANKS. IT'S NOT A
PASS-IT-ON-OR-BE-CURSED LETTER.

201
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
- STOP. I KNOW
IT'S ONE OF THOSE.

202
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,708
OH, GREAT. SEE, THE CURSE IS
WORKING ON ME ALREADY.

203
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,000
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

204
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,958
- I SEE. WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT THIS GUY?

205
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,458
I BET YOU'LL SAY HE'S HOT.

206
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,750
- WELL, I DON'T CARE
HOW HE LOOKS.

207
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,666
BUT I THINK HE'S
PRETTY AND CUTE.

208
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,208
YOU KNOW MY FRIENDS ARE
ALWAYS SAYING THAT

209
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,875
WHEN YOU AND YUUJI
ARE WALKING TOGETHER

210
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,500
THAT THEY CAN'T KEEP
THEIR EYES OFF OF YOU

211
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,458
BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE SO PERFECT.

212
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,250
- YOUR FRIENDS
SOUND PRETTY NICE.

213
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,833
YOU SHOULD KEEP THEM AROUND.

214
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,500
- THEY ALSO ARE PRETTY SURE THAT
YOU'RE THE DONUT TO HIS BANANA.

215
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,375
- YOU SHOULD LOSE THOSE FRIENDS.

216
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,208
- HE'S... IT'S NOT ALL
ABOUT THE WAY HE LOOKS.

217
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,708
IT'S ABOUT HIS INSIDES.

218
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,333
- WELL, WHO AMONG US DOESN'T
HAVE A FABULOUS SPLEEN?

219
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,333
- PRETTY SURE THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

220
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,041
- OH, YOU MEAN HIS PERSONALITY.

221
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,791
- UH HUH. HE'S SO KIND
AND CHEERFUL.

222
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,416
I ALWAYS SEE HIM HAPPY.

223
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,375
I'VE LIKED HIM EVER SINCE
THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM.

224
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,375
- THAT'S GREAT.
SO THIS LETTER ...

225
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,833
- WHAT ABOUT IT?

226
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,666
- I HOPE YOU GET THE RESPONSE
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

227
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,500
- THANK YOU.

228
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,833
- HERE'S WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING.

229
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,125
READY TO START TALKING STRATEGY?

230
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,333
OH, MAN. WHAT'S WITH YOU?

231
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,458
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

232
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,208
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
WALKING WITH ME.

233
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,208
- COME ON, DUDE. TALK TO ME.
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG, MAN.

234
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,083
- I'M NOT... I'LL NEVER BE...

235
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,541
I'LL NEVER BE YOUR DONUT!

236
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,708
- OKAY, IT'S TIME TO
START ROUND ONE.

237
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,416
- Hideyoshi: UNBELIEVABLE.
WHY AM I THE ROUND WHORE?

238
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,250
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, HIDEYOSHI?

239
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,666
DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE
AROUND HERE AS PRETTY YOU?

240
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,166
- GOOD POINT. THOUGH YOU'RE
AWARE I'M NOT A GIRL.

241
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,791
- ONE PLAYER FROM EACH CLASS,
PLEASE STEP FORWARD.

242
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,083
- DON'T SCREW IT UP, ALL RIGHT?

243
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,125
- WATCH AND LEARN BOYS, 'KAY?

244
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,958
- I'LL TRY TO GET THIS OVER
WITH QUICKLY.

245
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,500
NO SENSE IN TORTURING
THE UNFORTUNATE.

246
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,125
- DON'T LET THAT F FOOL YOU.
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

247
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,333
- AND HERE WE GO!

248
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,125
- RIGHT. SUMMONING MY
AVATAR. SUMMON!

249
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,750
OH, I FORGOT TO
MENTION SOMETHING.

250
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,333
MY TEST SCORES IN MATH WOULD
HAVE EASILY PUT ME IN CLASS B.

251
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,500
- OH, WOW. I THINK I MIGHT
START CRYING. SUMMON!

252
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,625
- THAT SUCKS.

253
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,833
- OH, I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT
MY MATH SCORES PUT ME IN A.

254
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,416
- WINNER, YUUKO KINOSHITA,
CLASS A.

255
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,958
- ( cheering )

256
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,750
- WHAT CAN YOU DO? IT'S NOT LIKE
THAT CLASS B BRAIN OF YOURS

257
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,791
CAN DEFEAT A CLASS A ONE
JUST BECAUSE YOUR MATH.

258
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,583
SUCKS THE LIFE
OUT OF MY LUNGS!

259
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,291
- OH YES. IT FEELS SO GOOD!

260
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,666
STRETCH IT! YEAH!
- ALMOST. ALMOST.

261
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,083
- ROUND TWO!

262
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,583
- THE SECOND ROUND BEGINS NOW.
PLAYERS, STEP FORWARD.

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,375
- CLASS A. MIHO SATOU.

264
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,000
- WELL, IT'S ON YOU.
SINK OR SWIM, DUDE.

265
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,416
- WHY ME? YOU KNOW IF I LOSE
WE'RE SCREWED.

266
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,083
- DON'T SWEAT IT.
WE BOTH KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.

267
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,083
- I GUESS SO. DOES THAT
MEAN IT'S ABOUT TIME

268
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,708
TO BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS?

269
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,125
- HELL YEAH. CAN'T KEEP IT
LOCKED UP FOREVER.

270
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,750
YOU NEED TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN REALLY DO.

271
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,250
- THAT'S COOL.
I GUESS I'LL LIVE.

272
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,166
- OH, NO. YOU'RE HIM.

273
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,083
- YEP. AND THIS IS LIKE
THE FIRST TIME

274
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,791
I'VE BEEN SERIOUS IN MY LIFE.

275
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,625
- IT'S TRUE.
YOU'RE REALLY THE ONE.

276
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,250
- YES, I AM. I DON'T LIKE
TO SPREAD IT AROUND.

277
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,958
I'VE TRIED TO HIDE IT.

278
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,750
BUT NO MORE.
I FIGHT WITH MY LEFT HAND.

279
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,833
- THE WINNER IS MIHO SATOU
FROM CLASS A.

280
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,458
- YOU THOUGHT JUST BECAUSE
YOU WERE LEFT-HANDED

281
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,000
THAT IT'D SOMEHOW
MAKE YOU SMART?

282
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,541
- MY ARM, LET GO,
GET HER OFF ME.

283
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,083
- ALMOST, SO CLOSE, UP PLEASE.

284
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,500
- OUR REAL FIGHT IS COMING
UP NOW. GAME FACE TIME.

285
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,708
- OH, THANKS. AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO BOTH OF US KNOWING

286
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,125
THAT I COULD DO THIS?

287
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,791
- WELL I NEVER SAID
WHAT IT WAS YOU COULD DO.

288
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,083
- I SERIOUSLY WANT
TO PUNCH YOUR HEAD

289
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,125
WITH MY LEFT HAND RIGHT NOW.

290
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,250
- Takahashi: OKAY, STUDENTS
ON TO THE THIRD ROUND.

291
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,000
AIKO KUDOU FROM CLASS A

292
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,333
AGAINST KOUTA
TSUCHIYA FROM CLASS F.

293
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,625
HAVE YOU PICKED
YOUR SUBJECT YET?

294
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,250
- PHYS. ED ALONG WITH HEALTH.

295
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,250
- WELL, WELL. THERE'S
A RUMOR GOING AROUND

296
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,875
THAT YOU'RE SOMETHING
OF AN ATHLETE.

297
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,416
I'LL BET NOBODY'S EVER TOLD
YOU HOW AMAZING I AM.

298
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,375
AND HOW HARD
I WORK MY BODY.

299
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,708
AND HOW MUCH I SWEAT.

300
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,833
- I FEEL SICK.

301
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,875
( groaning )

302
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,333
- I'M COMING!

303
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,750
HOW DARE YOU HURT
HIM LIKE THAT?

304
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,583
YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF HIS DISABILITY. THAT'S SICK.

305
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,500
- YOU COULD ALWAYS STEP IN
FOR HIM IF YOU LIKE.

306
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,833
BUT ACADEMICS AREN'T
REALLY YOUR THING, RIGHT?

307
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,416
IF YOU DON'T MIND
GETTING A LITTLE ROUGH

308
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,875
I CAN TEACH YOU PHYSICAL
EDUCATION AND HEALTH.

309
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,208
OF COURSE THEN,
I'LL MAKE YOU SWEAT.

310
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,166
- Mizuki: YOSHII!
- Minami: AKI?

311
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,500
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

312
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,875
HE DOESN'T NEED A GIRL
TO TEACH HIM ANYTHING.

313
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,291
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

314
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,541
YOSHII ISN'T EVER GOING TO
NEED YOUR SWEAT EDUCATION.

315
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,458
- OKAY, YOU'RE DEPRESSING ME
WITH ALL THE NEGATIVES.

316
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,875
DUDE, STAY DOWN.

317
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,250
- I'M OKAY. JUST DIZZY.

318
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,625
- ALL RIGHT.
THEN LET'S BEGIN THE MATCH.

319
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,458
- SUMMON.

320
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,875
- SUMMON.

321
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,083
- OVER 400 POINTS!

322
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,291
- PRACTICE VERSUS THEORY.

323
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,833
WE FINALLY GET TO SEE
WHICH IS STRONGER.

324
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,541
SAY GOODBYE YOU LITTLE PERV!

325
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,041
- ACCELERATE.
- ( gasps )

326
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,458
- ACCELERATION COMPLETE.

327
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,750
- THAT CAN'T BE.
I REALLY LOST.

328
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,000
- WINNER, KOUTA
TSUCHIYA, CLASS F.

329
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,583
- HE'S STRONG. HIS HEALTH AND
PHYS. ED. SCORE ALONE IS BIGGER

330
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,458
THAN ALL MY SCORES COMBINED.

331
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,875
- AND NOW WE MOVE
TO ROUND FOUR.

332
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,625
- OKAY THEN, TIME TO FIGHT.

333
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,291
- GO KICK SOME BUTT, HIMEJI.

334
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,083
- I WILL FIGHT THIS ONE.

335
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,750
- THAT'S TOSHIMITSU KUBO. THIS
IS THE MATCH WE HAVE TO WIN.

336
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,041
- WHY IS THAT?

337
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,666
- HE'S THE NUMBER TWO
STUDENT HERE.

338
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,250
UNLESS SHE PICKS ONE OF HIS WEAK
SUBJECTS, IT'LL BE A TOUGH ONE.

339
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,583
- HOLY CRAP!

340
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,541
- TELL US, IN WHAT SUBJECT
WILL YOU BE FIGHTING?

341
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,666
- I WOULD LIKE ALL
SUBJECTS COMBINED.

342
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,083
- HE CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S OUR CHOICE. TELL HIM TO...

343
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,208
- THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

344
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,708
- OR NOT.

345
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,041
- THIS IS NOT GOOD. WHEN YOU
FIGHT IN COMBINED SUBJECTS,

346
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,833
YOUR STRENGTH IS
BASICALLY YOUR RANK.

347
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,250
- AND HE'S...

348
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,250
- BEGIN THE MATCH.

349
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,083
- NOW, SUMMON.

350
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,458
- Minami: LOOK AT THAT SCORE!

351
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,208
THAT NUMBER TWO STUDENT
MUST BE SMART.

352
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,791
- Akihisa: HIMEJI!

353
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,291
- I AM SUMMONING MY
AVATAR. SUMMON!

354
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,041
- IT'S OVER 4000?

355
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,541
- SHE'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE
TOP STUDENT IN THE ACADEMY.

356
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,916
- FROM WHERE DID YOUR SKILL
LEVEL ORIGINATE?

357
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,500
- I JUST DECIDED TO DO MY BEST!

358
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:29,416
I KNOW WHY OUR CLASS STARTED THE
SUMMONER TEST WARS THIS YEAR.

359
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,625
THEY'RE SUCH A GOOD CLASS,
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LIKE THEM.

360
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,541
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO HELP
EACH OTHER OUT

361
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,208
AND THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANYTHING TO ME.

362
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:42,125
BESIDES, I'VE STILL GOT A LETTER
TO GIVE ONE OF THEM.

363
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,833
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T GIVE UP.
I HAVE TO GIVE MY ALL.

364
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,041
- THE WINNER, FROM CLASS F,
IS MIZUKI HIMEJI.

365
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,583
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS AKI?

366
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,250
SOMEHOW WE'RE TIED WITH
THE TOP CLASS IN SCHOOL.

367
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,666
- Akihisa: HIMEJI.

368
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,000
- SO THE NEXT MATCH DECIDES
THE WHOLE THING I GUESS.

369
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,541
- OKAY, IT'S TIME TO BEGIN OUR
FIFTH AND FINAL ROUND.

370
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,666
- WELL THEN,
I GUESS IT'S MY TURN.

371
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,958
- READY?
- WE'LL SURE FIND OUT.

372
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,833
YUUJI SAKAMOTO. CLASS F REP.

373
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,416
- CLASS A REPRESENTATIVE.
SHOUKO KIRISHIMA.

374
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,333
- VERY WELL,
WHAT IS YOUR SUBJECT?

375
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,583
- WHY NOT RAISE THE STAKES?

376
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,708
I'D LIKE A RESTRICTED JAPANESE
HISTORY TEST.

377
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,500
HOW ABOUT WE
LIMIT THE QUESTIONS

378
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,625
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL WITH
A PERFECT SCORE OF ONE HUNDRED.

379
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,666
- A TEST MATCH?

380
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,791
- THEY'RE NOT USING
THEIR AVATARS?

381
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,250
- Nishimura: THIS SUMMONER
TEST WAR IS BASED

382
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,375
ON THE STUDENT'S SCORES

383
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,458
ON AN ACTUAL TEST
IN THE REAL WORLD.

384
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,833
AS LONG AS THE ATTENDING
TEACHER APPROVES,

385
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,208
THE CHOSEN TEST CAN BE ON ANY
SUBJECT FOR ANY SKILL LEVEL.

386
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,791
- YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.
I WILL GET THE TEST PREPARED

387
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,083
AND THE PLAYERS CAN GO
WAIT FOR ME IN THE CLASSROOM.

388
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,416
- Akihisa: HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR MIND, YUUJI?

389
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,375
- Hideyoshi: FIGHTING IT OUT
ON AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEST

390
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,041
WILL SIMPLY GET YOU
EACH A PERFECT SCORE.

391
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,208
- Minami: THE BEST
WE CAN DO NOW IS TIE.

392
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,708
- Mizuki: NOT NECESSARILY.

393
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,333
NOW EVEN A SIMPLE MISTAKE WILL
MEAN A LOSS FOR THAT SIDE.

394
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,416
- ( all gasp )

395
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,916
- EXACTLY. NOW THE BATTLE
IS ONLY ABOUT

396
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,041
STRENGTH OF CONCENTRATION
AND WILL POWER.

397
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,291
- OH, MAN.

398
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,958
- JUST TRUST ME, YOU GUYS,
I'VE GOT THIS.

399
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,958
WHENEVER SHOUKO MEMORIZES
SOMETHING SHE NEVER FORGETS IT.

400
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,333
- ISN'T THAT BAD SINCE A HISTORY
BATTLE IS ALL ABOUT MEMORIZING?

401
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,333
- NO, THAT'S HOW I'LL WIN.
SHOUKO SEEMS TO THINK THAT

402
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,125
THE TAIKA REFORMS
HAPPENED IN THE YEAR 625.

403
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:28,833
SHE MEMORIZED THEM AS "TAIKA
ALIVE IN SIX TWENTY FIVE."

404
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,208
I JUST NEED THAT ONE QUESTION
ON THE TEST AND I'LL WIN.

405
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,583
- HOLD ON, YUUJI.

406
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,166
THE TAIKA REFORM DID NOT
START IN THE YEAR 625?

407
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,333
- NO. THE RHYME'S
"TAIKA ALIVE IN SIX FORTY FIVE."

408
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,625
BUT IT'S EASY TO GET CONFUSED IF
SOMEONE TEACHES IT TO YOU WRONG.

409
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,416
- OKAY.

410
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,791
- HELLO WORKSTATIONS
FROM CLASS A,

411
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,375
YOU'RE ABOUT TO
BECOME CLASS F'S.

412
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,333
- OKAY. YOU MAY BEGIN
THE TEST.

413
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,958
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

414
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,166
- WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE ISN'T A
QUESTION ABOUT THE TAIKA REFORM?

415
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,625
- IF YUUJI CAN'T KEEP HIS FOCUS
AND LOSES CONCENTRATION

416
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,083
THEN SHE'LL DEFINITELY BEAT HIM.

417
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,416
- Mizuki: BUT THAT QUESTION
MIGHT NOT EVEN GET ASKED.

418
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,416
- Akihisa: I KNOW.

419
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,041
HE GOT IT.

420
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,708
- ( bell chiming )

421
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,500
- Takahashi: OKAY, I HAVE THE
TEST RESULTS TABULATED.

422
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,208
FOR SHOUKO KIRISHIMA,
OUR CLASS A REP,

423
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,750
NINETY-SEVEN POINTS.

424
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,166
- ( all jeering )

425
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,708
- THAT'S RIGHT!

426
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE

427
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,708
DIDN'T GET A PERFECT SCORE!

428
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,041
- WE'RE GETTING A
CLASSROOM MAKEOVER BIG TIME!

429
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,333
- CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
- I KNOW.

430
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,791
- NOW FOR THE SCORE MADE BY THE
CLASS F REP, YUUJI SAKAMOTO.

431
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,833
- ( laughing excitedly )

432
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,291
- FIFTY-THREE POINTS.

433
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,416
- CLASS F'S LOW TABLES TURNED
INTO CARDBOARD BOXES.

434
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,208
- ( theme song playing )

435
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,166
- I DIDN'T THINK
IT COULD GET WORSE.

436
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,291
WHAT IS UP WITH THAT SCORE? DID
YOU STROKE OUT OR SOMETHING?

437
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,166
- GUESS THAT'S
MY REAL SKILL LEVEL.

438
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,333
- WHAT USE IS YOUR STUPID PLAN

439
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,208
IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET
A HUNDRED POINTS?

440
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,416
- SOMETIMES IN LIFE YOU JUST GET
HIT WITH THAT UNKNOWN X FACTOR.

441
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,083
- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE X-FACTOR'S
YOUR OWN PUNY BRAIN!

442
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,625
- YUUJI.

443
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,791
YOUR PROMISE. IT'S TIME.

444
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,333
- RIGHT, THE PROMISE. HE'S GONNA
DO WHATEVER SHE TELLS HIM TO.

445
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,250
- I DIDN'T FORGET.
LET'S HAVE IT.

446
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,625
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS SHOUKO.
IT ONLY HAPPENS ON CABLE!

447
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,291
- YUUJI, I WANT YOU
TO GO OUT WITH ME.

448
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,166
- I THOUGHT YOU'D
FINALLY GIVEN UP ON THAT.

449
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,958
- I CAN NEVER GIVE UP. YOU'RE
THE ONE I ALWAYS LIKE BEST.

450
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,625
- CAN I SAY NO?

451
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,958
- YOU CAN'T. YOU MADE A PROMISE

452
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,666
AND NOW WE'RE GOING
OUT ON A DATE.

453
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,083
- WAIT A MINUTE,
CAN'T WE TALK.

454
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,458
( slapping )

455
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,083
- OKAY. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

456
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,000
- DON'T KNOW. BUT SO SWEET.

457
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,833
- THEN WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH
SHOUKO ALWAYS LOOKING AT HIMEJI?

458
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,375
- I DON'T KNOW,

459
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,291
MAYBE SHE WAS SIMPLY TRYING
TO INTIMIDATE THE COMPETITION.

460
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,041
- UM... I'M SORRY, HIMEJI.

461
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,583
OUR CLASSROOM IS EVEN WORSE
THAN BEFORE ALL THIS.

462
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,750
- I LIKE OUR CLASSROOM.

463
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,541
CLASS F IS LIKE MY NEW HOME.
AND I THINK THAT I LOVE IT.

464
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,083
AND BESIDES...

465
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,125
( whispering ) I'VE GOT YOU
HERE WITH ME.

466
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:16,125
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M HUNGRY AND
AKI STILL OWES ME SOME CREPES.

467
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,083
- WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
UNTIL THE WEEKEND.

468
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,458
- THERE'S NO TIME
LIKE THE PRESENT.

469
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,666
( in German )
MACH SCHNELL LIEBEN.

470
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,250
- NO WAY! YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE ME BLOW THROUGH

471
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,458
MY WHOLE FOOD BUDGET

472
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,416
BEFORE MY PARENTS CAN
SEND ANY MORE MONEY.

473
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,916
- HOLD ON. YOSHII PROMISED
HE WOULD TO TAKE ME OUT

474
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,333
TO THE MOVIES INSTEAD.

475
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,750
- HIMEJI, THIS MAY SOUND BAD,

476
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,208
BUT HOW COME I HAVE NO
MEMORY OF ASKING YOU OUT?

477
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,250
- BECAUSE I JUST
MADE IT UP NOW.

478
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,125
- COME ON. IT'S TIME TO GO EAT
SOME CREPES, YOU GUYS.

479
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,625
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT MOVIE YOU PICK FOR US.

480
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:44,208
- PLEASE DON'T! NO!
I HAVE A LIMITED BUDGET.

481
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,541
I'VE GOT ISSUES WITH MY BLOOD
SUGAR AND NEED MY FOOD. HELP!

482
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,041
- I DIDN'T THINK IT
COULD BE POSSIBLE,

483
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,666
BUT HE MAY JUST BE
A GENUINE IDIOT.

484
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,083
- Fukuhara: QUESTION THREE,

485
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,291
WHAT DO YOU CALL THE PART
OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD BUDGET

486
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,000
THAT IS SPENT ON FOOD?

487
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,791
- Akihisa: I ONLY GET SALT
AND WATER THIS WEEK.

488
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,916
- Fukuhara: I DIDN'T ASK YOU
HOW YOU'D SPEND YOUR BUDGET.

489
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,875
- Akihisa: NEXT TIME, FOOD
BUDGET, DATES AND STUN GUNS.

490
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,833
- Fukuhara: THIS WILL BE
ON THE TEST.
