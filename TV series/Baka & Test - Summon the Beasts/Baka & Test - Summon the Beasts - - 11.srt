1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,791
- ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.
NO CHICKENING OUT.

2
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,875
WHOEVER LOSES HAS TO
START THE WAR WITH CLASS D.

3
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,250
HOPE YOU'RE READY, YUUJI.

4
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,291
- PLAIN OLD ROCK, PAPER,
SCISSORS IS LAME.

5
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,875
TOO BAD IT'S NOT
ROCK, PAPER, KILL.

6
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,166
- WELL, IT'S NOT.
I'M CALLING ROCK.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,250
- YEAH, IT WAS DUMB.

8
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,875
ALL RIGHT, YOU CALLED IT.

9
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,416
NOW, IF YOU DON'T USE ROCK,
I'LL KILL YOU.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,458
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!
- ( sputters )

11
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,291
- BETTER GET MOVING.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,833
- YOU FREAKING TRICKED ME.

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,833
- FIRST OF ALL,
YOU WALKED INTO IT.

14
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,000
SECOND OF ALL, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT CLASS D TENDS

15
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,916
TO GO EASY ON THE GUYS
THAT ARE HOTTER.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,583
- I SEE.  SO THEN I GUESS
I SHOULD BE OKAY, RIGHT? 

17
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,916
- UH, NO.
YOU'RE NOT HOT, DUDE.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,958
- WHATEVER. IF THERE WAS A
RANDOM CHART OF MY HOTNESS,

19
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,041
IT'D BE FILLED UP
WITH ONE SOLID COLOR.

20
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,208
- LOOK, A RANDOM CHART.

21
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,166
- AND YOU ONLY FILL UP 5%.

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,916
- I HATE YOU ALL.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,541
- DON'T FORGET, WE'RE ALL
COUNTING ON YOU, DUDE.

24
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,041
- ( whimpers )

25
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,125
I THINK I NEED AN ADULT.

26
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,625
- ( theme song plays )

27
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:21,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

28
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,291
- THIS AFTERNOON,
AS PLANNED,

29
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,041
AN S.T. WAR BETWEEN
SECOND YEAR CLASSES

30
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,291
F AND D
WILL TAKE PLACE.

31
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,375
SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

32
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,458
- INDEED.

33
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,083
I DO ENJOY STUBBORN IDIOTS.

34
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,541
DO YOU THINK THEY ACTUALLY
HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING?

35
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,583
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

36
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,041
- ABOUT WHAT?
- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

37
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,041
CLASS-F STUDENT
YUUJI SAKAMOTO.

38
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,541
HIS SCORES HAVE BEEN DROPPING
WITH EVERY TEST HE TAKES.

39
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,208
- AND HE'S THEIR REP?
WHAT EXACTLY MAKES THEM THINK

40
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,083
THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO DEFEAT CLASS D?

41
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,916
IS THIS ALL SOME
KIND OF JOKE TO THEM

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,833
OR DO THEY THINK
THE S.T. WARS ARE A SILLY GAME

43
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,333
TO PLAY WHEN
THEY'RE BORED?

44
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,041
- NO, MA'AM,
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

45
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,083
HAVE A LOOK.

46
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,083
- ( gasps )

47
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
- CLEAR THIS STUFF UP.
GOT TO BE PREPARED, GUYS.

48
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,125
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PUT AWAY
BEFORE THE BATTLE.

49
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,250
- WE'LL NEED THIS SPACE. 
I'M GUESSING OUR NEW GEAR

50
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,833
IS GONNA TAKE UP
MORE ROOM.

51
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,416
- I WILL BE SO GLAD
TO GET RID OF THESE BOXES.

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,791
- IT'LL BE LIKE WE'RE
REAL, LIVE PEOPLE, HIMEJI,

53
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,333
WITH A REAL, LIVE CLASSROOM.

54
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,791
- YUP, WE'RE GONNA DO IT
THIS TIME FOR SURE.

55
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,083
- THAT LETTER,
WHY DO I KEEP

56
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,000
GETTING THE FEELING
IT'S FOR YUUJI?

57
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,791
BUT EVEN IF IT IS,
HE'S ALREADY WITH SHOUKO.

58
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,958
- ( gasps, pants )

59
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,625
- MAYBE SHE STILL WANTS
TO GIVE IT TO HIM.

60
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,750
- EXCUSE ME.
DO WE NEED ALL OF THESE?

61
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,666
YOU REALIZE THE CAPTIONS
LESSEN MY ROLE.

62
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,791
- SO CLASS F HAS DECIDED
TO START A WAR WITH US

63
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,750
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
WANT TO USE BOXES ANYMORE.

64
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,000
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S TOO DAMN BAD.

65
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,000
- ( booing )
- THAT'S RIGHT.

66
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,458
- WE'RE GONNA
SHOW THOSE LOSERS

67
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,875
THAT THEY'RE EXACTLY
WHERE THEY BELONG,

68
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,375
WITH THE GARBAGE!

69
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,708
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S WORK
ON OUR STRATEGY.

70
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,375
- STRATEGY, DUDE,
DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC.

71
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,666
WE'VE GOT HIMEJI, HELLO.
THAT'S LIKE AN AUTOMATIC WIN.

72
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,000
- HE'S GOT A POINT,
YOU KNOW.

73
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,541
HER STRENGTH IS
CLASS-A LEVEL. 

74
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,875
- BUT, STILL,
YOU NEVER KNOW.

75
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,000
- OKAY, LISTEN UP.

76
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,708
CLASS E LOST BECAUSE
THEY DIDN'T KNOW

77
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,625
MIZUKI HIMEJI
WAS IN CLASS F.

78
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,458
HOWEVER, SINCE
WE KNOW THAT STRATEGY,

79
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,416
WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.
AS YOU KNOW,

80
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
OUR ROOM IS LOCATED
AT THE END OF THE NEW BUILDING.

81
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,458
AND OF COURSE,
THEIRS IS IN THE OLD ONE.

82
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,250
SINCE OUR FIGHTING POWER
WILL NEED TO SPREAD

83
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,916
OVER A LARGE BATTLEFIELD,
WE'LL HAVE THE UPPER HAND

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
BECAUSE OUR SCORES
ARE MUCH HIGHER.

85
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,708
- IF HIMEJI GOES IN THERE ALONE,
SHE'S DONE FOR.

86
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,958
IT'D BE EASY FOR CLASS D
TO ATTACK HER.

87
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,166
SHE'LL BE SURROUNDED
AND WON'T BE ABLE

88
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,166
TO REACH THE CLASS REP.

89
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,750
- GREAT, THEN WHAT
ARE WE GONNA DO?

90
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,916
- WE'LL USE SOMETHING

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,458
I LIKE TO CALL
BLITZ TACTICS.

92
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,791
FIRST, CLASS F
WILL MARCH

93
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:06,958
RIGHT INTO
THE ENEMY'S TRENCHES,

94
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,291
ATTACKING THEM
FROM THE REAR.

95
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,791
THIS IN TURN WILL
CREATE AN OPENING

96
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,500
IN THEIR DEFENSE.
THEN, HIMEJI...

97
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,208
- YES.
- YOU'LL BE UP NEXT.

98
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,458
YOU'RE MAKING A SURPRISE ATTACK
RIGHT DOWN THE CENTER.

99
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,083
THAT'LL THROW EVERYBODY OFF
AND YOU'LL BE ABLE

100
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,000
TO TAKE DOWN THEIR TOP GUY.
- GOT IT.

101
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,458
- WE CAN'T SPLIT UP THIS TIME
OR WE'LL DIE.

102
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,750
FORGET THE DEFENSE.

103
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,166
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK!

104
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,541
WE GOT ONE SHOT AT THIS.

105
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,166
NO SCREWING AROUND, ALL RIGHT!?

106
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,375
CLASS D
IS GONNA EAT THOSE BOXES!

107
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,916
- THEIR DEFENSE
WILL BE WEAK SINCE

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,041
THEY'LL LIKELY
PUT ALL THEIR ENERGY

109
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,416
INTO ATTACKING US.

110
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
FORTUNATELY,
THE CLASS REP'S SCORE

111
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,166
IS PATHETICALLY LOW.
IF HE'S NOT GUARDED,

112
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,708
WE CAN TAKE HIM OUT
WITH ONE SHOT.

113
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,250
- Class D: OH!
- F HAS GOTTEN COCKY.

114
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,333
LET'S GO OUT THERE
AND CRUSH THOSE IDIOTS.

115
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,125
- Fukuhara:
AND JUST LIKE THAT,

116
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,083
THE WAR BEGAN.

117
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,375
- OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.
- YEAH!

118
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,041
- AKIHISA,
TAKE THE FRONT LINE.

119
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,750
YOU'RE GONNA BE 
THE UNIT LEADER.

120
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,500
- WHAT? WHY ME?

121
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,791
- WHY? BECAUSE
IT'LL CONFUSE THEM.

122
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,458
DUDE, WE'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

123
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,791
AND THEY WON'T KNOW
HOW TO RESPOND TO IT.

124
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,250
TRUST ME.

125
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,666
YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE.
- YEAH, OKAY.

126
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,166
- ( boxes scraping )

127
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,333
- ARE THOSE SNAKES?

128
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,541
- I'M A SNAKE.
- ( sighs )

129
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,791
- SUMMON!

130
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,250
- WORST PLAN EVER!

131
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,125
- OH, WOW, HOW
ARE YOU STANDING HERE?

132
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,291
- BECAUSE BY SOME
FREAKING MIRACLE I DIDN'T DIE.

133
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,458
FIVE OF OUR PEOPLE
WERE JUST SENT TO

134
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,041
REMEDIAL CLASS, YOU JERK.

135
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,916
- KOUTA, LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT THE LIST.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,458
CHECK IT OUT. TELL ME WHAT
THEIR LINEUP WAS LIKE.

137
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:34,208
- THAT ONE, THIS ONE, AND HER.
THEY WERE ALL ON THE FRONT.

138
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,291
AND... HEY, I DON'T SEE
THE GUYS ANYWHERE.

139
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,166
- I DON'T DO GUY PICS.

140
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,833
- I SEE.
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

141
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,375
ANY OF THESE CHICKS
ARE GOOD AT MATH.

142
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,333
- SWEETNESS, GUESS
THAT MEANS I'M UP.

143
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,333
- THAT'S RIGHT,
ALL PART OF THE PLAN.

144
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,083
WE'VE MADE SURE TO SECURE
HASEGAWA. WE GOT THIS.

145
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,458
- HEY, ANYONE ELSE REMEMBER
THAT TIME I ALMOST DIED?!

146
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,166
SUGAWA, GO AHEAD AND
MAKE THE PREPARATIONS.

147
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,416
- ROGER THAT.

148
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,041
- Yuuji:
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,

149
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,416
PREPARE TO ATTACK!

150
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,833
- MR. HASEGAWA,
MAY WE HAVE YOUR APPROVAL?

151
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,250
- APPROVAL GRANTED.

152
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,583
- SUMMON! HERE I COME.

153
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,333
IT'S AS IF YOU THINK
I'LL BE LESS OF A MATH GENIUS

154
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,625
IF THERE ARE MORE OF YOU.

155
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,416
- ( grunting )

156
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,041
- TAKE THIS, JERKS.

157
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,750
- ( screaming )

158
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,333
- ( groans )

159
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,500
- THOSE WHO DIED, MEET ME 
IN THE REMEDIAL CLASSROOM.

160
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,500
- UGH! AW, MAN.
- I REALLY DON'T WANT

161
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,125
TO TAKE A CLASS
FROM IRON MAN.

162
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,000
- THAT'S NOT EVEN
A REAL CLASS.

163
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,458
IT'S TORTURE!
- WELL, THEN IT MUST BE WORKING.

164
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,875
JUST YOU WAIT.
YOU'LL SOON BE IDEAL STUDENTS

165
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,291
WHO STUDY TO RELAX,

166
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,458
ATTENDING PHILOSOPHY CLUBS
ON THE WEEKENDS.

167
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,375
SO PREPARE YOURSELVES.
- ( groaning )

168
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,833
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S ATTACK
THEIR LINE OF DEFENSE.

169
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,791
- ( cheering )

170
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,708
- IT'S THE CLASS F REP,
HE'S ENTERED THE NEW BUILDING.

171
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,041
- OKAY, MOVE IN.

172
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,791
- WE'VE GOT TO
KIDNAP HASEGAWA.

173
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,291
- EXCUSE ME?!

174
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,375
- SOME OF THE D-TROLLS
CAPTURED MR. HASEGAWA 

175
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,750
AND ARE HOLDING HIM
IN THE BATHROOM.

176
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,291
- FORGET HIM.
IT'S A TRAP.

177
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,083
- BUT WHAT ABOUT MINAMI?

178
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,291
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE MATH FIELD?

179
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,083
- HOLY CRAP.  NO WAY.
THAT'S MR. TAKENAKA. 

180
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,375
WHERE'D HE COME FROM?

181
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,250
- ( pants )
LET ME CATCH MY BREATH.

182
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,041
I APPROVE THE FIGHT
IN CLASSICAL LANGUAGE.

183
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,250
- OH, GREAT.  OF COURSE
THEY PICKED THAT ONE.

184
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,125
- DON'T WORRY,
I GOT YOUR BACK.

185
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,750
- SUGAWA!
- I NEED YOU

186
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,083
TO BUY ME SOME TIME.
- OKAY, WE'RE ON IT.

187
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,208
RIGHT, MINAMI?
- WHY'RE YOU ASKING ME?

188
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,458
( gasps )

189
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,083
- LOVE MONKEY!

190
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,250
SORRY IT'S COME TO THIS.

191
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,875
- WHAT? MIHARU?

192
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,750
- I DON'T KNOW THAT
I CAN EVEN LOOK AT SOMEONE

193
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,333
WHO'S BECOME A PUPPET
IN THE MAN SHOW,

194
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,333
MUCH LESS FIGHT THEM.
- OH BOY.

195
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,625
- BUT I'M GONNA TRY.

196
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,750
SUMMON!

197
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,791
THERE'S A BATTLE
IN EVERY LOVE STORY,

198
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,458
PRAIRIE DOG,
DON'T LOSE HOPE.

199
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,583
IF DESTINY WANTS TO
TEST OUR HEARTS, LET HER.

200
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,791
WE WILL SURVIVE THIS.
- WILL SOMEONE HELP ME?!

201
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,250
- CLASSICAL LANGUAGE, RIGHT?
- THANK YOU.

202
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,625
- ( music plays )

203
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,416
- Sugawa: MAY I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION PLEASE.

204
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,458
THIS IS AN URGENT MESSAGE
FOR MS. FUNAKOSHI

205
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,583
IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT.
- IT'S SUGAWA!

206
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,541
- AKIHISA YOSHI IS SHIRTLESS

207
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,375
AND WAITING FOR YOU 
IN FRONT OF CLASS D.

208
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,750
HE SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT.
- ( gasps )

209
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,166
- Fukuhara: PERHAPS A LITTLE
EXPLANATION IS NEEDED HERE. 

210
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,125
MS. FUNAKOSHI IS
A 45-YEAR-OLD SINGLE WOMAN.

211
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,541
AND THAT MAY BE ENOUGH.
IF NOT,

212
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,666
LET'S JUST SAY SHE'S ONE
WHO BELIEVES IN EXTRA CREDIT.

213
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,583
- PLEASE HURRY,
MS. FUNAKOSHI. 

214
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,416
YOUNG YOSHI SAYS IT'S
NOT ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT.

215
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,625
SCREW THE ASSIGNMENT.
THIS IS ABOUT A MAN

216
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,416
AND HIS FEELINGS.

217
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,166
- SHUT UP!
- LOOK, IT'S MS. FUNAKOSHI.

218
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,500
- WHERE?! ( whimpers )
- YOSHI, YOU ARE THE MAN, MAN.

219
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,208
BEST LEADER EVER.
- THAT'S WHAT WE CALL

220
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,083
TAKING ONE FOR THE TEAM.
- COME ON, GUYS.

221
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,083
LET'S SHOW OUR LEADER
IT WASN'T ALL FOR NOTHING.

222
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,375
- All: YEAH!

223
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,791
- I'M GONNA GET YOU, SUGAWA!

224
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,666
- I WOULDN'T GET TOO COCKY,
CLASS D.

225
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,333
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW THERE'S
MORE THAN ONE MATH TEACHER. 

226
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,000
HEY, THERE KOUTA,
GO GET MR. TAKENAKA.

227
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,958
- ROGER.

228
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,875
HEY, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CHECK THE WIG.

229
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,041
- ( gasps )

230
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,500
I HAVE TO GO BE
IMPORTANT NOW!

231
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,583
( cries )

232
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,625
- ALL CLEAR!

233
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,541
- MS. FUNAKOSHI,
PLEASE APPROVE US.

234
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,750
- ( growls )

235
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,500
- OH, GOOD, I CAN WIN NOW.

236
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,833
TAKE THIS!

237
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,000
- ( crying )
- ( groans )

238
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,250
- THE PATH IS CLEAR.

239
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,541
- HIMEJI, YOU'RE UP.
- RIGHT.

240
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,416
SUMMONING MY AVATAR.
SUMMON!

241
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,125
- IT'S TOO LATE.
THIS IS OVER.

242
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,458
- EMERGENCY.
- KOUTA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

243
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,500
- ( gasping )

244
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,750
- YOU'RE SURROUNDED.

245
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,166
I CAN SEE THEM
ON THE SPY CAMERA.

246
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,791
- THERE HE IS.
THAT'S THEIR REP.

247
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,583
- NOW'S OUR CHANCE.
LET'S GO.

248
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,708
- NOT SO FAST,
DEFEATING ME ISN'T THAT EASY.

249
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,041
- THAT KID MADE
A FOOL OF US, DIDN'T HE?

250
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,583
ALL THIS TIME, I THOUGHT
THEY MEANT TO INSULT HIM

251
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,541
BY CALLING HIM A SMART ASS.

252
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,333
- NO, WAY.  I HEARD YOU HAD
THE LOWEST SCORE EVER.

253
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,916
OH, YOU DID?
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,791
BUMMER, I GUESS I FORGOT TO ADD
MY LATEST SCORE TO THAT LIST.

255
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,666
INTENTIONAL INFO LEAK,
PRETTY HARD NOT TO FALL FOR.

256
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,583
- ( gasps )
- BUT I DIGRESS. LET'S GO!

257
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,041
- MIZUKI, BUT WHY?

258
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,916
- SO SORRY.

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,583
- ( groaning )
- WHAT A BUNCH OF CHUMPS.

260
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,958
TOO EASY.

261
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,625
- Fukuhara:
TIME FOR MORE "BAKA AND TEST."

262
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,750
- WE ACTUALLY BEAT THEM.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

263
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,166
- WAY TO BE SMART, MAN.

264
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,833
WHEN DID YOU START 
STUDYING AND STUFF?

265
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,958
- AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME,
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

266
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,583
WE'VE GOT BIGGER THINGS WE NEED
TO BE THINKING ABOUT.

267
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,916
LIKE BEATING CLASS A!

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,500
- ( groaning )

269
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,291
- FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO
IS DESTROY CLASS B.

270
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,333
WHO'S IN?!

271
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,416
- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

272
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,541
BUT ISN'T NEMOTO IN CLASS B?

273
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,541
- AFTER EVERY ONE OF US
HAS TAKEN A RECOVERY TEST,

274
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,416
WE'LL BE READY TO
DECLARE WAR ON THAT JERK.

275
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,375
HEY, AKIHISA, LISTEN UP.

276
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,750
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING

277
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,083
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DO IT.

278
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,500
- WHY DO I LET YOU
DO THESE THINGS?

279
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,500
- I'M JUST AMAZED
YOU KEEP FALLING FOR IT.

280
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,083
- ( screams )

281
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,416
- CLASS F HAS
DECIDED TO START

282
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,916
A CUTE LITTLE WAR
WITH US.

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,666
WELL, THEY'LL
LEARN SOON ENOUGH.

284
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,458
- I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS.

285
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,750
BUT CLASS F DEFEATED
BOTH CLASS E AND CLASS D.

286
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,666
- ARE YOU AFRAID OF
THE LITTLE FREAKLINGS, YUUKA?

287
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,916
- OH, PLEASE.
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

288
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,166
CLASS C HAS ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

289
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,666
- THEN WHY WOULD
YOU EVEN SUGGEST

290
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,666
THAT CLASS B
MIGHT BE IN DANGER.

291
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,041
- I WAS SIMPLY THINKING.

292
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,208
- ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS
WINNING STREAK?

293
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,375
EITHER THEY'RE CHEATING OR
HAVE SOME KIND OF SECRET WEAPON.

294
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,666
FIGHTING THEM HEAD-ON 
ISN'T A VIABLE OPTION.

295
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,125
- YES, AGREED.
- JUST WAIT.

296
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,000
I'M WORKING ON A STRATEGY.

297
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,625
I'LL PAY THEM BACK FOR WHAT
THEY DID TO ME THE OTHER DAY.

298
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,083
- Yuuji: SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S ALL GOING DOWN.

299
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,958
I NEED YOU GUYS TO
TEAR IT UP OUT THERE.

300
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,541
WE'RE NOT GONNA
STOP WINNING NOW.

301
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,416
- YEAH!

302
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,458
- Yuuji: ALL RIGHT,
GET OUT OF HERE.

303
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,125
- All: SEE YOU LATER.

304
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,625
- ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA

305
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,875
FOR US NOT TO MAKE
THE EXCHANGE WITH CLASS D?

306
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,250
- POSITIVE.
I'M PLANTING SEEDS AS THEY SAY.

307
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,333
- I THOUGHT IT WAS SOWING.

308
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,791
- JUST SIT BACK, RELAX,

309
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,875
AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.

310
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,250
- WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?!

311
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,666
- WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT
HAPPENED, BUT WHO DID IT?

312
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,208
- I'M GUESSING CLASS B.
NOBODY ELSE SPRINGS TO MIND.

313
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,000
- I GUESS THEY WERE
TRYING TO SABOTAGE

314
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,333
OUR RECOVERY TEST BY
BREAKING OUR PENCILS IN HALF.

315
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,041
- LIKE WE CAN'T JUST
SHARPEN THE OTHER SIDE.

316
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,708
- LAME.

317
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,416
- ( gasps )

318
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,250
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU OKAY?

319
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,416
- OH, YEAH, IT'S NOTHING.

320
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,375
- ( gasps )

321
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,833
NEMOTO'S GONNA GET IT!

322
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,958
- AFTER WE KILL HIM,
I'LL EAT HIS LIVER! 

323
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,208
- JUST CALM DOWN.
THERE'S NO NEED

324
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,000
TO LOSE OUR COOL HERE.
- WHY NOT?

325
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,750
- BEATING THEM IN THE S.T. WAR
IS GONNA BE ENOUGH PAYBACK.

326
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,166
FREAKING OUT ABOUT THIS CRAP
IS WHAT CLASS B WANTS

327
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,916
BECAUSE IF WE LOSE FOCUS,
WE WON'T WIN.

328
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,500
- Fukuhara: AND THUS,
BEGAN THE SHOWDOWN

329
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,125
BETWEEN CLASS F
AND CLASS B.

330
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,666
- GET READY, GUYS.
KILL THEM ALL!

331
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,833
- YEAH!

332
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,416
- THERE THEY ARE!
LET'S KICK SOME BUTT.

333
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,458
- CLASS F
IS ON THE WAY.

334
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,875
- AFTER ALL THAT,
PATHETIC.

335
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,041
PROCEED AS WE PLANNED.
THEY STILL DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

336
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,875
- CHARGE!

337
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,416
- NO, WAY.
THEY'RE TOO STRONG.

338
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,791
WE CAN'T BEAT 'EM.
- ( grunts )

339
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,791
- ARE WE REALLY GONNA
GO THROUGH WITH ALL THIS?

340
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,416
- IT'S CLASS B. WE KNEW THEY
WERE STRONG COMING INTO IT.

341
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,458
- YOSHI!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

342
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,958
I DIDN'T THINK IT 
WAS YOUR TURN YET.

343
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,916
IT'S NOT, BUT YUUJI
SAID FOR YOU TO USE THIS

344
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,791
IF YOU FEEL TRAPPED.
- WHAT IS IT?

345
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,583
HA! YES!

346
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,583
OKAY, YOU GUYS, LISTEN UP.

347
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,583
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT
THE CLASS B REP

348
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,916
NEMOTO HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

349
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,791
- WHAT?!

350
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,000
- HE'S SEEING
THE CLASS C REP, YUUKA KOYAMA.

351
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,916
- WHAT?!

352
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,291
- GET THIS.
I KNOW FOR A FACT

353
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,666
THAT SHE'S BEEN MAKING
HIS LUNCHES EVERY DAY.

354
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,541
- WHAT?!

355
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,750
- ONCE THEIR OUTRAGEOUS
FURY REACHES ITS PEAK,

356
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,833
THE F.F.F. INQUISITION
DELIVERS MERCILESS SLAUGHTER

357
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,458
IN WAYS THAT WOULD MAKE
THE REMEDIAL CLASSES

358
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,708
OF THE IRON MAN
FEEL EUPHORIC. 

359
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,416
- THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE!
- GUILTY!

360
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,416
- HOW DARE HE CHOOSE
TO BE HAPPY!

361
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,375
IF WE ALL HAVE TO SUFFER
FROM BEING ALONE,

362
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,750
SO SHOULD HE!
- WHAT'S WITH THOSE GUYS?

363
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,833
CAREFUL, THEY LOOK
REALLY DANGEROUS. 

364
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,375
- ( groans )

365
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,041
- WHO'S ON TOP NOW, JERKS?
COME ON, GUYS, LET'S GO.

366
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,041
- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM?

367
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,875
- WHY AREN'T THEY AFRAID
OF THE REMEDIAL CLASS?

368
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,166
- WHAT IS IT?
- CLASS F IS ACTING CRAZY.

369
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,666
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOTTEN INTO THEM.

370
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,000
WHAT DO WE DO?
THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN OUT

371
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,958
A LOT OF US, SIR.

372
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,708
- I THINK I SMELL
AN INSURANCE POLICY.

373
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,791
- THOSE WHO DIED, MEET ME 
IN THE REMEDIAL CLASSROOM.

374
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,208
- THANK, SUGAWA, I'LL NEVER
FORGET THE SACRIFICE YOU MADE,

375
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,791
EVER.

376
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,250
OH, AND I JUST REALIZED
I'M NOT EVEN MAD

377
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,750
ABOUT THE COUGAR THING ANYMORE.

378
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,416
- I HAD A FEELING YOU
WERE HOLDING A GRUDGE

379
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
AGAINST HIM ABOUT
MS. FUNAKOSHI.

380
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,125
- THE SIZE OF OUR GROUP
IS SHRINKING.

381
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,791
WE NEED TO CHANGE FORMATION.
- Boys: RIGHT, OKAY.

382
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,208
- ANYONE FEELING WEAK,
SHOULD GO TAKE A RECOVERY TEST.

383
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,291
- HUH?

384
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,166
HEY, HIMEJI.

385
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,208
NEMOTO? WHAT THE CRAP?

386
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,500
- THAT WAS REALLY MEAN OF YOU
TO MESS UP OUR CLASSROOM.

387
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,750
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO DO THAT?

388
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,250
- EXACTLY WHAT
PROOF DO YOU HAVE

389
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,541
THAT IT WAS CLASS B?
- THERE ISN'T ANY.

390
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,125
- ( laughs ) FINE, OKAY.
WE DID IT.  ARE YOU HAPPY NOW.

391
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,083
- THAT DOES IT.
I'M SUMMONING MY AVAT--

392
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:59,625
- OOPS, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE,
WASN'T IT?

393
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,125
- ( gasps )

394
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,833
- COULD THIS BE A THANK YOU NOTE
FOR SAVING YOU

395
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,708
THE TROUBLE OF FINDING
EVIDENCE OF OUR WORK? 

396
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,291
- DON'T OPEN IT.

397
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,041
- AND WHY NOT?
IS IT A LOVE LETTER?

398
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,666
TALK ABOUT
AN UNEXPECTED BONUS.

399
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,375
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
PEOPLE STILL DID THAT.

400
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,416
HOW ADORABLE.

401
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,458
- STOP, GIVE IT BACK
TO ME RIGHT NOW.

402
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,791
- NOT YET, I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
THE CHANCE TO READ IT.

403
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,125
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
PROBABLY READ THIS

404
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,666
WHEN I'M NOT
IN SUCH A HURRY.

405
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,541
- WHY ARE YOU BEING THIS WAY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

406
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,625
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'LL
HELP ME WIN OR ANYTHING.

407
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,458
BUT I'LL TAKE IT
IN LIEU OF INSURANCE.

408
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,625
THANK YOU, YOU'LL GET IT BACK
AFTER THE WAR'S OVER.

409
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,708
THAT IS IF I DON'T
CHANGE MY MIND OF COURSE.

410
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,833
( laughing )

411
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,291
- ( banging )

412
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
DID YOU LEAVE THE FIGHT?

413
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,666
FIGURED YOU KNEW 
BETTER THAN THAT.

414
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,583
- DON'T START, DUDE.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

415
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,083
- WHAT IS IT?
- I THINK IT'S TIME

416
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,791
FOR HIMEJI TO BE TAKEN
OUT OF THIS BATTLE.

417
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,708
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

418
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,375
- ( sighs ) FINE.
SHE'S OUT.

419
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,625
HOWEVER, BY REMOVING
HER FROM THE BATTLE,

420
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,500
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE OVER HER ASSIGNMENT.

421
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,958
- OF COURSE, YEAH.

422
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,916
- I NEED YOU TO LAUNCH
A SURPRISE RAID ON THEM.

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,208
USE THE METHOD 
OF YOUR CHOICE.

424
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,666
CAN YOU HANDLE IT?

425
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,083
- SURE, I'LL TRY.

426
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,625
SCREW THAT!
I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

427
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,541
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
GO GET THEM, CHAMP.

428
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:15,208
- Akihisa: JUST ONE THING.
- Yuuji: WHAT IS IT?

429
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,791
- NO WAY, ARE YOU
REALLY GONNA DO THAT?

430
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,291
- IF I HAVE TO LAUNCH A SURPRISE
RAID ON CLASS B ALONE,

431
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,041
THEN IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
- WORKS IN THEORY,

432
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,916
BUT WHO'S GONNA GIVE YOU
SUMMONING APPROVAL?

433
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,833
- I DON'T NEED IT.  I'VE GOT
THIS LITTLE GEM, REMEMBER?

434
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,625
AWAKEN!

435
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,958
GO!
- ( shouts )

436
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,833
( grunts )

437
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,166
- IT'S NOTHING.

438
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,500
- ( grunts )

439
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,666
- ( screams )

440
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,041
- ( bangs )

441
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,000
- ( rumbling )
- WHOA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

442
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,916
- AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

443
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,333
- ( grunts )

444
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,000
- ARE YOU OKAY?
AKIHISA?!

445
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,458
- YEAH, I'M MORE THAN OKAY.

446
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,000
NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS TO ME...

447
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,833
I MADE A PROMISE AND
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS WORK.

448
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,166
I WON'T GIVE UP.

449
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,833
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THOSE JERKS DO.

450
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,833
THIS ONE'S FOR HIMEJI!

451
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,500
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- ( rumbling )

452
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,208
- ( screams )

453
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,791
THERE HE IS.

454
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,750
- DID YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULDN'T BE PREPARED

455
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,791
FOR THIS SORT OF THING?

456
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,291
I KNOW YOU WERE LOOKING FORWARD

457
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,625
TO SURPRISING ME.
- SHUT UP.

458
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,500
- KOUTA, WHERE ARE YOU?!

459
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,541
- WHAT THE HELL?

460
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,375
- OUR BATTLE WILL BE
IN HEALTH AND PHYS ED.

461
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,208
SUMMON!

462
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,000
- NO WAY,

463
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,333
HE CAN'T DO THAT.
HE CAN'T JUMP IN THERE

464
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,833
WITH A TEACHER.
- Fukuhara: OH, BUT HE CAN.

465
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,708
IRON MAN IS NOT ONLY
ABLE TO APPROVE BATTLES

466
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,291
IN EVERY SUBJECT, BUT HE CAN
JUMP WITH THE BEST OF THEM.

467
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,125
- UGH! KILL ME.

468
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,875
THIS WAR IS OVER.

469
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,458
CLASS F IS THE WINNER.

470
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,208
- ( cheers )

471
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,083
- IT'S A SHAME YOU GUYS LOST.

472
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,625
GOOD TRY THOUGH.
- YUUJI.

473
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,208
LISTEN UP, I'VE GOT A LITTLE
PROPOSAL FOR YOU GUYS.

474
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,666
- Class B: HUH?

475
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,958
- NOW, USUALLY, THIS
IS WHERE WE TRADE STUFF.

476
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,000
WE TAKE YOUR THINGS AND
LEAVE YOU WITH CARDBOARD BOXES,

477
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,458
BUT WE'LL SKIP THAT
UNDER ONE CONDITION OF COURSE.

478
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,125
- WHAT CONDITION?
- WEAR THIS.

479
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,708
YOU'LL LOOK HOT.
I PROMISE.

480
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,541
OH, AND YOU HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER I TELL YOU TO

481
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,375
FROM HERE ON OUT.
- WHAT?! THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

482
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,250
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
I'D EVER AGREE TO THAT?

483
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,958
- WE'LL MAKE SURE
HE AGREES TO IT. 

484
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,958
- WE GOT YOUR BACK, YUUJI.

485
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,625
- I THINK THIS COLOR
REALLY BRINGS OUT YOUR EYES.

486
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,333
- Nemoto: ARGH!
I AM NOT WEARING A DRESS!

487
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,875
- ( banging )

488
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,666
- Nemoto: YOU'LL REGRET THIS.
GET OFF ME.

489
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,583
- DID YOU GET WHAT YOU WANTED?
I DID.

490
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,833
- YEAH.

491
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,625
- ( theme music plays )

492
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

493
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,000
- HERE YOU GO, HIMEJI.

494
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,541
IT'S YOURS.
- THANK YOU, YOSHI.

495
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,333
IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME
THAT YOU DID THIS.

496
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,583
I WAS COMPLETELY 
WORRIED ABOUT IT.

497
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,541
- I KNOW, I COULD TELL.

498
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,208
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT.

499
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,666
- SORRY, GUESS I SHOULD
HAVE MAILED IT EARLIER.

500
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,583
IT'S MY FAULT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE IGNORED

501
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,166
THE CHAIN LETTER'S
INSTRUCTIONS.

502
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,666
AND NOW I'VE BROUGHT
EVERYBODY MY BAD LUCK.

503
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

504
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,791
- I WAS AFRAID
TO SEND THE LETTER

505
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,625
BECAUSE SO MANY
BAD THINGS HAPPENED.

506
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,916
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

507
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,833
SO I KEPT IT,
BUT THEN I REALIZED...

508
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,958
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS
HAPPENED TOO.

509
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,333
SO IT MUST NOT 
BE THAT CURSED.

510
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,375
I DON'T NEED
TO HOLD ONTO THIS.

511
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,750
I SHOULD EXPRESS
MY FEELINGS

512
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,083
WITHOUT HIDING
BEHIND A LETTER.

513
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,625
I KNOW THIS WON'T BE EASY,

514
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,041
BUT TELLING SOMEONE
IN MY OWN WORDS HOW I FEEL

515
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,541
JUST SEEMS RIGHT.

516
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,875
CAN I START WITH YOU?

517
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,666
- YEAH, SURE,
I'M HERE TO HELP.

518
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,625
- I WANTED TO ASK YOU,
CAN I--

519
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,958
CAN I CALL YOU AKIHISA?

520
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,083
- AH, WELL, NORMALLY
I'D SAY YES,

521
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,416
BUT YOU MIGHT NOT
WANT TO SAY THAT 

522
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,791
AROUND THOSE
F.F.F. GUYS, YOU KNOW?

523
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,125
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM.

524
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,333
IS IT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?

525
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,375
- Akihisa: OKAY.

526
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:34,083
- YUUJI, WHY ARE YOU OBSESSED
WITH THE SUMMONER TEST WARS?

527
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,833
IS IT THE BOXES?

528
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,541
- OF COURSE NOT.
SHOUKO, THIS ISN'T ABOUT DESKS.

529
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,458
THIS IS ABOUT
PROVING TO EVERYONE

530
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,666
THAT LIFE DOESN'T
REVOLVE AROUND TEST SCORES.

531
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,208
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

532
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,833
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M COUNTING ON YOU

533
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,958
NOT TO GO EASY ON THEM.
- I WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.

534
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,500
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

535
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,541
- Fukuhara: QUESTION 12,

536
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,541
"WHAT DO YOU CALL
THE LAST SCENE IN A STORY

537
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,916
SUCH AS A NOVEL OR PLAY
WHERE THINGS GET RESOLVED?"

538
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,375
- Akihisa: FINAL BOSS BATTLE.

539
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,708
- Fukuhara:
YOU NEED EXPERIENCE POINTS.

540
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:01,833
- Akihisa: NEXT TIME,
"LOVE, COURAGE,

541
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,208
AND OUR BATTLE
HAS JUST BEGUN."

542
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,416
TEMPORARY.
- THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
