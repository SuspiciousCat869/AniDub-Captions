1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,875
- ( grunts ) NO!
THIS IS NOT OVER YET.

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,166
NOT YET.
WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN.

3
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,125
TAKE THIS!
- ( squealing )

4
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,083
- HUH?

5
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,041
- WHAT?!
IT'S NOT OVER?

6
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,500
- CLASS "A," I DECLARE YOU
THE WINNERS.

7
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,166
- ( groaning )

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,916
- WOW? REALLY?
AWESOME!

9
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,166
YAY ME?

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,000
- ( theme music playing )

11
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,375
- Fukuhara: THE SUMMONER
TEST WAR HAS ENDED

12
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,208
AND A NEW MORNING
HAS BEGUN.

13
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,000
- Akihisa: YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

14
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,500
- Yuuji: DRAWING BOARDS
AND MATS, THAT'S AWESOME.

15
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,000
- I UNDERESTIMATED THEM--

16
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,875
I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET
WORSE THAN CARDBOARD BOXES.

17
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,875
- BUT IT DID.
IT GOT WAY WORSE.

18
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,583
- WAY WAY WORSE.
- I'M SO SORRY, HIMEJI.

19
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,333
- DON'T WORRY. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

20
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,416
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG
THE S-T WAR WAS PRETTY FUN.

21
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,250
WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD TEAM.
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

22
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,458
- JEEZ.
STOP WHINING ABOUT IT.

23
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,625
WE LOST; BIG DEAL.
CAN WE MOVE ON ALREADY?

24
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,250
WE CAN STILL WORK IN CLASS
USING THE DRAWING BOARDS.

25
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,250
NO OTHER CLASS GETS
TO SIT ON THE GROUND.

26
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,083
- YEAH, IT'S KINDA LIKE WE'RE
IN AN ART CLASS OR SOMETHING.

27
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,708
I THINK IT'S COOL.
OH!

28
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,250
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU OKAY?

29
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,833
- NOTHING, IT'S JUST... WELL,

30
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,750
I CAN'T USE THE BOTTOM
OF THE BOARD.

31
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,000
- ( moans )
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

32
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,208
- HEY!
- WHERE DO YOU THINK, AKI?

33
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,250
I NEED TO START
ANOTHER S-T WAR NOW!

34
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,166
- NO, MINAMI!
IT'S NOT WORTH IT!

35
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,916
- WE CAN'T DECLARE WAR
FOR ANOTHER THREE MONTHS ANYWAY!

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,875
- BUT I HATE THIS DRAWING BOARD!
I HATE EVEN LOOKING AT IT!

37
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,375
- OH, COME ON.

38
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,666
YOUR BOOBS WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO
KICK MY SPLEEN INSIDE OUT!

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,500
AHHH, THIS IS NOT
A NATURAL POSITION!

40
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,833
- YOU DON'T KNOW MY BREASTS!
- ALMOST. ALMOST.

41
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,291
- THEY CAN COVER UP PART
OF THE BOARD IF I WANT THEM TO!

42
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,791
- ( yelling continues )

43
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,000
- SO CLOSE. SO CLOSE.
SO CLOSE.

44
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,583
SO CLOSE SO CLOSE SO CLOSE
SO CLOSE SO CLOSE SO CLOSE.

45
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,666
- YOU LET YOURSELF CATCH
ON FIRE, KOUTA!

46
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,791
- ( screams )

47
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,541
- NICE.
THE BLOOD DOUSED THE FIRE.

48
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
IT'S EARLY.

49
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,375
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE ALREADY ANEMIC.

50
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,625
- AIKO?

51
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,416
- OH NO, AND I WENT THROUGH ALL
OF THE TROUBLE

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,833
OF PUTTING ON A BRA TODAY,
JUST FOR YOU.

53
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,708
AND IT'S A LACY ONE.
- SO? I DON'T CARE.

54
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,625
- YOUR NOSE APPEARS
TO DISAGREE WITH YOU.

55
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,333
- IT'S OKAY.
I'M ALL OVER THIS, MAN!

56
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,000
AWAKEN!

57
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,958
HUH?

58
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,166
I FORGOT MY BRACELET BROKE.
I GUESS I'M NOT ALL OVER THIS.

59
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,583
WAIT!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING NOW?

60
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,000
- PLEASE ALLOW YOSHII
TO SUMMON HIS AVATAR.

61
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,458
- WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?

62
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,125
- TAKE SOMEONE'S BRA OFF.

63
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,375
- I'M SORRY. I CAN'T DO THAT.
- ( moans )

64
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,625
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE CLASS "F"
JUST WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN.

65
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,541
- YEAH.
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

66
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,666
- I CAN'T--
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS, MAN.

67
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,708
THE WAY IT ENDED SEEMS WRONG.

68
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,791
- AGREED. BUT A DEFEAT
IS A DEFEAT.

69
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,833
WE MADE THE DECISION TO USE OUR
FIGHTING SKILLS AS OUR WEAPON

70
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,833
INSTEAD OF SOME LAME
TEST SCORES.

71
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,000
CLASS "F" FOUGHT UNDER THE
SAME TERMS, "A" WAS JUST BETTER.

72
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,458
THEY WERE ABLE TO ATTACK

73
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,500
AND NOT BE AFFECTED BY WHAT
WAS GOING ON AROUND THEM.

74
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,041
WE LOST BECAUSE
WE LET OUR GUARD DOWN.

75
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,541
- Akihisa: YEAH, BUT--
- BUT NOTHING. GET REAL, DUDE.

76
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,291
HOW THINGS PLAY OUT IS ALL THAT
MATTERS IN THIS STUPID WORLD.

77
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,375
- ( sighs )

78
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,875
- OKAY, WHAT'S ALL THIS DRAMATIC
SIGHING ABOUT?

79
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,333
- AKIRA, REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID

80
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,500
TRYING HARD IS
ONLY A MEANS TO AN END?

81
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,416
- OF COURSE.
WHY DO YOU ASK?

82
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,166
- I DID MY BEST,
BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

83
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,708
I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
I REALLY AM AN IDIOT.

84
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,125
- WELL, IF YOU'RE TAKING PRIDE
IN YOUR OWN EFFORTS,

85
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,916
THAT IS PRETTY STUPID.
HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T MEAN

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,916
SOMEONE ELSE CAN'T TAKE PRIDE IN
YOU AND HOW HARD YOU'RE TRYING.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,125
- REALLY?

88
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,291
- AKI, YOU DID THE BEST YOU
COULD OUT THERE.

89
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,375
THAT'S ALL ANYONE CAN DO AND I'M
PROUD OF YOU, LITTLE BROTHER.

90
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,500
- THANKS, SIS!
- YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION

91
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,958
TO MOPE AROUND
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

92
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,583
- WAIT, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO CHEER ME UP

93
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,458
BY TELLING ME NOT
TO MOPE AROUND?

94
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,500
- IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACCEPT
A DEFEAT FOR WHAT IT IS.

95
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,333
IF A PERSON GOES
THROUGH THEIR LIFE

96
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,375
WITHOUT EXPERIENCING
DISAPPOINTMENT,

97
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,583
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW
HOW TO GET UP

98
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,083
WHEN THEY FALL AND CONTINUE
MOVING FORWARD.

99
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,750
DIVE RIGHT ON INTO THAT FAILURE
AND MOPE AROUND FOR A BIT.

100
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,916
AND WHEN YOU'RE
FINISHED BEING UPSET,

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,291
JUST PICK YOURSELF BACK UP

102
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,250
AND MOVE FORWARD WITH
YOUR LIFE, OKAY?

103
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,583
- SURE!

104
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,208
- AND WHILE YOU'RE BUSY
BEING DEPRESSED,

105
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,541
PLEASE KNOW I'LL DO WHATEVER
I CAN TO COMFORT YOU,

106
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,500
LITTLE BROTHER,
WHETHER ITS TAKING A BATH

107
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,583
OR SLEEPING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.
DOESN'T THAT SOUND NICE?

108
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,958
- EH, NO.
IT SOUNDS GROSS.

109
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,666
- DON'T BE SO SHY, AKI.
I AM YOUR SISTER AFTER ALL.

110
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,333
- I'M NOT SHY,
I'M THROWING UP IN MY MOUTH!

111
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,416
- ( water splashes )

112
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,416
- Akihisa: WHEN I'M DONE BEING
ALL DEPRESSED,

113
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,583
I CAN PICK MYSELF BACK UP
AND MOVE FORWARD WITH MY LIFE,

114
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,333
MY FUTURE.

115
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,166
I WONDER IF THERE'S STILL
SOMETHING I CAN DO.

116
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,416
THAT'S IT!
I'LL DO IT!

117
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,208
- DO WHAT?
TAKE A BATH WITH ME?

118
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,291
- NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

119
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,750
- Takahashi: AND THAT CONCLUDES
THE S-T WAR RESULT REPORT.

120
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,666
- ( knocks )
- WHO IS IT?

121
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,333
- HELLO, YOSHII.
WHAT CAN WE HELP YOU WITH?

122
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,875
- I HAVE TO ASK FOR THIS FAVOR.
PLEASE, MA'AM,

123
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,666
WE NEED ANOTHER SUMMONER
TEST WAR WITH CLASS "A."

124
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,375
- WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
PERMISSION?

125
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,208
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
WAIT THREE MONTHS,

126
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,000
AND THEN YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

127
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,291
- I WANT TO DO IT NOW!
- TOO BAD.

128
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,000
IT'S A RULE, YOSHII. AND YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW IT.

129
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,833
- PLEASE!

130
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,750
I'M BEGGING YOU.
I CAN'T ACCEPT LOSING LIKE THAT!

131
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,833
PLEASE!

132
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,291
- WE'D LIKE TO SECOND
THAT REQUEST.

133
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,375
I CANNOT ACCEPT
THIS OUTCOME EITHER.

134
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,458
CLASS "A" MAY HAVE ENDED UP
BEATING CLASS "F,"

135
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,000
BUT TO BE HONEST
WE REALLY ONLY WON BY A FLUKE.

136
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,250
- YUUKO?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

137
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,375
- Takahashi: DO YOU REALLY
MEAN THAT, LADIES?

138
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,208
- WE DO. CLASS "A"
REPRESENTS THE BEST

139
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,833
THIS ACADEMY HAS TO OFFER.

140
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,250
THIS ISN'T HOW WE SHOULD WIN,

141
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,125
AND I BET THE OTHER
CLASSES AGREE.

142
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,208
PLEASE.

143
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,083
- WE'D LIKE TO HAVE
ANOTHER WAR TOO.

144
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,875
- I UNDERSTAND.
BUT THE SUMMONER TEST WAR SYSTEM

145
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,375
REPRESENTS RESPONSIBILITY
AND ACCOUNTABILITY,

146
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,166
NOT BREAKING THE RULES.
- ( sighs )

147
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,708
- ( sighs ) I SIMPLY CANNOT
GRANT YOU ANOTHER WAR.

148
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,833
SORRY.
HOWEVER,

149
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,250
I BELIEVE WE STILL OWE YOU

150
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,875
FOR THE TIME THE SYSTEM WENT
OUT OF CONTROL.

151
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,666
THE NEW IRON BRACELET WAS
A PROTOTYPE AND I FEEL BAD

152
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,750
FOR MAKING YOU THE GUINEA PIG
ON IT. WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID,

153
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,208
MAYBE WE CAN COME
TO A COMPROMISE AFTER ALL.

154
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,375
- COMPROMISE?

155
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,291
- IF WHAT YOU WANT IS TO
EXCHANGE EQUIPMENT

156
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,250
BETWEEN CLASS "A" AND CLASS "F,"
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

157
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,458
IF NOT, THERE IS ANOTHER
OPTION I HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU.

158
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,000
( laughs )
- Class: WHAT?!

159
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,541
- Minami: WE CAN FIGHT
CLASS "A" AGAIN?

160
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,458
- Hideyoshi: BUT I THOUGHT
WE HAD TO WAIT THREE MONTHS.

161
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,750
- CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT THAT OLD HAG

162
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,166
TO GIVE US
ANOTHER CHANCE!

163
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,750
- THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS,
AKIHISA!

164
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,708
- YEAH, I GUESS.
- ALL RIGHT!

165
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,500
WE'RE GONNA TAKE 'EM DOWN
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

166
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,333
BETTER COME UP
WITH A NEW STRATEGY QUICKLY.

167
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,875
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

168
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,125
IT'S NOT THE NORMAL
KIND OF WAR THIS TIME.

169
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,750
- HUH?
- Class: WHAT?!

170
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,041
- YOU'RE DUELING BY YOURSELF?
- THAT'S THE DEAL.

171
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,541
I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE
SOME KIND OF A TEST

172
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,625
AGAINST THE CLASS "A"
REPRESENTATIVE.

173
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,791
- SHOUKO'S WHO YOU'RE UP
AGAINST? YOU'LL NEVER WIN.

174
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,375
- LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS A LONG
SHOT, BUT I'VE STILL GOT TO TRY.

175
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,458
IF I WIN, WE CAN'T EXCHANGE
EQUIPMENT OR ANYTHING,

176
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,166
BUT THEY'LL GRANT US
ONE SMALL REQUEST.

177
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,166
- YOU DO KNOW YOU'RE FIGHTING
THE NUMBER ONE STUDENT?

178
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,958
- DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN?

179
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,958
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT!

180
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,125
- DON'T WORRY. NO MATTER WHAT,
NOTHING BAD'LL HAPPEN.

181
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,166
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE

182
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,291
ANY OF THE CRAP EQUIPMENT
WE'VE GOT LEFT.

183
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,708
- I'M SURE.

184
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,958
BESIDES, CLASS "A" WOULD JUST
GET A SMALL REQUEST TOO.

185
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,333
- WHEN I WIN,

186
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,541
I'LL ASK TO GET MY MARRIAGE
CERTIFICATION FORM BACK.

187
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,708
- IT WAS NEVER YOURS
TO BEGIN WITH, WOMAN!

188
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,125
YOU GIANT LYING JERK!

189
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,250
DIDN'T YOU SAY NOTHING BAD
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

190
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,666
THIS IS VERY VERY BAD.
REAL BAD!

191
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,708
- IT'S NOT THAT BIG
OF A DEAL!

192
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,291
- WE'LL GO ON OUR HONEYMOON
AS SOON AS THE WAR IS OVER.

193
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,375
- NO WAY, FREAK!
-

194
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,625
YUUJI, HOW MANY
CHILDREN DO YOU WANT?

195
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,666
- IF YOU DON'T WIN,
I SWEAR I'LL KILL YOU

196
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,583
AND MAKE IT AS PAINFUL
AS POSSIBLE!

197
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,208
AND AS FOR YOU! SHOUKO, YOU
BETTER TAKE IT EASY ON HIM!

198
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,000
- WHY WOULD I DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

199
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,291
AFTER ALL, YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO HOLD BACK.

200
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,541
- DAMN IT! MY LIFE
IS COMPLETELY OVER! OVER!

201
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,958
- YOUR CONFIDENCE IN ME
IS OVERWHELMING.

202
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,000
I GUESS
THEY ARE RIGHT THOUGH.

203
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,916
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
IF I GET TO FIGHT THEM AGAIN.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,083
I MEAN, IT'S WITH SHOUKO.

205
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,000
- Hazuki: HEY,
STUPID! WHAT'S UP?

206
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,875
- HI HAZUKI.
- GUESS WHAT?

207
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,166
I GOT YOU A PRESENT.
SEE?

208
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,666
- WOW. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
KNEW HOW TO MAKE COOKIES.

209
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,458
- I LEARNED IT IN HOME-EC CLASS.

210
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,916
I'M NOT THAT GOOD,
SO I HOPE THEY TASTE OKAY.

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,375
- I'M SURE THEY DO.
THANK YOU!

212
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,541
- I WANTED TO HELP.
I THOUGHT THAT

213
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,375
MAYBE THEY COULD
HELP YOU DO YOUR BEST.

214
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,375
- THANK YOU.
THAT'S SWEET.

215
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,125
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

216
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,208
MMM, THESE TASTE GREAT.

217
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,041
I THINK YOU FOUND A NEW TALENT!
- YOU MEAN IT?

218
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,875
THAT WAS THE FOURTH BATCH
I MADE.

219
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,958
I BURNED THE FIRST THREE
TO SMITHEREENS.

220
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,333
BUT I KEPT TRYING HARD
AND THEN I DID IT!

221
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,916
- ALL RIGHT!

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,375
- ALL RIGHT WHAT?
I DON'T GET IT.

223
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,833
- WELL, I'LL JUST
TRY HARD TOO THEN.

224
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,541
IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING.
MIGHT AS WELL GIVE IT A SHOT.

225
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,333
THANKS AGAIN,
HAZUKI!

226
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,791
- YOU'RE WELCOME!

227
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,625
- I'M HOME!
- HEY THERE.

228
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,250
HOW WAS YOUR DAY, AKI?
( huffs )

229
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,625
- ( door opens )

230
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,458
- I'LL STUDY ALL NIGHT.
I DON'T CARE--

231
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,333
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE

232
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,375
I CAN ANSWER AS MANY
QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE!

233
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,458
- Toudou: BAKA AND TEST.

234
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,416
- WELCOME TO
THE TEST SHOWDOWN.

235
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,916
WE'LL NOW BEGIN A DUEL BETWEEN

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,083
CLASS "A" REP
SHOUKO KIRISHIMA

237
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,208
AND AKIHISA YOSHII,
ONE OF CLASS "F"'S STUDENTS.

238
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,041
THIS COMPETITION WILL FOLLOW
SUDDEN DEATH RULES.

239
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,750
- Fukuhara:
IN SUDDEN DEATH RULES,

240
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,208
THE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN
THE SAME QUESTIONS ONE BY ONE

241
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,208
AND ANSWER SIMULTANEOUSLY.

242
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,250
IF EITHER STUDENT GIVES A WRONG
ANSWER, THE GAME IS OVER.

243
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,833
THE PERSON WHO MADE THE ERROR
IS THE ONE THAT LOSES.

244
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,416
- SO BASICALLY, THE ONE
WHO MAKES THE FIRST MISTAKE

245
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,708
LOSES THE WHOLE THING.

246
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,458
- AND THERE'S AN UNLIMITED
AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS.

247
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,291
THE FURTHER A STUDENT GOES, THE
HARDER IT'S GONNA BE TO ANSWER.

248
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,916
- WHICH MEANS THIS PROBABLY
ISN'T GONNA TAKE VERY LONG.

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,708
- YOU CAN DO IT, AKIHISA!

250
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,625
- LET THE SUDDEN
DEATH DUEL BEGIN!

251
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,500
- C'MON, WIN!
YOU CAN DO IT!

252
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,708
- YUUJI?

253
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,541
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, YOU CAN
WIN THIS TEST!

254
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,166
COME ON! JUST TRUST
IN YOURSELF, AKIHISA!

255
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,750
THEN YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!

256
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,583
- WOW. HE'S A REALLY 
COMMITTED CHEERLEADER

257
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,458
WHEN HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
IS AT STAKE.

258
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,541
- OH GOOD.
THIS ONE'S LIKE WAY EASY.

259
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,708
- YEAH, I MEAN,
AKIHISA IS PRETTY STUPID,

260
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,041
BUT HE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO ANSWER THAT WITH NO PROBLEM.

261
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,000
- ( whimpering )

262
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,583
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
HE DOESN'T KNOW IT?

263
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,583
- ANSWER!

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,083
- GOT IT!

265
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,500
ONE DOWN!
- BOTH ANSWERS ARE CORRECT.

266
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,833
- GUH! DON'T SCARE ME
LIKE THAT, AKIHISA!

267
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,791
- I DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE!
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?!

268
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,250
HECK YEAH! SHOUKO ALREADY MADE
A MISTAKE, IT'S OVER!

269
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,583
WHAT? HOLD ON!

270
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,583
IS THAT RIGHT?
- HONESTLY.

271
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,333
HE IS AN IDIOT.

272
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,416
- MOVING ON.
QUESTION THREE...

273
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,083
- IT'S BETTER
BUT IT'S NOT QUITE THERE.

274
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,458
AT LEAST IT'S NOT AWFUL.

275
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,583
AKI MUST BE FIGHTING HARD
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

276
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,333
I HOPE I CAN MAKE SOMETHING
AS GOOD AS HE DESERVES.

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,375
WELL, I'LL JUST HAVE
TO KEEP ON TRYING.

278
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,041
- NEXT...

279
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,000
BOTH ANSWERS ARE CORRECT.

280
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,250
- ( audience gasps )
- GOOD JOB! WAY TO ROCK!

281
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,875
- KEEP IT UP, MAN!
- Akihisa: I DON'T KNOW HOW,

282
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,250
BUT I SURE GUESSED
THE RIGHT SUBJECTS TO STUDY.

283
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,000
SHE'S NOT GONNA MAKE
AN EASY MISTAKE THOUGH.

284
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,750
IF I LOSE MY FOCUS
EVEN A LITTLE, I'LL LOSE.

285
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,166
- ALL RIGHT THEN...

286
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,791
- ANOTHER HISTORY ONE.

287
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,625
- AND IT'S A PRETTY
HARD ONE TOO.

288
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,916
- I KNOW HE CAN DO IT.

289
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,000
- BOTH ANSWERS ARE CORRECT.
- NICE! HE GOT IT RIGHT!

290
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,041
- WAY TO GO, AKI!

291
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:57,416
- ( groans ) EVEN I CAN'T
SCREW UP ALEXANDER THE GREAT.

292
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,125
- OKAY. THE QUESTIONS WILL START
GETTING REALLY HARD NOW.

293
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,833
- I HOPE HE PREPARED
FOR THEIR INCREASING DIFFICULTY.

294
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,916
- AKIHISA.

295
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,583
- ( gasps )
- DID HE REALLY ASK THAT?

296
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,333
- IT'S LIKE A FREEBIE.

297
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,916
- OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE BOTH GONNA
GET THIS QUESTION RIGHT.

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,833
- I'D BE MORE WORRIED
ABOUT THE NEXT ONE.

299
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,541
- HEY!
COME ON, YOU KNOW THIS!

300
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,041
- YEAH, THE TAIKA REFORM.

301
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,541
WHEN WAS THAT AGAIN?
- ( roaring )

302
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,083
- SERIOUSLY!
HOW MANY TIMES

303
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,208
DO WE HAVE TO KEEP
GOING OVER THE SAME THING?!

304
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,708
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT!
YOU'RE THE ONE

305
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,583
WHO CONFUSED ME ABOUT IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

306
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,666
- ANSWER THE QUESTION,
YOU IDIOT!

307
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,333
- THE TRICK IS TAIKA ALIVE.
I KNOW THAT MUCH.

308
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,250
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHICH ONE IT IS,

309
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,833
645 OR 625.

310
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,125
TAIKA ALIVE...
TAIKA ALIVE...

311
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,125
TAIKA ALIVE
IN SIX-WHAT-FIVE?

312
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,500
- YOU KNOW THIS!
- AKI!

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,791
- WHICH ONE?
WHICH ONE IS IT?

314
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,208
IF I SCREW UP HERE,
IT'S ALL OVER.

315
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,875
DAMN IT.

316
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:07,916
- ANSWER!

317
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,625
- COME ON, AKIHISA!

318
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,500
- ( hisses )
DAMN IT!

319
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,625
- AKI!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

320
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,333
- THAT BASTARD TOTALLY
JUST GAVE UP! HE'S DEAD!

321
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,583
- NO, THERE'S NO WAY
HE'D DO THAT! WOULD HE?

322
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,333
- THE STRIKER SIGMA FIVE!
HE'S GONNA USE IT!

323
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:37,166
- GO, STRIKER!
- NO! STOP IT-TTT!

324
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,125
- WAIT, ISN'T IT 645?
- THAT'S THE WRONG ANSWER!

325
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,958
- ( sobs ) IT'S OVER!
MY LIFE IS OVER!

326
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,166
- AND THE WINNER IS
AKIHISA YOSHII FROM CLASS "F"!

327
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,958
- UGH-HUH?
- ( cheering )

328
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,375
- WHAT?
I ANSWERED IT RIGHT?

329
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,000
- Minami: YOU DID IT, AKI!
- Hideyoshi: GOOD JOB, AKIHISA!

330
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,208
- Mizuki: SO PROUD OF YOU!

331
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,958
- Akihisa: I STILL
CAN'T BELIEVE I WON.

332
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,125
HOW WEIRD.

333
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,291
- SHOUKO,
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

334
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,041
- BECAUSE...

335
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,375
I MADE A PROMISE.
- UH?

336
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,000
- REMEMBER?
I SAID I'D NEVER FORGET.

337
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,166
- ( camera clicks )

338
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,041
- ( sighs )

339
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,083
YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

340
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,541
- DON'T BE, BECAUSE I STILL
GOT WHAT I WANTED.

341
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,500
- HUH?

342
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,916
- I'M GOING
TO CITY HALL NOW.

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,916
- WHAT THE HELL?
HOW THE HELL DID YOU FIND THAT?!

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,291
- SOMEONE NICE GAVE IT TO ME.
- DON'T TELL ME?!

345
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,875
- KINDNESS NEVER GOES
UNREWARDED.

346
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,375
- I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D WIN.
CONGRATULATIONS.

347
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,958
- THANK YOU.
- LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

348
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,875
ACCORDING TO OUR AGREEMENT,
WE'LL GRANT YOU THAT REQUEST.

349
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,666
- I APPRECIATE THIS.
- AKIHISA?

350
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,500
WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU REQUESTED?
NEW EQUIPMENT?

351
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,666
- NOT EXACTLY.
- GET READY, MIZUKI.

352
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,375
YOSHII REQUESTED FOR YOU TO TAKE
ANOTHER PLACEMENT TEST.

353
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,083
- OH, AKIHISA, YOU DID THAT?

354
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,750
- THAT WAS THE WHOLE REASON
I EVER WANTED TO START

355
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,666
THE SUMMONER TEST WARS.

356
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,250
FOR YOU.

357
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,416
YOU'RE A CLASS "A" STUDENT, YOU
JUST HAD A BIT OF BAD LUCK.

358
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,333
ALL I WANTED WAS TO MAKE
SURE YOU COULD STUDY

359
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,666
WITH GOOD EQUIPMENT.

360
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,125
- I SEE.
- THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE CLASS

361
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,333
BEST SUITED TO YOU.
- OH.

362
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,375
- HIMEJI?
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

363
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,250
- SURE, I GUESS.
BUT, AKIHISA?

364
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,333
- WHAT IS IT?
- IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

365
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,750
ARE YOU REALLY OKAY WITH ME
BEING IN A DIFFERENT CLASS?

366
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,416
- IT'LL BE LONELY
WITHOUT YOU, BUT, HIMEJI,

367
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,750
AS LONG AS IT'S WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOU, THAT'S ALL I WANT.

368
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,708
- OH. OKAY.

369
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,083
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING
ALL OF THIS FOR ME!

370
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,208
- SURE!

371
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,166
- READY? BEGIN!

372
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,666
- Toudou: A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD

373
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,833
ARE ONLY GOOD AT ACADEMICS.

374
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,875
BUT NO MATTER HOW HIGH
ONE'S INDIVIDUAL ABILITY IS,

375
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,750
THERE IS A LIMIT.

376
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,708
SOME PEOPLE ONLY WORRY ABOUT
THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND TALENTS.

377
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,791
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,
YOU'LL FIND

378
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,625
THAT THEY ARE THE ONES WHO
NEVER EXCEED LIMITATIONS.

379
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,125
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL,

380
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,833
IT WAS NATURAL TO WORK HARD FOR
EVERYONE'S SAKE.

381
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,666
WE ALL SUPPORTED EACH OTHER

382
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,083
AND WE PUSHED OURSELVES
TOGETHER.

383
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,833
AFTER ALL, YOU DON'T GET MUCH

384
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,833
WHEN YOU'RE ONLY WORKING HARD
FOR YOURSELF.

385
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,166
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
LESSONS YOU CAN LEARN.

386
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,083
- YOUR TIME IS UP.

387
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,250
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DID WELL.

388
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,708
I'M SURE THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO JOIN CLASS "A."

389
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,875
- THANK YOU.

390
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,416
- I WILL LET YOU KNOW
THE RESULTS SOON.

391
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,208
OKAY?
YOU CAN GO HOME NOW.

392
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,083
- UH-- EXCUSE ME!

393
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,833
- WHAT IS IT?

394
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,333
- I JUST REMEMBERED I MADE
A REALLY HUGE MISTAKE.

395
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,416
WILL YOU PLEASE
LET ME FIX IT?

396
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,916
- THE TEST IS ALREADY OVER.

397
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,625
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO MAKE CHANGES.

398
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,291
- BUT...
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

399
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,625
THE TEST LOOKS GOOD.
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE OKAY.

400
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,750
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT!
- HMM?

401
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,791
- LET ME CHANGE IT--
NO MATTER WHAT!

402
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,833
PLEASE, SIR,
YOU HAVE TO LET ME FIX IT!

403
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,041
I'M BEGGING YOU, SIR!

404
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,416
- WHAT'S UP, AKI?
- GOOD MORNING.

405
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,750
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- MORNING AND STUFF.

406
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,583
- HEY, GUYS.
- YOSHII.

407
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,833
- OH. HEY, SHOUKO,
HOW'S IT GOING?

408
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,208
- I TOOK THE FORM DOWN TO CITY
HALL, BUT THEY REJECTED IT.

409
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,875
- ( laughing )
- Fukuhara: IN JAPAN,

410
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,125
MEN MUST BE 18 YEARS OR OLDER
IN ORDER TO GET MARRIED.

411
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,583
- BUMMER. MAYBE IN A
COUPLE OF YEARS OR SO.

412
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,583
- HEY, AKIHISA!

413
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,250
- AKI, HAVE YOU SEEN
MIZUKI TODAY?

414
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,958
- NO.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER YET.

415
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,125
- OKAY.

416
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,541
- I'M GUESSING IT'LL BE
HARDER TO SEE HER

417
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,500
NOW THAT SHE'S
IN A DIFFERENT CLASSROOM.

418
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,500
- YEAH, I KNOW.

419
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,958
- DID YOU HEAR THE
NEWS, AKIHISA?

420
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,166
- HEAR WHAT NEWS?

421
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,208
- APPARENTLY HIMEJI'S
TEST SCORE WAS GOOD.

422
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,541
LOOKS LIKE SHE'LL PROBABLY
END UP IN CLASS "A."

423
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,916
- THAT'S GOOD.
- DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT'S GOOD.

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,333
- IT IS. I KNOW HIMEJI WAS NEVER
SUPPOSED TO BE IN CLASS "F."

425
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,500
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
STUDYING IN "A"'S ROOM

426
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,333
WITH ALL THAT FANCY
COMFORTABLE EQUIPMENT

427
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,875
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

428
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,083
- IF THAT'S HOW YOU REALLY FEEL,
THEN WE'RE OKAY WITH IT TOO.

429
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,458
HOWEVER THINGS DON'T APPEAR

430
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,583
TO HAVE WORKED OUT
THE WAY YOU PLANNED, DUDE.

431
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,458
- HUH?
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE!

432
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,083
AKIHISA!
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

433
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,000
- DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING?
- NOT AT ALL.

434
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,958
THIS IS MY CLASSROOM.
- WHAT?

435
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,916
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
JOIN EVERYBODY IN CLASS "A."

436
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,625
- YEAH, FUNNY STORY:
IT TURNS OUT

437
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,833
I FORGOT TO WRITE MY NAME
ON THE TEST,

438
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,166
SO I DIDN'T GET ANY
POINTS AT ALL.

439
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,625
YOU SEE, THAT MEANS

440
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,750
THAT I'M GONNA BE IN CLASS
"F" FOR GOOD NOW.

441
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,750
( giggles )
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

442
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,125
( shudders )

443
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,000
- DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S WONDERFUL?

444
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,625
I'M GLAD WE CAN STILL STUDY
TOGETHER. THIS IS A GREAT CLASS.

445
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,208
- ( shuddering )
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

446
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,291
- ARE YOU CRYING?

447
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,250
- YOU SHOULD BE
PLEASED, AKIHISA.

448
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,458
- YEAH, IT'S A HAPPY ENDING.
- IT'S NOT.

449
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,166
I HATE THAT VICIOUS,
MEAN OLD HAG!

450
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,000
( grunts, screaming )

451
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,708
- YOU'RE A HORRIBLE PERSON!
- EXCUSE ME,

452
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,958
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING
BARGING IN HERE LIKE THAT?

453
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,416
- WHAT AM I DOING? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING GIVING HIMEJI ZERO POINTS?

454
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
- IT'S SIMPLE, SHE FORGOT
TO PUT HER NAME ON THE TEST,

455
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,083
THAT MEANS NO POINTS.

456
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,166
- THAT IS SO MESSED UP! SHE'S
THE ONLY ONE WHO TOOK THE TEST.

457
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,833
OF COURSE IT'S HER TEST!
THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS!

458
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,166
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW THAT!

459
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,791
IT'S THE MOST COMMON
OF COMMON SENSES EVER!

460
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,375
HOW STUPID COULD YOU PEOPLE BE?

461
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,666
YOU IDIOT!

462
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,458
- HOW ODD.

463
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,208
I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE
CALLED AN IDIOT BY YOU.

464
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,458
- NOW LISTEN!

465
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,041
YOU GIVE HER POINTS AND YOU GIVE
'EM TO HER NOW.

466
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,041
EITHER THAT OR YOU CAN JUST
LET HER RETAKE THE TEST AGAIN.

467
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,333
- ( sighs )
GOOD GRIEF.

468
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,291
YOU REALLY ARE AN IDIOT.

469
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,000
- HUH?

470
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,125
WHAT?

471
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,750
- IDIOT.
- IDIOT.

472
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,625
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
- IDIOT.

473
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,791
- GENUINE IDIOT.
- IDIOT.

474
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,666
- ( giggles )
IT'S TRUE YOU KNOW.

475
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,083
YOU REALLY ARE
AN IDIOT, AKIHISA!

476
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,500
- HEY, YOU DON'T REALLY
THINK THAT, DO YOU, HIMEJI?

477
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,250
- ( all laughing )

478
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,458
All: IDIOT!
