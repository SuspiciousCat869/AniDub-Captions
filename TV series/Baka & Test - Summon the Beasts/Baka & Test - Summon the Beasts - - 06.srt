1
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:17,958
- ( water splashing )

2
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,125
- Fukuhara: SUMMERTIME...

3
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,208
FUMIZUKI ACADEMY IS BATHED
IN GOLDEN BLISS.

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,666
LAUGHTER CAN BE HEARD EVERYWHERE

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,333
AS SPLASHING WATER
GLISTENS IN THE SUN.

6
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,166
- ( girls giggling )

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,375
- ( gasps )

8
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,625
- Fukuhara: ALSO, THERE IS
SCREAMING AND SPURTING BLOOD.

9
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,625
- ( theme song playing )

10
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,791
- Akihisa: OH THAT'S RIGHT.
YUUJI.

11
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,083
- HUH?

12
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,291
( screaming )

13
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,791
- THE GAS HAS BEEN SHUT OFF,
SO THERE'S NO HOT WATER.

14
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,666
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
TAKE A SHOWER?

15
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,916
- WELL IF YOU START BY KINDA
NUMBING UP YOUR ARMS AND LEGS

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,333
EVENTUALLY YOU CAN
WASH YOUR HEAD

17
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,666
AND ALL YOUR IMPORTANT JUNK.

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,416
- THAT WASN'T A
REAL QUESTION, YOU MORON,

19
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,791
IT WAS
A HYPODERMIC ONE!

20
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,333
- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE USING
THAT WORD RIGHT. I KNOW.

21
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,125
WHY NOT TAKE A SHOWER TO
CLEAR YOUR HEAD?

22
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,250
- I'M NOT FREEZING MY BUTT OFF

23
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,416
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
A GASLESS TOOL!

24
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,041
SERIOUSLY, MAN, YOU'VE GOT NO
HOT WATER, NO FOOD.

25
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,416
HOW CAN YOU LIVE LIKE THIS?
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

26
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,708
- DON'T BE SUCH A JERK. IT'S NOT
LIKE I'M SURVIVING ON NOTHING.

27
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,291
I'VE GOT STUFF TO EAT.

28
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,791
- I LIKE TO START MY DAY WITH A
NICE GLASS OF OLIVE OIL.

29
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,916
HOW MUCH YOU WANNA BET THERE'S
NOTHING IN YOUR FRIDGE.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,958
- SHOWS WHAT YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
STUFF IN THERE.

31
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,500
- OH THANK GOD, THERE'S A
GREEN BAG OF FUNK.

32
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,416
- SO, YUUJI, WHAT'RE YOU
GONNA HAVE TO EAT?

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,083
- EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE,
MINUS THE CHOPSTICKS.

34
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,583
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

35
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,541
THE ONLY THING YOU'RE LEAVING ME
TO EAT ARE THE CHOPSTICKS?

36
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,458
- YOU WOULDN'T SERIOUSLY
EAT THOSE THINGS?

37
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,000
- WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN
EATING THE PLASTIC BAG.

38
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,583
AT LEAST THE WOOD IS ORGANIC.

39
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,458
- I CAN'T LET YOU EAT WOOD
FOR LUNCH.

40
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,750
BESIDES, I DON'T WANT TO USE
MY FINGERS FOR THE NOODLES.

41
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,958
BUT DON'T WORRY, I GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU, TOO.

42
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,625
DIET COLA, DIET GELATIN
AND DIET NOODLES.

43
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,958
- I DON'T NEED TO GO ON A DIET!

44
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,083
- I'M TRYING TO KEEP YOU HEALTHY

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,583
AFTER ALL THAT JUNK YOU'VE
BEEN EATING.

46
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,625
- MAYBE YOU DON'T REMEMBER US
TALKING 10 SECONDS AGO

47
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,125
BUT I HAVE NO FOOD!

48
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,541
- YOU SHOULD KNOW A DIET OF OIL
AND SUGAR IS BAD FOR YOU.

49
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,791
- WORSE THAN STARVING?

50
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,666
I'M GONNA SHOVE THAT DIET
CRAP UP YOUR NOSE.

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,750
- BIG TALK, YOU WANNA GO?

52
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,375
- HECK YEAH. GOTTA SAY I'VE BEEN
DREAMING ABOUT TAKING YOU DOWN

53
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,333
FOR A WHILE NOW, YUUJI.

54
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,041
- THAT'S FINE.
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

55
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,083
- ( grunting )

56
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,833
- ( both screaming )

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,541
- YOU'VE GOT PRETTY GOOD AIM.

58
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,750
- COULD SAY THE SAME THING
ABOUT YOU.

59
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,125
- WATCH OUT. I'M DONE SCREWING
AROUND, YOU PANSY!

60
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,583
- GO AHEAD, BIG MAN,
BRING IT ON!

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,083
- WHAT EXACTLY DO WE GET OUT OF
CRACKING EACH OTHER'S SKULLS?

62
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,416
- NOTHING...

63
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,291
I'M ALL STICKY. I BETTER TAKE
A SHOWER SOON.

64
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,083
BUT YOU CAN GO FIRST
IF YOU WANT TO.

65
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,666
- I'M NOT TAKING A SHOWER HERE.

66
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,208
- WHERE YOU GONNA GO THEN?

67
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,625
- SOMEPLACE WHERE THEY'VE
HEARD OF A LITTLE THING

68
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,083
CALLED HOT WATER.

69
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,583
- OKAY FINE.

70
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,333
YOU HOPPED THE FENCE TO TAKE A
SHOWER IN THE LOCKER ROOM,

71
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,583
BUT THEN THOUGHT
SINCE YOU WERE HERE

72
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,750
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO SWIMMING IN
YOUR UNDERPANTS

73
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,833
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY FOR YOURSELVES?

74
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,541
- Both: IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT!

75
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,125
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO COULDN'T
STAND A LITTLE COLD WATER.

76
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,208
- WE WOULDN'T BE HERE IF YOU
COULD PAY YOUR STUPID GAS BILL.

77
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,125
- IT'S BETTER THAN NO WATER!
- YOU'RE LIKE A HOMELESS DUDE!

78
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,208
- I'VE HEARD ENOUGH EXCUSES,
I THINK I GOT IT.

79
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,625
- SEE? IT'S NOT MY FAULT, RIGHT?

80
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,750
- I DON'T THINK EITHER OF YOU
WOULD CHOOSE TO BE THIS STUPID

81
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,166
IF YOU COULD HELP IT.

82
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,125
BUT MAYBE CLEANING THE POOL NEXT
WEEKEND AS PUNISHMENT

83
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,791
WILL MAKE YOU THINK A LITTLE!

84
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,833
- Both: YES, SIR...

85
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,791
- HE REALLY PICKED YOU UP
BY YOUR FACE?

86
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,916
- YEAH AND NOW WE HAVE TO
CLEAN THAT GINORMOUS POOL

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
ALL BY OURSELVES.

88
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,250
- CHEER UP, PAL.

89
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,833
WE GOT AN ALL-ACCESS PASS TO
USE THE POOL

90
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,291
AS LONG AS WE CLEAN
THE STUPID THING.

91
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,125
YOU WANNA COME
HANG WITH US, KOUTA?

92
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,625
- NO THANKS.
- NOT THAT IT MATTERS,

93
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,416
BUT I'M INVITING MINAMI
AND MIZUKI TO COME WITH US TOO.

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,208
- WHERE'S MY BRUSH AND
WHEN DO I CLEAN?

95
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,375
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

96
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,125
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT WITH
YOU IF I ASSISTED

97
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,750
IN YOUR CLEANING
EFFORTS AT THE POOL?

98
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,875
- HECK YEAH, MAN!

99
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,208
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

100
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,625
- KEEPING OUT OF TROUBLE?

101
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,000
- GOTTA CLEAN THE POOL
THIS WEEKEND,

102
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,625
BUT WE WERE THINKING
OF SWIMMING.

103
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,333
YOU LADIES WANNA
JOIN US?

104
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,791
- I DON'T KNOW.
MIGHT NOT HAVE A SUIT.

105
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,833
- YEAH ME TOO.
NOT SURE MINE FITS.

106
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,708
- I BET AKIHISA CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE HIDEYOSHI'S SWIMSUIT.

107
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,750
- I'VE GOT MY SWIMSUIT.

108
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,375
- NO FAIR MAKING THE REST
OF US LOOK BAD

109
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,958
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPER HOT.

110
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,250
- THAT'S RIGHT. DO YOU HAVE TO
MAKE EVERYTHING SO DIFFICULT!

111
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,000
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU TWO ARE TALKING ABOUT.

112
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,791
- SO, YOU COMING WITH
OR WHAT, GIRLS?

113
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,166
- I'M COMING.
- YOU BET I AM.

114
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,916
- I HAVE TO START GETTING READY.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,166
- OH YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WE
CAN'T SHOW UP THERE LIKE THIS.

116
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,958
I HAVE TO STOP EATING SO I CAN
LOOK GOOD AT THE POOL.

117
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,625
- OKAY. I JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE
SHOUKO CAN GO, THEN WE'RE SET.

118
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,083
- YOU'RE ASKING HER?

119
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,083
I GUESS YOU'RE STARTING TO
GET INTO SHOUKO A BIT, HUH?

120
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,333
- AKIHISA, IF SHE
FINDS OUT LATER

121
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,416
THAT I DIDN'T INVITE HER
ALONG WITH THE REST OF US,

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,041
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL DO TO ME?

123
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,958
- I'M SORRY.

124
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,125
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE!

125
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,125
- WELL SOMEBODY'S IN A
GOOD MOOD TODAY.

126
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,208
REALLY LUCKED OUT WITH
BEAUTIFUL WEATHER DIDN'T WE?

127
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,375
- I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A NEW
SWIMSUIT ESPECIALLY FOR TODAY.

128
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,291
- REALLY? WHAT KIND IS IT?
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE.

129
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,250
- EH, JUST SOME BORING TRUNKS.

130
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,125
- BUT THAT'S A MEN'S SWIMSUIT.

131
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,666
- YOU'RE TOYING
WITH ME, HIDEYOSHI!

132
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,791
DON'T YOU LIKE ME ANYMORE?

133
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,625
- I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT.

134
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,666
- HEY THERE, BIG STUPID HEAD!
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

135
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,083
- HI, HAZUKI.

136
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,333
- SHE KEPT FREAKING
OUT ABOUT COMING

137
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,916
SO I FELT BAD AND SAID 'YES'.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,833
- WELL, THIS IS EVERYONE.

139
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,583
LET'S ALL GO GET CHANGED IN
THE LOCKER ROOMS

140
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,291
AND THEN MEET UP POOLSIDE
IN A FEW.

141
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,625
- YAY!

142
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,000
- HOLD UP KID. THIS IS THE WAY
TO THE GUY'S LOCKER ROOM.

143
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,166
YOU AND HIDEYOSHI HAVE TO
GO THAT WAY.

144
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,166
- ( laughing )
I'M JUST JOKING.

145
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,166
- MY CHOICE OF LOCKER ROOM
IS NOT A JOKE.

146
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,041
- OKAY, YOU'VE HAD
YOUR FUN, YOU TWO,

147
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,750
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
WITH ALL THE BOYS.

148
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,083
- DON'T AGREE WITH HIM!

149
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,333
I CAN'T GO WITH YOU, THEN I'D
BE CHANGING ALONE

150
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,875
IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF GIRLS,
WHICH IS HARDLY APPROPRIATE.

151
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,916
- YOU'LL HAVE TO CHANGE
WITH YUUJI.

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,166
- I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

153
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,833
- DON'T SWEAT IT, HIDEYOSHI.
CHECK IT.

154
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,750
- SO, IS HIDEYOSHI
A NEW GENDER?

155
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,458
- HEY SILLY BOYS!
THANKS FOR WAITING FOR ME!

156
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,875
- OF COURSE, HAZUKI WE...

157
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,125
( gasps )

158
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,166
- ( screaming )

159
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,458
- WE COULD GET ARRESTED
FOR WHAT WE'RE THINKING.

160
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,500
- I THINK I NEED TO CALL
MY LAWYER.

161
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,125
- PULL YOURSELVES TOGETHER,
GUYS. QUIT BEING OVER DRAMATIC.

162
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,000
- HAZUKI, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
BE WEARING THAT! GIVE IT BACK!

163
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,583
I HAVE TO USE IT TO
KEEP MY BIKINI TOP ON.

164
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,666
- THESE?

165
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,791
THEY COME RIGHT OUT, CHILL.

166
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,583
- THIS ISN'T A TOY TO PLAY WITH!

167
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,125
THEY COST A LOT OF
MONEY, YOU KNOW!

168
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,041
- SO THOSE ARE YOUR BOOBIES?

169
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,541
- YOU EVER MENTION THIS AGAIN,

170
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,583
I'LL TWIST YOU INTO
NEXT TUESDAY.

171
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,625
- MENTION WHAT?
I ALREADY FORGOT! SEE?

172
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,625
- ALMOST... ALMOST...

173
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,125
- ( screaming )

174
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,458
PLEASE, SOMEONE,
TAKE A PICTURE.

175
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,916
- STUPID HAZUKI RUINED THE WHOLE
ILLUSION I WAS TRYING TO CREATE.

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,458
- ( laughing )
- WHAT'RE YOU GRINNING AT?

177
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,083
IS THERE SOMETHING FUNNY HERE?

178
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,958
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
I THINK YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD.

179
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,750
- REALLY?
- SURE.

180
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,791
IN THAT SUIT YOUR BOOBS...
UH BUST... I MEAN BREASTS...

181
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,208
THEY LOOK SAME FROM ANY SIDE
LIKE... MY FOOT BEING CRUSHED!

182
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,625
( crying in pain )

183
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,333
- MY BODY DOES NOT LOOK THE SAME
FROM ANY SIDE, GOT IT?

184
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,708
- NOW DON'T GET UPSET.

185
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,833
THAT'S HIS OWN STUPID WAY OF
HIDING THE FACT

186
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,750
THAT HE'S CHECKING YOU OUT
IN YOUR SWIMSUIT.

187
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,916
- GEE, AKI YOU'RE SO SWEET.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,250
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE YOUR LOVE
BEHIND STUPID COMMENTS.

189
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,958
- COOL. YOUR MICRO-BREASTS
ARE HOT.

190
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,958
- AND NOW I GOUGE OUT YOUR EYES.

191
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,833
-MY EYES! I'M BLIND.
SHE STABBED MY FREAKIN' EYES!

192
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,125
- YUUJI. NOW YOU WON'T
LOOK AT OTHER GIRLS.

193
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,208
- OH WOW. YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

194
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,958
- THAT'S VERY SWEET. I BLUSH.

195
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,541
- OKAY STUD.

196
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,666
ISN'T THERE A LITTLE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO SHOUKO NOW ?

197
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,125
- SHOUKO...

198
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,208
YOU GOT A RAG? MY EYES
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BLEEDING.

199
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,000
- TELL HER HOW YOU
LIKE HER SWIMSUIT.

200
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,000
- HOW CAN I,
WHEN I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING?

201
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,583
- AH, MAN YUUJI'S TURNING
INTO A WUSS.

202
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,208
AM I RIGHT, KOUTA? KOUTA?

203
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,541
KOUTA!

204
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,208
- I'M SORRY BUT MY TIME HERE
IS FINISHED.

205
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,875
- OH NO. NOT YET.

206
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,000
WHO DARES ATTACK MY FRIEND
KOUTA LIKE THIS!

207
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,333
- I'M SORRY!

208
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,750
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT

209
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,791
HOW TO TIE MY STRINGS IN
THE BACK ALL BY MYSELF.

210
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,333
- ( screaming )
SWEET DEATH EMBRACE ME!

211
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,000
IT'S LIKE A WEAPON
OF MASS DESTRUCTION!

212
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,416
- YOSHII! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

213
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,458
- ( speaking in
foreign language )

214
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,416
- MINAMI, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

215
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,375
- IT'S WEIRD, BUT SOMETIMES
WHEN MINAMI GETS UPSET,

216
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,708
GERMAN IS THE ONLY
THING SHE CAN SPEAK.

217
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,333
- OH MAN, WHAT THE
HECK'S GOING ON?

218
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,000
- ( punching )
- ( groaning in pain )

219
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,958
- YOU CANNOT LOOK AT HER.

220
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,791
- SO IS THIS EVERYBODY?

221
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,458
- NO. HIDEYOSHI HASN'T
MADE IT YET.

222
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,083
- WHAT'S HIS SWIMSUIT AGAIN?

223
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,458
- A PAIR OF TRUNKS.

224
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,875
- THAT'S RIGHT.

225
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,041
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU ALL WAITING.

226
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,625
- MY NOSE DIDN'T EXPLODE.

227
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,291
- IT'S DRIED UP.

228
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,458
- DID EVERYBODY MAKE IT?

229
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,833
- THANKS HIDEYOSHI,

230
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,166
WAY TO GO MAKE US LOOK LIKE
WE'RE NOT EVEN TRYING!

231
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,458
- BIG FAKER. PRETEND YOU'RE
GOING TO COME HERE IN TRUNKS

232
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,916
AND THEN
SHOW UP LIKE THAT.

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,416
- I THINK YOU'RE THE PRETTIEST
GIRL I'VE EVER SEEN.

234
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
- I WOULD THANK YOU EXCEPT THAT
I'M ACTUALLY A GUY.

235
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,333
- THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE
WEARING A GIRLS SWIMSUIT?

236
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,708
- I TOLD THE STUPID SALESPERSON

237
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,958
I REQUIRED REGULAR
FASHION FOR A POOL.

238
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,500
- TO BE FAIR TO THE SALESPERSON,

239
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,416
IT WOULD BE REGULAR FASHION IF
YOU WERE A PRETTY PRINCESS.

240
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,833
- POOR YUUJI... ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

241
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,916
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
EVENTUALLY I'LL START...

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,500
- ( screaming in pain )
KILL ME ALREADY!

243
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,791
- LOVE HURTS. BUT IT CAN
HURT WORSE

244
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,833
IF YOU ALLOW YOUR EYES
TO WANDER.

245
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,916
- Hideyoshi: BAKA AND TEST

246
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,000
- ( laughing ) THERE!

247
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,875
- ( muffled )
SHOUKO? SHOUKO?

248
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,250
- HEY, YOSHII, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
A PRETTY GOOD SWIMMER.

249
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,125
- YOU'RE NOT GOING IN MIZUKI?

250
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,500
- ACTUALLY, THE ONLY THING I DO
IN WATER IS FLOAT.

251
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,625
NOBODY EVER TAUGHT ME
HOW TO SWIM BEFORE.

252
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,458
- I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO SWIM
IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT.

253
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,166
I'M A REALLY GOOD SWIMMER.

254
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,291
- THAT IS SO SWEET OF YOU,
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

255
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,958
- IT'S LIKE THEY'VE
SWITCHED ROLES.

256
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,500
MIZUKI THE A STUDENT IS BEING
HELPED BY MINAMI THE F STUDENT.

257
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,583
THINGS ARE BACKWARDS...

258
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,291
MIZUKI'S GOT F'S
AND MINAMI'S GOT A'S.

259
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,583
- WITH DUCT TAPE AND THE RIGHT
LIGHTING I'M AT LEAST A B.

260
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,375
- IN CASE YOU'RE CURIOUS
YUUJI I'M RANKED A STRAIGHT C.

261
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,750
- ( muffled ) I HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

262
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,041
- HEY DORKFACE!

263
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,541
ME AND YOU SHOULD PLAY
UNDERWATER DEMON!

264
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,875
- UNDERWATER DEMON?

265
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,958
IS THAT ANYTHING LIKE SHARKS
AND MINNOWS?

266
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,583
- NO. IN UNDERWATER DEMON,

267
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,666
THE PERSON BEING THE DEMON
CHASES AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE.

268
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,208
AS SOON AS HE IS ABLE TO DRAG
SOMEONE INTO THE WATER

269
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,833
AND DROWN THEM HE'S THE WINNER.

270
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,500
- THAT ISN'T A GAME,
THAT'S PSYOCHOTIC!

271
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,458
- LISTEN, HAZUKI...

272
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,875
THAT GAME IS TOO DANGEROUS
FOR YOU TO PLAY, OKAY?

273
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,000
- OKAY. JUST SOUNDED LIKE FUN.

274
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,791
- CHECK IT OUT. HEY SHOUKO!

275
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,083
- YOU RANG?
- I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU

276
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,375
AN AWESOME POOL GAME
TO PLAY WITH YUUJI.

277
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,166
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.
YOU DRAG YUUJI INTO THE WATER.

278
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,208
AFTER HE DROWNS, YOU
PERFORM CPR ON HIM

279
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,791
AND THAT'LL MAKE YOU A WINNER.

280
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,458
- ( screaming )

281
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,750
- ( water splashing )

282
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,541
- HELP! I CAN'T...
PLEASE! SOMEONE... HELP!

283
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,625
- SEE? NOT MUCH FUN.

284
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,875
- ( water bubbling )

285
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,625
- YOU DID THIS, DIDN'T YOU?

286
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,625
- YUUJI, IT'S ONLY A GAME.

287
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,083
- ( muffled ) GET OFF OF ME!
WHY DO YOU HATE ME SO MUCH?

288
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,458
- SHOUKO... WHAT'S GOING ON?

289
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,833
- HEY, AIKO.

290
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,625
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE AIKO?
GOT SWIMMING CLASS?

291
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,875
- I'VE GOT A MEMBERSHIP
TO THE POOL HERE.

292
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,875
A BUNCH OF US DO ACTUALLY.

293
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,416
- THERE'S MY HONEY!

294
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,541
- NOW WHY WOULD YOU PLAN A
NEAR NAKED TRIP TO THE POOL

295
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,250
WITHOUT TELLING YOUR
SWEET GIRLFRIEND?

296
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,125
- WHY ARE YOU HERE, MIHARU?

297
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,833
- I HAVE SPIES AND THEY'RE
ALWAYS KEEPING ME UP TO DATE

298
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,375
SO I CAN PROTECT YOU FROM
THE CRAZIES AROUND HERE.

299
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,625
- WELL, I'M GOING TO GO
GET MY SUIT ON.

300
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,041
BY THE WAY, BOYS, IF YOU'RE
GONNA CHECK ME OUT,

301
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,375
DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU.

302
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,333
- OH CRAP. SHE JUST TOTALLY
GAVE ME PERMISSION.

303
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,375
THEN MY MANHOOD REQUIRES
THAT I GO.

304
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,958
- BETTER THINK TWICE BEFORE
FOLLOWING YOUR MANHOOD, YOSHII.

305
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,208
IT'LL ONLY LEAD YOU TO TROUBLE
IN THE END.

306
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,333
- YOU DO WANT TO LIVE TO SEE
ANOTHER TOMORROW, DON'T YOU AKI?

307
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,541
- ( screaming in pain )

308
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,833
- THIS IS THE CREEPIEST
POOL EVER.

309
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,875
MY ONLY HOPE NOW
IS THAT KOUTA'S CAMERA

310
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,916
WILL BE ABLE TO FIND ITS MARK.

311
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,833
- NO!

312
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,708
- OH MAN, SWIMMING REALLY
MAKES ME HUNGRY, YOU KNOW?

313
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,000
- THEN I'VE GOT THE
PERFECT TREAT FOR YOU.

314
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,666
- I BROUGHT ALONG SOME SNACKS.

315
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,125
I DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH
FOR EVERYONE

316
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,916
SO I WASN'T GOING TO MENTION IT.

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,208
- ( all gasping )

318
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,958
- I ONLY HAVE THREE WAFFLES BUT
THEY'RE REALLY CUTE.

319
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,125
- WE HAVE TO DO IT!

320
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,125
- A WINNER-EAT-NONE
CHAMPIONSHIP.

321
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,166
- Both: SUDDEN DEATH
SWIMMING CONTEST!

322
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,333
- YEAH!

323
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,000
- THE RULES ARE SIMPLE. THE
FIRST ONE TO REACH THE END

324
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,916
AFTER MAKING A
LAP IS THE WINNER!

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,875
- Fukuhara: MIZUKI MADE THREE
WAFFLES OF DEATH.

326
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,500
THERE ARE FOUR BOYS
TO FEED THEM TO,

327
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,666
WHICH MEANS WHOEVER WINS THIS
RACE HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE

328
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,375
EATING AND LIVE TO
FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

329
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,375
- READY EVERYBODY?

330
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,750
ON YOUR MARK!

331
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,041
- KOUTA'S WEAK BECAUSE
HE'S A BLEEDER.

332
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,708
HIDEYOSHI'S HOT BUT
I'M TOTALLY STRONGER.

333
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,125
- SET!
- WHICH MEANS...

334
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,166
IT'S JUST BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US.

335
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,291
- GO!

336
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:10,416
- DROP DEAD!
- DROP DEAD!

337
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,750
- YOU PLAY DIRTY!
-

338
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,875
WHATEVER GET'S ME THROUGH
THE DAY, WAFFLE EATER!

339
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,000
- NOT BAD, AKIHISA.

340
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,333
- IS THAT ALL YOU GOT FOR ME,
TOUGH GUY?

341
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,750
- YOU GUYS CAN FIGHT
ALL YOU WANT,

342
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,291
BUT THEY'RE AT THE TURN ALREADY.

343
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,833
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

344
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,541
- THIS IS BAD.
THEY'RE GOING TO BEAT US.

345
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,666
- NOT IF WE CAN HELP IT!

346
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,250
I'M GONNA TAKE KOUTA
OUT OF THE RACE,

347
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,958
WHILE YOU GO AFTER HIDEYOSHI!

348
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,208
- OKAY!

349
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,833
HIDEYOSHI! YOU SHALL NOT PASS!

350
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,708
WHAT?

351
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,416
WHAT'S THIS?

352
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,750
- AKI!

353
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,083
- WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU DO THAT
TO HIDEYOSHI? WHY?

354
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,500
- WHAT DID I DO?

355
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,000
WAIT!

356
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,375
DON'T TELL ME I ACCIDENTALLY
SNAGGED HIS...

357
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,583
- HEY! WHAT DID YOU DO
THAT FOR?

358
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,458
- Mizuki: YOSHII!
- Minami: AKI!

359
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,458
HIDEYOSHI, COVER YOURSELF.
QUICK!

360
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,208
- BUT WHY?
I'M JUST A REGULAR GUY.

361
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:20,041
- I'M A GONER,
BUT I HAVE NO REGRETS.

362
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,916
- ( laughing )

363
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,166
I WONDER HOW YOU GET BLOOD
OUT OF A POOL.

364
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,875
- THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN,
WASN'T IT?

365
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,458
- YEAH.
- I AM TOTALLY BEAT THOUGH.

366
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,916
- IT MIGHT BE ALL THE
BLOOD LOSS, DON'T YOU THINK?

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,500
- HERE'S AN IDEA. WHAT DO YOU
SAY WE ALL HIT THE BATHHOUSE?

368
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,666
- OKAY!

369
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,000
- HOLD UP, KID. THIS IS THE WAY
TO THE MEN'S BATH.

370
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,000
YOU AND HIDEYOSHI
HAVE TO GO THAT WAY.

371
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,000
- ( laughing )
I'M JUST JOKING.

372
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,958
- MY CHOICE OF BATH
IS ALSO NOT A JOKE.

373
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,000
- OKAY, YOU'VE HAD
YOUR FUN, YOU TWO,

374
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,583
YOU CAN'T BATHE
WITH ALL THE BOYS.

375
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,916
- NOT AGAIN! I TOLD YOU BEFORE.

376
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,625
IT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR
ME TO GO WITH THE GIRLS.

377
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,000
- DON'T SWEAT IT, HIDEYOSHI.
CHECK IT.

378
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,583
- SO IT'S ACKNOWLEDGED
BY SOCIETY.

379
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,375
- SO SWEET.

380
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,083
- SOOTHES THE BONES.

381
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,250
WHAT'S YOUR DEAL, KOUTA?

382
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,125
- NAKED GIRLS ARE
RIGHT OVER THERE.

383
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,208
- WHAT?

384
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,500
- ( girls giggling )

385
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:30,125
- HEY! WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
- IT'S JUST WASHING.

386
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,291
- I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF
SOAPING MYSELF, THANK YOU!

387
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,958
- IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU WEIRD
OR ANYTHING.

388
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,625
- WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE
SAVE ME FROM HER!

389
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,416
- ( grunting )

390
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,416
- ( humming )

391
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,541
- ( screaming )

392
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,958
- OH THESE?

393
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,416
YOU KNOW THEY'RE REALLY NOT AS
FUN AS EVERYONE THINKS.

394
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,750
YOU GET THESE BACKACHES
AND JOGGING'S A TOTAL PAIN.

395
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,416
- THAT'S THE LIE ALL YOU
HUGE BOOBERS TELL US.

396
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,083
- AKIHISA, SHAMPOO.

397
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,541
- SURE, HERE.

398
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,666
- SAID SHAMPOO, THIS IS SOAP
THAT I BOUGHT.

399
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,416
- ALL YOU NEED TO
CLEAN HAIR IS BUBBLES

400
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,458
SO I JUST RUBBED IT ON MY HEAD.

401
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,125
- WHY THE HELL DID I BOTHER
ASKING YOU TO GET SHAMPOO?

402
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,250
- HEY, SHOUKO, CAN I BORROW
YOUR SHAMPOO?

403
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,750
THANKS!

404
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,750
- YUUJI, I NEED SOME SOAP.

405
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,166
- CATCH.

406
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,833
- Mizuki: YOU TWO ARE ACTING
LIKE A MARRIED COUPLE ALREADY.

407
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,250
- MIZUKI, BITE YOUR TONGUE!

408
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,666
SAYING CRAP LIKE THAT ONLY
STRENGTHENS HER DELUSIONS.

409
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,458
IF YOU START BUYING INTO IT
SHE'LL ONLY TRAP ME...

410
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,833
- ( humming )

411
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,333
- I DON'T THINK THEY CHANGE SIZE
IN ZERO GRAVITY...

412
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,791
- DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S BAD MANNERS

413
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,875
TO TRY AND STAY COVERED UP
IN A SPA LIKE THIS.

414
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,083
YOU HAVE TO SET YOURSELF FREE

415
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,083
AND LET US BE TOGETHER AS
NATURE INTENDED!

416
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,541
- WHY CAN'T SHE JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE?

417
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,666
- ( humming )

418
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,083
- HEY, DID YOU KNOW?

419
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,166
THE MEN'S AND WOMEN'S SIDES OF
THE BATH ARE TOTALLY CONNECTED.

420
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,875
- YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
SEE STUFF UNDERWATER.

421
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,541
- Both: DIVE CHALLENGE!

422
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,375
- HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT!

423
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,541
- THEY KEEP US SEPARATE

424
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,958
BY SUPPLYING ALL THE HOT
WATER RIGHT THERE!

425
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,875
- LET'S FREEZE OUR HEADS
AND THEN WE CAN TAKE THE PAIN!

426
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,166
- Both: DIVE CHALLENGE
NUMBER TWO!

427
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,166
- MY EYES! THE PAIN! OW! PAIN!
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN!

428
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,083
- ( laughing ) LOOKS LIKE IT
DIDN'T WORK, DID IT?

429
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,541
- WE CAN'T LET THAT WENCH JUST
MOCK US LIKE THAT.

430
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,833
- IT'S GAME TIME.

431
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,625
- TIME TO PULL OUT THE BIG GUNS.

432
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,958
- Fukuhara: THE IRON BRACELET
ALLOWS AKIHISA

433
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,125
TO SUMMON HIS AVATAR

434
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,333
WITHOUT THE NEED
OF TEACHER APPROVAL.

435
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,833
- AWAKEN!

436
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,708
I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR. SUMMON!

437
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,333
OKAY, GO!

438
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,500
- YOSHII'S STUPID AVATAR IS
GETTING ALL CREEPY!

439
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,958
- CAN YOU SEE?

440
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,208
- MY AVATAR CAN SEE THEM

441
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,416
BUT IT'S JUST MAKING MY BRAIN
EXPLODE INSIDE!

442
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,791
- TRY PLAN B. HERE.

443
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,583
- AWESOME! MY AVATAR CAN
DEFINITELY TAKE SOME PICTURES.

444
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,750
- Girls: I'M
SUMMONING MY AVATAR!

445
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,000
- SUMMON!
- SUMMON!

446
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,375
- SUMMON!
- SUMMON!

447
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,916
- SUMMON!

448
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,708
- WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU USE
YOUR AVATAR AS A PEEPING TOM!

449
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,625
- I DON'T THINK THAT
LITTLE THING

450
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,791
HAS WHAT IT TAKES
TO GET PAST US.

451
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,083
- IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF THE SHIP
BUT THE MOTION OF THE OCEAN!

452
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,500
- ( screaming )

453
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,958
- THOSE WHO DIED, MEET ME IN THE
REMEDIAL CLASSROOM!

454
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,500
- WHAT? WHERE DID HE COME FROM?
HELP ME!

455
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,500
- HE REALLY HASN'T EVEN THE
SLIGHTEST BIT OF LUCK.
