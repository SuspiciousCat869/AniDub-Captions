1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,666
- Nishimura: WELCOME TO
FUMIZUKI ACADEMY.

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,041
A PREP SCHOOL IMPLEMENTING
THE WORLD'S FINEST

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:25,250
AND MOST UNIQUE SYSTEMS.

4
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,166
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU MAY BEGIN THE TEST.

5
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,541
- Nishimura: ONE SUCH SYSTEM
IS THE SUMMONER TEST WAR.

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,083
A BATTLE BETWEEN
CLASSES UTILIZING AVATARS

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,666
REALIZED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART
TECHNOLOGY.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,166
ANOTHER IS CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,000
BASED ON THE STUDENTS'
PERFORMANCE.

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,791
AT THE END OF THEIR FIRST YEAR,
THEY TAKE A PLACEMENT TEST.

11
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,541
BASED ON THE RESULTS, THEY
ARE DIVIDED INTO SIX LEVELS.

12
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:51,333
THE HIGHEST, CLASS A,
THROUGH THE LOWEST, CLASS F.

13
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,333
- THIS IS IT.
THE PLACEMENT TEST.

14
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,541
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WAY HARD.
BUT I GOT THIS!

15
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,541
- ( panting )

16
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,083
- ( gasps )

17
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,750
HIMEJI!

18
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,125
HEY! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

19
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,291
- LEAVE THIS CLASS, AND YOU'LL
BE GIVEN A ZERO ON THE EXAM.

20
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,166
NO EXCUSES.

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,833
- NO EXCUSES? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

22
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,458
- I'M PERFECTLY SERIOUS. STAYING
HEALTHY IS A PART OF THE TEST.

23
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,458
- WHATEVER! HOW IS THAT FAIR?
- YOSHII...

24
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,625
- C'MON, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY SICK,
THAT'S NOT HER FAULT!

25
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,916
- ( panting )

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,458
- YOU'RE LATE, YOSHII!

27
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,875
- HEY, IRON MAN!

28
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,833
- MY NAME IS MR NISHIMURA.

29
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,833
HERE, TAKE THIS ENVELOPE.
IT'S FOR YOU.

30
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,791
IT'S THE RESULT OF
YOUR PLACEMENT TEST.

31
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,291
YOU'LL BELONG TO THAT
CLASS FROM THIS DAY ON.

32
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,416
- COOL!

33
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,125
- YOSHII, I CAN TELL YOU
THIS NOW.

34
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,000
WHILE OBSERVING YOU
OVER THE PAST YEAR,

35
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,291
I HAD A SUSPICION.

36
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,666
WELL, THAT YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE AN IDIOT.

37
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,916
- WHAT?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,791
- BUT WHEN I HAD A LOOK
AT YOUR TEST RESULTS,

39
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,583
I REALIZED I'D MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

40
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,625
I UNDERESTIMATED
YOUR TALENTS, YOSHII.

41
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,541
YOU HAVE COMPLETELY
SHATTERED ALL MY EXPECTATIONS.

42
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,375
YOU ARE, IN FACT, BEYOND A
SHADOW OF A DOUBT,

43
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,583
THE REAL DEAL.

44
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,500
A GENUINE IDIOT.

45
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,916
- ( theme song playing )

46
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,000
- Nishimura: WELCOME TO
FUMIZUKI ACADEMY.

47
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,208
A PREP SCHOOL IMPLEMENTING
THE WORLD'S FINEST

AND MOST UNIQUE SYSTEMS.

49
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,166
- HOW COME I'M IN CLASS F?

50
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,166
THAT'S LIKE THE
LOWEST RANKED CLASS.

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,541
MAN, I THOUGHT I DID
BETTER ON THE TEST.

52
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,208
I ANSWERED ONE OUT
OF EVERY TEN QUESTIONS.

53
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,625
- Nishimura: WELCOME TO
FUMIZUKI ACADEMY.

54
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,625
A PREP SCHOOL THAT TAKES PRIDE
IN HAVING THE LATEST EQUIPMENT.

55
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,291
- WHOA.

56
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,833
THEY'VE GOT WORKSTATIONS
WITH RECLINING CHAIRS!

57
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,375
LAPTOPS? NO WAY!

58
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,541
TELL ME THOSE AREN'T
FREE FOUNTAIN DRINKS!

59
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,041
LOOK AT ALL THOSE SNACKS!
I WANNA BE IN CLASS A!

60
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,708
NASTY MATS? OLD PILLOWS?
SHORT TABLES?

61
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,083
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO
BE A CLASSROOM?

62
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,458
- Nishimura: FUMIZUKI ACADEMY
IS RUTHLESS.

63
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,291
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE
A BETTER LIFE IN SCHOOL,

64
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,083
THEN YOU SHOULD
DO BETTER IN SCHOOL.

65
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,458
THAT IS THE LAW OF THIS ACADEMY.

66
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,583
- NO FAIR. THIS IS VIOLATING
MY CIVIL RIGHTS!

67
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,750
- WELL, AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT
ALONE. GO AHEAD AND SIT DOWN.

68
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,625
- FINE. WHERE WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO SIT, SIR?

69
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,500
- I DON'T CARE.
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

70
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,500
- THERE'S NO ASSIGNED SEATING?

71
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,708
- ( cushion deflates )

72
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,500
- EXCUSE ME. MY CUSHION THING,

73
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,708
IT SEEMS TO HAVE RUN OUT
OF ALL OF ITS CUSHION.

74
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,416
- PLEASE PUT UP WITH IT.

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,791
- ( wind blowing )

76
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,708
- EXCUSE ME. THERE'S A DRAFT.
IT'S COLD IN HERE.

77
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,625
- PLEASE PUT UP WITH IT.

78
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,375
- EXCUSE ME. ONE OF THE LEGS
ON MY SHORT TABLE BROKE.

79
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,458
- PLEASE PUT UP WITH IT.
- NOT POSSIBLE!

80
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,083
- ( laughs ) I WAS JUST KIDDING.

81
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,833
- Nishimura: LIKE I SAID,
FUMIZUKI ACADEMY IS RUTHLESS.

82
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:42,208
- OKAY. SO, YEAH, I'M YOUR
HOMEROOM TEACHER, MR FUKUHARA.

83
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,833
I LOOK FORWARD TO TEACHING
YOU AND ALL THAT STUFF...

84
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,666
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH SOME TOOLS,

85
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,500
YOU GUYS JUST STUDY OR WHATEVER.

86
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,541
- MAN. THIS CLASSROOM
IS RIDICULOUS!

87
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,791
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
SPEND A YEAR IN HERE?

88
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,125
TALK ABOUT DEPRESSING.

89
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,583
- DON'T COMPLAIN.

90
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,083
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULD'VE
DONE BETTER ON YOUR TEST.

91
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,375
- YUUJI? I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE IN HERE!

92
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,375
- IT'S NOT JUST ME.

93
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,250
- ( chuckling ) HEY, WHAT'S
UP? I'M IN CLASS F, TOO!

94
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,166
- SHIMADA! OF COURSE!

95
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,500
IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE THAT
YOU'D BE IN THIS CLASS.

96
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,833
- ( growling )

97
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,833
- ARE YOU TRYING TO
CALL ME AN IDIOT?

98
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,041
- YOUR BREASTLESS CHEST IS
FORCING YOUR RIBS INTO MY EARS!

99
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,166
IT HURTS SO MUCH MORE
THAN A NORMAL CHICK!

100
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,750
( moaning )

101
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,916
I CAN ALMOST SEE IT.
ALMOST!

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,291
- I GREW UP IN GERMANY.

103
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,583
IT'S NOT MY FAULT I CAN'T
READ THAT STUPID KANJI!

104
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,708
- YOU ALL ARE LIVELY, AS USUAL.

105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,750
- HIDEYOSHI?

106
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,708
- CORRECT. GLAD TO SEE YOU.
WELCOME TO CLASS F.

107
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,833
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

108
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,583
WELL, I GUESS THIS IS WHAT
YOU'D EXPECT FROM A CLASS F.

109
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,208
THERE'S JUST A BUNCH OF SCRUFFY
LOOKIN' DUDES EVERYWHERE.

110
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,041
LUCKY US.

111
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,083
- DOESN'T THAT INCLUDE
YOU TOO, THOUGH?

112
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,250
- THAT'S TRUE, BUT IF WE
CAN ONLY HAVE ONE GIRL,

113
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,708
I'M GLAD IT'S YOU, HIDEYOSHI.

114
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,041
- THANKS, BUT I'M A GUY.

115
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,625
- I'M THE GIRL, YOU JERK.

116
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,458
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.

117
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,666
GIRLS ARE KIND AND GRACEFUL

118
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,916
AND HAVE THIS SOOTHING
SPIRIT ABOUT THEM

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,083
THAT MAKES EVERYONE FEEL
GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.

120
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,833
SOMEONE LIKE YOU WHO'S
VIOLENT AND SCARY

121
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,041
AND DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY BOOBS
THAT BREAK MY SPINE IN HALF.

122
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,708
PLEASE STOP! YOU'RE
GONNA SPLIT ME IN TWO!

123
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,708
- HELLO? I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

124
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,375
- ( gasping )

125
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,583
- I WAS AT THE NURSE'S OFFICE.

126
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,791
IT TOOK LONGER THAN I
THOUGHT IT WOULD.

127
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,666
- ( class murmuring )

128
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,125
- IT'S HIMEJI.

129
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,125
- AH! YOSHII. HI!

130
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,750
HOW ARE YOU?

131
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,708
- I'M GOOD. THANKS FOR ASKING.

132
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,541
- THAT LOOKS KINDA PAINFUL.

133
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,958
- NO! MY SPINE IS NOT
SUPPOSED TO BEND THAT WAY!

134
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,625
IT'S NOT NATURAL. IT'S ALSO
NOT BENDING! IT'S BREAKING!

135
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,125
- YES, SO CLOSE!

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,333
- ( gasping )

137
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,541
( groaning )

138
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,166
- CALL A DOCTOR!

139
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,500
- I SAW...

140
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,208
- DON'T SPEAK! ARE YOU OKAY,
KOUTA? SAY SOMETHING!

141
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,000
- THEY WERE LIGHT BLUE.

142
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,291
- STAY WITH ME!

143
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,625
- WHAT A RELIEF I'M NOT
THE ONLY GIRL IN HERE.

144
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,875
SEATS AREN'T ASSIGNED
OR ANYTHING,

145
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,666
SO WE CAN SIT
WHEREVER WE WANNA SIT.

146
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,166
- COOL. THANKS
FOR TELLING ME.

147
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,583
SO, IS THE SEAT
OVER THERE TAKEN?

148
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,375
- NO. ALL YOURS.

149
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,458
- THIS SUCKS. CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
ENDED UP IN CLASS F.

150
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,791
- NO. I KINDA LIKE THAT WE'LL
GET TO STUDY TOGETHER, YOSHII.

151
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,958
- ( coughing )

152
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,708
- OH NO. YOU'RE NOT
STILL SICK ARE YOU?

153
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,625
- YEAH, A LITTLE.

154
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,666
- WE'VE GOT THIS
CRAP-DRAFTY CLASSROOM,

155
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,041
CUSHIONLESS CUSHIONS,

156
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,541
OLD WORN OUT MATS WITH DUST
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE,

157
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,375
NOT THE BEST ENVIRONMENT
TO BE RECOVERING IN.

158
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,916
- ( clock chiming )

159
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,583
- ( coughing )

160
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,041
- SO, WHAT DID YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT?

161
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,791
- I WAS JUST THINKING, SEE...

162
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,041
SCHOOLS ARE LIKE A
WEIRD SOCIAL THING, YOU KNOW?

163
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,291
THERE SHOULDN'T BE A
NON-EQUAL-NESS

164
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,208
AND A SEPARATION-NESS
AMONG CLASSES.

165
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,250
AND BESIDES, NO MATTER WHAT US,
THE LOWEST RANKED STUDENTS SAY,

166
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,166
WE END UP SOUNDING
LIKE SORE LOSERS.

167
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,750
FOR FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE,
I THINK WE SHOULD BATTLE IT OUT!

168
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,166
- BASICALLY, YOU'RE SAYING

169
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,208
YOU WANT HIGHER QUALITY
CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT FOR HIMEJI.

170
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,708
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SO BLUNT?

171
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,750
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY CRAP LIKE
THAT. IT'S EMBARRASSING!

172
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,125
- WHATEVER.

173
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,000
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT STARTING A WAR MYSELF.

174
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,708
- YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

175
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,541
I THOUGHT WE COULD PROVE
THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN

176
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,291
WHETHER OR NOT YOU MAKE
GOOD GRADES IN SCHOOL.

177
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,541
PLUS, I THINK WE CAN WIN.

178
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,625
WHAT DO YOU SAY? WANNA TRY?

179
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:34,875
- YEAH! WE SHOULD DO IT! LET'S
CALL FOR A SUMMONER TEST WAR!

180
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,083
- HEY GUYS, LISTEN UP.

181
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,291
AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVE,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

182
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,750
I THINK IT'S TIME WE CHALLENGE
CLASS E TO A SUMMONER TEST WAR.

183
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,083
- ( all gasping )

184
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,166
- YOU'RE KIDDING?

185
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,583
- A SUMMONER TEST
WAR. IT'S SUICIDE!

186
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,291
- Nishimura:
AT FUMIZUKI ACADEMY,

187
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,166
THERE'S A SYSTEM CALLED
SUMMONER TEST WAR,

188
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,375
ALSO REFERRED TO AS ST WAR.

189
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,250
AS LONG AS AN APPROVING
TEACHER IS PRESENT,

190
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,333
A STUDENT CAN SUMMON
THEIR AVATAR,

191
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,416
WHOSE OFFENSE POWER IS BASED
ON THE STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE

192
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,875
IN A PARTICULAR SUBJECT.

193
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,833
THEY FIGHT USING
THEIR AVATARS.

194
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,833
IF THE BATTLE IS WON BY
A LOWER RANKED CLASS,

195
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,375
THEY CAN EXCHANGE EQUIPMENT WITH
THE LOSING HIGHER RANKED CLASS.

196
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,083
- NOW, I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE
TIRED OF THIS CRAPPY CLASS!

197
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,416
- All: WE ARE!

198
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,291
- RIGHT! THIS IS ALL
WE HAVE TO DO.

199
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,416
WIN A FEW WARS, AND
CLASS A'S AWESOME STUFF

200
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,375
COULD BE OUR AWESOME STUFF!

201
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,958
- ( all exclaim )

202
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,291
- WE'RE THE LOWEST OF THE LOW!

203
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,875
THE BOTTOM OF THE
FRIKKIN' BARREL, GUYS!

204
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,791
- ( chanting) All: YEAH!
- WE'RE JUST A GROUP OF LOSERS.

205
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,833
NO ONE RESPECTS US BECAUSE THEY
DON'T EVEN KNOW WE'RE HERE!

206
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,333
BUT WHAT THEY'VE
FAILED TO REALIZE

207
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,916
IS THAT WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE!

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,375
WE HAVE TO TRY.
WE CAN AT LEAST DO THAT.

209
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,291
AND DON'T FORGET,
WE HAVE THIS GUY!

210
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,875
- ( gasping )

211
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,833
- MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM.

212
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,958
GUESS WHAT,
HE'S A PROBATIONARY STUDENT!

213
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,666
- ( all murmuring )

214
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,416
- UH, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

215
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,000
- DO YOU HAVE A
QUESTION, HIMEJI?

216
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,583
- IS A PROBATIONARY STUDENT
SPECIAL OR SOMETHING?

217
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,875
- YEAH, NOT JUST ANYBODY
CAN BE ONE.

218
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,541
IT'S SPECIAL TREATMENT
FOR A STUDENT

219
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,958
WHO ISN'T VERY GOOD IN ACADEMICS

220
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,625
AND DOESN'T SEEM TO
HAVE ANY MOTIVATION.

221
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,416
- IT'S CONSIDERED THE
SAME THING AS STUPID.

222
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,750
- UH-HUH.

223
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,166
PRETTY MUCH IT'S SOMEONE
WHO'S COMPLETELY USELESS.

224
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,458
- OH, HE REALLY IS SPECIAL.

225
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,875
- AH! I'D CRAWL UNDER THE RUG
IF WE HAD ONE!

226
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,666
- IF WE WIN A SUMMONER TEST WAR,
WE CAN HAVE A RUG AND MORE.

227
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,333
WHAT DO YOU SAY, YOU GUYS?
SHOULD WE DO IT?

228
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,291
- ( all cheering )

229
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,375
- AWESOME! LET'S START THIS OFF
BY CHALLENGING CLASS E.

230
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,750
AKIHISA, SINCE YOU'RE THE
AMBASSADOR FOR CLASS F,

231
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,125
YOU HAVE TO OFFICIALLY GO
AND DECLARE WAR ON THEM.

232
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,833
- WHY ME? AREN'T WAR
DECLARING MESSENGERS

233
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,041
FROM LOWER RANKED CLASSES

234
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,666
NORMALLY GIVEN HELL FOR IT?

235
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,083
- NO. THAT KIND OF THING ONLY
HAPPENS IN THE MOVIES.

236
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,208
YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT AMBASSADOR,

237
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,000
THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO RESPECT YOU.

238
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,083
- BUT...

239
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,541
- LISTEN TO ME.
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MISSION.

240
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,125
ONLY YOU CAN DO THIS, MAN.

241
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,625
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO LET
EVERYBODY DOWN, WOULD YOU?

242
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,250
- MMM-HMM.

243
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,000
YOU LIED TO ME!

244
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,458
- I FIGURED AS MUCH.
- YOU EXPECTED THIS?

245
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,958
- I'M CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, GIVE
ME A LITTLE BIT OF CREDIT HERE.

246
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,500
- AT LEAST PRETEND
LIKE YOU'RE SORRY!

247
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,375
- NOW, THERE'S NO GOING
BACK FOR US. IT'S DONE.

248
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,125
ARE YOU READY?

249
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,708
ISN'T THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?

250
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,541
- YEAH IT IS. LET'S DO IT!

251
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,041
- REALLY?

252
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,250
THE SECOND YEAR STUDENTS ARE
TRYING TO CALL FOR AN ST WAR

253
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,250
ON THE FIRST DAY OF A
NEW TERM? HOW INTERESTING.

254
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,291
APPROVE IT.

255
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,750
- I'LL LET THEM KNOW
IMMEDIATELY.

256
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,583
- I WONDER HOW IT
WILL TURN OUT.

257
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,416
GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO WAIT AND SEE.

258
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,875
- WE'LL USE MR HASEGAWA AS THE
ATTENDING TEACHER FOR THE WAR.

259
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,708
WE'LL NEED TO SECURE
HIM ON HIS WAY TO CLASS E

260
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,250
BEFORE THE FIFTH PERIOD.

261
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,250
- MR HASEGAWA? DOES THAT MEAN
THE SUBJECT WILL BE MATH?

262
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,375
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
I'M LIKE WAY GOOD AT MATH.

263
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,833
- YES. WE'LL USE MATH.

264
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,041
MINAMI EXCELS AT IT, SO THAT
CAN BE OUR MAIN STRENGTH.

265
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,833
- ARE YOU ANY GOOD
AT MATH, MIZUKI?

266
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,333
- IT'S NOT MY BEST,
BUT I'M NOT BAD AT IT.

267
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,416
- YAY. THEN MAYBE WE CAN
FIGHT TOGETHER.

268
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,916
- NO. SHE WON'T BE
ABLE TO FIGHT.

269
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,041
- WHAT? WHY NOT?

270
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,666
- THE SCORES ON THE
LAST TEST WE TOOK

271
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,541
ARE WHAT BECOME OUR AVATARS'
OFFENSIVE POWER.

272
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,166
STOP AND THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR A SECOND.

273
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,291
- THE LAST TEST WAS...
- IT WAS THE PLACEMENT TEST.

274
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,291
- AND SINCE I LEFT THE ROOM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EXAM,

275
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,958
MY SCORES ARE ALL ZERO.

276
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,666
- BUT, ONCE THE ST WAR STARTS,

277
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,416
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE A
RECOVERY TEST TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

278
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,250
ALL SHE HAS TO DO
IS FINISH THAT TEST,

279
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,708
THEN SHE'LL BE ABLE
TO FIGHT WITH US.

280
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,250
- ALL RIGHT.

281
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,958
- WE'RE ALL COUNTING ON YOU.

282
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,750
- OKAY.

283
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,125
- ( clock chiming )

284
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,666
- MISTER HASEGAWA
HAS BEEN SECURED!

285
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,541
- ALL RIGHT EVERYONE.
BATTLE TIME. LET THE WAR BEGIN!

286
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,333
- All: YEAH!

287
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,166
- GOOD GRIEF. FOR IDIOTS
THEY SURE ARE COCKY.

288
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,875
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.
GET READY!

289
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,083
LET'S TEACH F A LESSON
THEY'LL NEVER FORGET!

290
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,708
- All: YEAH!

291
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,916
- MINAMI SHIMADA.
PREPARED TO FIGHT!

292
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,458
- HIDEYOSHI. I SHALL
PARTICIPATE AS WELL!

293
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,958
- KOUTA TSUCHIYA.
I'M DOIN' IT, TOO!

294
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,291
- I APPROVE THIS WAR!

295
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,041
- I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR.
SUMMON!

296
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,791
- SUMMON.

297
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,583
- I'M SUMMONING
MY AVATAR. SUMMON!

298
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
- WHY WAS MY TRANSFORMATION
SO DRAMATIC?

299
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,750
- THEY'RE COMING!

300
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,125
- ( exclaiming )

301
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,583
- Hasegawa: BE CAREFUL...

302
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,416
REAL HUMANS ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO PASS THROUGH THAT AREA.

303
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,416
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL HAVE TO
GET THROUGH US FIRST.

304
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,708
- YOSHIKO MIKAMI. I ACCEPT
THIS CHALLENGE. SUMMON!

305
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,416
- HELLO... GOODBYE!

306
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,250
- EXCUSE ME, BUT THAT'S MY LINE!
- OH, NO!

307
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,125
- WHEN IT COMES TO MATH,
I WON'T LOSE AGAINST CLASS E.

308
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,416
- THOSE WHO DIED, MEET ME
IN THE REMEDIAL CLASS.

309
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,000
- IRON MAN!
- SCARY...

310
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,875
- IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE ST WAR RULES,

311
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,125
REMEDIAL CLASSES ARE REQUIRED

312
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,000
FOR ALL WHO HAVE THEIR
SCORE REDUCED TO ZERO.

313
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,416
- NO, HELP ME!

314
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,958
I DON'T WANNA TAKE A REMEDIAL
CLASS TAUGHT BY A DEMON.

315
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,875
( wailing )

316
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:30,875
- IF YOU WANT TO PASS
THROUGH HERE,

317
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,625
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO
DEFEAT US FIRST.

318
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,083
- FINE. THEN I GUESS WE'LL
JUST HAVE TO DO THAT.

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
- SUMMON...

320
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,958
- BRING IT ON!

321
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,083
- WELL THEN, IF YOU'RE READY,
YOU MAY BEGIN THE EXAM.

322
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,041
- ( yawning )

323
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,125
- OKAY, YUUJI, WHAT'S
YOUR BIG STRATEGY?

324
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,166
- I DON'T HAVE A STRATEGY.
- WHAT?

325
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,000
- THE WHOLE GAME
DEPENDS ON FORCE.

326
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,500
ONE CLASSROOM TRIES TO RUSH IN
AND OVERWHELM THE OTHER,

327
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,250
AND THE CLASS WHOSE REP
GETS TAKEN OUT

328
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,791
IS THE ONE THAT ENDS UP LOSING.

329
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,083
- BUT THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GONNA
BE OVERWHELMED, IS THERE?

330
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,250
- THERE'S TROUBLE.
WE'RE GONNA BE OVERWHELMED!

331
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,416
- WHAT?

332
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,458
- WELL, THAT ISN'T SHOCKING.

333
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,000
THEIR SCORES ARE
BETTER THAN OURS.

334
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,208
IF WE KEEP FIGHTING
THEM LIKE THIS,

335
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,916
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE WE LOSE.

336
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
- OH, NO!

337
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,625
- BUT THEY ARE ONLY CLASS E
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,

338
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,166
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE REALLY
THAT MUCH SMARTER THAN WE ARE.

339
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,875
IT SHOULD TAKE THEM
A WHILE TO BEAT US.

340
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,125
AND THAT TIME IS THE KEY
TO OUR VICTORY.

341
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,250
- MY SCORE'S DROPPING!

342
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,333
- YOU NEED TO FALL BACK, NOW.

343
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,958
IF YOU DON'T TAKE A RECOVERY
TEST, YOU'LL DIE. GO.

344
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,458
- OKAY!

345
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,500
- I NEED TO TAKE A
RECOVERY TEST, PLEASE!

346
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,250
- NOW UNDERSTAND, THE SCORE OF
THIS EXAM WILL BE YOUR SCORE

347
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,208
THE NEXT TIME YOU
SUMMON YOUR AVATAR.

348
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,166
IF YOU GET A LOWER SCORE
THAN YOU HAVE NOW,

349
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,250
YOUR AVATAR WILL GET
WEAKER INSTEAD.

350
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,750
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO TAKE THE TEST?

351
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:54,875
- I AM, YES.

352
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,375
- WHAT SUBJECT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TAKE?

353
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,541
- I WANT MATH, PLEASE.

354
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,750
I HAVE TO ANSWER AS MANY
AS I CAN TO GET A BETTER SCORE!

355
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,750
- I CAN'T FIGHT ANY MORE!

356
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,000
- I GOT YOUR BACK.

357
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,875
OR WE COULD JUST TAKE A
STRATEGIC WITHDRAWAL.

358
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,291
- THIS BATTLE IS MINE!

359
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,416
- ( avatars screaming )

360
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,041
- NOT GOOD.

361
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,041
- ATTACK THEM.

362
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,125
- ( grunting )

363
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,208
- SOUNDS LIKE OUR
DEFENSE WENT DOWN.

364
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,250
- THIS IS BAD, YUUJI!

365
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,083
- THEY'RE ONLY NUMBERS
ON A PAGE...

366
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,458
AS LONG AS I DON'T HAVE
TO READ JAPANESE, I'VE GOT THIS!

367
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,291
IT'S KANJI!

368
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,500
I'LL JUST HAVE TO SKIP THIS ONE

369
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,666
AND MOVE ON TO THE
NEXT QUESTION.

370
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,666
- ( avatar groaning )

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,500
- THOSE WHO DIED, MEET ME
IN THE REMEDIAL CLASSROOM!

372
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,750
- ( all groaning )

373
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,291
- NO. WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO NOW, MAN?

374
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,250
- OH, IS THAT ALL YOU GUYS HAVE?

375
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,375
LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALREADY COME
DOWN TO THE CLASS F REP.

376
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,916
WOW. THE CLASS E REP HERSELF
HAS GRACED US WITH HER PRESENCE.

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,541
YOU SEEM CONFIDENT.

378
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,458
- WHO DECLARES WAR ON THE FIRST
DAY OF A NEW TERM ANYWAY?

379
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,500
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
OUR TWO CLASSES

380
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,541
IS STILL IN THE
PLACEMENT TEST SCORES.

381
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,416
YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU ACTUALLY
THOUGHT CLASS F COULD WIN?

382
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,208
- WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW, RIGHT?

383
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,083
- OH, I SEE.
YOU REALLY ARE AN IDIOT.

384
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,000
THAT EXPLAINS YOUR TEST SCORE.

385
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,166
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT A STRATEGY YET OR NOT,

386
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,166
BUT NOW WOULD BE A
REALLY GOOD TIME FOR ONE.

387
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,125
- OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

388
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,666
I DID HAVE A STRATEGY
AFTER ALL.

389
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,250
- WHAT?

390
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,958
- COME ON, MAN. WHY ELSE WOULD
I HAVE WANTED TO KEEP YOU HERE?

391
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,500
- MMM-HMM. YEAH, I GET IT.

392
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ARE YOU TELLING ME HE'S A...

393
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,833
- THAT'S RIGHT. AKIHISA YOSHII
IS A PROBATIONARY STUDENT!

394
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,125
GO AHEAD. SHOW THEM THE KIND
OF POWER YOU POSSESS, YOSH!

395
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,375
- WELL, I GUESS IT
CAN'T BE HELPED.

396
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,583
AFTER ALL, YOU'LL
HAVE TO DEAL WITH

397
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,375
MY WICKED SKILLS EVENTUALLY.

398
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,041
SUMMON!

399
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,833
- ( all gasp )

400
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,916
- THE AVATAR OF A PROBATIONARY
STUDENT HAS A UNIQUE ABILITY.

401
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,333
AS PUNISHMENT,

402
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,958
THEY HAVE TO HELP FACULTY
MEMBERS WITH THEIR CHORES,

403
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,750
SO THEIR AVATAR CAN
ACTUALLY TOUCH THINGS.

404
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,083
- ( gasps )
- BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

405
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,458
ANY INJURIES THE AVATAR RECEIVES
ARE ALSO FELT BY THE SUMMONER.

406
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,375
- ( moaning in pain )

407
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,708
- SEE? ISN'T THAT INTERESTING?

408
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,333
- I DON'T THINK SO!

409
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,041
- FINE. I'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE
CARE OF THE LITTLE GUY FIRST.

410
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,666
SUMMON!

411
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,625
- YOU WON'T WIN THAT EASILY.
LET'S GO!

412
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,750
( battle cry )

413
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,125
- OW! HE LANDED ON THE
SAME SPOT! THE PAIN! THE PAIN!

414
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,958
JUST WHAT I'D EXPECT
FROM A CLASS E REP.

415
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,375
YOU DON'T TOTALLY SUCK.

416
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,500
- SO WHAT? HE'S AN IDIOT
AND USELESS?

417
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:50,708
- NO WAY. YOU JUST DON'T
GIVE HIM ENOUGH CREDIT.

418
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,291
- YEAH, WHATEVER YOU SAY.

419
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,291
AS CLASS REP, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND PUT AN END TO THIS THING.

420
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,041
- ( panting )

421
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,375
- GET READY.

422
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:02,500
I, HIROMI NAKABAYASHI,
CHALLENGE YUUJI SAKAMOTO!

423
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,125
- PLEASE WAIT!

424
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,125
MIZUKI HIMEJI FIGHTING!

425
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,625
I ACCEPT THIS CHALLENGE.
SUMMON!

426
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,583
HERE I COME!

427
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,375
- WHAT'S WITH HER SCORE?

428
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,208
- HER POWER IS LIKE
A CLASS A LEVEL!

429
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,666
- WHAT'S SOMEONE LIKE THAT
DOING IN F?

430
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,625
- SHE'S FINALLY HERE.
- HIMEJI!

431
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,750
- MIZUKI HIMEJI? DON'T
TELL ME YOU'RE IN CLASS F?

432
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,708
- YOSHII!
- HEY, SHIMADA.

433
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,041
- SHE'S LIKE AN OUT OF
CONTROL SMARTY!

434
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,916
- NOT TOO SHABBY, BUT I'M NOT
THE LEAST BIT SURPRISED BY IT.

435
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,083
- HOW CAN HER SCORE
GET SO HIGH?

436
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,416
- THE SCHOOL'S EXAMS HAVE AN
UNLIMITED NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

437
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,458
AND SO DOES YOUR SCORE
AS LONG AS YOU CAN ANSWER

438
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,916
WITHIN THE TIME ALLOWED.

439
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,625
- THEN YOU DID HAVE A STRATEGY.

440
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,166
- I WAS BUYING US TIME
'TIL SHE FINISHED.

441
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,500
- NO FAIR. NOBODY SAID
THERE WAS A SMART PERSON

442
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,625
IN YOUR STUPID CLASS.

443
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,916
- THEY DIDN'T? I'M SORRY!
HERE I COME!

444
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,208
- OH, NO!

445
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,916
- Nishimura: AND THUS,

446
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,041
THIS SUMMONER TEST WAR ENDED
WITH A VICTORY BY CLASS F.

447
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,125
- AWESOME! THAT WAS AMAZING.

448
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,833
WE COULDN'T HAVE WON
IF YOU WERE AS STUPID AS WE ARE!

449
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,041
- AW, THANKS.
THAT'S REALLY SWEET OF YOU.

450
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,958
- I CAN'T WAIT! NOW
WE GET TO EXCHANGE

451
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,958
OUR EQUIPMENT WITH
CLASS E'S, RIGHT?

452
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,250
I MEAN, IT'S NOT THAT GREAT,

453
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,041
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN THE
CRAP WE'VE GOT!

454
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,583
- OH, NO. WE'RE NOT
EXCHANGING ANYTHING.

455
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,416
- WE'LL JUST STICK
WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT.

456
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,583
IS THAT COOL WITH YOU?

457
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,250
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
MAKE THE SWITCH?

458
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,666
- NO WAY. SERIOUSLY?

459
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,375
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
