1
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,875
- Fukuhara: AKIHISA YOSHII...

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,166
A PECULIAR YOUNG MAN

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,666
WHO IS QUITE PARTICULAR ABOUT
THINGS HE DOES.

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,958
- Akihisa: DOWN THE HATCH!

5
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,250
( sipping )

6
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,333
NOTHING LIKE SALT WATER SOUP.

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,166
AND I GOT SUGAR WATER
FOR DESSERT...

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,083
I'M GOING ALL OUT TONIGHT.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,708
- THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE
IS PARTICULAR

10
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,375
SEEMS TO BE LOWERING EVERY DAY.

11
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,458
- ( doorbell rings )

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,250
- YEAH?

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,250
- Akira: LONG TIME NO SEE.
WHAT'S UP?

14
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,666
- ( slams door )

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,958
- GREAT. MY SISTER.

16
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,750
- ( theme music playing )

17
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

18
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,500
- Fukuhara: AKIRA YOSHII.
E CUP.

19
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,583
SHE IS AKIHISA'S SISTER
AND LIVES ABROAD.

20
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,875
- WHY DID YOU COME HERE
DRESSED LIKE THAT, AKIRA?

21
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,750
- WHY IN THE WORLD ARE YOU
YELLING AT ME RIGHT NOW, AKI?

22
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,458
YOU'RE BEING SILLY.

23
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,166
- SAYS THE GIRL WEARING A ROBE.

24
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,958
- IF YOU'D SHUT UP, THEN I COULD
TELL YOU WHY I'M WEARING THIS.

25
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,916
JUST SO YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
HAVE A VERY GOOD REASON.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,541
- I'M SORRY...

27
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,583
PLEASE GO AHEAD.

28
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,291
- YOU SEE, I HAD TO CARRY MY
HEAVY LUGGAGE FROM THE AIRPORT

29
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,750
ALL THE WAY TO THE TRAIN STATION

30
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,958
WITHOUT ANY AIR
CONDITIONING AT ALL.

31
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,458
WHEN I FINALLY
MADE IT ON THE TRAIN,

32
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,541
I WAS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED
TO SEE HOW SWEATY I'D BECOME.

33
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,416
- MM-HMM.

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,583
- WELL I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN SUCH A LONG TIME,

35
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,875
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
I LOOKED MY BEST.

36
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,750
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK BAD OF ME.

37
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,000
- MM-HMM.

38
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,708
- IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF THE
SWEAT, I CHANGED INTO A BATHROBE

39
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,875
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO
HIGHLY ABSORBENT.

40
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,583
- WHAT? THAT'S MESSED UP!

41
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,291
- THIS WAY I WAS ABLE TO REUNITE
WITH MY BABY BROTHER

42
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,250
WHILE MAINTAINING THE
SWEAT-FREE APPEARANCE

43
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,041
OF A DIGNIFIED, OLDER SISTER.

44
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,875
- THAT'S EVEN MORE MESSED UP!

45
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,375
- IT'S A GOOD THING
THE TRAIN WAS RATHER EMPTY.

46
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,666
IF IT HAD BEEN MORE CROWDED,

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,791
I WOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY
EMBARRASSED.

48
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,000
- WAIT... WHERE DID YOU CHANGE?

49
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,666
- YOU SHOULD KNOW.
THE REASON I CAME BACK

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,166
WAS TO TAKE CARE OF
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

51
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,416
- ( gasps )

52
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,416
- I NEED TO INVESTIGATE
HOW YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING

53
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,583
BEING ALONE
FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

54
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,041
THEN I CAN DETERMINE WHETHER
OR NOT I SHOULD ALLOW YOU

55
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,875
TO CONTINUE
LIVING BY YOURSELF.

56
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,250
- WHAT?

57
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,583
- WHEN YOU FIRST
STARTED STAYING HERE

58
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,541
WITHOUT ANY ADULT SUPERVISION,

59
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,166
I GAVE YOU TWO RULES
TO FOLLOW.

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,791
I'M ASSUMING YOU STILL REMEMBER
WHAT THEY WERE.

61
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,166
- ARE YOU GONNA BE MAD
IF I SAY NO?

62
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,000
- OF COURSE I WON'T.

63
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,041
- WELL, GOOD...
IN THAT CASE, I ...

64
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,291
- WHY GET MAD WHEN I CAN
JUST GIVE YOU A KISS?

65
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,250
- REMEMBER THEM BOTH!

66
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,333
- AND THE KISS I HAVE IN
MIND WILL RUIN MY CHANCES

67
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,916
OF EVER GETTING MARRIED.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,125
- THAT IS NOT EVEN
A LITTLE FUNNY!

69
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,791
- IT REALLY ISN'T.

70
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,750
RELAX. I'M THE ONE
WHO'LL DIE ALONE.

71
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,458
- HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO RELAX?

72
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,666
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

73
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
I MEAN, YOU'LL SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,375
FEELING GUILTY FOR WHAT
YOU'VE PUT YOUR POOR,

75
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,750
SPINSTER SISTER THROUGH.

76
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,083
- I REMEMBER THEM, I SWEAR.
PLEASE STOP THIS.

77
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,250
- GOOD. THEN WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE.

78
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,541
- UM, THEY'RE, UH...

79
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,708
- OH, AKI. CLOSE YOUR EYES.

80
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,041
- ( screams )

81
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,000
I CAN ONLY PLAY VIDEO GAMES
THIRTY MINUTES A DAY

82
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,291
AND ILLICIT SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS
ARE FORBIDDEN!

83
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,458
- I'M SO SORRY.

84
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,833
- WAS I WRONG?

85
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,958
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, I
JUST CAN'T KISS YOU NOW.

86
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,041
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SORRY FOR THAT!

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,125
- IT'S A LOT CLEANER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

88
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,458
- WHY? I'VE NEVER REALLY
BEEN THAT MESSY.

89
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,291
- YES, BUT AS THEY SAY,
YOU'RE "AT THAT AGE".

90
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,000
I WAS EXPECTING
YOUR ROOM TO BE BURIED

91
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,500
UNDERNEATH TWO THOUSAND
DIRTY BOOKS BY NOW.

92
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,583
- I CAN'T AFFORD
TWO THOUSAND DIRTY BOOKS!

93
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,583
- SO BASICALLY,
YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE.

94
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,041
A DEDUCTION OF 20 POINTS

95
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,500
FOR A SEMI-ILLICIT SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIP.

96
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,083
- WHAT ARE THE POINTS FOR?

97
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,125
- I'M SCORING YOU
BASED ON THOSE CONDITIONS

98
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,083
TO SEE IF YOU'VE EARNED THE
RIGHT TO CONTINUE LIVING ALONE.

99
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,208
FOR THE FINAL SCORE,
I'LL AVERAGE EVERYTHING HERE

100
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,083
WITH YOUR NEXT TEST
AT SCHOOL.

101
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,708
- GREAT. NOW I HAVE TO
MAKE SURE I GET

102
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,333
AT LEAST TWENTY EXTRA POINTS
ON MY MIDTERM EXAM.

103
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,541
THAT WAY IT WILL CANCEL OUT
THOSE POINTS.

104
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,333
- DON'T GET AHEAD
OF YOURSELF, YET.

105
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,333
ANY OTHER ILLICIT
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS

106
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,375
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

107
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,416
- IF SO, WHAT WOULD
THAT SCORE BE?

108
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,458
- IF YOU'RE CAUGHT
HOLDING HANDS WITH A GIRL,

109
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,541
SUBTRACT ONE HUNDRED POINTS.

110
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,416
- ONE HUNDRED POINTS?

111
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,083
- IF YOU WERE TO TAKE GIRLS
OUT TO THE MOVIES,

112
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,708
OR TREAT THEM TO CREPES,

113
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,208
OR EVEN IF THEY MAKE
YOU LUNCH OR WAFFLES

114
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,791
OR ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT,

115
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,791
THAT WOULD BE MINUS FIFTY
THOUSAND POINTS.

116
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,958
- ( muffled grunting )
- Akira: WHAT'S THE MATTER?

117
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,708
- OH! NOTHING!

118
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,166
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
A HEALTHY YOUNG MAN.

119
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,083
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

120
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,375
WITH YOUR BODY YET.

121
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,583
- HOLD ON A MINUTE,
I NEVER SAID THAT.

122
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,000
- DON'T WORRY. I'LL ALLOW YOU
A LITTLE FUN.

123
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,000
ILLICIT SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS WITH GIRLS

124
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,166
ARE AGAINST THE RULES.

125
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,666
BUT ILLICIT SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS WITH GUYS,

126
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,041
THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

127
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,500
- IT IS NOT PERFECTLY FINE!

128
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,333
AND QUIT SAYING ILLICIT
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS!

129
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,583
YOU'RE CREEPING ME OUT!

130
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,208
- OH, STAR LIGHT. STAR BRIGHT.

131
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,625
- NOT GOOD.

132
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,708
YOUR SCORES ARE MUCH WORSE THAN
I EXPECTED THEM TO BE.

133
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,291
- I TRIED REALLY HARD
IN MY OWN WAY.

134
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,958
- TRYING HARD IS ONLY
A MEANS TO AN END.

135
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,250
IF ALL YOU DO IS TRY WITHOUT
EVER ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING,

136
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,958
WHAT'S THE POINT,
LITTLE BROTHER?

137
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,708
FAILING IS FAILING
NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

138
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,583
- THANKS. THAT'S JUST
WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.

139
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,291
- GET BETTER GRADES
AND I WON'T HAVE TO NAG YOU.

140
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,416
JUST ONE DECENT SCORE
WOULD BE HELPFUL.

141
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,041
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT PERFECT.
NOT AT EVERYTHING.

142
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,333
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- Akihisa: COOKING.

143
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,375
- MAKING FOOD HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ACADEMICS.

144
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,875
- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR LIFE.

145
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,833
BESIDES, THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE GOOD AT IS SCHOOL WORK.

146
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,958
I'LL BE FORCED TO KISS YOU
UNTIL YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

147
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,875
- I'M SORRY. I WAS WRONG.

148
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,958
- YUUJI. I WANT TO SEE
YOUR CELL PHONE.

149
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,541
- Yuuji: WHAT FOR?

150
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,416
- I SAW A SHOW LAST NIGHT
THAT SAID YOU CAN TELL

151
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,833
IF YOUR PARTNER'S CHEATING

152
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,750
BY LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC CLUES
ON THEIR PHONE. GIVE ME.

153
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,333
- HELL, NO.
( screams in pain )

154
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,125
MY EYES! YOU CAN'T GIVE LASER
EYE SURGERY WITH YOUR FINGERS!

155
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,125
- OH MY GOD!
- FINE, BE THAT WAY.

156
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,541
I DON'T MIND TAKING IT
BY FORCE.

157
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,250
- HEY! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

158
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,791
- I HEARD IT WAS SEXY
TO BE NAKED

159
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,291
WITH ONLY A GUY'S SHIRT ON.

160
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,250
- YEAH, THAT'S FOR CHICKS,
NOT A DUDE!

161
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,416
- LET ME BE THE JUDGE.

162
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,458
- OKAY, I GIVE UP! TAKE IT.
YOU CAN HAVE THE PHONE!

163
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,625
- ARE YOU SURE?

164
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,416
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SOUND
SO DISAPPOINTED.

165
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,041
- GEEZ. HERE.

166
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,750
- YUUJI, YOUR EMAIL.

167
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,875
YOU GET MORE FROM YOSHII
THAN FROM ME.

168
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,291
- YEAH, SO WHAT?

169
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,875
- THAT MEANS YOU'RE HAVING
A LOVE AFFAIR WITH YOSHII.

170
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,333
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

171
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,208
- Akihisa: CAN I STAY OVERNIGHT
AT YOUR PLACE?

172
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,000
I KINDA DON'T WANT TO
GO HOME TONIGHT.

173
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,708
- WAIT A SEC... SHOUKO... I...
( screams )

174
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,541
- TAKEN CARE OF...

175
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,250
- Hideyoshi: GOOD MORNING,
AKIHISA.

176
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,833
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

177
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,541
IT'S WEIRD, BUT YOU LOOK A LOT
HEALTHIER THAN YOU NORMALLY DO.

178
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,291
- YEAH. I GOT TO EAT
ACTUAL FOOD THIS MORNING.

179
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,958
- Fukuhara: AKIHISA SOLD HIS
MANGA AND VIDEO GAMES

180
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,166
TO A SECOND HAND SHOP

181
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,041
AND GOT MONEY TO BUY FOOD.

182
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,291
- EVEN IF IT JUST
GETS ME THROUGH AKIRA'S STAY,

183
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,541
AT LEAST SHE'LL THINK
I'M TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.

184
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,958
OTHERWISE, SHE'LL TAKE
MORE POINTS AWAY.

185
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,666
- NO PANTS DAY, HUH?

186
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,833
- NO, IT'S NOT NO PANTS DAY,
YOU IDIOT!

187
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,291
I GOT PUNISHED BECAUSE OF
YOUR SUPER WEIRD EMAIL.

188
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,125
- THERE WAS NOTHING WEIRD
ABOUT MY EMAIL.

189
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,041
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY
READING IT OUT LOUD THEN.

190
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,541
- CAN I STAY OVERNIGHT
AT YOURPLACE?

191
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,875
I KINDA DON'T WANT TO
GO HOME TONIGHT.

192
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,958
- OF COURSE! NOW IT SEEMS
SO OBVIOUS!

193
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,750
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
EXPERIMENT UNTIL YOU'RE OLDER!

194
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,166
- THAT'S JUST OBSCENE, YOSHII!

195
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,166
UH...

196
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,083
BAKA AND TEST!

197
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:06,625
UH, YOSHII,
GO TO THE NURSE'S OFFICE.

198
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,500
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS THINK
I'M SICK WHEN I'M STUDYING?

199
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,416
- SO WHAT HAPPENED, AKI?

200
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,208
I MEAN, WHY ARE YOU
STUDYING ALL OF A SUDDEN?

201
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,375
- YOU'RE ACTING
A LITTLE STRANGE TODAY.

202
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,500
- REALLY? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

203
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,041
- WOW. YOU'VE GOT QUITE THE
WELL-PREPARED LUNCH TODAY.

204
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,958
- I KNOW. NICE FOR A CHANGE.

205
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,541
- LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
WHO MADE THIS FOR YOU ANYWAY?

206
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,791
- OH, I MADE IT.

207
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,500
- Minami: LIAR.
- Mizuki: YEAH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

208
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,875
- WHAT? I AM NOT LYING!

209
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,916
- SOMEONE SUPER TALENTED
HAD TO MAKE THIS.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,500
MAYBE IT WAS YUUJI OR KOUTA.

211
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,291
- TELL US THE TRUTH , AKI!
COME ON!

212
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,416
- JUST CONFESS,
WHO REALLY MADE IT FOR YOU?

213
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,708
- I THINK I'LL JUST LEAVE IT
TO YOUR IMAGINATION.

214
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,125
- AKIHISA, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO HOME TODAY.

215
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,625
- WHY DO THE GOOD ONES
ALWAYS PLAY FOR THE OTHER TEAM?

216
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,583
- NO! I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT!

217
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,333
- I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

218
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,500
- WHAT'D YOU IMAGINE?

219
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,250
AND WHY THE HELL
IS KUBO IN OUR CLASSROOM?

220
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,000
- HEY, SO I WAS WONDERING,

221
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,083
WHY'D YOU WANT TO STAY OVER
AT MY PLACE ANYWAY?

222
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,958
- WHAT? OH, I JUST THOUGHT
WE COULD STUDY.

223
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:04,750
- DON'T LIE TO ME.

224
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,875
YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH!

225
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,375
MIDTERMS ARE COMING UP.

226
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,916
I GUESS GETTING A GROUP TOGETHER
TO STUDY ISN'T A BAD IDEA.

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,916
- REALLY?

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,208
- LET'S DO IT OVER
AT YOUR PLACE.

229
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,666
- NO, NO! NOT MY PLACE! TODAY
ISN'T GOOD. NO, NOT AT ALL!

230
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,458
IT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL!

231
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,250
- PRETTY SURE HE'S H
IDING SOMETHING.

232
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,791
- SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK IT OUT.

233
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,500
- GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

234
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,583
- NO! YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA!
IT'S JUST MESSY! VERY MESSY...

235
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,708
- THAT'S OKAY!
I'LL HELP YOU CLEAN!

236
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,416
- NO. I'LL DO IT.

237
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,083
NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING A GIRL
WOULDN'T WANT TO TOUCH!

238
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,625
THIS MESS IS BAD.
IT'S TWO THOUSAND DIRTY BOOKS.

239
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,875
- I'LL STILL HELP!

240
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,041
- WE CAN GET RID OF THEM!

241
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,833
- YEAH, I'M IN TOO.

242
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,958
- Akihisa: DAMN IT! THAT ISN'T
WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY!

243
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,125
- Announcer: BAKA AND TEST.

244
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,875
- SO, UH, WE'RE REALLY
DOING THIS THEN?

245
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,708
- LOOK DUDE, WE JUST
WANNA KNOW WHAT YOU'RE HIDING.

246
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,250
- YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
RATHER SUSPICIOUS ALL DAY.

247
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,875
- Kouta: I BET HE'S GOT
A SECRET GIRLFRIEND.

248
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,791
- IS THAT TRUE?
WHAT'S A SECRET GIRLFRIEND?

249
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,791
- UM, YOU SHOULD ASK KOUTA.

250
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,958
- CALM DOWN, MINAMI.

251
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,750
YOU KNOW YOSHII WOULD NEVER
EVEN DREAM OF DATING SOMEONE

252
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,875
BEHIND OUR BACKS LIKE THAT.

253
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,125
- Mizuki: ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, YOSHII?

254
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,708
- Akihisa: WHY ARE
YOU SQUINTING?

255
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,208
- WELL, IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT

256
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,000
THERE'S PROBABLY
NOTHING GOING ON.

257
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,541
THAT'S YOUR CUE, AKIHISA.
OPEN THE DOOR.

258
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,250
- I DON'T WANNA.

259
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,458
- DO YOU WANT TO GET PANTSED
LIKE I DID? THIS IS YOUR CHOICE.

260
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,625
- IF YOU COULD LOOK UP AT THE
SKY WITH TEARS IN YOUR EYES,

261
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,833
THAT'D BE GREAT.

262
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,291
- WHAT FOR?
SO YOU CAN PROFIT FROM MY PAIN?

263
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,000
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? I MEAN
TO MAKE IT MORE MARKETABLE?

264
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,250
YOU SHOULD HAVE HIM UNBUTTON
HIS FIRST TWO BUTTONS.

265
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,375
- I AM NOT A PRODUCT TO BE
MARKETED! FINE, I'LL DO IT!

266
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,250
I'LL OPEN IT
IF YOU'LL LEAVE ME ALONE!

267
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,083
- Minami, Mizuki: YOUR SHIRT?
- Akihisa: NO! THE DOOR!

268
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,708
- ( Akihisa screaming
in frustration )

269
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,000
I CAN'T EVEN MAKE SOMETHING UP
TO EXPLAIN THIS.

270
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,583
- NO, I THINK WE KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

271
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,125
- Kouta: I'M SO JEALOUS
I COULD KILL HIM.

272
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,125
- THIS IS NOT A VERY GOOD
THING, YOSHII.

273
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,916
YOU BOUGHT A BRA SIZE
THAT WOULD NEVER FIT YOU.

274
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,625
SMALLER CUP WOULD BE BETTER.

275
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,583
- All: SHE'S REFUSING
TO FACE IT.

276
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,458
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

277
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,291
- A COTTON PAD FOR MAKEUP,
I THINK.

278
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,958
- WRONG. MUST BE A FISH CAKE.

279
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,333
- All: A FISH CAKE?

280
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,625
- LOOK!

281
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,916
- DUDE, THAT IS DEFINITELY
SOMETHING A CHICK WOULD EAT.

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,500
- ( Mizuki crying )
- ARE YOU ALRIGHT, HIMEJI?

283
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,458
- I CAN'T KEEP DENYING
THIS ANYMORE!

284
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,791
- SERIOUSLY? UNDERWEAR
AND MAKEUP ARE OKAY.

285
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,958
BUT ONE STUPID LUNCH
SENDS YOU OVER THE EDGE?

286
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,708
- HELLO. I SEE WE HAVE COMPANY.

287
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,375
- AN OLDER WOMAN!

288
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,250
WITH... HUGE BOOBS!

289
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,833
HOW CAN YOU BE SO CRUEL?

290
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,333
- Minami: YOU ARE TEARING
OUT MY HEART!

291
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,708
- I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW.

292
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,250
ALL RIGHT.

293
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,500
I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
SHE'S MY OLDER SISTER.

294
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,166
- All: YOUR SISTER?

295
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,791
THAT'S RIGHT. I'M AKIRA
YOSHII. THANK YOU.

296
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,416
IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU
TO BE FRIENDS

297
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,750
WITH MY EXTREMELY
STUPID BROTHER.

298
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:06,083
I'M SURE IT'S NOT EASY, UNLESS
HE USUALLY ISN'T THIS RUDE.

299
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:10,041
- WOW. SHE LOOKS NORMAL EVEN IF
SHE IS BEING MEAN. I'LL TAKE IT!

300
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,958
- HEY THERE, I'M YUUJI SAKAMOTO.

301
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,458
- I'M KOUTA TSUCHIYA.

302
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,958
- AND I'M HIDEYOSHI KINOSHITA.

303
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,916
PEOPLE USUALLY ASSUME
I'M A GIRL, BUT...

304
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,291
- YOU'RE A BOY, AREN'T YOU?

305
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,083
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S
EVER RECOGNIZED ME AS A GUY.

306
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,041
THAT'S AMAZING!

307
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,625
- WELL, IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS.

308
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,416
THERE'S NO WAY MY STUPID, UGLY,
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING LITTLE BROTHER

309
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,041
WOULD BE ABLE TO GET GIRLS
TO BE FRIENDS WITH HIM.

310
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,625
ALTHOUGH I MUST SAY
THE TWO OF YOU

311
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,625
ARE RATHER STRANGE
LOOKING BOYS.

312
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,541
- WHY ARE YOU SO RUDE
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

313
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,625
GO BACK TO BEING NICE, OKAY?

314
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,833
ALL THREE OF THEM ARE GIRLS!

315
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,541
- HOW MANY WAYS CAN I PUT IT?

316
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,083
- GIRLS? REALLY.?

317
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,541
WHEN DID YOU START BRINGING
GIRLS INTO THIS HOME,

318
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,791
AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM
WHEN THEY'RE HERE?

319
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,833
- AKihisa: CRAP!

320
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,000
ILLICIT SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS WITH GIRLS

321
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,666
GETS YOU TWO HUNDRED
POINTS TAKEN AWAY.

322
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,625
- ( Akihisa crying helplessly )

323
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,666
- AKIHISA, IT HASN'T BEEN EASY
FOR YOU EITHER, HAS IT?

324
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,041
- YUUJI...

325
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,041
- HOWEVER, I WILL ALLOW ILLICIT
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS

326
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,041
WITH BOYS, THOUGH.

327
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,541
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!

328
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,416
- IN FACT, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
TEN POINTS!

329
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,458
- WHAT? LIKE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO
MAKE ME HAPPY?

330
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,916
- HEY, AKIHISA!

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,083
SINCE WE CAME HERE UNINVITED,

332
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,041
WE CAN AT LEAST HELP
YOU MAKE DINNER.

333
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,791
- THANKS. THAT'D BE COOL, MAN.

334
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,875
- I CAN HELP.
- MAYBE I COULD COOK!

335
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,625
- ( all gasp )

336
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,000
- NO WAY. WE'LL BE FINE.
YOU STAY HERE.

337
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,875
- YEAH, WE GOT IT.
THANKS FOR OFFERING.

338
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,416
- Mizuki: REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?

339
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,250
- HEY SIS! KEEP 'EM COMPANY.

340
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,333
- SURE. WOULD YOU ALL LIKE TO
SEE SOME OLD PHOTOS OF AKI?

341
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,958
- YEAH, I MEAN IF THAT'S OKAY.

342
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,708
- Akira: LET'S SEE
THE EMBARRASSING ONES FIRST.

343
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,041
- Akihisa: ANYTHING BUT THOSE?

344
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,166
- WE'RE GONNA LIVE.

345
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,208
- SO, THEN,
WHAT ARE WE MAKING?

346
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,583
- LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE EVERYTHING
WE NEED TO MAKE PAELLA.

347
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT'S ACTUALLY MY FAVORITE DISH.

348
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,083
- CONVENIENT. DID SHE KNOW
WE WERE COMING OVER?

349
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,833
- NO. SHE CAN'T COOK
TO SAVE HER LIFE EITHER.

350
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,750
MUST HAVE BOUGHT TOO MUCH
BY ACCIDENT.

351
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,125
- ( girls laughing )

352
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,083
- Yuuji: YEAH, PUT IT
OVER THERE.

353
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,541
- OKAY, HERE WE GO! THESE ARE
PICTURES OF AKI TAKING A BATH

354
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,000
WHEN HE WAS TWO.

355
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,041
- OH! LOOK, HE'S ADORABLE!

356
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,291
- AND THESE ARE PICTURES OF AKI
TAKING A BATH WHEN HE WAS FOUR.

357
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,875
- Minami: AW, HE FELL ASLEEP!

358
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,375
- THESE ARE PICTURES OF AKI
TAKING A BATH WHEN HE WAS SEVEN.

359
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,083
- THIS WAS IN
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, RIGHT?

360
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,083
- THESE ARE OF AKI TAKING A
BATH WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD.

361
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,500
- WAIT A SEC! HOW COME I'M
ALWAYS TAKING A BATH?

362
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,666
- THESE ARE OF AKI TAKING A BATH
WHEN HE WAS THIRTEEN.

363
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,458
- ( all gasp )

364
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,791
- WAIT. WHY'D YOU ALL GET QUIET?

365
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,791
- AND THESE, ARE OF AKI
TAKING A BATH YESTERDAY.

366
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,833
- NO!

367
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,125
AH! WHEN DID YOU TAKE THOSE?

368
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,416
PLEASE DON'T AT MY
PRIVATE PARTS!

369
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,250
PLEASE DON'T LOOK!
PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT THEM!

370
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,208
- Yuuji: COME ON, BATH BOY.
YOU'VE GOT SOME COOKING TO DO.

371
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,333
- Akihisa: NO!

372
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,916
- THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS.

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,375
- LOOK AT THAT.
YOU MADE PAELLA.

374
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,791
- IS IT OKAY?

375
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,041
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU BOUGHT
ALL THOSE GROCERIES FOR.

376
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,375
- IT SMELLS REALLY GOOD, AKI.

377
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,250
- WOW. I HAD NO IDEA YOU
COULD ACTUALLY COOK.

378
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,000
THAT'S SUPER NEAT.

379
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,416
- ( Akihisa screaming
in frustration )

380
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,833
HOW DID YOU NOT KNOW?

381
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,291
- OH, NO. AKI'S YELLING AGAIN,
THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

382
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,500
MINUS TEN POINTS.

383
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,291
IT'S NOT FAIR!
THIS IS ALL YOUR DAMN FAULT!

384
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,625
GAH, WHY DO YOU HATE ME?

385
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,500
IT'S LIKE YOUR DOING YOUR BEST
TO STRESS ME OUT!

386
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:25,041
- AKI, YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THAT I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.

387
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,583
- WHAT?

388
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,291
- I CARE ABOUT YOU AS A WOMAN.

389
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,416
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

390
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,083
- THERE'S AN OLD, FAMOUS SAYING
THAT GOES LIKE THIS.

391
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,583
THE DUMBER THE CHILD
THE CUTER...

392
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,333
- GIVE IT UP, AKIHISA.

393
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,833
IT SEEMS TO ME SHE
LOVES YOU MORE

394
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,041
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD.

395
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,291
BUT YUUJI, WOULDN'T
THAT MEAN SHE THINKS

396
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,875
I'M THE DUMBEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD?

397
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,041
- SO WHAT IF SHE DOES, AKI?

398
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,416
I HAPPEN TO THINK YOU'RE
THE DUMBEST PERSON

399
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,666
IN THE WHOLE WORLD, TOO!

400
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,833
- SO DO I! YOU'RE
STUPIDER THAN ANYONE ELSE

401
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,958
ON THIS ENTIRE PLANET
IN MY OPINION!

402
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,125
- STOP IT! WHY ARE YOU
GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY

403
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,375
TO HURT MY PRECIOUS FEELINGS!

404
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,041
- WOW, YOU REALLY ARE AN IDIOT.

405
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,750
- OKAY, NOW THAT DINNER'S
FINALLY OVER, WE SHOULD STUDY.

406
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,250
- IF YOU'D LIKE, I CAN HELP
ALL OF YOU. I REALLY DON'T MIND.

407
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,375
- ARE YOU SURE?

408
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,666
- I WENT TO SCHOOL OVERSEAS
AND GOT A DEGREE IN EDUCATION,

409
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,541
SO I'M KIND OF TRAINED FOR IT.

410
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,666
- WHERE OVERSEAS?

411
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,375
- JUST IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.

412
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,750
- Yuuji: YOU'RE KIDDING ME. DO
YOU MEAN... SHE WENT TO HARVARD?

413
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,166
- ( Minami, Mizuki gasp )
- INTERESTING...

414
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,333
SHE GOT THE GOOD GENES.

415
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,750
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN,
YOU, JERK?

416
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,791
- LOOK WHAT I FOUND
UNDER AKI'S BED TODAY.

417
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,833
THEY MUST BE FOR
REFERENCE PURPOSES.

418
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,541
- Akihisa: BUT THOSE ARE MY
ULTIMATE OF TOP SECRET SECRETS!

419
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,208
- UNFORTUNATELY, I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO TAKE AWAY SIXTY POINTS.

420
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,458
- SO, YOU'RE SUBTRACTING
TEN POINTS PER BOOK?

421
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,625
- NO. YOU'RE LOSING POINTS

422
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,375
FOR NOT HAVING DIRTY BOOKS
ABOUT SISTERS.

423
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,041
- NO! IS THERE NO END?
THIS IS BRUTAL!

424
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,833
- THEY LOOK LIKE PHYS. ED
REFERENCES TO ME.

425
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,000
- STOP! I CAN'T SHARE THOSE
WITH THEM, THEY'VE BEEN USED!

426
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:53,000
- AKI TENDS TO STUDY BY FOCUSING
ON VERY SPECIFIC SUBJECTS.

427
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,166
APPARENTLY HE LIKES THE
SUBJECT OF GIRLS

428
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,666
WITH BIG BREASTS AND PONYTAILS.

429
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,958
- ALL RIGHT THEN. LET'S GET TO
THAT STUDYING, SHALL WE?

430
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,458
- AND JUST WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO YOUR HAIR, MIZUKI?

431
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,875
- I THOUGHT I'D JUST TIE IT BACK
SO IT DOESN'T GET IN MY WAY.

432
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,541
- OH, HERE!
I CAN DO IT FOR YOU!.

433
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,083
- OW! YOU'RE HURTING ME, MINAMI,
PLEASE STOP THE PAIN!.

434
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,875
- I DON'T NEED YOU TO HELP ME!
- WAIT A SECOND.

435
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,500
YOUR HAIR DOESN'T
NORMALLY GET IN YOUR WAY.

436
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,708
- ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED POINTS
TO BE DEDUCTED.

437
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,208
- WHAT? HOW COME?

438
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,375
- TRUST ME, LITTLE BROTHER.

439
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,833
ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'LL
UNDERSTAND WHY.

440
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,458
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

441
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,916
- THE OTHER ONE THOUSAND NINE
HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR BOOKS.

442
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,708
- YOU THOUGHT I WAS SERIOUS?

443
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,541
- Mizuki: HEY THERE.
GOOD MORNING, YOSHII.

444
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,125
- Minami: WHAT'S UP, AKI?

445
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,000
- HEY GIRLS. MORNING.

446
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,833
DID YOU CHANGE YOUR HAIR
STYLE, HIMEJI?

447
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,583
- OH, YES. I JUST WANTED
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

448
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,833
- DID YOU CHANGE YOUR
BOOB STYLE, MINAMI?

449
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,333
- NO WAY!
THEY JUST GREW OVER NIGHT!

450
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,458
- SERIOUSLY?

451
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,916
- YES, SERIOUSLY.
I'M STILL GROWING.

452
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,041
- ( popping sound )

453
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,083
- CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO
DISGRACE THE FEMALE BREAST

454
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,666
WITH SUCH IMPERTINENCE.

455
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,875
- ( Minami growls )

456
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,916
- YESTERDAY WAS FUN, WASN'T IT?

457
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,041
- WE MANAGED TO GET
SOME STUDYING DONE, TOO.

458
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,666
- YEAH, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I
WON'T BE ALLOWED TO LIVE ALONE.

459
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,958
I WISH SHE'D GO BACK TO AMERICA.

460
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,500
- YOU SHOULDN'T TALK THAT WAY
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

461
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,458
- Yuuji: SHE SEEMED
PRETTY COOL TO ME.

462
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,791
- YEAH, RIGHT.

463
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,416
SHE ALWAYS TAKES AWAY POINTS AND
TRIES TO KISS ME.

464
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,958
I THINK THIS IS ALL JUST
BECAUSE SHE HATES ME.

465
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,291
- Mizuki: THAT'S NOT
TRUE AT ALL.

466
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,208
YOSHII, YOUR SISTER LOVES YOU.
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

467
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,958
- SO SHE REALLY DOES THINK
I'M STUPIDEST.

468
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,291
- DON'T BE SILLY. HER ONLY
REASON FOR BEING HERE IS

469
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,750
TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY,

470
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,333
WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW
HOW MUCH SHE CARES ABOUT YOU.

471
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,041
- SHE TRAVELED ALL THE WAY HERE
FROM AMERICA FOR YOU.

472
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,000
DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER
REASON, DID SHE?

473
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,666
- Akihisa: MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT
ABOUT MY SISTER.

474
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,000
WHAT SHOULD I MAKE
FOR DINNER?

475
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,708
SHE HASN'T BEEN BACK
HOME FOR AWHILE NOW.

476
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,875
I KNOW WHAT I'LL COOK.
JAPANESE FOOD.

477
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,000
I'M HOME, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE CLOTHES ON.

478
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,500
- VERY FUNNY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY? GOOD?

479
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,000
- IT'S OKAY. I'LL GET DINNER
STARTED HERE IN A SECOND.

480
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,666
- DINNER? NOT SO FAST, AKI.

481
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,125
- AREN'T YOU HUNGRY?

482
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,208
YOUR MIDTERMS
ARE COMING UP SOON?

483
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,666
THINK ABOUT THIS.

484
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,125
SHOULD YOU BE WASTING YOUR
TIME MAKING ME DINNER?

485
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,000
- WELL, NO.
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T.

486
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,875
BUT YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY,
SO I THOUGHT...

487
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,125
- YOU DIDN'T THINK.

488
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,875
YOU'RE MISTAKING THE MEANS
FOR THE END AGAIN.

489
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,000
THE REASON I CAME BACK
WAS TO CHECK ON YOU

490
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,458
AND MAKE SURE YOU WERE OKAY.

491
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,166
IF YOU'RE WASTING TIME ON ME,

492
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,500
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH WASTING
MY TIME, AS WELL.

493
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,500
ON TOP OF THAT,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO USE ME

494
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,833
ME AS AN EXCUSE
WHEN YOUR GRADES SUFFER.

495
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,750
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK FOR ME,
I'M DOING JUST FINE.

496
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,875
IN FACT, I'LL MAKE US DINNER
WHILE YOU STUDY.

497
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,750
- HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
- SOUNDS PRETTY STUPID TO ME!

498
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,750
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
ALL YOU EVER CARE ABOUT

499
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,583
ARE THOSE DUMB TEST RESULTS.

500
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,583
FINE. I'LL GO STUDY, THEN!

501
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,708
SHE'S SO STUPID.

502
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,916
I'LL MAKE SURE
I GET A GOOD GRADE.

503
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,375
THAT'LL SHUT HER UP.

504
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,000
- ( clock chiming )
- OH, COME ON.

505
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,250
- GOOD MORNING, YOSHII.
HOW ARE YOU?

506
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,583
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, AKI?

507
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,875
- PLEASE DON'T TALK TO ME..

508
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,458
THE STUFF I MEMORIZED AND
CRAMMED INTO MY HEAD

509
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,708
MIGHT COME OUT.

510
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,500
- WHEN'S THE IDES OF MARCH?
- O... KAY.

511
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,000
GUESS WE'LL LET YOU STUDY.

512
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,375
- Nishimura: ALL RIGHT. WE'RE
ABOUT TO BEGIN THE TEST. READY?

513
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,500
BEGIN!

514
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,375
- ( reading to himself )
I CAN DO THIS. QUESTION ONE.

515
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:41,125
334 BC! THE LAST KING OF THE
ACHAEMENID EMPIRE OF PERSIA WAS.

516
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,333
ALEXANDER THE GREAT!

517
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,291
NEXT!

518
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,208
- I BET HE'S TAKING
THE TEST RIGHT NOW.

519
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,916
WELL THEN, I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD START TOO.

520
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,208
- ALL RIGHT. I DID MY BEST.

521
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,458
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TIME LEFT
OVER TO DOUBLE CHECK MY ANSWERS.

522
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,458
- ( clock chimes )

523
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,625
- OKAY. PUT YOUR PENCILS DOWN.

524
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,083
LOSERS IN THE BACK,
COLLECT THE ANSWER PAGES.

525
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,958
GOODBYE SWEET LIFE
ALL ON MY OWN.

526
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:23,083
- REALLY? ALEXANDER THE GREAT
IS MY BROTHER.

527
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,833
YOU PUT THE FIRST ANSWER WHERE
YOU SHOULD'VE PUT YOUR NAME,

528
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,583
SO EVERY ANSWER
YOU PUT DOWN WAS OFF BY ONE.

529
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,583
- PLEASE! DON'T CALL ME
ALEXANDER THE GREAT ANYMORE!

530
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,250
- Akira: HOW ABOUT
DARIUS THE THIRD?

531
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,583
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
HUMILIATE ME LIKE THIS?

532
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,375
I COULD'VE GOTTEN A DECENT SCORE

533
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,750
IF I HADN'T SCREWED THAT
SIMPLE THING UP.

534
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,541
- DO YOU THINK THEY'D
FORGIVE YOU IF YOU MADE

535
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,416
THE SAME MISTAKE
ON A COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM?

536
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,416
- NO. BUT I REALLY DID
TRY MY HARDEST.

537
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,000
- YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

538
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,250
REMEMBER OUR TALK ABOUT "TRYING"
BEING A MEANS TO AN END?

539
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,416
- YEAH, I DO.

540
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,083
SHE IS RUTHLESS.

541
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,791
- ( frustrated grunt )

542
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,791
- ( water dripping )

543
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:08,875
-( tap turning on )

544
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,041
- IT'S A MESS IN HERE.

545
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,333
WAIT. SHE CAN'T COOK.

546
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,833
THESE LOOK LIKE
FAILED PAELLA DISHES.

547
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,416
I WONDER.

548
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,791
WAS SHE PRACTICING
MAKING MY FAVORITE MEAL?

549
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,375
- Akira: TRYING HARD
IS ONLY A MEANS TO AN END.

550
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,916
IF YOU BECOME PROUD
OF THE EFFORT ITSELF,

551
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
YOU'RE MISTAKING
THE MEANS FOR THE END.

552
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,833
- FOR REAL? SHE'S SO STUPID.

553
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,833
- ( theme music playing )

554
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,375
( singing in Japanese )

555
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,291
- Akihisa: HEY, AKIRA?
- YEAH?

556
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,208
- THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

557
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,333
AND... I REALLY DO LOVE YOU.

558
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,041
- YOU DO?

559
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,916
- OF COURSE I DO,
BUT ONLY AS A SISTER.

560
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,250
- THAT'S SWEET,

561
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,333
BUT I'M STILL NOT GOING TO
IGNORE YOUR TEST SCORE.

562
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,375
- WELL, THAT SUCKS.

563
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,708
- SO, AKI...
- WHAT?

564
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:50,250
- I WAS THINKING THAT
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS

565
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,166
I COULD MAKE DINNER FOR YOU.

566
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,500
- REALLY?

567
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,916
- REALLY. BUT ONLY IF
I FEEL LIKE IT.

568
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,291
- YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S FAIR.

569
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,291
- HEY, AKIRA?

570
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,791
- YES, AKI.

571
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,000
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST
SPICE IN THE WORLD IS?

572
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,000
- HMM. HOW SHOULD I KNOW,
I DON'T COOK.

573
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,916
FINE, I GIVE UP.

574
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,791
TELL ME, WHAT IS THE BEST SPICE?

575
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,875
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION!

576
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,041
- Fukuhara: QUESTION TEN:

577
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,000
NAME THE JAPANESE NOVELIST
WHO INTRODUCED

578
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,541
THE "ADOLESCENT DETECTIVE GANG"

579
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,000
AND THE "MYSTERY MAN OF TWENTY
FACES" TO THE WORLD.

580
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,333
- Akihisa: THE THIEF
IS AMONG US!

581
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,541
- IT'S NOT ME.

582
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,833
- NEXT TIME: PREP TESTS,
MYSTERIOUS THIEVES,

583
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:27,791
AND LOVE LETTERS!

584
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,583
- THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
