1
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,666
- Yuuji: GREAT JOB, GUYS.
HOW ABOUT WE CALL IT A DAY?

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,916
- Akihisa: YEAH, OKAY.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,625
- ( beeps )
- HUH?

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,083
- Mizuki: SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR BRACELET, AKIHISA?

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,291
- EVER SINCE WE TOOK
OUR MIDTERMS

6
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,041
THIS THING'S BEEN ALL
KINDS OF CRAPPY.

7
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,916
STUPID SHODDY
CRAFTSMANSHIP!

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,541
IT DISAPPEARED.

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,250
HMM.

10
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,208
- I'LL BET YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO WORK THAT THING.

11
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,166
- Hideyoshi: DID YOU EVER
READ THE MANUAL?

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,958
- OKAY, LET'S SEE HERE...

13
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,125
"...DO NOT USE IT AS A HANDLE...

14
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,458
...AND ALWAYS REMEMBER
TO KEEP THIS PRODUCT

15
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,291
OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN."

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,083
THAT'S ALL PRETTY MUCH
STANDARD STUFF.

17
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,291
- WHAT'S THAT?

18
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,833
- THAT'S IT!
- EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M OVER 13!

19
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,083
- YEAH, BUT YOU STILL
THINK LIKE A LITTLE KID.

20
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,041
- HEY THAT'S NOT TRUE! IN FACT,
MOST OF THE STUFF I READ

21
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,541
IS ONLY MEANT FOR PEOPLE
18 OR OLDER. ( whimpers )

22
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,708
- WE'D LIKE YOU TO TELL US

23
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,791
EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF BOOKS
YOU'RE READING.

24
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,958
- BE SURE TO CHOOSE
YOUR ANSWER CAREFULLY.

25
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,125
- Fukuhara: THE BIRD THAT KEEPS
QUIET DOESN'T GET SMOKED.

26
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,541
- ( theme music playing )

27
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,666
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING, AKI.
TIME TO GET UP.

28
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,500
- ( groans )
GOOD MORNING, AKIRA.

29
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,791
- GOT YOUR BREAKFAST ALL READY.

30
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,083
I KNOW YOU'RE FIGHTING
THE TOP CLASS

31
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,916
IN THE SUMMONER TEST WAR TODAY,

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,625
SO I MADE YOU A MANLY BREAKFAST
TO HELP YOUR STRENGTH.

33
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,958
MEAT BRINGS LUCK IN COMBAT.
AND WITH THAT BEING SAID,

34
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,583
I GOT YOU A STEAK
AND BREADED PORK CUTLET.

35
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,625
- REALLY?!
- NO, THEY WERE TOO EXPENSIVE.

36
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,416
BUT I MADE SURE
TO CUT OUT THE PHOTOS.

37
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,375
- WHAT?
JUST PICTURES?

38
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,666
- ISN'T THAT GREAT?
NOW YOU'LL WIN FOR SURE.

39
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,916
- YOU'RE NOT REALLY
MAKING ANY SENSE,

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
AND I'M STILL HUNGRY.
- YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

41
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,333
I KNOW MOST TEENAGE BOYS
HAVE BIG APPETITES

42
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,375
AND PICTURES ALONE
JUST WON'T SUFFICE.

43
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,875
I THOUGHT AS MUCH,
SO I GOT ACTUAL FOOD...

44
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,083
- REALLY?!

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,000
- ...AND MADE A VIDEO
OF ME EATING.

46
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,458
- WHY DIDN'T YOU FEED ME?!
THIS IS BEYOND CRUEL!

47
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,083
I FIGURED I GOT PICTURES
'CAUSE WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

48
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,000
- WE COULDN'T AFFORD
A SECOND STEAK...

49
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,708
AND TRUST ME, FINISHING
THAT FIRST ONE

50
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,625
WAS HARD ENOUGH TO DO
IN A SINGLE SITTING.

51
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,875
- I'M SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT
THAT PIECE OFF YOUR CHEST!

52
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,583
- OH, WHY DO YOU TEASE ME, AKI.

53
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,958
- WOULD YOU STOP IT?

54
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,416
I DON'T NEED ANY OF THIS CRAP
FROM YOU RIGHT NOW!

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,166
- ( moans )
- I NEED FOOD!

56
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,666
- YOU ARE SUCH A LITTLE MONKEY.

57
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,125
DON'T YOU WANT TO TELL ME
HOW MUCH YOU LIKE MY SWIMSUIT?

58
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,500
- THERE ARE TONS OF OTHER THINGS
I SHOULD BE SAYING RIGHT NOW,

59
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,458
SO YOUR SWIMSUIT, QUITE FRANKLY,
IS THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES.

60
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,500
WHY ARE YOU EATING STEAK
IN A BIKINI ANYWAY?

61
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,708
- IT WAS THE DIRECTOR
OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

62
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,041
HE SAID YOU'D LIKE
IT BETTER THAT WAY.

63
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,666
I'M THINKING HE WAS RIGHT.

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,250
- THIS THING'S GOT A D.P.?

65
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,958
- Yuuji: TEST SCORES ARE
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTER HERE.

66
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,250
NOBODY CARES ABOUT
YOUR ACADEMIC ABILITY.

67
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,708
SHOW THOSE SKILLS ON THE TESTS
OR YOU'LL BE DUMPED IN A CLASS

68
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,458
WITH THE REST OF THE IDIOTS.
- THAT'S HOW YOU ENDED UP

69
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,875
GETTING STUCK IN CLASS "F,"
ISN'T IT, MIZUKI?

70
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,625
- THEY TOLD ME THAT
STAYING HEALTHY

71
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,916
WAS PART OF PREPARING FOR THE
PLACEMENT TEST.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,250
I WAS A LITTLE SICK THAT DAY.

73
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,291
- WE SHOULD BE ACTION-ORIENTED
LIKE THIS SCHOOL!

74
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

75
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,125
- I MEAN, WE CAN START
THIS BATTLE

76
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,958
WAY BEFORE THE BELL
HAS EVEN RUNG.

77
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,583
HIDEYOSHI!

78
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,541
- THIS IS EVERYTHING
I TOOK FROM MY SISTER--

79
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,791
BOOKS AND A SCHOOL UNIFORM.

80
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,625
I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN USE
ANY OF THIS AGAINST HER.

81
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,916
- WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.
LEAVE IT TO ME.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,375
- OH, CLASS "A" BOOKS
LOOK PRETTY TOUGH.

83
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,916
I WONDER HOW YOU SOLVE
THIS WEIRD MATH PROBLEM HERE.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,166
- LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

85
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,708
- MATH PROBLEMS ARE
A PIECE OF CAKE!

86
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,833
- Both: THIS...
IT'S-- UHH...

87
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,750
THIS MATH IS HARD!

88
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,333
- THE PROBLEMS EXCITE ME
BUT MAKE ME CONFUSED.

89
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,333
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT THOSE TWO MAKE TOGETHER.

90
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,541
- THE PROBLEM MUST BE
SUPER ADVANCED

91
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,875
IF IT STUMPED
THESE TWO OVER HERE.

92
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,208
YOUR SISTER'S REALLY SMART.

93
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,083
- THERE'S MORE HERE TOO.
WHY ARE THEY SO EXPENSIVE

94
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,583
IF THEY'RE JUST TINY
LITTLE PAMPHLETS?

95
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,416
- THESE AREN'T SAFE
FOR DELICATE BRAINS.

96
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,041
- AKIHISA CAN'T
PROCESS THOSE YET.

97
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,750
- ALL RIGHT, DUDE,
GRAB SOMETHING

98
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,041
FROM THE BOX AND THEN GO
DECLARE WAR ON CLASS "A."

99
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,583
- NAH. I DON'T WANT TO
GET MY BUTT KICKED AGAIN.

100
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,375
- DON'T WORRY,
I GOT YOUR BACK.

101
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,041
JUST WALK IN LIKE YOU FOUND
HER FAVORITE BOOK SOMEWHERE

102
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,916
AND WANT TO RETURN IT TO HER.
- NICE ONE.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,125
THEN SHE'LL BE ALL THANKFUL
AND LET ME DECLARE WAR ON THEM

104
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,583
WITHOUT THE WHOLE
BEAT-DOWN THING.

105
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,250
YUUKO!

106
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,583
I FOUND YOUR BOOK!

107
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,916
- ( glass breaks )
- Yuuko: NOOO!

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,750
- YOU'RE ALL BIG FAT LIARS.

109
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,625
- YOU'RE JUST A BUNCH
OF HEARTLESS, CRUEL,

110
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,375
MEAN MISFIT-HEADS.
- YUUKO!

111
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT TO ME!

112
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,541
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR THIS!

113
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,250
- HEY, YUUKO. HERE TO SCOPE
OUT YOUR SWEET NEW EQUIPMENT?

114
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,125
- IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
A JOKE, MONKEY BRAIN?

115
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,041
THERE'S NO WAY CLASS "F"
CAN DEFEAT CLASS "A."

116
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,833
WHY DON'T YOU IDIOTS
GIVE IT A REST?!

117
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,875
- GOOD...

118
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,541
NIGHT.

119
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,583
- I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN SHE WAS
SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY.

120
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,083
- YOU CRETINS SHOULD BE THANKFUL
TO BE IN THIS SCHOOL AT ALL--

121
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,666
YOU'RE THE SCUM
OF THE ACADEMY.

122
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,541
QUIT TRYING TO MESS
WITH THE REAL STUDENTS HERE.

123
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,250
- YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT.
CLASS "F" MIGHT NOT GET

124
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,291
THE HIGHEST GRADES
ON ALL THE ACADEMICS,

125
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,708
BUT I WON'T BE QUIET
WHILE YOU CALL THEM SCUM.

126
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,291
- I GUESS
YOU'RE NOT SCUM THEN?

127
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,291
- ( whimpers )
- I MEAN, IF THINGS 

128
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,625
HAD TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY

129
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,750
ON THAT LITTLE PLACEMENT
TEST OF YOURS...

130
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,833
OR PERHAPS I'M WRONG AND YOU
REALLY FIT IN WITH THESE LOSERS.

131
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:32,958
- HUH?

132
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,375
- MAYBE IT MIGHT BE
TOO LATE FOR YOU.

133
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,875
WORD IS YOU'VE TURNED
INTO A REAL MORON ALREADY.

134
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,500
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU.

135
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,833
HIMEJI IS WAY TOO SMART
TO BE STUCK HERE IN CLASS "F."

136
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,916
- AKIHISA, THIS LITTLE
OUTBURST ACTUALLY STRENGTHENS

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,083
HER ARGUMENT ABOUT US.

138
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,541
- ( growls )
- CARDBOARD BOXES ARE READY.

139
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,500
WE MADE SURE TO SHINE
THEM ALL UP FOR YA.

140
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,791
THEY'LL LOOK GOOD IN CLASS "A."

141
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,000
- YOU WON'T BE SO COCKY
AFTER SCHOOL GETS OUT.

142
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,916
YOU BETTER BE READY.
- ( door bangs )

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,125
- THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PLAN
IS NOW COMPLETE.

144
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,041
- I STILL DON'T SEE HOW THIS
HELPS US TO WIN AGAINST THEM.

145
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,500
- WE'D NEVER SURVIVE A HEAD
TO HEAD BATTLE WITH CLASS "A."

146
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,583
- THERE'S THAT LITTLE HISTORY
THINGY OF SHOUKO'S,

147
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,875
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME
IT WON'T WORK TWICE.

148
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,833
- AGREED.
MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE

149
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,708
A SECOND TIME IS
HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

150
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,083
- WHY DO YOU THINK WE DIDN'T
EXCHANGE EQUIPMENT

151
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,041
ON OUR LAST ENCOUNTER?
- HUH?

152
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,541
- THE SEEDS I PLANTED HAVE GROWN
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO HARVEST.

153
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,416
- Yuuko: A MOCK S-T WAR?

154
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,750
- Nemoto: NORMALLY WE WOULD'VE
LIKED TO OFFICIALLY DECLARE WAR,

155
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,958
BUT THAT'S NOT ALLOWED FOR THREE
MONTHS AFTER OUR LAST LOSS.

156
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,791
WE JUST NEED
A TRAINING MATCH.

157
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,583
- I'M AFRAID WE ALREADY
HAVE A WAR WITH CLASS "F"

158
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:38,125
STARTING THIS AFTERNOON.
SO WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

159
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,750
- YOU ONLY ATTACKED THOSE IDIOTS

160
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,750
AFTER THEY WERE WEAKENED
FROM THEIR WAR.

161
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,250
IS THAT THE LEGACY
THIS CLASS "A" WANTS TO BRING?

162
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,083
( chuckles )

163
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,000
ALTHOUGH, IT WOULD BE TERRIBLY
EMBARRASSING TO HAVE TO SAY

164
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,791
YOU COULDN'T WIN BECAUSE
YOU WERE TIRED FROM FIGHTING US.

165
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,041
- I HOPE YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING
WE'LL LOSE TO THEM,

166
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,541
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE STUPID.
OH, FINE.

167
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,250
SUPPOSE WE COULD USE
A WARM-UP BEFORE FIGHTING "F."

168
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,875
IS THAT OKAY, REP?
- GO AHEAD. I DON'T MIND.

169
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,416
- A WARM-UP, HUH? I WOULDN'T
UNDERESTIMATE US IF I WERE YOU.

170
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,125
- WHATEVER.
I'M NOT GOING TO STRESS TOO MUCH

171
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,250
ABOUT FIGHTING AN
AMATEUR TRANNY.

172
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,833
OH.

173
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,416
- ( bell ringing )

174
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,125
- THIS IS A MOCK S-T WAR
AS AGREED.

175
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,541
CLASS "A" AND "B" ARE
BOTH PRESENT AND READY.

176
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,875
BEGIN!

177
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,833
- LET'S NOT WASTE
ANY TIME WITH THEM.

178
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,250
- Students: SUMMON!

179
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,375
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
THEY'VE STARTED.

180
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,166
HIDEYOSHI, IT'S ALL YOU.
- GOT IT.

181
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,291
- ( gasps )

182
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,500
- HOW'S THIS?
DO I LOOK LIKE A GIRL NOW?

183
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,083
- ( moans )
- TOO FAST.

184
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,000
- ( whimpers )
LOOKS LIKE THE ENEMY OF US GIRLS

185
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,666
HAS BEEN A WOMAN ALL ALONG.
- I FEEL WEIRD.

186
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,750
I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY
I'M SUPPOSED TO SWING.

187
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,833
- WAY TO FLAUNT IT, HIDEYOSHI!

188
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,875
I TOTALLY KNEW YOU
WERE A HOT CHICK

189
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,416
EVER SINCE THE
FIRST TIME WE MET.

190
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,250
- LIKE I KEEP TELLING YOU,
I'M A GUY!

191
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,625
- CLOTHES...
CHANGED TOO QUICK.

192
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,125
- IN DRAMA CLUB YOU HAVE
TO LEARN THE QUICK CHANGE.

193
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,541
NOW YOU SEE IT...

194
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,875
NOW YOU DON'T.
- ( shuddering )

195
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,541
( screams )

196
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,708
- ( bell dings )
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING, DUDE?

197
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,125
- IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME,
I COULD'VE HAD MY CAMERA READY.

198
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,250
( moans )

199
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,875
- I GUESS HE'S BEEN
TRYING PRETTY HARD

200
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,708
TO SNAP PICS OF YOU
IN THE BUFF.

201
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,708
- NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL
PIECE OF DECEPTION.

202
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,625
AHH AH-AH-AHH.
AHH.

203
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,708
AH AH.
HELLO, MY NAME'S YUUKO.

204
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,166
MY NAME'S YUUKO.

205
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,375
( higher-pitched )
AHH. HELLO, MY NAME'S YUUKO.

206
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,708
HELLO, MY NAME'S YUUKO.
HELLO, MY NAME'S YUUKO.

207
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,583
HELLO, MY NAME'S
YUUKO KINOSHITA!

208
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,666
YOU'RE ALL JUST A BUNCH
OF FILTHY SWINE!

209
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,750
- WHAT?! YOU CAN'T JUST BUST
IN HERE AND START YELLING--

210
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,083
- YOU SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE!
YOU SMELL LIKE A PIG!

211
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,166
- WHAT?!

212
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,333
- I'M YUUKO KINOSHITA
FROM CLASS "A"!

213
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,000
WE'RE TIRED OF YOUR LAME
POOPY-POOP CLASSROOM.

214
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,791
- POOPY-POOP CLASSROOM?

215
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,041
- THE STENCH OF THIS PIGSTY
YOU CALL HOME IS MAKING ME

216
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,583
NAUSEATED TO THE POINT WHERE
I WISH FOR YOUR DESTRUCTION.

217
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,541
YOU DOMESTICATED ANIMALS SHOULD
BE SOILING OUR WORST ROOM.

218
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:09,041
- YOU SERIOUSLY TRYING TO SAY WE
DESERVE TO BE PUT IN CLASS "F"?

219
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,333
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE
AS DUMB AS THOSE LOSERS.

220
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,541
- ( normal voice )
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

221
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,541
LUCKY FOR YOU WE'RE GOING
TO BE TOO OCCUPIED

222
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,250
FIGHTING A SUMMONER TEST WAR
WITH CLASS "F" TODAY,

223
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,125
BUT TRUST ME, YOUR RECKONING
APPROACHES. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

224
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,000
- THAT DOES IT.
IT'S ON!

225
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,958
- ( bell rings )

226
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,791
- IT'S OVER!

227
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,041
- I THOUGHT IT'D NEVER END.

228
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,166
BORING! LET'S GO!

229
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,250
- YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WANTED
TO FIGHT US SO BAD.

230
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,708
- I'M CLASS "C" REP
YUUKA KOYAMA!

231
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,750
I'M HERE TO CHALLENGE CLASS "A"
TO A MOCK SUMMONER TEST WAR!

232
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,000
- HUH?
- YOU...!

233
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,708
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

234
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,125
- UH?
- UH, YUUKA!

235
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,583
THIS IS
A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

236
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,500
- SO IS THIS LIKE
A REGULAR THING?

237
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,708
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
LET ME EXPLAIN. OH, YUUKA!

238
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,333
- Fukahara: AND JUST LIKE THAT,
THEIR RELATIONSHIP ENDED

239
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,416
BECAUSE OF CROSS-DRESSING
CONFUSION.

240
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,791
- READY... CHARGE!
DO NOT LEAVE ANYONE STANDING!

241
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,625
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THEM?!

242
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,458
AREN'T THEY AFRAID
OF GETTING KILLED?

243
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,875
- IS EVERYONE READY?
- Class: YEAH!

244
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,166
- MY DEAREST MINAMI, I HOPE YOU
SEE HOW BRAVE I'M BEING FOR YOU.

245
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,416
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS. LET'S GET IN
THIS BATTLE FOR CLASS "F"!

246
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,500
- CLASS "A" IS EXHAUSTED
FROM BACK TO BACK BATTLES.

247
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,000
ATTACKING THEM RIGHT NOW

248
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,625
IS THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE OF
TAKING THEM DOWN A NOTCH.

249
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,958
- WE DON'T WANT TO OWE
CLASS "F" FOREVER, DO WE?

250
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,125
COME ON, LET'S HIT CLASS "A"
WITH ALL WE'VE GOT!

251
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,291
- ( panting )

252
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,125
WE'RE CLASS "A."
DON'T FORGET IT.

253
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,791
- I'M CLASS "E" REP,
HIROMI NAKABAYASHI.

254
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,458
I'M CHALLENGING YOU
TO A MOCK S-T WAR!

255
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,958
- WHAT'S WRONG? YOU'RE NOT
GONNA CHICKEN OUT ARE YOU?

256
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,166
- YOU GUYS! SO FAR CLASS "E"
IS HOLDING UP AGAINST CLASS "A"!

257
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,916
- AN S-T WAR TAKES
PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND STAMINA.

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,458
WHILE CLASS "E" CONSISTS
MAINLY OF ATHLETES,

259
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,958
CLASS "A" IS FULL
OF BRAINIACS AND BOOKWORMS

260
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,125
WHO CAN'T BE BOTHERED
WITH GOING TO THE GYM.

261
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,000
IF THEY BEGIN TO GET TIRED,
THEIR ATTACKS CAN START TO MISS.

262
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,583
REMEMBER, THEIR BATTLE?
IT'S MOCK.

263
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,000
RECOVERY TESTS ARE OUT
OF THE QUESTION.

264
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,500
- I GET IT!

265
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,208
THAT'S THE REASON WE DIDN'T
EXCHANGE CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT

266
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,291
WHEN WE WON.

267
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,125
YOU PLANNED
ON DOING THIS ALL ALONG.

268
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,208
- NOW EVERY ONE OF THEM
OWES US BIG TIME!

269
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,750
- ACCUMULATING LITTLE VICTORIES
CAN REALLY ADD UP.

270
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,458
THERE'S NEVER ONE BIG WAY
TO WIN A BATTLE.

271
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,250
AND BUILDING AN
ADVANTAGE OVER AN ENEMY

272
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,833
DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

273
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,208
STRATEGY IS THE KEY
TO WINNING THIS THING!

274
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,166
- ( panting )

275
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,375
YOU GUYS LIKE
TO PLAY DIRTY, HUH?!

276
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,458
- SORRY, WHAT ARE YOU
REFERRING TO?

277
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,458
- I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU CAN BEAT US DOWN

278
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,625
BY TURNING THE OTHER
CLASSES AGAINST US.

279
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,750
BUT WE DON'T CARE.
YOU STILL HAVE TO FACE US ALONE.

280
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,500
WE CAN TAKE IT.
- THIS IS ABOUT WHAT I'D EXPECT

281
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,208
FROM CLASS "A"... NEVER SMART
ENOUGH TO CALL IT QUITS.

282
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,250
- Yuuko: ENJOY THAT SMUG LOOK
ON YOUR FACE WHILE YOU CAN.

283
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,333
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

284
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,625
- HMPH.
- DON'T FORGET...

285
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,333
- ( shudders )
- ...I'LL BE THERE AS WELL.

286
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,833
- MEH.
ALL RIGHT THEN,

287
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,291
LET'S KICK SOME ASS!
- Class: YEAH!

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,500
- Fukuhara: BAKA AND TEST.

289
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,375
- Yuuko:
THEY'RE CLASS-"F" IDIOTS.

290
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,958
THEY NEED TO BE
TAKEN DOWN A NOTCH! WE--

291
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,791
- EXCUSE ME. THIS BATTLE
IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

292
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,041
- SHOUKO?

293
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,875
- WE'LL HAVE TO USE EVERY OUNCE
OF OUR STRENGTH.

294
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,291
THAT'S ALL.
DON'T SCREW UP.

295
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,791
- Class: YEAH! SUMMON!

296
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,541
- Shouko:
WHAT'S OUR STRATEGY?

297
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,791
- THERE'S A STAIRWAY
BEHIND CLASS "F."

298
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,125
THE MAIN FORCE WILL ATTACK
FROM THE FRONT

299
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,166
WHILE WE SEND SQUADS
ABOVE AND BELOW THEM

300
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,750
TO MAKE THEIR MOVE
FROM BEHIND.

301
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,541
- Class: YEAH!
- LET'S GET THEM!

302
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,208
- HUH?
- UH...

303
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,333
- THEY'RE NOT HERE!
- MAYBE THEY RAN.

304
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,625
- HEY!
WE'RE OVER HERE!

305
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,291
- HUH?
THERE THEY ARE!

306
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,291
- YOU GUYS SHOULD
PROBABLY GET MORE SUN.

307
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,416
YOU'RE LOOKING
KINDA PASTY THERE.

308
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,958
- WHAT A BUNCH OF JERKS!

309
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,791
- ( groans )
- Yuuko: HOW DID THEY...?

310
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,416
EVERYONE!
REGROUP IN THE SCHOOLYARD!

311
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,666
- HERE THEY COME, AKIHISA!
- OKAY!

312
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,666
- GO! OUTSIDE!

313
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,541
HUH?
- WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?!

314
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,041
- DAMN IT!

315
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,416
- ( avatar humming )

316
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,208
( gasps )
- HUH.

317
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,666
- ( yelps, whimpers )

318
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,875
- EVERYONE, FOLLOW ME!

319
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,833
YOU CAN'T GET--

320
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,291
AWAY FROM--

321
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,458
- All: WELCOME!

322
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,500
- HEY... GUYS.
'SUP?

323
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,333
- GET HIM!

324
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,041
- ( yelling )

325
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,958
- ( screaming )
- REMEDIAL CLASS FOR YOU!

326
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THOSE DORKS

327
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,208
ACTUALLY STOPPED
TO CHANGE SHOES BEFORE BATTLING.

328
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,250
- THEY'RE USED TO COMING
AT US FROM EVERYWHERE

329
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,833
BUT NOW THEY'RE
ALL IN ONE PLACE.

330
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,166
- IF WE ATTACK THEM
ONE AT A TIME IN A BIG GROUP

331
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,583
IT WON'T MATTER THAT
THEY'RE CLASS "A" STUDENTS.

332
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,375
WE CAN STILL OVERWHELM THEM.

333
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,916
- HECK YEAH. ON TO THE
NEXT ONE, RIGHT, AKIHISA?

334
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
- ALL RIGHT!
- ( screams )

335
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,291
- EVERYONE, MOVE!

336
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,041
- BUNCH OF JERKS!
COME HERE!

337
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,666
( yelps )

338
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,166
- WHAT THE CRAP?
WHY'D YOU PULL DOWN YOUR PANTS?

339
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,291
- ( squeals )
- ( moans )

340
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,083
- NOW ATTACK!
TAKE THEM DOWN

341
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,666
WHILE THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT FLAPPIN' IN THE WIND.

342
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,625
- YEAH!

343
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,541
- THAT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT YOUR AVATAR, MAN.

344
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,000
HE'S FASTER THAN
ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE.

345
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,541
- OH YEAH!
ONE REQUEST...

346
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,625
- AND WHAT WOULD
THAT BE, KOUTA?

347
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,791
- THIS TIME...
- UHHH?

348
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,791
- ...CAN WE UNHOOK THEIR
BRAS INSTEAD!

349
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,625
- SO PREDICTABLE.

350
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,875
- HOW DARE YOU ATTACK THEM!

351
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,541
YOU'LL HAVE TO FACE OFF
AGAINST ME.

352
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,041
- OKAY, KOUTA!
LEAVE IT TO ME!

353
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,708
- ( squealing )

354
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,083
- HOLD ON.
YOU'RE NOT... WHAT?

355
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,250
- YOUR PLAN IS A WASTE
OF TIME AGAINST ME.

356
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,875
I DECIDED I WOULDN'T
WEAR A BRA TODAY.

357
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,875
- ( rumbling )

358
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,375
- NO...

359
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,541
- I GUESS WE'LL FINALLY
GET TO SEE WHICH ONE OF US

360
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,041
SHOULD DOMINATE HERE,
MY LITTLE KOUTA.

361
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,833
- A BATTLE OF THE SEXES...

362
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,958
MALE OR FEMALE,
ONLY ONE CAN WIN.

363
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,791
( growls )
- NO, KOUTA!

364
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,250
- I'M OKAY.

365
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,208
I'LL TAKE HER DOWN
ALL BY MYSELF.

366
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,250
- YOSHII! I'D LOVE TO
FACE OFF AGAINST YOU.

367
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,125
- KUBO! RIGHT!

368
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,583
COUNT ME IN.
- ( squeals )

369
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,041
- A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT,
AREN'T WE?

370
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,750
ALLOW ME...

371
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,708
DEPANTSING BEFORE YOU
BRINGS NO SHAME.

372
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,208
IT FILLS ME WITH LIFE!

373
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,416
NOW I TURN THAT ENERGY
INTO PASSIONATE BLOWS

374
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,875
THAT STRIKE YOUR FLESH WITH
A RESOUNDING FLESHY SOUND.

375
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,291
A MATADOR IN HEAT!

376
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,708
THE MORE YOU HURT ME THE HARDER
I CAN FEEL YOUR LOVE.

377
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,000
YOSHII, WAIT! WE HAVE
TO RISK OUR LIVES TOGETHER

378
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,458
IN A CARNAL EMBRACE
OF SWEATY COMBAT!

379
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,625
- KICK HIM WHILE HE'S DOWN!
- YEAH!

380
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,458
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!

381
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,083
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF THIS PLAYING AROUND.

382
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,500
- IT'S TIME FOR ME TO FACE
YUUJI. WHERE IS HE?

383
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,791
- YUUJI'S BUSY.
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE US ON.

384
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,416
- Minami: WE'RE CUTTING THEIR
NUMBERS DOWN BIT BY BIT.

385
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,583
- HEY, GUYS!
- Mizuki: AKIHISA!

386
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,375
- LOOKS LIKE THINGS
ARE GOING WELL.

387
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,583
- SURPRISE AND DISTRACTION...
THOSE ARE THE BEST TOOLS

388
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,708
WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING SOMEONE
WHO CAN TOTALLY KICK YOUR BUTT.

389
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,333
- YOU MEAN US?

390
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,250
- SO THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN FIGHT US

391
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,291
IS WITH TRAPS AND TRICKS?
IS THAT IT?

392
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,958
- ( laughs )
NO LAW AGAINST TACTICS.

393
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,166
- TRUE.

394
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,000
BUT THE TIME
FOR GAMES IS OVER.

395
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,166
- YUUJI, I'M GOING
TO DEFEAT YOU NOW.

396
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,250
- MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.
LET'S GO!

397
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,583
- I APPROVE THIS!

398
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,583
- I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR.
SUMMON!

399
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,333
- SUMMON!

400
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,958
- ( all yelling )

401
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,041
- OUR ATTACKS KEEP MISSING!
- WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING A LOT.

402
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,666
- WITH MY IRON BRACELET

403
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,708
WE CAN SUMMON OUR AVATARS
WHENEVER WE WANT.

404
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,000
- WE'VE HAD LOTS OF TIME
TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY

405
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,666
TO CONTROL
OUR AVATARS' MOVEMENTS.

406
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,791
- YOU DON'T USE
YOUR AVATARS EVERY DAY.

407
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,666
AND BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE TIRED
FROM ALL THE WARS YOU HAD BEFORE

408
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,875
DODGING YOUR ATTACKS
IS EASY!

409
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,750
- GOT A PRETTY BIG MOUTH...

410
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,583
BUT IT ONLY TAKES
ONE HIT TO END IT.

411
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,291
- BRING IT ON, YUUKO.

412
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,291
IT MEANS NOTHING IF YOU CAN'T
HIT... LIKE THIS!

413
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,583
OUR HITS MAY NOT BE
ALL THAT POWERFUL...

414
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,125
BUT THEY SURE CAN
ADD UP OVER TIME.

415
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,041
- BUT YOU CAN'T!
YOU'RE JUST CLASS "F"!

416
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,166
- GUESS WE'VE BEEN HITTING
THE BOOKS A LOT LATELY!

417
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,750
- YEAH, BUT YOU GUYS
ARE STILL SMARTER THAN US.

418
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,500
- IT CAN'T BE.

419
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,416
- IT LOOKS LIKE HELP'S
FINALLY ARRIVED.

420
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,041
- THEY GOT HERE QUICKER
THAN I THOUGHT. AKIHISA!

421
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,625
- RIGHT.
AWAKEN!

422
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:01,291
- ( grunts )
- ( clangs )

423
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,708
- NONE OF YOU CAN GET THROUGH
HERE TILL WE'RE FINISHED!

424
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,166
- NO! PUSH IT!
( groaning )

425
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,583
- ( squealing )

426
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,916
- Yuuji: YOU GUYS ARE
ON YOUR OWN NOW.

427
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,125
- BIG DEAL. I COULD TAKE
YOU LOSERS ALL BY MYSELF.

428
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,291
- TALK ABOUT CONCEITED.
- I'LL FIGHT YOU!

429
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,541
- YUUJI...

430
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,375
IT'S TIME.
- COME ON!

431
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,041
- THEY'RE JUST
THE STUPID "F" CLASS.

432
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,208
- BUT HOW?

433
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,958
- WE GOT BETTER.
AND NOW YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

434
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,291
- WAY TO GO!
- LET'S FINISH THIS!

435
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,625
( roars )

436
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,458
- ( gasps )
- WHAT'S WRONG?

437
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,541
- IT'S THE BRACELET!

438
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,458
- DAMN IT.
THE BRACELET SURVIVED

439
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,125
WHEN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS DOWN.
WHY'S IT CRAPPING OUT NOW?

440
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,208
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?!
- YOU OVERLOADED IT

441
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,291
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
STUDYING SO MUCH!

442
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,708
- WHAT'S YOUR POINT?!
- THE BRACELET IS DESIGNED

443
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,041
TO BE USED
BY AN IDIOT ONLY!

444
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,041
- ( explosion )

445
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,833
- ( gasps )

446
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,916
- YUUKO!

447
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,416
- SHOUKO!
- HIMEJI, NO!

448
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,708
- ( pants )

449
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,208
- SHOUKO...

450
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,083
- HOLD ON, AKIHISA!

451
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,291
- YEAH.
I GOT YOU.

452
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,166
- ( both scream )

453
