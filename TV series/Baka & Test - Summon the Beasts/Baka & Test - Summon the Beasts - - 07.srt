1
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,750
- GOOD MORNING, YUUJI.

2
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,958
IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUTSIDE TODAY.

3
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,416
ARE YOU HUNGRY? HERE.

4
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,500
YUUJI? YOU LOOK SLEEPY.

5
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,708
- SHOUKO, TOSS ME MY CELL.

6
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,625
HELLO, IS THIS THE POLICE?
I'D LIKE TO REPORT AN INTRUDER.

7
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,333
( theme song playing )

8
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,041
- YUUJI, WHAT IS THIS?

9
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:25,000
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I'VE
NEVER SEEN THAT BOOK BEFORE.

10
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,875
- REALLY? BECAUSE IT WAS HIDDEN
UNDER A FALSE BOTTOM

11
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,500
IN THE THIRD DRAWER OF YOUR DESK

12
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,000
WITH A SCHOOLBOOK COVER
DISGUISING IT.

13
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,541
- HELLO? DID YOU HAVE
AN EMERGENCY? HELLO?

14
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,333
- I'M SORRY. I MADE A MISTAKE.

15
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,000
- ALL RIGHT, IF YOU BURN IT,
I WILL FORGIVE YOU.

16
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,583
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT? WHAT
DO I CARE IF YOU FORGIVE ME?

17
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,000
- FINE. I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT MYSELF.

18
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,666
- YOU CAN'T JUST TORCH
SOMEONE'S STUFF!

19
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,458
( Yuuji screams )

20
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,541
SO TELL ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE ANYWAY?

21
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,166
- LET ME SHOW YOU.

22
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,875
- WAIT. THE VIP TICKET
FOR THE AMUSEMENT PARK?

23
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,500
HOW DID YOU GET THAT?

24
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,000
- SOMEONE GENEROUS
GAVE IT TO ME.

25
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,750
- YEAH, RIGHT, SOMEONE GENEROUS.

26
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,458
AKIHISA WAS THE ONE
WHO ENDED UP WITH THOSE TICKETS.

27
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,000
- Akihisa: WASN'T ME.
I'M NOT GUILTY!

28
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,166
- WE HAVE SPECIAL PASSES
TO THE WEDDING EXPERIENCE.

29
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,291
( phone ringing )

30
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,500
- Akihisa: HELLO?
WHO MAY I ASK IS CALLING?

31
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,166
- ( in menacing tone )
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

32
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,666
- WHAT? BUT WHY?
WHO ARE YOU? PLEASE DON'T.

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,416
- WELL. IT'S TIME. LET'S GO.
- NO WAY.

34
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,708
- SO YOU LIED TO ME?

35
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,583
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

36
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,541
- YOU PROMISED THAT
YOU WOULD GO OUT WITH ME

37
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,708
BACK WHEN YOU LOST THE ST WAR.

38
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,625
- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT AT ALL.
- IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

39
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,250
YOU SWORE IF YOU
BROKE YOUR PROMISE,

40
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,000
YOU WOULD MARRY ME RIGHT AWAY.

41
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,583
- OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
MAKING THINGS UP.

42
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,166
- ( firecrackers exploding )

43
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,458
- OF COURSE. THIS IS
ALL AKIHISA'S FAULT.

44
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,166
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

45
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,583
ARGH! WOULD YOU LET GO?

46
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,000
HOW COME EVERY TIME YOU TOUCH ME
IT HAS TO HURT?

47
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,125
- COUPLES ARE SUPPOSED TO WALK
ARM IN ARM LIKE THIS.

48
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,625
- REALLY?

49
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,666
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER
CHICKS USING BRUTE FORCE!

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,750
- HELLO, LOVERS! WE'D LIKE TO
GIVE YOU A BIG FAT WELCOME!

51
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,000
( phone ringing )

52
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,791
HELLO?

53
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,916
- HEY, YOU JERK WAD, I BET YOU
GUYS THINK YOU'RE REALLY FUNNY,

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
DON'T YOU?

55
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,750
- RUN! I'M INNOCENT!

56
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,791
- IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN WHY
THE HELL ARE YOU RUNNING?

57
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE A PART OF
THIS WHOLE THING TOO, HIDEYOSHI!

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,125
- WHO DID YOU SAY? I HAPPEN TO
BE A MEMBER OF THE STAFF HERE.

59
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,583
THIS IS MY OCCUPATION. I AM NOT
ACQUAINTED WITH THIS PERSON

60
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,375
TO WHOM YOU ARE REFERRING.

61
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,458
- REALLY? I'M SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT?

62
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,208
( phone ringing )

63
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,500
- OH HEAVENS, MY HAND
JUST SLIPPED FOR NO REASON.

64
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,666
- OF COURSE IT DID.

65
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,875
- MAY I PLEASE HAVE
YOUR TICKETS NOW, FOLKS?

66
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,166
- HERE.

67
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,625
- WHOA! WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT.
YOU HAVE VIP PASSES WITH YOU!

68
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,833
ALPHA CALLING BRAVO.
I'VE CONFIRMED THE TARGET.

69
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,625
WE HAVE A CODE SEVEN AND ARE
SHIFTING TO OPERATION WEDDING.

70
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,250
REPEAT: OPERATION WEDDING.

71
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,166
- WE'RE STANDING RIGHT HERE.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN'T HEAR YOU!

72
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,583
- PLEASE CALM DOWN, SIR.
IT'S NOT YOUR CONCERN.

73
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,583
- YOU WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT ME!

74
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,000
- NOW THEN,

75
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,666
IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR US TO TAKE A
COMPLIMENTARY PICTURE.

76
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,041
- SMILE.

77
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,333
- SHOUKO, SORRY!

78
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,125
AM I SUPPOSED TO NOT NOTICE

79
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,166
IT'S YOU DOWN THERE BEING YOUR
PERVERTED SELF?

80
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,208
HEH!

81
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,541
- YUUJI, BE NICE.

82
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,166
- OKAY, I'LL DO MY BEST.

83
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,291
- GOOD. I'LL REWARD YOU LATER.

84
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,500
- NO! HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

85
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,583
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
WHAT YOUR UNDERWEAR LOOKS LIKE.

86
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,333
- Shouko: I WILL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU FOR THAT.

87
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,708
- STOP IT! PUSHING DOWN ON
SOMEONE'S TEMPLES LIKE THAT

88
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,791
CAN CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE!

89
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,041
- CHEESE!
- Shouko: CHEESE.

90
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,583
- Yuuji: WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS PICTURE?

91
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,583
- IT'S A FREE SOUVENIR
FOR THE HAPPY COUPLE.

92
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,416
- IT'LL BE PUT UP IN
THE PARK'S PHOTO STUDIO

93
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,250
SO EVERYONE CAN SEE IT!

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,416
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,291
- YUUJI, DON'T BE SHY.

96
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,750
- I'M NOT BEING SHY. I JUST
DON'T WANT THIS PICTURE UP.

97
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,250
- COOL! CHECK IT OUT, BABY!

98
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,625
LET'S HAVE THEM TAKE
OUR PICTURE, TOO!

99
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,583
- WHATEVER YOU WANT, SUGAR.
HEY, LITTLE DUDE!

100
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,375
YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND TAKE OUR PICTURE NEXT.

101
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,875
- UNFORTUNATELY, GOOD SIR,
THIS SERVICE IS ONLY AVAILABLE

102
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,791
TO OUR VIP TICKET HOLDERS.

103
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,208
- WHAT? WE'RE CUSTOMERS, TOO,
AND JUST ASKING FOR ONE PICTURE,

104
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,375
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

105
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,541
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HAVE
A HOT COUPLE ON DISPLAY

106
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,583
INSTEAD OF
THOSE LAME TWEENIES. WELL?

107
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,916
- IT'S TRUE. I MEAN, LOOK AT US.
IT'S NOT LIKE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,458
CAN COMPARE, RIGHT?

109
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,250
- HOLD ON.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

110
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,958
- I WILL NOT ALLOW THEM
TO TALK THAT WAY ABOUT US.

111
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,375
- DON'T LET THOSE JERKS
GET TO YOU, OKAY?

112
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,375
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

113
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,583
- WE WANT TO HAVE A PICTURE
JUST LIKE THEY HAD!

114
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,125
- ALL RIGHT. IF YOU INSIST,
WE'LL DO IT.

115
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,416
PLEASE COME THIS WAY.

116
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,791
IF YOU COULD PUT YOUR HAND
RIGHT HERE.

117
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,541
NOW, SQUEEZE AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

118
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,416
- ( man groans )

119
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,833
- CHEESE.
- Girl: CHEESE.

120
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,750
- WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

121
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,583
- SAID YOU WANTED US
TO TAKE THE SAME PICTURE.

122
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,583
- I HOPE YOU RUN FAST,
'CAUSE I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

123
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,166
- GO-GO! BURGER HEAD'S
LOST HIS MIND!

124
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,916
- ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME,
YOU PUNK?

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,500
- WOULD YOU LIKE FRIES
WITH THAT, SIR?

126
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,833
- OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, IF
YOU WANTED TO LEAVE INTSEAD,

127
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:25,333
I'D BE COOL WITH IT.

128
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,708
DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU AT ALL

129
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,333
THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME?

130
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,041
- DON'T BE SHY. RELAX.

131
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,333
- I'M NOT BEING SHY, I JUST
PREFER NOT BE HURTING!

132
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,291
- BUT THIS IS HOW COUPLES WALK.

133
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,583
- IT'S ARM IN ARM,
NOT ARM IN PAIN!

134
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,666
- GREETINGS TO THE ADORABLE
LOOKING COUPLE OVER THERE!

135
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,583
- SEE. I TOLD YOU
WE LOOKED LIKE A COUPLE.

136
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,583
- SHE'S A GIANT FUZZ BALL.
WHAT DOES SHE KNOW?

137
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,166
- I AM FEE THE FOX.

138
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,333
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU A
FUN AND INTERESTING ATTRACTION.

139
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,916
- EARLIER I COULD'VE SWORN
AKIHISA WAS OUT

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,583
ON A DATE WITH SOME CHICK.

141
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,458
- WHAT? YOU SAW YOSHII?
WHERE IS HE? WHERE DID THEY GO?

142
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,708
- HELLO, THERE, HIMEJI.

143
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,541
- ( train whistle toots )

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,500
- I AM FEE THE FOX.

145
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,583
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU A
FUN AND INTERESTING ATTRACTION.

146
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,791
- LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
INNOCENT, THAT'S FINE.

147
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,041
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US WHERE
WE SHOULD GO THEN, ALL RIGHT?

148
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,333
OKAY! DON'T MISS THE HAUNTED
HOUSE RIGHT OVER THERE!

149
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,916
YOU SHOULD GO NOW!

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,041
- AWESOME. SHOUKO, WE'RE GOING
ANYWHERE BUT THAT HAUNTED HOUSE.

151
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,958
- WAIT! YOU HAVE TO GO!
WHY DON'T YOU WANNA?

152
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,583
- BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE
SET UP SOMETHING STUPID THERE.

153
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,041
- PLEASE! GO TO
THE HAUNTED HOUSE!

154
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,541
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT
ON IT! PLEASE!

155
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,750
- NOT HAPPENING.

156
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,375
- STOP RIGHT THERE, YUUJI!

157
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,583
I'M NOIN, AND I WILL NOT
LET YOU MAKE FEE CRY ANYMORE!

158
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,916
- OH, COME ON, YOUR HEAD'S
ALL MESSED UP, AKIHISA.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,583
- HOW RUDE!
WHICH PART IS MESSED UP?

160
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,583
- YUUJI, NOIN IS
THE ABSENTMINDED ONE.

161
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,916
- I DON'T CARE.

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,958
WHAT KINDA FOX WOULD HAVE
HIS HEAD ON BACKWARDS?

163
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,583
- YOSHII! YOU PUT YOUR HEAD ON
THE WRONG WAY!

164
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,000
- WHAT? DAMN IT! NO WONDER
I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

165
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,375
- HURRY AND FIX IT BEFORE THEY
FIGURE OUT WHO WE ARE!

166
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,000
- Akihisa: WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHERE AM I?

167
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,333
- THE SAD THING IS, THEY REALLY
THINK THEY'VE FOOLED US.

168
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,250
- OH, BY THE WAY,

169
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,916
HOW DID YOUR DATE WITH THAT
SUPER HOT COLLEGE CHICK GO, MAN?

170
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,708
- WHAT?

171
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,791
- YOSHII, I HEARD
WHILE WE WERE WORKING

172
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,458
ON THIS VERY
IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT

173
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,583
THAT YOU WENT OUT ON A DATE.

174
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,583
- WAIT. WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

175
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,000
- MINAMI'S ON HER WAY
HERE NOW.

176
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,583
WE THINK WE NEED TO SIT DOWN
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

177
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,500
- NO! BAD IDEA. THIS PARK IS
SUPPOSED TO BE FOR AMUSEMENT

178
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,708
NOT A-FIGHTING!

179
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,583
- HEY! WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE, AKI?

180
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,208
- HOW'D SHE GET HERE SO FAST?

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,583
TRASH CAN! AND GROUND!

182
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,416
- YOU'RE GONNA TELL US
EVERY SINGLE DETAIL.

183
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,583
- AND YOU NEED TO TELL US
THE TRUTH, TOO.

184
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,291
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

185
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,625
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, SHOUKO.

186
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,041
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO RIDE
THE FERRIS WHEEL

187
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,416
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

188
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,875
SHOUKO? WHERE'D YOU...

189
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,291
- ( dramatic music playing )

190
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,125
- EVERYTHING SET UP,
THE HAUNTED HOUSE IS READY.

191
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,791
- STOP THAT!
- WE'RE GOING WHERE THEY WANT.

192
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,458
- AH, WHAT THE HELL
DID HIDEYOSHI SAY TO YOU?

193
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,791
- THAT I CAN JUMP INTO
YOUR ARMS IN THERE.

194
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,875
- SIGN THIS BEFORE ENTERING.
- SIGN WHAT?

195
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,958
- LIABILITY WAIVER.
SUCH WAIVERS ARE OFTEN PREPARED

196
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,583
IN THESE TYPES OF DANGEROUS
SITUATIONS. JUST IN CASE.

197
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,916
- REALLY? SO THIS PLACE IS
ACTUALLY DANGEROUS?

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,583
AT LEAST THAT'LL
MAKE IT INTERESTING.

199
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,250
WHAT'S IT SAY?
WAIVER: I, YUUJI SAKAMOTO,

200
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,375
WILL LOVE SHOUKO KIRISHIMA
AS MY WIFE

201
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,166
AS LONG AS I LIVE AND WILL SHARE
MY JOYS AND SORROWS WITH HER.

202
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,000
SO I SWEAR?

203
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,500
- HERE'S A PEN.
- AND A REGISTERED SEAL.

204
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,750
- INK PAD TO STAMP IT WITH.

205
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,625
- WHAT THE HELL?
AM I THE ONLY ONE

206
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,583
WHO FINDS THIS
ENTIRE THING RIDICULOUS?

207
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,875
- UNDER THE CARBON SHEET
IS A SECOND SHEET,

208
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,583
YOUR MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM.

209
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,833
- HOW CONSIDERATE.
- NO, IT ISN'T!

210
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,750
- Shouko: BAKA AND TEST.

211
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,583
- PLEASE, COME THIS WAY.

212
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,125
- WOULD YOU MIND
HOLDING MY BAG FOR ME?

213
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,000
- MAKE SURE WHAT'S INSIDE
DOESN'T FALL OUT.

214
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,833
- AS YOU WISH.

215
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,875
WELL THEN, I HOPE YOU ENJOY
YOURSELVES

216
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,041
WHILST BEING
THOROUGHLY TERRIFIED.

217
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,083
( finger snaps )

218
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,500
- ( eerie music playing )

219
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,083
- SO THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
AN ABANDONED HOSPITAL?

220
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,541
I GUESS IT'S NOT
TOO BAD, CONSIDERING...

221
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,333
- Recorded voice: HIMEJI...

222
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,708
- WHAT'S THAT?
- THAN SHOUKO...

223
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,750
- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU.

224
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,541
- HIMEJI'S MORE THAN...

225
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,208
- WEIRD. IT'S LIKE SYNTHESIZED.

226
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,416
I WONDER
IF HIDEYOSHI'S DOING IT.

227
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,166
- WHATEVER. IT'S NOT
SCARY AT ALL.

228
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,208
- HIMEJI IS MORE MY TYPE
THAN SHOUKO.

229
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,000
- WAIT... WHAT?
- SHE'S GOT BIGGER BOOBIES, TOO.

230
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,083
HIMEJI IS MORE MY
TYPE THAN SHOUKO.

231
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,750
SHE'S GOT BIGGER BOOBIES, TOO.

232
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,666
HIMEJI'S MORE MY TYPE
THAN SHOUKO...

233
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,541
- YUUJI, IS THAT TRUE?

234
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,375
- OKAY, GUYS! VERY FUNNY!
YOU GOT ME. I'M SCARED.

235
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,000
- YUUJI, PREPARE YOURSELF.

236
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,208
- CRAP! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
SHE'S REALLY GONNA HURT ME!

237
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,333
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

238
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,416
- PLEASE CALM DOWN!
IT'S JUST A TRICK!

239
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,416
- ( girl screams )

240
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,125
- ( breathing heavily )

241
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,625
- HOW DID IT GO?

242
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,541
I BET THAT RIDE MADE YOU WANT
TO GET MARRIED, DIDN'T IT?

243
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,541
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'D WANT TO GET MARRIED?

244
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,583
- BECAUSE THEY SAY WHEN A MAN
AND A WOMAN FACE DANGER TOGETHER

245
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,541
THAT COUPLE FORMS
A SPECIAL BOND.

246
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,250
- THAT ONLY WORKS WHEN ONE
OF THEM ISN'T THE DANGER

247
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,583
THE OTHER ONE IS FACING!

248
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,375
- YUUJI, I THINK
IT'S LUNCHTIME.

249
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,166
- FINE. ALL THAT RUNNING AROUND
MADE ME HUNGRY ANYWAY.

250
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,708
- ( music on PA )

251
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,041
- Fukuhara on PA: UM, ATTENTION,
GUESTS, ATTENTION GUESTS.

252
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,625
WE'VE PREPARED A SPECIAL MENU
FOR THOSE WITH A VIP TICKET

253
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,458
AT THE RESTAURANT TODAY.

254
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:52,875
AND DURING LUNCH, A SPECIAL
PERFORMANCE WILL BE HELD.

255
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,458

256
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,541
- RIGHT THIS WAY.

257
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:58,916
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, SHOUKO?

258
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,583
- NOTHING. I'M JUST
REALLY HUNGRY.

259
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,666
- ME, TOO.

260
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,208
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

261
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,791
- I'M WITH YOU,
OF COURSE IT WAS.

262
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,166
- ( both gasp )

263
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,750
- GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

264
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,875
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO
OUR SPECIAL PERFORMANCE TODAY.

265

ABOUT GETTING MARRIED SOON!

268
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,708
- EXCUSE ME?

269
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,916
- IN THEIR HONOR, WE'VE ARRANGED
A GAME TO CELEBRATE THEIR UNION

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,583
AND TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT!

271
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,708
GET READY, EVERYONE,
BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR

272

273
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,208
- YAY! LET THE SHOW BEGIN!

274
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,708
- DAMN IT! THEY'VE LOCKED
THE EXIT!

275
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,625

FIVE QUESTIONS CORRECTLY,

276
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,166
THEY'LL BE ABLE

278
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,333
AND IF THEY WANT TO GO AHEAD
AND GET MARRIED AT THE TIME,

279
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,458
IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

280
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,625
- OH, IT'S A PROBLEM!

281
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,375
- WILL MISTER YUUJI SAKAMOTO
AND THE LOVELY MISS SHOUKO

282
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,666
PLEASE HEAD TOWARD THE STAGE?

283
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,083
- NO, WE WON'T!

284
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,375
- WEDDING EXPERIENCE?
WE WILL NOT FAIL.

285
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,416

286
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,541
- AREN'T YOU EXCITED?

287
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,750
- THIS BLOWS.

288
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,000
I HAVE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

289
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,583
- ALL RIGHT,
LET THE QUIZ BEGIN!

290
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,458
- OF COURSE! WE HAVE TO ANSWER
THE QUESTIONS CORRECTLY!

291
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,541
THIS WILL BE A PIECE OF CAKE
TO LOSE.

292
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,541
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GIVE
THE WRONG ANSWER!

293
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,083
- QUESTION NUMBER ONE!

294
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,291
- BRING IT ON! I'VE GOT
THIS THING IN THE BAG!

295
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,916
- WHEN IS MISTER YUUJI SAKAMOTO
AND MISS SHOUKO'S ANNIVERSARY?

296
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,125
- OKAY, I DON'T THINK I
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE ASKING.

297
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,333
- I KNOW.
IT IS EVERY DAY.

298
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:39,000
- CORRECT! EVERY DAY IS AN
ANNIVERSARY! GOOD JOB, LOVERS!

299
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,458
QUESTION NUMBER TWO!

300
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,041
- I'M GONNA GIVE THEM
SUCH A WRONG ANSWER,

301
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,583
THEY WON'T
KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM.

302
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,375
- TELL US WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TO HOLD YOUR WEDDING?

303
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,958
- ( beeping )
- MACKEREL COOKED IN MISO!

304
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,083
- THAT IS CORRECT!

305
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,375
- ( audience cheering )
- IS NOT!

306
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,833
- IS TO! YOU'VE PLANNED TO
HAVE YOUR UPCOMING WEDDING

307
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,541
HELD IN THE PHOENIX HALL WHICH
HAS RECENTLY BEEN NICKNAMED

308
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,416
"MACKEREL COOKED IN MISO"!

309
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,583
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

310
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,375
YOU JUST NICKNAMED IT
THAT, DIDN'T YOU?

311
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,875
- Akihisa: QUESTION
NUMBER THREE!

312
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,833
- NOW I GET WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

313
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,625
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
MAKE MY NEXT ANSWER WORK.

314
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,875
- WHERE DID YOU TWO
MEET THE FIRST TIME?

315
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,000
- I GOT IT!

316
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,708
( screams )

317
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,791
- GRADE SCHOOL.
- THAT'S CORRECT!

318
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,625
- FINE! I'LL GIVE UP BEFORE
THEY CAN EVEN ASK IT THIS TIME!

319
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,208
- AND NOW FOR QUESTION NUMBER
FOUR! THE TWO OF YOU...

320
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,833
- I DON'T KNOW!
- CORRECT.

321
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,333
- IT'S NO USE.

322
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,541
THEY WON'T LET MY ANSWERS BE
WRONG NO MATTER WHAT I DO.

323
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,333
THIS IS THE END FOR ME.

324
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,125
- HELLO! NOT FAIR!

325
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,583
WE ARE PLANNING TO GET MARRIED,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

326
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,750
WHY ARE THEY THE ONLY ONES

327
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,083
WHO GET THE SPECIAL FANCY
TREATMENT, HUH?

328
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,625
- YEAH. WE WANNA PLAY
YOUR STUPID GAME.

329
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,458
- LOOK, BURGER HEAD... I MEAN,
SIR, WE'RE NOT DONE YET.

330
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,333
- NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOU STUPID FOX.

331
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:58,083
I'M A CUSTOMER, TOO! YOU JERK!

332
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,125
- HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.
WE WANT A WEDDING THINGIE.

333
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,208
AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO HAVE IT, TOO!

334
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,416
- WELL, YEAH, BUT...

335
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,541
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT
"WELL, YEAH BUT" CRAP!

336
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,750
WE'RE GONNA DO IT,
SO JUST GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!

337
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,666
- OH MY GOD, YOU GUYS,
I'M SO SMART! I HAVE AN IDEA!

338
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,833
WHY DON'T WE ASK THE
LAST QUESTION.

339
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,416
IF THEY GET IT RIGHT, THEY WIN,

340
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,208
BUT IF THEY GET IT WRONG, WE DO!

341
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,916
- I DON'T THINK THAT'LL WORK.

342
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,833
- PERFECT! I KNOW I'LL BE
ABLE TO ANSWER THEM WRONG.

343
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,458
THEN I CAN FINALLY GET OUT OF
THIS WHOLE WEDDING NIGHTMARE!

344
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,583
- HEY!

345
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,250
- ALL RIGHT. LISTEN UP, KIDS,
HERE'S THE QUESTION!

346
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,208
WHAT'S THE CAPITOL CITY
OF EUROPE?

347
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,833
- ( all mumbling )

348
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,083
- CONGRATULATIONS! MISTER YUUJI
SAKAMOTO AND MISS SHOUKO HAVE

349
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,666
WON THE EXCLUSIVE

350
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,708

STARRING YUUJI AND SHOUKO!

352
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:00,083
- FIRST, LET'S WELCOME OUR GROOM
WITH A WARM ROUND OF APPLAUSE!

353
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,625
- ( audience cheering )

354
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,208
- YOU REALIZE I'M GONNA KNOCK
YOUR TEETH OUT FOR THIS.

355
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,208
- AND NEXT,
THE GROOMS PROFILE!

356
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,041
WE DON'T HAVE THIS PART READY
YET, SO WE'LL JUST SKIP IT.

357
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,625
- WHAT?

358
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,125
- FINALLY! WELCOME THE BRIDE AS
SHE MAKES HER GRAND ENTRANCE!

359
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,708
- ( mellow music playing )

360
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,416
- ( Yuuji gasps )

361
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,541
- SHE LOOKS SO PRETTY!

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,041
- UM, YUUJI?

363
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:49,833
TELL ME THE TRUTH. DO YOU REALLY
THINK THAT I LOOK LIKE A BRIDE?

364
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,666
- ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,
YOU LOOK PRETTY NICE.

365
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,583
I MEAN I'VE DEFINITELY SEEN
WORSE OUT THERE.

366
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,458
- YUUJI?
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

367
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,333
- I'M SO HAPPY.

368
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,208
- WAIT... DON'T CRY.

369
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,208
- THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

370
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,083
- A DREAM?

371
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,875
- I WANTED THIS SINCE...
SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

372
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,541
I PRAYED FOR THIS MOMENT.

373
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,458
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF BEING ABLE TO MARRY YOU.

374
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,416
I DREAMED THAT ONE DAY
I WOULD GET TO BE THE BRIDE

375
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,250
OF YUUJI SAKAMOTO.

376
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,041
I NEVER THOUGHT IT
WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

377
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
AND HERE WE ARE.

378
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,208
YOU AND I,
STANDING LIKE THIS TOGETHER.

379
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,166
I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

380
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,041
AFTER ALL, I'M HERE WITH YOU.

381
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,541
THIS DAY IS EVERYTHING
I'VE EVER HOPED FOR.

382
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,625
- SHOUKO, I...

383
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,416
- OH, MAN. THIS IS BORING!

384
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,708
- ( grunting )

385
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,916
- CAN SOMEONE DO SOMETHING
INTERESTING, PLEASE?

386
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,875
NO ONE CARES ABOUT
YOUR LOSER LOVE LIFE.

387
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,208
SO HURRY UP, SO WE CAN
GET THIS THING OVER WITH!

388
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,625
- YEAH, WE'VE GOT STUFF TO DO,
YOU KNOW.

389
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,083
ENOUGH WITH THE CHIT CHAT.

390
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,833
SHUT UP ALREADY AND GET
TO THE FREAKIN' POINT!

391
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,083
- DOES ANYONE ELSE
THINK IT'S WEIRD

392
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,583
THAT HER DREAM IS
TO BECOME A BRIDE?

393
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,416
I MEAN, WHAT,
SHE'S LIKE TWELVE, RIGHT?

394
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,583
- NOT TO BE RUDE,
BUT THAT IS WAY CREEPY.

395
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,166
- MAYBE WE'RE ON ONE OF THOSE
PRACTICAL JOKE SHOWS?

396
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,750
- ( both laughing )

397
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,166
- Girl: C'MON!
WHERE ARE THE CAMERAS?

398
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,208
- I DARE YOU TO SAY THAT AGAIN!
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

399
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,333
WHY DO YOU TWO
HAVE TO BE SO RUDE?

400
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,041
I THINK YOU BETTER GET OUT OF
HERE BEFORE I KICK YOU OUT. SO.

401
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,000
- WAIT, YOSHII!
- WHAT?

402
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,166
- YOU'RE ABOUT TO MESS UP
THE ENTIRE EVENT!

403
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,916
- BUT THEY... THEY WERE
SO MEAN TO SHOUKO.

404
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,541
-I CAN'T JUST DO NOTHING!

405
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,666
- Yuuji: SHOUKO...

406
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,166
- (people chattering )

407
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,750
- ( panting )

408
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,000
- Mizuki: YOSHII!
DID YOU SEE HER ANYWHERE?

409
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,541
- Akihisa: SHE DIDN'T
GO THIS WAY.

410
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,208
- Hideyoshi: YUUJI!

411
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,500
WHERE DID SHOUKO GO?
- Yuuji: I DON'T KNOW.

412
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,666
- WHY NOT?

413
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,750
- WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHERE
SHE MIGHT BE?

414
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,458
EVERYONE'S REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT HER.

415
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,916
- I'M NOT. I DON'T CARE.

416
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,500
- ( all gasping )

417
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,375
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

418
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,500
- Mizuki: YOU HAVE TO WHAT?

419
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,041
I HAVE TO PEE. SEE YA.

420
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,083
- THAT WEDDING WAS A JOKE.
TALK ABOUT TOTAL CRAP, RIGHT?

421
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,791
I MEAN LOOK AT THE COUPLE.

422
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,208
- OH, YUUJI, I'VE ALWAYS
DREAMED OF MARRYING YOU.

423
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,208
HOW'S THAT? SOUND LIKE HER?

424
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,458
- YEAH, YOU REALLY DO. THAT WAS
PERFECT. SHE WAS SO PATHETIC.

425
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,000
- ( both laughing )

426
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,333
- HEY, YOU TWO.

427
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,333
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT,
HIGH SCHOOL BOY?

428
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,208
- WELL, IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL, BUT...

429
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,500
- WHAT?

430
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,041
- I THINK THE THREE OF US
NEED TO HAVE A TALK!

431
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,583
- Yuuji: HEY.

432
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,875
I WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER
IF YOU'D SHOW UP.

433
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,625
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I FIGURED YOU'D COME HERE.

434
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,625
- YUUJI...
- WHAT IS IT?

435
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,000
- DO YOU THINK
MY DREAM IS WEIRD?

436
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,666
- SHOUKO, THERE'S SOMETHING
I REALLY NEED TO SAY.

437
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,708
YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL THE WAY
THAT YOU DO ABOUT ME.

438
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,833
IT'S A BIG MISTAKE.

439
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,250
SEVEN YEARS AGO, I WAS STUPID.

440
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,375
AND YOU GOT SUCKED INTO
ALL THAT.

441
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,125
I WAS ONLY EVER TRYING TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY, THAT'S ALL.

442
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,208
NOTHING ELSE.

443
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,750
ALL THIS TIME YOU'VE BEEN
WASTING YOUR DREAMS ON ME.

444
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,583
AND I KNOW I'M NOT WORTH IT.

445
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,416
- ( Shouko whimpers )

446
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,750
- BELIEVE ME. I'M REALLY SORRY.

447
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,833
- YUUJI, I...

448
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,541
- LISTEN TO ME. YOUR DREAM
IS NOTHING TO LAUGH AT!

449
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,083
YEAH, YOU MAY HAVE PICKED
THE WRONG GUY,

450
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,250
BUT I THINK CARING ABOUT SOMEONE
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME

451
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,250
IS A WONDERFUL THING.

452
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,250
WHAT YOU WANT IS AMAZING,
AND YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF IT.

453
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,166
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU
SO SPECIAL.

454
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,541
ALTHOUGH, YOU PROBABLY WANT TO
GO WITH THE RIGHT MAN NEXT TIME.

455
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,750
IT MIGHT WORK OUT BETTER.
( chuckles )
