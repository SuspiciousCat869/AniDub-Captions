1
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,041
- Fukuhara: MIZUKI HIMEJI
IS DILIGENT IN EVERY SUBJECT

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,666
SHE CHOOSES TO STUDY.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,125
FOR EXAMPLE, TODAY, SHE'S
STUDYING A SUBJECT

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,333
THAT'S NOT EVEN
COVERED IN SCHOOL.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,125
- HOW TO DELIVER A LOVE LETTER.

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,833
- THERE ARE MANY WAYS BUT IT'S
BEST TO GIVE IT IN PERSON.

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,500
THIS WAY THE PERSON KNOWS HOW
SERIOUS YOU ARE AND IT HELPS...

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,791
- HEY, HIMEJI. YOU STUDYING?

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,000
- ( exclaims ) YOSHII.

10
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,083
- YEAH, JUST A LITTLE
EXTRACURRICULAR RESEARCH.

11
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,541
HOLD ON.

12
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,416
THE BOOK SAID IT WAS BEST TO
GIVE IT TO HIM IN PERSON.

13
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,166
WELL... ACTUALLY...

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,375
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,958
PLEASE... NO MATTER WHAT YOU
THINK JUST DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

16
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,000
- ( glass shatters )

17
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,541
- Mizuki: ( screams )
WRONG ENVELOPE.

18
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,500
- HOW IS THIS FUNNY?

19
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,000
- ( theme song playing )

20
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,166
- Fukuhara: AKIHISA IS A YEAR 2,
CLASS F STUDENT.

21
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,375
THIS IS A NORMAL
MORNING FOR HIM.

22
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,083
- WAKE UP LITTLE BROTHER.
IT'S ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY.

23
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,208
- ( snarls ) JUST TEN
MORE MINUTES.

24
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,208
- THEN THERE'S NO
OTHER WAY TO DO THIS.

25
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,375
I'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU A
LITTLE GOOD MORNING KISS

26
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,958
TO GET YOUR BLOOD MOVING.

27
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,416
- ( gasps ) I'M UP. I'M UP.
LOOK AT ME, I'M UP.

28
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,916
- YES YOU ARE.
BUT WHY STOP NOW.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,291
I'M HERE. DON'T I DESERVE
A GOOD MORNING KISS, AKI?

30
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,750
- GET AWAY. I DON'T EVER
NEED MY SISTER'S KISSES.

31
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,416
- WELL, THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,166
I'M ONLY TRYING TO KEEP
OUR FAMILY CLOSE.

33
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,666
HURRY AND GET DRESSED.

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,583
I'VE GOT YOUR BREAKFAST READY.

35
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,708
- YOU MADE BREAKFAST? OKAY,
I MUST BE DREAMING THEN.

36
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,416
- NOW I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEANT.

37
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,625
- MEAL REPLACEMENT DRINKS
ARE VERY GOOD FOR YOU.

38
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,125
I THOUGHT I'D BUY YOU THESE

39
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,083
BECAUSE THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH
TIME TO COOK IN THE MORNING.

40
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,416
- IT'S NO BACON, EGGS AND TOAST

41
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,833
BUT IT SURE BEATS THE HECK
OUT OF SALTWATER, RIGHT?

42
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,166
- HAVING ENOUGH CALORIES
IN YOUR BODY IS VITAL.

43
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,208
ESPECIALLY FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

44
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,250
HOWEVER, WHEN THE EVENING
BEGINS TO APPROACH,

45
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,250
EATING SOMETHING LIGHT
IS SMART BECAUSE...

46
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,625
- IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

47
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,125
- THE AVERAGE MALE IS
SUPPOSED TO EAT

48
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,291
ABOUT 25 HUNDRED
CALORIES PER DAY.

49
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,333
I'VE COME TO THE DECISION
THAT IT WOULD BE BEST

50
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,000
TO GIVE YOU A THOUSAND
CALORIES FOR BREAKFAST,

51
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,541
A THOUSAND CALORIES FOR LUNCH

52
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,583
AND THE LAST FIVE
HUNDRED FOR DINNER.

53
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,208
EACH ONE OF THESE CANS
IS ONLY TWO HUNDRED CALORIES.

54
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,875
SO, I EXPECT YOU TO DRINK
FIVE FULL CANS FOR BREAKFAST.

55
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,541
- THAT'S LIKE WAY TOO MUCH.

56
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,083
- YOU GET THIRTEEN CANS A DAY.

57
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,125
IT'S REALLY JUST
A MATTER OF SIMPLE MATH.

58
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,875
YOU NEED TO STAY HEALTHY.

59
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,958
- THERE'S NO WAY I'LL BE
ABLE TO DRINK ALL THOSE.

60
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,375
- KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT.

61
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,875
SO, I BOUGHT ALL
THE FLAVORS THEY HAD

62
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,500
TO KEEP YOU FROM
GETTING BORED, AKI.

63
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,750
YOU'LL HAVE THE NORMAL ENTREE
WITH A SIDE OF CORN SOUP.

64
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,958
YOUR DRINK IS COFFEE AND YOU
CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN CAFE AU LAIT

65
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,416
OR CHOCOLATE FOR DESSERT.

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,250
- THINK YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE, SIS.

67
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,250
- I'M SORRY. SILLY OLD ME.

68
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,625
I FORGOT, YOU'RE GROWING.

69
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,083
THEREFORE YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED MORE

70
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,125
THAN THE AVERAGE
MALE'S DAILY INTAKE.

71
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,625
- PLEASE DON'T.
CAN'T DRINK, ANYMORE.

72
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:37,083
- Fukuhara: A GOOD MORNING
IS STILL IN THE FAR DISTANCE.

73
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,250
- SHE COULD AT LEAST HAVE THROWN
A COUPLE OF GRANOLA BARS

74
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,583
INTO THE MIX.

75
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,541
- WHATCHA DOING MAN?
BIRD WATCHING?

76
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,125
- I'M TAKING MEASUREMENTS.

77
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,375
- MEASUREMENTS?

78
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,916
- I'M RECORDING THE STATS
ON BUST SIZES IN THIS ACADEMY.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,708
A STANDARD A CUP IS TEN
CENTIMETERS FROM SUMMIT TO BASE.

80
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:03,125
ADD 2.5 CENTIMETERS
AND YOU'RE A, B, C OR D.

81
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,500
B, C, A.

82
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:08,791
A, B, D, B, B, C. B, A.
YES, A G. D, A, B, A.

83
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,416
- I THOUGHT THOSE
LAST TWO WERE D'S.

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,000
- SILICONE DOESN'T COUNT,
OF COURSE.

85
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,708
- WOW, THAT'S A GOOD EYE, MAN.

86
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,416
OH, LOOK AT THOSE
POOR LITTLE FELLAS.

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,916
DO YOU
STOP AT 'A' CUP?

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,541
- NOT AT ALL. AS WE GO FROM
SMALL TO NEARLY CONCAVE

89
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,666
BY TWO POINT FIVE CENTIMETERS
YOU GET YOUR DOUBLE A, TRIPLE A.

90
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,000
- I SEE. SO, IF IT'S COMPLETELY
FLAT LIKE THE ONE WE JUST SAW

91
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,416
IT COULD BE RATED
AS LOW AS FIVE A'S

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,125
OR EVEN GET A-BROKEN SPINE
AND CRUSHED PELVIS

93
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,291
WHICH DON'T GET ANY RATINGS.

94
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,791
( screams )

95
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,500
- FLAT CHESTED WOMEN OF THE
WORLD UNITE AND TAKE OVER.

96
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,208
- I'M SORRY, YUUJI, BUT
YOU CANNOT WATCH THAT.

97
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,875
- A LITTLE MORE.
THERE YOU GO.

98
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,791
( gasps )

99
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,666
- ( screams )
I GIVE UP.

100
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,375
- ( screaming )

101
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,291
- NOT THE MERRY-GO-ROUND.

102
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,958
- YOU GUYS ARE LIVELY, AS USUAL.

103
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,666
- ( groaning )

104
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,458
-WHY THE NURSE'S CLOTHES?
I GET IT.

105
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,083
YOU'RE HERE TO TAKE
CARE OF ME, AREN'T YOU?

106
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,166
- IT'S MY COSTUME
FOR THE DRAMA CLUB.

107
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,958
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR A MALE NURSE.

108
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,583
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE

109
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,041
FOR A WOMAN WHEN I PUT IT ON.

110
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,625
- HOLD ON, THAT SHOULD
READ NURSE, NOT MALE NURSE.

111
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,833
- YOU SURE? I GUESS IT'S
POSSIBLE I MISREAD THE SCRIPT.

112
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,000
AND THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY

113
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,041
THE UNDERWEAR THEY
PROVIDED HAD LACE.

114
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,583
- WHAT?

115
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,875
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE
TOP UNSNAPS IN THE FRONT.

116
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,250
- PATHETIC. THIS IS JUST SAD.

117
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,541
- YEAH, HOW EMBARRASSING.

118
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,208
- HUH?
- HMM?

119
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,541
- Hideyoshi: IT'S MY SISTER.

120
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,458
- PULL IT TOGETHER, HIDEYOSHI.

121
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,791
IF YOU ACT LIKE A TOTAL FREAK,

122
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,333
PEOPLE CAN'T HELP THINKING YOUR
SISTER IS ONE TOO.

123
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,416
- HEY, I'M NOT ACTING
LIKE A FREAK.

124
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,541
- DID I SAY FREAK?
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY

125
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,500
WAS MY STUPID BROTHER
IS A CLASS F DORK.

126
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,250
WHICH IS FINE, SINCE YOU
ACTUALLY LIKE THESE GUYS.

127
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,208
- HOW CAN YOU LIVE
WITH YOURSELVES?

128
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,500
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT.

129
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,166
- YOU SHOULD REALLY
WATCH WHAT YOU SAY.

130
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,208
- WHAT? YOU CAN'T
HANDLE THE TRUTH?

131
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,208
OR DID YOU GUYS
ALL GROW BRAINS OVERNIGHT?

132
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,916
- ( all gasp )

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,708
- Yuuko: THIS IS A SCHOOL.

134
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,750
STOP WASTING ALL YOUR TIME
FIGHTING AND PLAYING DRESS UP.

135
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,916
LET'S GO, REP.

136
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,083
- Fukuhara: MEANWHILE,

137
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,000
MIZUKI CONTINUED HER IMPORTANT
EXTRA-CURRICULAR RESEARCH.

138
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,000
- HOW TO DELIVER A LOVE LETTER.

139
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,375
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE
TO GIVE IT IN PERSON,

140
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,333
SIMPLY ASK
A CLOSE FRIEND TO HELP .

141
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,708
CLOSE FRIEND...
I GET IT. I THINK.

142
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,916
- HEY, MINAMI.
- WHAT IS IT, MIZUKI?

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,166
- I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
HELP ME WITH YOSHII.

144
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,833
- NO WAY. DON'T TELL ME
YOU ARE TOO?

145
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,583
- ( gasps ) YES WAY.
WHAT'D YOU WRITE?

146
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,250
- I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU
HAVE MY MISSING ONES?

147
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,875
- MAYBE IT'D WORK BETTER

148
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,000
IF I ASKED ONE OF YOSHII'S
CLOSE FRIENDS

149
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,875
INSTEAD OF ONE OF MINE.

150
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,750
- HEY, YUUJI.
- WHAT'S UP, HIMEJI?

151
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,125
- I WONDERED IF YOU
WOULD DO ME A FAVOR.

152
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,166
- FAVOR?
- I HAVE... A LOVE LETTER.

153
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,916
- WA... WAIT, SHOUKO.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,583
HOW IS ANY OF THIS MY FAULT?

155
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,541
- LOOK AT THIS. YOU'RE MINE.

156
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,375
- ( yells ) A MARRIAGE
REGISTRATION?

157
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,208
NO, GET IT AWAY FROM ME.

158
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,541
I'LL NEVER SIGN IT.
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.

159
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,291
( screams )

160
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,375
- IF YOU FIND IT HARD TO GIVE
THE LOVE LETTER ALL BY ITSELF,

161
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,333
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SPICE
IT UP WITH A GIFT.

162
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,750
HEY, YOSHII.

163
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,166
- WHAT IS IT, HIMEJI?

164
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,083
- IT'S NOTHING.

165
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,458
I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE
YOU A PRESENT

166
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,666
SO I BAKED SOMETHING
THIS MORNING.

167
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,375
IT'S COOKIES.

168
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,166
THEY'RE CHOCOLATE CHIP
WITH RAI...

169
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,750
OH, DEAR. WHERE'D HE GO?

170
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,375
YOSHII. WHERE ARE YOU?

171
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,750
YOSHII, I BAKED THESE COOKIES
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU.

172
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,500
- THIS IS MY HIDING PLACE.
- SHH.

173
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,208
- DON'T MAKE A SOUND. IF SHE
FINDS US, WE'RE BOTH DEAD.

174
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,416
- HAVING FUN PLAYING
YOUR STUPID GAMES, YOSHII?

175
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,708
- Both: IRON MAN.

176
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,291
- GOOD TIMING. NOW, YOU
CAN MOVE STUFF FOR ME.

177
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,291
- ( yells ) WHAT?

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,875
- IT'S ALSO OKAY TO SECRETLY
HIDE IT IN THEIR BAG

179
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,500
OR SLIP IT IN THEIR LOCKER.

180
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,916
IT WILL MAKE YOU
APPEAR SHY

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,208
AND THAT CAN INCREASE THE
ATTRACTION HE HAS TO YOU.

182
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,708
WHY DIDN'T I JUST DO THIS
AT THE VERY BEGINNING?

183
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,291
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING, MIZUKI?

184
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,708
- NOTHING.

185
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,708
- WHAT'S THAT?

186
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,625
- Both: IT'S PORN!

187
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,166
- YUUJI, WHERE ARE YOU?

188
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,250
- CLOSE ONE. IF SHE EVER MAKES
ME SIGN HER DEMON CONTRACT,

189
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,625
ALL WILL BE LOST.

190
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,208
- Kouta: MY WORK HERE
IS FINISHED.

191
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:48,041
THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FUMIZUKI
BOOBS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

192
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,333
- ( sighs ) NOT FAIR.

193
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,333
I DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE
TO PUT IT IN HIS STUPID LOCKER.

194
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,125
WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?
THIS ISN'T MY LETTER.

195
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,875
ALTHOUGH THESE
ARE KINDA PRETTY.

196
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,500
WAIT A MINUTE...
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY LOVE LETTER?

197
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,958
DID I DROP IT
SOMEWHERE EARLIER?

198
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,708
- ( grunting )

199
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,166
- THIS BLOWS, MAN. WHY AM I THE
ONLY ONE WHO HAS TO DO THIS?

200
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,375
- (screams )
AVATAR. OW.

201
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,750
- WHAT'S THIS?

202
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,375
IT LOOKS LIKE...

203
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,958
WAIT, THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS
FOR THE NEXT EXAM.

204
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,916
HEY, IF I STUDY THESE...

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,708
AND MEMORIZE ALL
THE QUESTIONS HERE,

206
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,166
EVEN I COULD GET A GOOD GRADE.

207
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,083
JUST KIDDING.
THAT WOULD BE CHEATING.

208
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,541
PEOPLE WILL TOTALLY KNOW
SOMETHING'S UP

209
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,916
IF I START GETTING GOOD
GRADES SUDDENLY.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,166
( sighs )

211
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,500
- THE BOXES ARE
ALL JACKED UP.

212
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,416
CRAP, I'M BUSTED.

213
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,166
MAYBE I CAN SWAP THEM OUT WITH
THE BOXES FROM THE CLASSROOM.

214
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,041
I'M FINISHED WITH THE STUFF.

215
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,375
- SAY GOODBYE TO THOSE FOR NOW

216
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,833
BUT I'D START GETTING
READY TO SEE

217
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,333
THEM AGAIN ON THE UPCOMING
PREP TEST.

218
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,958
- Akihisa: YAY, TESTS.

219
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,833
- THERE IT IS.

220
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,166
THOUGHT I'D LOST IT.
THANK GOODNESS.

221
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,666
A DELIVERY SLIP?

222
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,583
HUH?

223
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,000
( screams )

224
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,458
- Announcer: BAKA AND TEST.

225
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,791
- WHAT'S WRONG, HIMEJI?
YOU LOOK REALLY BUMMED OUT.

226
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,541
- OH, IT'S NOTHING. I...

227
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,625
WELL... I...

228
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,541
- WHAT IS IT? IF YOU NEED ME
TO HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING

229
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,375
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK.

230
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,583
- YOSHII?

231
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,000
HELP ME.

232
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,666
- All: IT'S GONE.

233
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,708
- WHERE'S THAT STUPID MARRIAGE
PAPER? I LEFT IT RIGHT HERE.

234
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,750
- MY FUMIZUKI BOOBIES LIST THAT
I BUSTED MY BUTT ON, IS GONE.

235
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,083
- THAT COLLECTION OF PICTURES
TOOK ME YEARS TO BUILD UP.

236
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,083
- MY NURSE COSTUME, WHERE IS IT?

237
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,333
- HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TO ME?

238
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,958
I LOCKED IT. I HAD SO MANY
SECURITY MEASURES.

239
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,750
WHOEVER DID THIS
MUST BE A PROFESSIONAL.

240
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,083
- SAW IRON MAN EARLIER.

241
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,625
PRETTY SURE HE TOOK SOME BOXES
DOWN TO THE SAFE.

242
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,958
- All: HOLY CRAP.
AND WHAT?

243
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,583
- YOU LOST
AN IMPORTANT ENVELOPE?

244
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,791
WAIT, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHERE YOU DROPPED IT?

245
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,208
- I THOUGHT I DID, BUT WHEN
I CHECKED I ONLY FOUND THIS.

246
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,625
- IT'S A SLIP FROM
THE BOX OF PREP TESTS.

247
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,541
THAT MUST MEAN WHEN
I DROPPED THE EXAM PAPERS...

248
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,041
IT MUST HAVE GOTTEN MIXED
IN WITH THEM.

249
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,375
NOW, THEY'RE
ALL LOCKED IN THE SAFE

250
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,750
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY
DO THAT TO KEEP US OUT.

251
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,000
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

252
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,208
- CALL FOR BACK-UP.

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,458
- WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

254
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,125
- THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE HERE
FOR, YOU JUST GOTTA ASK.

255
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,833
- GOOD SUPPORT SYSTEMS
ARE FUNDAMENTAL.

256
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,500
- YUUJI, YOU GUYS.

257
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,208
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH SOMETHING IMPORTANT

258
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,625
TRAPPED BEHIND
SIX INCHES OF COLD STEEL.

259
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,000
- THIS MAY SEEM A TAD OVER
DRAMATIC FOR A COSTUME.

260
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,041
- MY BOOBY LIST
IS LIKE MY FAMILY.

261
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,333
- WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM
ALL BACK NO MATTER WHAT.

262
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,541
- YEAH, WE ARE.

263
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,000
- YOU GUYS, THANK YOU.

264
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,375
- WHEN WE HAVE ONE GOAL,

265
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,000
- All: NOTHING CAN STOP US.

266
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,958
- Fukuhara: THEIR GOALS WERE
ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT.

267
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,041
- WHO KNEW, THEY REALLY
DO HAVE BIG ROUND DOORS.

268
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,333
- Akihisa: A KEY AND A SECRET
CODE ARE NEEDED TO OPEN IT.

269
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,458
- I WISH IT WOULD OPEN WITH JUST
A KEY OR JUST A SECRET CODE.

270
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,125
- THAT'S LIKE TWO THINGS
AT THE SAME TIME.

271
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,916
- I SAY, WE GET AKI'S AVATAR
TO RIP THAT BIG ROUND DOOR OFF.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,166
- I'LL BE THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS
KICKED OUT IF WE DO THAT.

273
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,625
- HOLD PLEASE. I HAVE
AN IDEA FORMING.

274
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,166
- All: WHAT DO WE DO?

275
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,166
- IN THE DRAMA CLUB'S
PRODUCTION OF TOP HAT BAT THIEF,

276
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,041
A THIEF DEVISED
THIS CLEVER DECEPTION

277
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,750
TO GAIN ACCESS TO A VAULT.

278
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,916
- All: WHOA.

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,458
- HOW DID HE DO IT?

280
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,500
- Hideyoshi: HE TOOK THE TIME
TO PREPARE A DECOY TREASURE.

281
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,000
THEN HE SHOWED THE
FAKE TO THE OWNER

282
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,041
AND TOLD THEM THAT HE STOLE IT.

283
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:24,208
THE OWNER COMPLETELY FREAKED OUT
AND OPENED THE SAFE TO CHECK IT.

284
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,875
WHEN HE OPENED THE SAFE,
HE STOLE THE TREASURE FOR REAL.

285
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,166
- THAT'S AMAZING.
- YOUR THIEF WAS SO SMART.

286
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,791
- CAN I BE THE ONE
WITH THE TOP HAT?

287
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,708
- OKAY. LET'S USE THE PLAN
FROM THE DRAMA CLUB.

288
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,208
- All: YEAH.

289
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,375
- ( laughs ) IRON MAN, WOULD
YOU LOOK AT THIS RIGHT HERE?

290
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,791
IT'S THE PREP TEST
FROM THE SAFE.

291
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,041
- WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT?
- WHAT?

292
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,416
- HMM.

293
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,625
- HOLD ON.

294
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,875
DON'T YOU WANT TO
GO OPEN THE SAFE

295
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,375
AND DOUBLE CHECK TO MAKE SURE?

296
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,750
- WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO DO THAT

297
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,750
WHEN YOU'RE STANDING RIGHT IN
FRONT OF ME, GENIUS?

298
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,791
- OH, YEAH. RIGHT...
WELL, CRAP.

299
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,000
IT DIDN'T WORK.

300
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,750
- WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY
PROBLEMS IN THE PLAY.

301
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,083
- I WONDER WHAT WAS DIFFERENT.

302
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,666
- COSTUMES?

303
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,666
- GUESS WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO CRACK THIS BABY OURSELVES.

304
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,541
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN. A SECRET
CODE AND A STUPID KEY?

305
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,333
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

306
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,041
- PERHAPS, I SHOULD OFFER
YOU MY ASSISTANCE.

307
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,083
- All: WHAT?

308
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,750
- WHO ARE YOU?

309
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,875
- Fukuhara: KYOUJI NEMOTO. HE
IS THE REP FOR YEAR 2, CLASS B.

310
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,541
- ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
OPEN A LITTLE SAFE.

311
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,250
I THINK WE CAN HANDLE THAT.

312
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,458
- YOU THINK?

313
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,333
- YOU'LL NOTICE THAT I SAID
"WE" THERE.

314
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,375
YOU GUYS GET THE KEY,
I'LL HANDLE THE CODE.

315
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,916
IT'LL BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,041
- All: REALLY?

317
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,958
- YEAH, I PROMISE.

318
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,208
WE HAVE TO COUNT ON OUR FRIENDS
IN TIMES OF NEED, RIGHT?

319
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,250
- NEMOTO IS TOTALLY AWESOME.

320
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,458
- WHERE IS IT?
- THAT'S THE ONE.

321
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,875
- THE KEY TO THE SAFE
IS OVER THERE?

322
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,000
- NO WAY. IT'S RIGHT
BEHIND IRON MAN?

323
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,083
- WHAT DO WE DO?
- THIS IS HOPELESS.

324
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,666
- OKAY, SOMEONE HAS TO
CREATE A DIVERSION FOR US.

325
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,375
- BY DOING WHAT?

326
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,708
- A REALLY HOT CHICK WOULD BE
THE PERFECT DISTRACTION FOR HIM.

327
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,583
WE'D HAVE NO PROBLEM
SNAGGING THE KEYS.

328
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,166
- HIDEYOSHI IS
THE PERFECT HOT CHICK.

329
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,666
- WHY MAKE ME DO IT?

330
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,791
- WE COULDN'T LET HIMEJI RISK
GOING IN THERE BY HERSELF

331
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,458
AND MINAMI DOESN'T HAVE
THE HOTNESS OF A BROKEN SPINE.

332
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,375
- ( screams )

333
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,250
- WHO DOESN'T HAVE
ANY HOTNESS?

334
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,500
- WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?

335
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,208
- THIS IS OUR NEW ROUTINE
FOR DANCE CLASS.

336
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,083
IT'S CALLED ANGRY TROLL,
SHE CRACKS MY SPINE.

337
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,958
- ( screams )

338
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,125
- I COULD FEEL HIS
FINGERS IN MY BRAIN.

339
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,375
- YOUR SIGHT SHOULD
COME BACK SOON.

340
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,666
- BECAUSE OF YOUR PAIN,
I GOT THE KEY.

341
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,166
- GOOD JOB. IT WENT EXACTLY
AS WE PLANNED, KOUTA.

342
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,166
- SO, I WAS THE DECOY?

343
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,333
- ( beeps )

344
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,541
- OKAY. IT'S UNLOCKED.

345
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,208
- NOW, ALL WE NEED
IS THE SECRET CODE.

346
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,791
- TRY NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING.

347
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,208
THESE ALARMS ARE VERY SENSITIVE
AND COULD STILL GO OFF.

348
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,833
- OKAY, SUPER THIEF.
- IT'S ALL YOU THEN.

349
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,083
- CHECK THIS OUT.
- All: NO WAY.

350
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,083
- A SWEET CAMERA.

351
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,875
- I RECORDED IRON
MAN OPENING IT.

352
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,750
- WE CAN SEE ALL THE NUMBERS
HE PRESSED.

353
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,000
- THAT'S RIGHT.

354
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,458
WE'VE GOT THE SECRET CODE THAT'S
JUST FOR TODAY.

355
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,208
- ( all gasp )

356
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,166
- Kouta: I FOUND IT.

357
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,458
- THEY'RE ALL HERE.
I'VE GOT MY PICTURES.

358
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,166
- YOU CAN'T GET ME NOW.

359
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,791
I BETTER FIND SOME
PLACE TO BURY THIS.

360
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,083
- HERE'S MY LETTER.

361
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,791
- I TOLD YOU WE'D
FIND IT, HIMEJI.

362
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,583
- YEAH. AND IT'S ALL
THANKS TO YOU.

363
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:14,041
THANK YOU. YOU SAVED ME, YOSHII.

364
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,291
- ( laughs )

365
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,500
- YES. MY NURSE
COSTUME'S INTACT.

366
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,875
- AND A BRA.

367
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,958
- FRONT HOOK.
IT WOULD POP RIGHT OPEN.

368
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,166
- ( both exclaim )

369
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,500
-I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT THOSE LOOKED LIKE.

370
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,833
- YOU SERIOUS?

371
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,500
MIZUKI, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
A FRONT HOOK BRA BEFORE?

372
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,541
- STORES DON'T HAVE IT
IN MY SIZE.

373
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,875
APPARENTLY, CLASPS AREN'T
STRONG ENOUGH FOR ME.

374
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,458
- ( screams )

375
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,375
- THAT'S SO NOT TRUE. THOSE
THINGS ARE LIKE STEEL TRAPS.

376
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,333
FRONT HOOKS AREN'T JUST MADE
FOR THOSE FLAT CHESTS.

377
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,125
WHO SAID THAT?

378
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,458
- Both: STRONG ENOUGH?

379
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,458
- JACKPOT.

380
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,291
-WHAT'RE YOU DOING, NEMOTO?

381
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,708
- NOTHING. JUST
A LITTLE RESEARCH.

382
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,458
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE RESEARCH.
- YOU'RE JUST A CHEATER.

383
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,458
- DON'T TRY TO GET RIGHTEOUS
WITH ME.

384
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,375
WE'RE IN THIS
TOGETHER NOW.

385
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,541
YOU HELPED BREAK
INTO THE SAFE

386
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,500
WHERE THE EXAMS WERE BEING
KEPT, REMEMBER?

387
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,041
IF THEY WERE TO
EVER FIND THAT OUT,

388
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,916
YOU'D BE IN AS MUCH
TROUBLE AS ME.

389
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,083
- BUT WE... DIDN'T WANT THIS.

390
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,083
WE JUST TRYING TO GET
OUR STUFF BACK.

391
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,875
- DO YOU REALLY THINK ANY
TEACHER'S GOING TO BELIEVE THAT?

392
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,458
HONESTLY, A COUPLE
OF MONTHS IN CLASS F

393
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,541
AND ALL READY YOU'RE NEARLY
AS STUPID AS THEM.

394
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,666
THIS WORLD ONLY CARES
ABOUT WINNING. THAT'S ALL.

395
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,416
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW YOU GET THERE.

396
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,125
- YOU CAN'T... NO.

397
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,791
-THE ONLY THING I HAVE
TO DO IS ANSWER THESE

398
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,833
QUESTIONS CORRECTLY
THE DAY OF THE TEST.

399
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,250
IF I CAN DO THAT, THEN
I PROVE I'M SMART.

400
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,041
I STILL HAVE TO MEMORIZE
ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS

401
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,625
EVEN IF I KNOW THE QUESTIONS.

402
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,125
- YOU'RE KIND OF A JERK.

403
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,791
- ONLY A MORON WOULD SKIP
THIS PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

404
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,208
BUT THAT'S WHY
YOU GUYS ARE IDIOTS.

405
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,291
- ( all gasp )

406
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,416
- AM I REALLY HURTING ANYONE

407
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,541
BY IMPROVING MY SCORES
A LITTLE BIT?

408
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,625
AND WHO GETS ANYTHING

409
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,791
FROM A POINTLESS ACT OF
HONESTY, REALLY?

410
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,041
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS
CORRECTLY

411
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,875
AND MAYBE YOU COULD MAKE IT
OUT OF CLASS F.

412
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,708
I CAN SEE NOW THAT IT'S NOT ONLY
YOUR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE

413
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,666
THAT'S DEFECTIVE BUT MOST LIKELY
YOUR VERY BRAINS THEMSELVES,

414
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,291
YOU WORTHLESS CLASS OF NITWITS.

415
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,708
- YOU'RE A NITWIT.

416
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,666
- HIMEJI...

417
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,458
- TRUE, CLASS F'S ACADEMIC
PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE GOOD,

418
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,000
BUT...

419
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,250
BUT THEY'VE ALL
GOT KIND HEARTS.

420
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,791
THEY'RE CONSIDERATE. SO, I
GUESS MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

421
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,750
THEY'LL NEVER BE LIKE YOU.

422
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,041
- WOW, HIMEJI...

423
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,875
- YOU BETTER THINK TWICE BEFORE
YOU TALK ABOUT MY CLASS

424
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,666
THAT WAY AGAIN.

425
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,833
- ( chuckles ) HOW TOUCHING.

426
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,416
ANYWAY, DON'T FORGET
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER...

427
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,791
IF I'M CAUGHT THEN SO ARE YOU.

428
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,750
CALL IT THE ONE THING
WE HAVE IN COMMON, GET IT?

429
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,583
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING
IN HERE AND TO BE QUITE FRANK,

430
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,083
I DON'T CARE.

431
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,041
LET'S JUST PRETEND THIS WHOLE
THING NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.

432
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,500
WE WERE NEVER HERE.

433
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,875
TIME TO WISE UP,
SIMPLETONS.

434
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,541
HOPE YOU ALL HAVE
A WONDERFUL DAY.

435
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,541
- ( laughs )

436
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,208
- YUUJI, DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE'RE STUPID LIKE HE SAID?

437
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,708
- DUDE, WITHOUT A DOUBT.

438
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,708
WE'RE ALL EXTRA CRISPY
SUNDRIED BONEHEADS.

439
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,000
- YEAH, I GUESS.

440
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,416
- YOU'RE JUST MAD.
HE GOT US GOOD.

441
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,208
- I DON'T CARE IF SOMEONE
MAKES A FOOL OF ME. BUT...

442
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,916
TALKS SMACK ABOUT MY FRIENDS
AND THAT'S GOING TO PISS ME OFF.

443
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,291
- HIMEJI SHOULD TOTALLY BE
STUDYING WITH CLASS A RIGHT NOW

444
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,541
BUT SHE GOT STUCK
IN F BECAUSE OF LUCK.

445
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,291
IT ISN'T HER FAULT
SHE WAS THROWN IN

446
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,041
WITH THE LOSERS AND
REJECTS OF THE ACADEMY.

447
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,541
SO, THERE'S NO REASON
FOR HIM TO BE SUCH JERK.

448
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,333
WHY TRY TO MAKE HER
FEEL ASHAMED OF IT?

449
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,291
- IF YOU'RE THAT UPSET, GUESS
TWO OF US SHOULD DO SOMETHING.

450
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,666
- WHAT?

451
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,500
- IT'S ALMOST BEEN THREE
MONTHS SINCE OUR LOSS.

452
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,791
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,

453
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,250
WE'LL BE ABLE TO DECLARE WAR
AGAIN, SOUND GOOD?

454
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,875
WE GOT OUR BUTTS HANDED
TO US LAST TIME WE TRIED.

455
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,250
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE I DIDN'T
THINK THINGS THROUGH.

456
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,375
- I'M SORRY.
- YUUJI...

457
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,083
- BUT IT'S BECAUSE WE GOT SO
CLOSE THAT I KNOW WE CAN DO IT.

458
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,375
I'M NOT GOING TO SCREW UP
LIKE THAT EVER AGAIN.

459
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,916
I KNOW WE'RE READY THIS TIME.
LET'S GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT.

460
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,416
WHAT DO YOU SAY, MAN?

461
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,166
- ( chuckles ) IT'S PRETTY
OBVIOUS. I SAY WE DO IT.

462
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,583
THIS TIME WE'LL WIN.

463
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,916
THEN WE'LL SHOW THEM
THAT WE'RE NO ORDINARY IDIOTS.

464
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
LET'S GO. IT'S SUMMONER
TEST WAR TIME.

465
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,375
- YEAH. I SAY WE GO
AND EVEN THE SCORE.

466
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,125
- FIRST THING'S FIRST.

467
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,125
- I SHOULD GO GET
HIMEJI'S COOKIES.

468
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,708
- GOOD IDEA.

469
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,500
WHY SHOULD WE BE THE ONLY ONES
WHO RISK OUR LIVES ON HER FOOD?

470
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,750
- AWAKEN.

471
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,958
I'M SUMMONING
MY AVATAR... SUMMON.

472
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,833
- ( both laugh )

473
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,750
- Minami: WHAT'S THIS?

474
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,583
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE PREP TEST
FROM THE SAFE. THAT'S WEIRD.

475
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,833
- ( all gasps )

476
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,333
- ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
MEMORIZE THE QUESTIONS

477
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,958
AND I'LL GET A PERFECT SCORE.

478
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,333
- ( girls cheering )

479
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,750
- WOW, LOOK AT ALL
THOSE BRAINLESS GEEKS.

480
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,500
- THEY'LL NEVER PUT ANY OF THESE
QUESTIONS ON THE TEST NOW.

481
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,916
- SOMETHING TELLS ME WE MIGHT
KNOW THE GUYS BEHIND THIS.

482
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,041
- THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

483
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,958
- YOSHII!. YUUJI! WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

484
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,625
- WE'RE SORRY.

485
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,416
- EXPLAIN RIGHT NOW.
WHY'D YOU TWO DO THIS?

486
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,125
- IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PRANK.
- I GUESS WE WENT TOO FAR.

487
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,875
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

488
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:30,083
- Both: LOOK, SERIOUSLY.
WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

489
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,541
- HMM. YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH, HUH?

490
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,500
- WE DID. IT WAS A PRANK.

491
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,958
- OH, C'MON.

492
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,708
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE NEVER
APOLOGIZED LIKE THIS BEFORE.

493
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,875
OKAY THEN. YOU'RE BOTH GETTING
THE DEMON'S REMEDIAL CLASS.

494
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,583
- ( both screams )

495
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,916
- SUCK IT UP. I'M REWORKING
ALL MY LESSONS FOR YOU TWO.

496
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,500
THIS PRANK IS GONNA HURT.

497
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,875
- ( both chuckle )

498
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,416
- Both: YES, SIR.

499
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,541
- ( theme song playing )

500
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,333
- OH, WHAT'S THIS?
SOME GIRL GAVE ME COOKIES.

501
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,416
QUITE THE CHICK
MAGNET, AREN'T I?

502
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,625
THINK I BETTER EAT THEM BEFORE
YUUKA FINDS OUT I HAVE THESE.

503
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:51,791
- Fukuhara: THAT'S THE SOUND
OF HIS SOUL BEING TAKEN AWAY.

504
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,166
- QUESTION 11.

505
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,083
WHAT TACTIC DID THE GERMANS USE
DURING WORLD WAR II

506
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,833
THAT WAS A COMBINATION OF
BOMBING AND ARMORED DIVISIONS?

507
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:01,541
- LET'S GO FULL BLAST.
- PLEASE VALUE YOUR LIFE.

508
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,625
- NEXT TIME. RIVALS,
LOVE LETTERS, AND BLITZ TACTICS.

509
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,250
- THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
