1
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,375
- C'MON! JUST LET ME SEE IT!
- STOP!

2
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,041
- JERK. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS?

3
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,083
- Minami: YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE ALL CREEPY ABOUT IT,

4
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,166
IF YOU WANTED TO SEE,
YOU COULD'VE JUST ASKED.

5
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,875
- ACTUALLY IT'S FUNNY, I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A PICTURE OF HIDEYOSHI!

6
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,625
YOU TWO LOOK SO MUCH A LIKE.
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CRUSH MY...

7
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,041
- TAKE IT BACK.

8
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,125
I SAID TAKE IT BACK!
ACKNOWLEDGE MY HOTNESS!

9
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,083
- THIS IS ABUSE! PEOPLE GO
TO JAIL FOR THIS, YOU KNOW!

10
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,041
- Minami: MR. NISHIMURA! MAY
WE HAVE YOUR PERMISSION

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,916
TO FIGHT A PRACTICE
ST WAR? PLEASE?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,333
- Nishimura: YES! I APPROVE!

13
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,541
- SUMMONING AVATAR. SUMMON!

14
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,708
- SUMMONING AVATAR. SUMMON!

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,291
REALLY? SUMMON! I'M SUMMONING!
SUMMON! SUMMON!

16
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,708
I SAID, SUMMON!

17
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,916
OKAY, THAT WAS WEIRD.
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN. SUMMON!

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,375
SUMMON! SUMMON! SUMMON

19
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:34,916
( shouts ) SUMMON!

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,958
- Nishimura: APPROVAL SUSPENDED!

21
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,333
THE... THE FIELD'S
OUT OF CONTROL!

22
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,083
- ( clamoring )

23
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,916
- ( theme song playing )

24
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,333
- Fukuhara: PROBLEMS ALWAYS
SEEM TO OCCUR

25
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,416
WHEN WE LEAST EXPECT THEM.

26
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,250
- Kouta: YOU READY?

27
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,666
WHAT'S THE SECRET PASS CODE?
- MAKES ME TOO FRISKY.

28
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,083
- OKAY.

29
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,333
- Akihisa: WHERE IS IT?
- HAND OVER THE CASH FIRST.

30
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,416
- Akihisa: OH! THERE'S HIDEYOSHI
AS A CUTE LITTLE WAITRESS!

31
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,541
HE MAKES LIFE SO DELICIOUS!

32
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,166
- Kouta: ( laughs )
I'VE GOT MORE IF YOU WANT.

33
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,916
HOW ABOUT A LOCKER ROOM SHOT?
COST YOU TWICE AS MUCH, THOUGH.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,708
- ( exclaims ) DUDE, COME ON.
GIVE ME A DISCOUNT?

35
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,458
YOU KNOW I CAN BARELY EVEN
AFFORD TO EAT THESE DAYS!

36
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,458
- BUY IT AND I'LL THROW
THIS ONE IN FOR FREE.

37
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,916
- WOW, THAT IS PRETTY HOT.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

38
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,125
- Nemoto: COME ON. I GOTTA SAY,
EXPECTED IT TO BE EASIER.THERE.

39
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,125
OH, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
THEY WANT ANOTHER PASSWORD?

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,041
DAMN IT!

41
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,791
( panting ) MAN,
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

42
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,958
- ( Akihisa avatars laughing )

43
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,166
- Toudou: SOMETHING
IS NOT RIGHT HERE.

44
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,416
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM!
WE HAVE A PROBLEM!

45
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,958
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH
THE SUMMONER TEST SYSTEM!

46
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,125
- YES. I AM AWARE OF THAT.

47
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,250
- THIS IS CRAZY... I CAN'T
BELIEVE THEY'VE SPREAD THIS FAR.

48
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,000
WHAT IS GOING ON?

49
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,166
- Boy 1: OKAY, THAT'S ANNOYING.
- ( Akihisa screams)

50
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,875
- Boy 2: GET OFF ME!

51
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,166
- STOP IT!

52
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,541
- LISTEN UP.

53
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,250
I'M GETTING SICK AND TIRED
OF YOUR PRANKS, YOSHII!

54
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,208
- WHAT THE CRAP? WHY IS THIS
AUTOMATICALLY MY FAULT?

55
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,208
- WHY'D YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT?
YOU SUCK.

56
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,208
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
JUST TELL US HOW TO FIX IT.

57
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,083
- NO ONE WILL BE MAD
AT YOU, I PROMISE.

58
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,583
- GREAT. YOU GUYS, TOO?

59
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,875
- AKI, IT'S OBVIOUS IT'S YOU.

60
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,458
NO ONE ELSE'S AVATAR IS
ACTING LIKE THAT.

61
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,250
WHAT THE... WHERE'D SHE GO?

62
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,666
- INTERESTING.

63
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,041
I WONDER IF THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM.

64
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,958
- I'M GONNA TRY SUMMONING
MY AVATAR.

65
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,916
SUMMON!

66
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,458
- THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE.

67
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,833
- CLOSE YOUR EYES! PLEASE!

68
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,291
- MY EYES! I CAN'T SEE! HELP!
I'M BLIND! I'M BLIND!

69
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,083
- SHE ASKED US
TO CLOSE OUR EYES, YUUJI.

70
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,000
- IS THIS THE FUTURE?

71
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,458
ARE WE LOOKING AT GROWN-UP
HIMEJI RIGHT NOW?

72
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,125
- WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING
GROWING UP, THAT'S FOR SURE.

73
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:24,458
- I'M GONNA SUMMON
MY AVATAR, TOO! SUMMON!

74
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,916
- Akihisa: FIGURES. WHY AM I NOT
SURPRISED MINAMI'S AVATAR GROWS

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,416
EVERYWHERE EXCEPT
IN THE... FRANKENSTINE!

76
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,500
- I'M A GENIUS.

77
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,125
- IF I ZOOM IN A BIT,
I CAN SEE EVERYTHING.

78
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,208
- PLEASE DON'T DO THAT! I'VE
NEVER BEEN MORE EMBARRASSED!

79
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,291
- OH YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT!

80
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,666
- PLEASE DON'T TAKE THAT
PICTURE! PLEASE!

81
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,041
FINE, THEN YOU LEAVE ME
NO CHOICE. STOP!

82
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,000
- ( exclaims )

83
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,708
- ( buzzing )
- Kouta: SKELETON?

84
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,083
- IT WORKED IN THEORY, KOUTA.
GOOD IDEA.

85
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,166
- MAYBE I JUST NEED TO
TRY A DIFFERENT ANGLE.

86
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,375
- IT'S KIND OF LIKE PLAYING
DRESS-UP, ISN'T IT?

87
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,333
I THINK I'LL TRY
SUMMONING MY AVATAR.

88
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,875
SUMMON!

89
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,291
OH, NO! DON'T EAT ME,
MISTER BIG BAD WOLF!

90
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,166
STOP THAT, THOSE AREN'T FOR YOU!

91
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,458
- COULD'VE TOLD YOU
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

92
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,000
YOU MAKE A HOT GIRL, THOUGH.

93
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,791
IT HURTS TO LOOK AT YOU!

94
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,250
- WELL, THIS CLARIFIES
EVERYTHING.

95
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,541
THE WHOLE SYSTEM
IS OUT OF ORDER!

96
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,125
- WELL, THEN, BETTER GIVE IT
A SHOT BEFORE IT'S FIXED.

97
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,625
SUMMON!

98
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:26,208
- BEAUTIFUL.
I'VE GOTTA TRY IT. SUMMON!

99
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,125
- ( Boys exclaiming )

100
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,333
- THEY LOOK GREAT TOGETHER.

101
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,625
- HEY, MAN, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOURS LOOKS LIKE.

102
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,750
- SUMMON!

103
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,583
- ( breathing heavily )

104
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,583
- HEY, STOP.
- I KNOW YOU WANT IT.

105
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,833
- STOP. STOP.

106
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,291
- HOLD ON, I DIDN'T... I DON'T
HAVE CONTROL OVER WHAT HE DOES!

107
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,208
YOU KNOW THE
SYSTEM'S SCREWED UP.

108
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,291
- YOU'VE BETRAYED ME, YUUJI.

109
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,166
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO HASN'T DONE IT, YOSHII.

110
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,041
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE?

111
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,375
- I KNOW I DO!
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT. SUMMON!

112
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,375
- ( Akihisa avatars clamoring )

113
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,458
- THIS IS REALLY SUCKS.

114
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:26,083
WHY'S MY AVATAR THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S FREAKING OUT LIKE THIS?

115
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,000
- HUH, THEY'RE NORMAL AGAIN.

116
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,875
- WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?

117
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,250
- EVERYTHING! THEY'RE POSSESSED!

118
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,458
- Hideyoshi: WHERE ARE
THEY GOING?

119
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,458
- Akihisa: THIS IS INSANE.

120
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,291
- Takahashi: THE TEACHERS'
AVATARS ARE THE CLOSEST

121
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,000
TO THE CORE OF THE SYSTEM
BUT IT APPEARS

122
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,708
THEY ARE COMPLETELY FROZEN
AND CANNOT BE SUMMONED.

123
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,500
THE STUDENTS' AVATARS
ARE OBVIOUSLY OUT OF CONTROL.

124
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,416
- Toudou: I DON'T GET THIS.

125
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
THERE'S NO WAY TO ACCESS
THE CRIME PREVENTION SYSTEM

126
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,833
IN THE SERVER ROOM.

127
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,791
AS IT IS RIGHT NOW,
WE CAN'T EVEN OPEN THE DOOR,

128
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,500
MUCH LESS GO IN TO FIX IT.

129
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,833
- WHAT IF WE TURN OFF THE POWER

130
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,666
AND COMPLETELY
RESTART THE SYSTEM?

131
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,083
- THE POWER SUPPLY UNIT KEEPS
EVERYTHING FUNCTIONING

132
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,375
FOR AT LEAST A MONTH
IN CASE OF A SHUT DOWN.

133
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,416
- I SEE. THEN I GUESS
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

134
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,458
BREAK THROUGH THE WALL AND
ENTER THAT WAY.

135
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,875
- WE MUST REMEDY THIS BEFORE
PRESENTING THE SYSTEM

136
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,291
AT THE CONFERENCE TOMORROW.

137
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,875
SHOWING THEM A HUGE
HOLE IN THE WALL

138
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,916
WOULD BE TERRIBLY
EMBARRASSING.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,916
- WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU
PROPOSE THAT WE DO?

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,750
- HMM... PERFECT!

141
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,291
WE'LL GET ONE
OF THE IDIOT STUDENTS TO DO IT.

142
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,291
- Akihisa: HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO FIX IT?

143
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,500
- A PROBATIONARY
STUDENT'S AVATAR IS RUN

144
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,541
FROM A SEPARATE AREA
OF THE SYSTEM.

145
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,375
SO UNLIKE YOUR
CLASSMATES' AVATARS,

146
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,833
YOURS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY
THE MALFUNCTION.

147
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,541
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

148
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,708
EXPLAINS WHY AKIHISA'S
SECOND-SELF

149
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,500
IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS
BEHAVING NORMALLY.

150
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,333
- IT WASN'T NORMAL.
I COULDN'T EVEN SUMMON HIM.

151
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,000
- THAT'S BECAUSE THE
TEACHER'S FIELD YOU USED

152
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,583
HAD ALSO BEEN AFFECTED.

153
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,458
BUT IF I RECALL, YOU DO HAVE
YOUR OWN FIELD, DON'T YOU?

154
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,083
- OH, YEAH. I GUESS I COULD
USE MY IRON BRACELET!

155
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,583
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SEND
YOUR AVATAR INTO THE SERVER ROOM

156
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,125
AND RECONNECT THE CABLE.

157
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,500
WHEN THAT'S DONE, I'LL SHUT DOWN
THE CRIME PREVENTION SYSTEM

158
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,125
FROM THE TERMINAL
AND OPEN THE DOOR.

159
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,750
- ONLY A PROBATIONARY STUDENT'S
AVATAR CAN PULL THIS OFF,

160
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,041
THEIR ABILITY TO TOUCH OBJECTS
IS CRUCIAL HERE.

161
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,833
- YEAH, BUT HOW IS HE SUPPOSED
TO GET IN THERE?

162
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,625
HE CAN'T JUST BUST
THROUGH THE WALL.

163
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,291
- GOOD QUESTION. THE SYSTEM IS
EQUIPPED WITH A COOLING VENT,

164
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,666
I'M SURE HE'S SMALL ENOUGH
TO WALK THROUGH IT.

165
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,750
- YEAH, BUT IF AKI CAN'T
SEE INSIDE THE VENT,

166
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,791
HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO CONTROL
THE LITTLE GUY?

167
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,458
- CHECK THIS OUT,
VIDEO CAMERA AND TRANSMITTER.

168
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,291
- IF WE HAVE HIS AVATAR
TAKE IT WITH HIM,

169
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,250
THEN WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON!

170
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,458
- GOOD CALL! WE LOVE KOUTA,
YES, WE DO!

171
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,125
- YOU JUST CARRY
THOSE THINGS WITH YOU?

172
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,416
WHAT WERE YOU GOING
TO USE THEM FOR?

173
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,791
- DON'T JUDGE HIM!
HE'S JUST MISUNDERSTOOD!

174
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,000
AND BY "MISUNDERSTOOD" I MEAN
A LITTLE CREEPY AND PERVY...

175
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,041
- I WAS MERELY ASKING A
QUESTION. I WASN'T JUDGING HIM.

176
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,458
- AKIHISA'S AN EXTREMELY
LOYAL CUSTOMER.

177
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,166
- THE EFFECTIVE FIELD AREA FOR
THE IRON BRACELET IS SMALL.

178
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,708
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO THE
FRONT OF THE SERVER ROOM

179
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,250
TO CONTROL YOUR AVATAR.

180
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,083
WE'LL GUIDE YOU
FROM OUT HERE.

181
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,000
- I GUESS THAT'S WHERE
HE GOES IN.

182
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,416
- AWAKEN. NOW. SUMMON!

183
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,958
LET'S GO!

184
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,750
- Mizuki: LOOK, THERE HE IS!
HE'S INSIDE THE VENT!

185
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,291
- Minami: OKAY, IT'S CLEAR!

186
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,375
- Yuuji: YOU'RE ALL GOOD.
JUST KEEP GOING STRAIGHT.

187
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,875
- Akihisa: GOT IT.

188
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,000
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
HE IS A PROBATIONARY STUDENT,

189
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,625
WHAT IF HE JUST CAUSES
MORE TROUBLE?

190
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,500
- THEN WE'LL HAVE
TO HOPE HE DOESN'T.

191
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,375
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT
IDIOT'S THE ONLY ONE

192
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,458
WHO CAN USE THE IRON BRACELET.

193
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,916
- COUNT THREE TURNS
AND MAKE A RIGHT.

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,041
THEN TAKE A LEFT AT THE
NEXT INTERSECTION

195
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,291
- AM I IN A LABYRINTH?

196
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,333
THERE IT IS. WHY'S IT HAVE TO BE
SO COMPLICATED?

197
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,916
- Toudou: IT'S JUST
A SECURITY MEASURE.

198
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,125
- OW! OW! EVERYTHING HURTS.
LIKE, BAD.

199
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,916
WHY'S MY SCORE GOING DOWN?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
- Fukuhara: YOU WALKED
THROUGH A POISONOUS SWAMP.

201
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,000
- WHY THE HELL WOULD THERE
BE A SWAMP IN HERE?

202
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,958
- Toudou: IT'S JUST
A SECURITY MEASURE.

203
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,958
- DUDE, YOU CAN GO AROUND IT.
TURN RIGHT AT THE NEXT CORNER.

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,833
- Akihisa: I SEE A LIGHT!

205
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,625
- Yuuji: YOU'RE ALMOST THERE,
JUST KEEP GOING STRAIGHT.

206
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,541
- HUH! WONDER WHAT IT IS.

207
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,833
AVATARS?

208
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,833
- Minami: THE PSYCHO AVATARS
ARE IN THERE!

209
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,208
- Mizuki: THEY'RE ABOUT
TO ATTACK!

210
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,083
- ( screaming )

211
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,750
- KNOCK IT OFF, YUUJI!

212
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,875
- IT'S NOT ME, MAN!
THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL!

213
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,000
- THEY'RE WHAT? NO THEY'RE NOT!
SHUT UP! NO, STOP! HELP!

214
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:43,500
YOU GUYS PLEASE MAKE THEM STOP!
YUUJI! HIDEYOSHI! MINAMI!

215
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,125
HIMEJI! MOMMY!

216
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,458
DON'T DO THIS! I'M BEGGING YOU!

217
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,041
- ( beeping )

218
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,541
- Nishimura: MEET ME
IN THE REMEDIAL CLASSROOM!

219
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,458
- Akihisa: NO!

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,500
- Yuuji: BAKA AND TEST!

221
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,083
- YOU OKAY, YOSHII?
WHAT HAPPENED?

222
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,208
- I JUST HUNG OUT
IN HELL FOR A BIT.

223
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,333
- WHAT KIND OF REMEDIAL CLASS
WAS IT?

224
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,083
- LET'S CONTINUE
MOVING FORWARD.

225
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,458
WE WILL NOW BE TAKING
THE RECOVERY TEST

226
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,083
TO HELP BRING UP YOUR SCORES.

227
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,833
- UNLESS HE MAKES
A REALLY GOOD SCORE,

228
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,625
HE'LL BE SCREWED IF HE RUNS
INTO ANY MORE OF OUR AVATARS.

229
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:50,875
- IF YOU WANT I CAN HELP YOU...
STUDY, I MEAN.

230
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,666
IT'LL BE FUN
IF WE DO IT TOGETHER.

231
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,666
- ( in seductive voice)
IF YOU WANT I CAN HELP YOU.

232
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,833
- WHAT?

233
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,666
- IT'LL BE FUN
IF WE DO IT TOGETHER.

234
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,500
- YES, I WANT TO DO IT WITH YOU
MORE THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD.

235
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,916
STUDY, I MEAN.

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,791
- WHY DO I GET THE IMPRESSION
THAT YOUR TEST SCORES

237
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,666
ARE THE LAST THING ON YOUR MIND?

238
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,625
- THE ONLY METHOD THAT WILL
ACTUALLY WORK

239
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,625
IS ONE THAT PRODUCES
IMMEDIATE RESULTS.

240
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,625
- IN THAT CASE I THINK
I HAVE THE ANSWER.

241
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,958
- Minami: I GET IT.

242
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,750
YOU MAKE THE TEST LIKE,
BONE-HEAD EASY,

243
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,083
AND AKI CAN ACTUALLY
GET A GOOD GRADE.

244
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,666
- AND IT'S ONLY KINDA CHEATING.

245
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,125
- WOW! I'VE NEVER SEEN AKIHISA
DO SO WELL ON A TEST BEFORE.

246
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,291
- Mizuki: YOU'RE DOING
SUCH A GOOD JOB, YOSHII!

247
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,041
- Minami: DON'T MESS IT UP, AKI!

248
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,041
- ( buzzing )

249
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,625
- YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

250
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,666
WHICH ONE DID YOU MISS?

251
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,000
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE TAIKA
REFORMS TOOK PLACE IN 645?

252
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,416
HOW COULD YOU MISS THAT AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED?

253
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,458
- I'M UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE
HERE. I GOT CONFUSED, OKAY!

254
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,708
- EVEN WITH THAT,

255
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,625
HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIS SCORE
UP QUITE A BIT.

256
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,958
- SO HE'S NOT A TOTAL LOSER.

257
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,166
I MEAN, IF THOSE GUYS COME
BACK, HE SHOULD BE OKAY.

258
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,875
- HE'LL BE FINE. LET'S DO THIS.

259
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,041
- ALL RIGHT!

260
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,875
SUMMON!

261
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,208
I CAN CLEAR THIS THING FOR SURE.
JUST WAIT AND SEE!

262
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,666
- OKAY, LEFT TURN AT
THE NEXT INTERSECTION.

263
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,958
- ON IT! ( screams )

264
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,166
- Fukuhara: IT WAS
THE POISONOUS SWAMP.

265
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,666
- I GUESS WE NEED TO TEACH HIM
SOME TRICKS TO AVOID THAT.

266
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,416
- I AM NOT AN ANIMAL!

267
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,666
- OKAY, SO THIS TIME
TAKE A RIGHT.

268
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,458
- I KNOW. WHAT THE...

269
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,666
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

270
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,000
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE
REALLY CAREFUL HERE.

271
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,000
IF YOU TOUCH IT YOU'LL...
- ( Akihisa screaming )

272
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,958
- Mizuki: OH, MY GOSH!
- Minami: AKI!

273
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,625
- I CAN'T BREATHE!

274
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,000
- Yuuji: WHICH PART OF "BE
CAREFUL" DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

275
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,916
- I COULDN'T HELP IT!
IT WAS HABIT!

276
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,291
WHAT'S THAT?

277
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,208
HEY, WHAT'S UP, GUYS?
I'M READY FOR YOU THIS TIME.

278
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,666
IN YOUR FACE!

279
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,375
- YOSHII, YOU HAVE
TO STAY FOCUSED!

280
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,041
- LOOK OUT! KOUTA'S
RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

281
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,666
- I GOT THIS. THE SUBJECT
WE'RE FIGHTING IS HISTORY.

282
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,541
IF THE MASKED PERV
ISN'T BATTLING

283
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,041
WITH HEALTH AND
PHYS. ED KNOWLEDGE,

284
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,125
HE'S DEAD BEFORE
HE EVEN ATTACKS!

285
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,458
- ( screaming )

286
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,625
- Fukuhara: IT WAS
THE POISONOUS SWAMP.

287
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,208
- THOSE WHO DIED, MEET ME
IN THE REMEDIAL CLASSROOM!

288
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,250
- Hideyoshi: HOW IS THAT FAIR?

289
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,125
- WE WEREN'T EVEN FIGHTING! OUR
AVATARS ARE POSSESSED, MAN!

290
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,041
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!

291
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,083
- Kouta: YOU'RE
FREAKISHLY STRONG.

292
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,458
- I MADE IT!

293
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,625
- LOOK FOR A DISCONNECTED CABLE

294
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,916
AND WHEN YOU FIND
IT, CONNECT IT.

295
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,041
- OKAY!

296
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,500
HUH! I FOUND IT!

297
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,958
MINAMI?
- AKI?

298
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,958
- RUN!
- Akihisa: NOT YET!

299
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,625
- PLEASE HURRY!

300
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,000
IF YOU DON'T,
IT COULD GET WORSE.

301
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,625
- Akihisa: HIMEJI?

302
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,500
- ONE, TWO, THREE!

303
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,041
- HOLD ON, YOSHII!

304
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,625
- ( bell ringing )

305
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,500
- HE CAN'T WIN THIS ONE!
- AKI!

306
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,791
- ( Akihisa groaning ) NO!

307
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,708
( screams )

308
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,666
( gasps )

309
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,625
- Mizuki: SOMETHING'S COMING!

310
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,875
COME ON, SUMMONING
FIELD! PLEASE SYNC!

311
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,291
I THINK IT'S... IT'S
ANOTHER AVATAR!

312
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,833
- Miharu: HONEY BISCUIT!

313
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,166
- Minami: MIHARU?

314
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,666
- HELLO, SUGAR CUPS, YOU DIDN'T
THINK I'D LET YOU

315
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,000
OR YOUR HOLOGRAPH OF HOTNESS

316
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,458
FIGHT THAT THING ALONE, DID YOU?

317
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,916
BESIDES, IT'S MY DUTY
TO PROTECT YOU

318
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,708
FROM BREATHING GROSS BOY AIR.

319
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,125
- NOW!

320
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,625
- ( both screaming )

321
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,458
- TO THE REMEDIAL CLASSROOM!

322
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,000
- I DON'T WANNA!

323
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,625
- THIS IS GONNA BE SO FUN!

324
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,625
- Akihisa: HIMEJI, I'M SORRY!

325
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,041
- NOT TOO BAD.

326
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:53,333
- ( avatars screaming )

327
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,333
- Mizuki: YOSHII! PLEASE RUN!
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BEAT HER!

328
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,416
- NO WAY. I'VE COME TOO FAR.
I'M NOT BACKING DOWN.

329
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,291
( screams )

330
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,916
- YOSHII, NO!

331
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,125
- COME ON, I'M SO CLOSE!

332
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,041
- HE WON'T BE ABLE TO FIGHT MUCH
LONGER. WE NEED TO STOP HIM!

333
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,208
AS EDUCATORS, IT'S OUR
FIRST RESPONSIBILITY

334
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,583
TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS SAFE.

335
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,333
- NO! I'M FINE!

336
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,333
I STILL HAVE SOME POINTS LEFT!

337
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,333
- THERE IS TOO BIG OF A GAP
BETWEEN THE SCORES RIGHT NOW.

338
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,166
AND YOUR ABILITY LEVEL
IS TOO LOW!

339
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,333
- I DON'T CARE. WAIT!

340
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,708
THAT'S RIGHT.

341
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,875
YOU GUYS, I CAN RAISE MY ABILITY
LEVEL THE SAME WAY!

342
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,958
THE TEST DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
ABOUT MY OWN ACTUAL ABILITY.

343
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,333
HIMEJI, TAKE THE RECOVERY TEST!

344
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,916
JUST TAKE IT!

345
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,583
- OH, I GET IT NOW!

346
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,708
MS. TAKAHASHI, CAN I TAKE IT?

347
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,916
- IT'S RISKY. IF YOU RAISE
YOUR SCORE EVEN BY ONE POINT,

348
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,333
HE WON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

349
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,375
- ( screaming )

350
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,833
- I'M DONE! PLEASE GRADE IT!

351
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,458
YES! YOU DID IT!

352
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,041
- Takahashi: I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS.

353
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,291
ZERO POINTS!

354
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,125
- GOOD WORK, LITTLE GUY.

355
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,875
- Takahashi: IT WORKED,
THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN RECOVERED!

356
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,666
- AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.
I'M IMPRESSED.

357
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,083
- ( theme song playing )

358
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,916
- YOU DID GREAT!
ARE YOU OKAY, YOSHII?

359
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,291
- YEAH. JUST ONE HANGING OUT'S
NOT GONNA HURT ME.

360
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,666
- THOSE WHO DIED WITH THE
PATHETIC SCORE OF ZERO,

361
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,750
MEET ME IN THE
REMEDIAL CLASSROOM!

362
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,333
- THAT'D ME,
GUESS I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

363
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,458
- OKAY.

364
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,333
THANKS A LOT, HIMEJI.

365
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,458
- WHAT'S WITH THE GLOOMY LOOK?

366
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,250
- OW! THAT HURT! WHY WOULD
YOU DO THAT?

367
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,833
MY POINTS! I'M LOSING THEM!

368
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,083
- IS SIX POINTS REALLY
SO IMPORTANT?

369
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,500
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE
REMEDIAL CLASS ANYWAY

370
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,166
WITH A SCORE LIKE THAT.

371
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,916
- LET'S GO, YOSHII!

372
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:20,916
- OKAY!

373
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,958
- I'D SAY THAT QUALIFIES
AS A DAY.

374
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,208
TALK ABOUT A GAMBLE, ENTRUSTING
SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT

375
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,875
TO A CLASS F STUDENT.

376
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,291
BUT I'M GLAD EVERYTHING
WORKED OUT IN THE END.

377
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,833
- ACTUALLY, NO. I DON'T THINK IT
WAS MUCH OF A GAMBLE AT ALL.

378
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:38,583
THERE'S A SPECIFIC WAY TO HANDLE
THE IDIOTS WE HAVE HERE.

379
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,500
YOU'LL LEARN, EVENTUALLY.

380
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,208
- I'M FINISHED.

381
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,791
WILL YOU PLEASE GRADE IT?

382
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,000
- Fukuhara: QUESTION NINE.

383
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,916
ONE OF THE UNITS USED TO
INDICATE BREAST SIZE IS "CUP".

384
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,625
EXPLAIN THE SIZE OF AN A CUP,
WHICH IS USED AS A BASIS.

385
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,125
- Akihisa: MINAMI SHIMADA.
- NO COMMENT.

386
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,625
- NEXT TIME! KISSES, BREASTS,
AND PONYTAILS!

387
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,083
- THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
