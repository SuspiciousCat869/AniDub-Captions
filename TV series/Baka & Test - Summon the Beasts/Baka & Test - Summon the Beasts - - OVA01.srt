1
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,416
- ( students chattering )

2
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,833
- Fukuhara: HERE
AT FUMIZUKI ACADEMY,

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:39,166
THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL KNOWN AS
"THE REFRESHING FESTIVAL"

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,125
IS FAST APPROACHING.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,750
BECAUSE THIS SCHOOL
IS CONSIDERED SPECIAL

6
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,500
IN REGARDS TO ITS
SUMMONER TEST WAR ABILITIES,

7
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,250
THEY ALWAYS RECEIVE
A SIGNIFICANT TURNOUT

8
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,541
OF FRIENDS, FAMILY
AND STUDENTS.

9
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,708
IN ORDER TO LIVE UP
TO SUCH HIGH EXPECTATIONS,

10
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,291
THEY BEGIN PREPARING FOR IT
VERY EARLY.

11
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,958
SOME ACTUALLY WORK HARDER
ON THE FESTIVAL

12
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,916
THAN IN THEIR CLASSES.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,291
"SOME" DOES NOT INCLUDE
YEAR 2, CLASS F.

14
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,291
- ( boy groans )
- HE'S FADING.

15
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,250
I GOT YOU, LITTLE BUDDY.
KOUTA, ARISE!

16
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,250
- Fukuhara: THEY WERE
PRACTICING C.P.R.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,375
- ( upbeat song playing )

18
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,500
- IT HAD BEEN A FEW DAYS
SINCE THE PREPARATION BEGAN.

19
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,166
STUDENTS WERE DECORATING AND
PREPARING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS.

20
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,708
"STUDENTS" DOES NOT INCLUDE
YEAR 2, CLASS F.

21
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,666
- Hideyoshi: PLAY BALL!

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,625
- Fukuhara: THEY WERE
PLAYING BASEBALL.

23
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,166
- ( boys cheering )

24
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,625
- COME ON, YOSHII,
LET'S GO.

25
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,250
- BRING IT.
YOU'RE SO ON.

26
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,500
- ( Akihisa's voice ) ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'VE YOU GOT FOR ME, YUUJI?

27
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,666
CURVE BALL.
ON IT.

28
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,083
AT HIS HEAD?
WHAT THE FUNHOUSE?

29
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,416
- YOU'RE CRAZY!
I'M NOT GONNA BEAN SUGAWA!

30
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
- NO HOLDING BACK.
RIGHT IN HERE.

31
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,916
- YOU'RE NUTS!
I CAN'T DO THAT!

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,375
- HEY, YOU PUNKS.

33
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,333
THAT BETTER NOT BE THE SMELL
OF SLACKING OFF.

34
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,875
- IRON MAN, HI.

35
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,833
- YOSHII, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

36
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,041
- I'M STANDING ON A HILL DOING
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING.

37
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,250
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS PICK ON ME?
IT'S NOT FAIR.  THE CLASS REP'S

38
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,416
RIGHT THERE.  ISN'T HE
SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE?

39
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
- ( sighs )

40
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,083
- FORKBALL?

41
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,291
THROW IT WHERE?

42
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,708
AT HIS JUNK?

43
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,416
- DAMN IT!
STOP BEING A DOUCHE!

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,000
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

45
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,458
IT'S ALL HIS FAULT.
- SHUT UP!

46
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,541
ALL OF YOU, JUST GO BACK
TO YOUR CLASSROOM.

47
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,333
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO DON'T
HAVE A PLAN FOR THE FESTIVAL.

48
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,375
I SUGGEST YOU GET ON IT.

49
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,416
- Students: FINE.

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
- ALL RIGHT,
CHECK IT OUT:

51
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,000
WE HAVE TO DECIDE
WHAT TO DO FOR THIS FESTIVAL.

52
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,333
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS,
JUST RAISE YOUR HAND.

53
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,166
KOUTA, WHAT YOU GOT FOR ME?
- ART GALLERY.

54
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,750
- AND WHAT KIND OF ART
ARE YOU HOPING TO SHOW?

55
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,416
- MYSTERY PHOTOS.
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,541
JUST WHAT IT SAYS--
PHOTOS OF MYSTERY.

57
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,416
ONLY IN OUR BOOTH,
WE REVEAL THE SECRETS.

58
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,333
- WELL, IT'S A START.
GO AHEAD AND WRITE IT DOWN.

59
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,000
- ALRIGHTY.

60
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,291
PHOTO GALLERY?
SECRET...

61
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,583
OR MYSTERY?

62
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,875
AND THAT'S WHERE WE REVEAL
STUFF AND THINGS.  GOT IT.

63
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,916
- GREAT.
ANYONE ELSE?

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,375
- HIMEJI, LET'S HEAR IT.
- I WAS THINKING

65
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,250
MAYBE IT WOULD BE FUN TO BUILD
A LITTLE WEDDING CAFE.

66
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,250
IT'S LIKE MAID CAFES,

67
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,166
EXCEPT ALL THE GIRLS WEAR
WEDDING DRESSES INSTEAD.

68
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,125
- O.M.G., IT'S PERFECT.

69
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,833
ALL THE GIRLS
ARE GONNA LOVE THAT,

70
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,833
PROBABLY AS MUCH
AS THE GUYS.

71
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,125
- NO GUY WOULD BE CAUGHT DEAD
IN THAT CAFE.

72
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,583
- YOU GOT THAT?
WRITE IT DOWN.

73
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,250
- I THINK I REMEMBERED
ALL THAT.

74
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,708
SO IT'S A WEDDING RESTAURANT,
OR--?

75
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,375
- ANY OTHER IDEAS?

76
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,083
- WE COULD ALSO DO
A CHINESE CAFE.

77
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,791
NO OTHER CLASS WOULD DO THAT.
WE COULD SERVE DIM SUM.

78
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,875
PLUS CHINESE CULTURE
IS SUPER DEEP,

79
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,000
LIKE, EMO-DEEP.
THEY'RE ALMOST

80
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,083
AS HARDCORE AS THE EUROPEANS,
EXCEPT WITH PANDAS.

81
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,833
- YOU GET ALL THAT?
WRITE IT DOWN.

82
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:34,375
- THINK SO.  A CHINESE-EUROPEAN
EMO PANDA CAFE THING?

83
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,500
- DUDE, WHAT THE HECK
DID YOU JUST SAY?

84
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,458
YOU CAN'T JUST WRITE DOWN
EVERY OTHER WORD, BUDDY.

85
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,666
- TURDLINGS, WHAT JOLLY HOLIDAY
IDEAS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH?

86
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,166
- HI.  WE HAVE
AT LEAST THREE RIGHT NOW.

87
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,833
- YOU MUST WANT
A REMEDIAL CLASS.

88
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,458
THAT'S FINE BY ME.
- WHY WOULD WE WANT THAT?

89
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,583
- PATHETIC.  YOU LITTLE BRATS
AMAZE ME SOMETIMES.

90
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,958
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU.

91
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,041
DON'T YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME
MONEY SO YOU CAN UPGRADE

92
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,500
YOUR CRAP EQUIPMENT?
- WAIT, SO DOES THAT MEAN

93
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,875
WE COULD BUY NEW DESKS
WITH THE MONEY WE MAKE?

94
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,208
- WHOA, I NEVER EVEN
THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY.

95
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,916
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED.  AWESOME.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,041
- YOUR SCORES DON'T SEEM
TO BE IMPROVING

97
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,041
AND THERE'S REALLY
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO

98
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,500
AFTER CARDBOARD BOXES,
UNFORTUNATELY.

99
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,208
IT MAKES ME WONDER
IF THE EQUIPMENT

100
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,833
IS INTERFERING
WITH YOUR STUDIES.

101
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,666
IF SO, WE HAVE OUR
PRIORITIES WRONG.

102
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,791
PUNISHING YOU SHOULD NOT BE
MORE IMPORTANT.

103
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,958
I'LL TALK TO THE PRINCIPAL
ABOUT IT TODAY.

104
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,833
- DO YOU MEAN IT?
- WHAT IS THIS WORLD

105
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,875
YOU SPEAK OF WHERE WE DON'T HAVE
TO STUDY ATOP CARDBOARD MATS?

106
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,458
- IF WE CAN, IT WOULD REALLY
HELP ME CONVINCE DAD.

107
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,458
- WHAT'S YOUR DAD
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

108
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,333
- NOTHING.  SORRY,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

109
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,833
- UH, YOU WERE SAYING
THAT SOUNDS AWESOME.

110
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,166
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY
TO TAKE A VOTE THEN.

111
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,000
WHICH OF THESE THREE IDEAS...
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

112
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,958
- THAT'S AWESOME.

113
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,166
WE'RE GONNA GET SO MANY
CUSTOMERS WITH THIS.

114
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,333
- HOPE SO.  WE SERIOUSLY CANNOT
AFFORD TO FAIL THIS TIME, AKI.

115
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,083
BRING YOUR A-GAME.
PROMISE?

116
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THIS TIME"?

117
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,541
- WELL, I TOLD HER
I WASN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING,

118
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,208
BUT IT'S MIZUKI.

119
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,125
HER PARENTS ARE WANTING HER
TO SWITCH SCHOOLS.

120
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,291
- DID SHE JUST SAY
WHAT I THINK SHE SAID?

121
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,958
CHANGE SCHOOLS?

122
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,583
SHE CAN'T DO THAT.

123
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,416
WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH
WE HAVE TO DO TOGETHER.

124
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,250
SHE'S THE ONLY SLICE OF A MENTAL
BREAK I HAVE FROM CLASS F.

125
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,958
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ALL OF US
IF SHE CHANGES SCHOOLS?

126
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,125
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

127
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,208
EVERYONE WILL FALL INTO
A DEEP DEPRESSION.

128
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,208
WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO GROW MOHAWKS

129
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,083
JUST LIKE IN
"FIST OF THE NORTH STAR."

130
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,500
VIOLENCE WILL BREAK OUT.  THERE
WILL BE LOOTING IN THE STREETS.

131
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,500
AND THE ONLY WOMAN LEFT FOR US
TO FIGHT FOR WILL BE HIDEYOSHI.

132
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,750
- ( laughing )

133
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,833
- I THINK HE MIGHT BE HAVING
A SYSTEM MELTDOWN.

134
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,583
- LIKE HE HAS A SYSTEM
TO START WITH.

135
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,458
- COME ON, YOU GOTTA
SNAP OUT OF THIS.

136
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,541
- HIDEYOSHI, WOULD YOU STILL
LOVE ME IF I HAD A MOHAWK?

137
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,583
IT WOULD COME WITH
WASHBOARD ABS.

138
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,166
- WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?
YOU'RE SO WEIRD SOMETIMES.

139
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,708
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH
MIZUKI CHANGING SCHOOLS?

140
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,000
- WHY DO THEY WANT HER TO CHANGE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR?

141
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,250
- THEY'RE JUST WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

142
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,125
THEY DON'T THINK
HER GRADES WILL IMPROVE

143
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,000
IF SHE HAS TO STAY
IN CLASS F.

144
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,541
- THAT'S NOT ALL.
IT'S THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT HERE.

145
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,125
SHE'S AROUND DUDES WHO ONLY COME
TO SCHOOL TO SCREW AROUND

146
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,958
ALL DAY.  IF I WAS HER OLD MAN,
I'D BE WORRIED TOO.

147
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,041
- SO, YEAH, THEY THINK
IF SHE GOES TO A SCHOOL

148
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,458
WITH A MORE NORMAL ENVIRONMENT,
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO FOCUS.

149
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,291
- BEFORE-- CONVINCE HER DAD
TO KEEP HER HERE--

150
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,875
THAT'S WHAT SHE MEANT, HUH?
- MM-HMM.

151
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,875
- SO MAYBE IF WE BUY A FULL SET
OF DECENT EQUIPMENT,

152
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,541
IT'LL LOOK LIKE A NORMAL SCHOOL
AND SHE'LL BE ABLE TO STAY.

153
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,375
- GOOD PLAN.  THAT MEANS
WE CAN'T FAIL.  YOU GOT THAT?

154
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,833
- HEY, YOU GUYS, WE'RE BACK.
- WHAT IS THAT STUFF?

155
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,708
- IT'S A DISH KOUTA MADE
FOR THE CHINESE CULTURE CAFE.

156
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,583
WE WERE HOPING
THAT YOU WOULD TEST IT OUT.

157
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,125
- THEY'RE SESAME DUMPLINGS.

158
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,958
- COOL.
YEAH, I'LL TRY 'EM.

159
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,083
HEY, THOSE ARE
PRETTY GOOD.

160
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,541
- YUM, LOVING THE CRISPY OUTSIDE
AND CHEWY INSIDE.

161
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,458
- AND THEY'RE NOT TOO SWEET.
GOOD JOB.

162
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,291
- THESE WOULD GO REALLY WELL
WITH TEA.

163
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,166
- I'LL GO MAKE SOME RIGHT NOW.
- WAIT, I'LL HELP YOU.

164
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,541
- WOW, ARE THEY REALLY
THAT AMAZING?

165
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,000
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY.

166
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,541
THAT IS DEFINITELY
A VERY CHEWY INSIDE.

167
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,083
IT'S NOT TOO SWEET
OR SPICY.

168
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,000
IT'S-- ( mumbles )
- WHAT HAPPENED?  ARE YOU OKAY?

169
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,666
- KOUTA, WHAT DID YOU DO?

170
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,250
DID YOU REALLY MAKE
ALL THOSE DUMPLINGS?

171
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,333
- OF COURSE.

172
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,833
EXCEPT I ONLY MADE
THREE OF THEM.

173
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,541
WHERE'D THE OTHERS COME FROM?

174
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,083
- BY THE WAY HE'S ACTING,
I'D SAY

175
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,500
THAT HIMEJI TRIED HER OWN
VERSION OF THE RECIPE.

176
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,583
- THAT WAS CLOSE,
LIKE FOOD RUSSIAN ROULETTE,

177
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,416
EXCEPT WITH
FIFTY-FIFTY ODDS.

178
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,708
- ( Akihisa laughs ) IS THAT
YOU, GRANDFATHER?  I MISSED YOU.

179
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,416
- Hideyoshi: THAT KIND OF STUFF
ONLY HAPPENS TO HIM.

180
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,000
- ( students chattering )

181
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,041
- Fukuhara: THE DAY
OF THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL

182
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,125
HAD FINALLY ARRIVED.

183
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,000
- WELCOME TO CHINESE CAFE
OF EUROPE.  WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

184
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,291
- IS THERE A DOCTOR
IN THE HOUSE?  WHO KNOWS C.P.R.?

185
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,166
- Fukuhara: OH, WAIT,
YOU'VE SEEN THIS ALREADY.

186
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,375
- YOSHII, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
PEOPLE IN THE KITCHEN.

187
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,750
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
HELP US OUT?

188
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,333
- WHATEVER.
I GUESS I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

189
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,791
- Mizuki: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
COME AGAIN.

190
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,791
- WELCOME TO CHINESE CAFE
OF EUROPE.

191
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,791
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO OUR CUSTOMERS'

192
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,958
FAVORITE WAITRESS IS.
PLEASE FILL OUT OUR SURVEY

193
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,750
AND TURN IT IN TO ME
WHEN YOU LEAVE.

194
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,500
- CHECK IT OUT.  IT TOTALLY
LOOKS LIKE A CAFE IN THERE.

195
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,041
- I KNOW.  WE'RE GETTING
SO MANY CUSTOMERS TOO.

196
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,750
THOSE NEW DESKS
ARE AS GOOD AS OURS.

197
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,791
- HEY, HOW LONG DO YOU
EXPECT US TO WAIT?

198
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,708
- HEY, PINKY,
HURRY IT UP, HUH?

199
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,541
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY
TO SPEND IN HERE, YOU KNOW.

200
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,166
- WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

201
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,208
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE YET.

202
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,291
- ( groans ) SERIOUSLY?
WE'VE BEEN HERE FOREVER.

203
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,291
- WHAT KIND OF JACKED-UP CAFE
IS THIS?

204
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,750
WHY ARE WE THE ONES
WAITING ON YOU?  HELLO?

205
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,708
- REALLY SORRY.  I'LL BE THERE
IN JUST A MINUTE, OKAY?

206
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,083
- DOUCHEBAGS.
WHY ARE THEY ACTING LIKE THAT?

207
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,666
- THIRD-YEAR GUYS
TRYING TO GIVE HER A HARD TIME.

208
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,750
- THIS SUCKS.
- I'M FREAKIN' HUNGRY.

209
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,125
DO I HAVE TO GO
COOK IT MYSELF?

210
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,208
WELL AT LEAST
THAT'S A START.

211
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,375
YUMMY.

212
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,708
IT'S LIKE A CRISPY GUMBALL
EXPLODING IN MY MOUTH.

213
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,416
- IT FEELS LIKE
A CHINESE WONDERLAND.

214
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,375
- OH, NO.
THIS IS BAD.

215
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,625
300 JOULES.
CHARGE!

216
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,125
- 300.
ROGER THAT.

217
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,166
THREE, TWO, ONE.

218
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,375
- THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL.
- YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

219
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,875
- I TEND TO LIVE MY LIFE
VERY CLOSE TO DEATH.

220
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,833
- VERY DEEP.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN HERE?

221
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,708
WHOA.  NO WAY.

222
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,000
- IDIOTS.  WHAT KIND OF FREAK
EATS THE DISPLAY FOOD?

223
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,791
- I'M-- I'M ALIVE.
WHAT WAS IN THAT?

224
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,791
- YOU LITTLE PUNKS.

225
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,791
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US?
GET OVER HERE.

226
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,791
- COME ON, SURVIVAL MODE,
HELP ME OUT HERE.

227
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,250
- ( bell dinging )

228
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,833
- CONGRATULATIONS, YOU TWO.
YOU WON.

229
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,833
YOU HIT THE JACKPOT.
- WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

230
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,333
- WE WIN A PRIZE OR SOMETHING?
LIKE CASH?  THE HELL IS IT?

231
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,958
- OF COURSE YOU GUYS
WIN A PRIZE.

232
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,291
IT'S BETTER THAN CASH.
IT'S, UH...

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,375
ONE OF THESE.  YUM.
- I DON'T WANT THAT.

234
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,000
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS.

235
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,250
- NO WAY.  WE'RE GONNA
CLOSE THIS DUMP DOWN.

236
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,250
- OH, PLEASE.  WE DIDN'T
FORCE YOU TO EAT THOSE.

237
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,958
- SHUT UP.
WHO'S IN CHARGE--?

238
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,000
- IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M YUUJI, THE CLASS REP.

239
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,875
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

240
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,875
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM?

241
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,750
- WELL, FOR ONE, MY BUDDY JUST
GOT PUNCHED OUT FOR NO REASON.

242
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,500
- WE WERE NEGOTIATING.
THEY ALWAYS SAY

243
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,208
TO START THINGS OFF
WITH A PUNCH, DON'T THEY?

244
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,458
- I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN THE HEAD, YOU BASTARD!

245
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,833
- AND THEN,
YOUR FOLLOW-THROUGH

246
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,125
SHOULD ALWAYS
KICK IT UP A NOTCH.

247
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,250
- MAN, THAT FREAKIN' HURT.
TSUNEMURA.

248
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,041
HEY THERE.
HOW'S IT GOING?

249
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,666
- AND NOW,
TO CLOSE THE DEAL,

250
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,208
I OFFER UP MY PRO WRESTLING
BACKBREAKER HOLD.

251
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,375
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I THINK I KIND OF GET IT.

252
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,583
- OKAY, FINE.

253
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,625
AND NOW,
NEGOTIATION COMPLETE.

254
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,500
- THAT'S A PRETTY
INTENSE LOCK HE'S GOT.

255
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,458
- HE REALLY KARL-GOTCHED
HIS FACE OFF.

256
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,500
- GOODBYE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING IN.

257
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,333
- Minami: WHY'S IT ALL SLOW
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

258
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,833
- IT'S SORT OF WEIRD.  WE SHOULD
BE GETTING A LUNCH RUSH.

259
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,458
- Yuuji: IT WON'T BE GOOD
IF IT STAYS LIKE THIS.

260
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,708
- HELLO AND WELCOME.
WHAT THE--?

261
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,958
- HEY, YOU GUYS.
DUMMY.

262
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,333
- HAZUKI, SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

263
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,208
- THANKS, YOU TOO.  I CAME
TO HELP YOU WITH THE FESTIVAL.

264
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,208
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
TELL ME.

265
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,333
- THANK YOU.  THAT'S SO NICE.
- SURE.  ANYTHING FOR YOU.

266
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:33,083
BESIDES, YOU'RE MY FUTURE
HUSBAND.  IT'S MY JOB.

267
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,916
REMEMBER?  HOW COULD YOU FORGET
OUR VERY FIRST KISS?

268
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,833
- Akihisa: HEY, WHAT AM I DOING
ON THE FLOOR?

269
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,625
- Minami: KOUTA, I NEED FORKS.
FIVE SHOULD BE ENOUGH.

270
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,916
- Mizuki: I NEED SOME TOO,
SO GET 10, PLEASE.

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,833
- NO!
( screams )

272
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,708
- Sugawa: QUIET.  WE ARE
ABOUT TO START THE INQUISITION.

273
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,916
SURVEY SAYS,
DEATH PENALTY.

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
- ( Akihisa screams )
GET OFF ME!  I'M INNOCENT!

275
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,000
- I'M SORRY YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE.

276
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,875
AS YOU CAN SEE,
WE'RE PRETTY DEAD RIGHT NOW.

277
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,666
NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED,
BUT I DOUBT ANYONE ELSE

278
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,250
WILL BE COMING AT THIS POINT.
- WE APPRECIATE IT.

279
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,000
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING FOR YOU TO DO.

280
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,625
- OKAY, BUT I REALLY
WANTED

281
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,833
TO WEAR A CHINESE DRESS
LIKE YOU GET TO.

282
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,875
- 100 MEAT BUNS,
AND STEP ON IT.

283
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,458
- Yuuji: GO GET THEM
YOURSELF.

284
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,291
- IS THIS BECAUSE OF THAT
CRAZY RUMOR I HEARD?

285
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,666
- A RUMOR?
- YEAH.

286
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,666
- ON MY WAY HERE I GOT LOST,
SO I ASKED ANYONE I RAN INTO

287
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,458
WHERE MY STUPID POTATOHEAD
BOYFRIEND'S CAFE WAS.

288
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,958
THEY ALL SENT ME TO THE RIGHT
PLACE RIGHT AWAY.

289
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,791
- YOU'RE ALREADY
A HOUSEHOLD NAME.

290
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,375
- YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ME?
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

291
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,208
THEY TOLD ME
I SHOULDN'T COME HERE.

292
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,125
THEY SAID IT WAS FILTHY
AND TO STAY AWAY.

293
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,166
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.
- BUT WE ALL CLEANED

294
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,750
THE WHOLE PLACE, AND TOTALLY
DECORATED HARDCORE.

295
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,875
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE HAPPY.

296
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,958
THEY GAVE US
GOOD REVIEWS ANYWAY.

297
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,750
- YEAH, ALL BUT TWO
OF THEM.

298
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,291
I KNOW.
IT'S THE TSUNEKAWA DUO.

299
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,125
THEY'RE THE TWO JERKS
WHO CAME IN EARLIER.

300
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,583
- WHAT'S THAT?
- TSUNEMURA AND NATSUKAWA--

301
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,000
THEIR NAMES COMBINED,

302
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,791
YOU KNOW, LIKE FANCY
CELEBRITY COUPLES.

303
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,333
- OH, I GET IT.

304
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,125
- I'M GONNA MAKE 'EM
BEG FOR MERCY.

305
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,208
JUST WAIT UNTIL I FIND
THOSE PANSIES AGAIN.

306
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,625
- SPIT IT OUT.  WHERE'D IT
COME FROM?  WHO'D YOU TALK TO?

307
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,958
- AT ANOTHER CAFE,
WITH THE PRETTY SISTERS.

308
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,791
- ON IT.  I WON'T REST
UNTIL I FIND THEM.

309
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,791
- DOES THIS MEAN NEW DESKS
ARE NO LONGER THE PRIORITY?

310
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,541
- I GUESS THIS IS THE CAFE
HAZUKI WAS TALKING ABOUT.

311
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,625
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
ANYTHING SHADY IS GOING ON.

312
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,958
- WE DID
JUST GET HERE.

313
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,291
- WELCOME HOME, MASTER.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

314
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,083
- SHOUKO, YOU LOOK
SO PRETTY IN THAT.

315
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,750
- THANK YOU.
I KNOW.

316
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,416
I WON'T LET YOU LEAVE.
I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

317
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
MISS ME?
- IT'S TIME TO GO, YOSHII.

318
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,666
WOULD YOU LIKE A MENU?
- Akihisa: THANKS.

319
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,708
LET'S SEE, I WILL HAVE...

320
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,041
WATER, PLEASE.
- CERTAINLY, SIR.

321
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,708
WHAT CAN I GET YOU,
MASTER?

322
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,833
- TO START,
YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.

323
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,750
- OUR LIST OF SPECIALS.

324
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,583
FIRST IS A HONEYMOON
WITH A MAID.

325
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,583
DINNER AND
MAKE OUT WITH A MAID.

326
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,375
OR JUST SWEET KISSES
WITH A MAID.

327
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,958
SUPPLIES ARE LIMITED.
I SUGGEST YOU ORDER QUICKLY.

328
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,333
- SCREW THAT!

329
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,041
- NOW THIS IS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

330
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,291
IT PUTS THAT CHINESE JOINT
TO SHAME.

331
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,333
I'M ALREADY 1000% SOLD.
CLASS F SUCKS.

332
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,875
- DUDE, I KNOW, RIGHT?

333
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,791
THAT PLACE SMELLED
LIKE FISH AND PISS.

334
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,291
AND THE WAITRESSES?
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN UGLIER.

335
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,166
ALSO, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THE NAME?

336
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,708
"THE CHINESE CAFE OF EUROPE"?
- ( both laughing )

337
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,291
- A-HOLES.
NONE OF THAT'S TRUE.

338
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,208
- EH, THE NAME WAS
KIND OF LAME.

339
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,666
I'M GOING AFTER THEM.

340
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,666
- NO YOU'RE NOT.
NOT RIGHT NOW ANYWAY.

341
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,458
OUR REPUTATION
IS BAD ENOUGH AS IT IS.

342
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,375
DON'T BE SUCH AN IDIOT.
- WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO?

343
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:04,291
LET ME SEE.  SHOUKO, WE NEED
TO BORROW YOUR MAID COSTUME.

344
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,875
- MY PLEASURE.

345
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,916
- ( screams ) NOT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

346
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,041
- YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
TO TAKE MY MAID COSTUME OFF.

347
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,041
- I DID NOT.
YOU'RE CRAZY.

348
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,291
I JUST SAID WE WANTED
TO BORROW IT, LIKE, LATER.

349
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,166
- I HAVE AN EXTRA ONE.

350
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,208
- WILL YOU QUIT ACTING
LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG?

351
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,416
- SO, UH, WHAT'S
THE DRESS FOR ANYWAY?

352
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,583
- FOR HIDEYOSHI.  HE'S ABOUT
TO BE A BIG HELP TO US.

353
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
- GOTCHA.
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

354
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,166
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DOES THIS LOOK WOMANLY ENOUGH?

355
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,166
- Yuuji: MM, YOU ARE HOT, MAN.

356
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,208
IT'S ALMOST STUPID HOW HOT.

357
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,458
- Hideyoshi: IT'S THE MAKEUP.

358
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,291
I PICKED UP A FEW TRICKS
HERE AND THERE.

359
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,791
- Akihisa: WAIT, IS THAT A BRA?
- THE BEST PERFORMANCES

360
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,333
REQUIRE FULL COMMITMENT,
RIGHT DOWN TO THE UNDERWEAR.

361
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,375
- PANTIES TOO?

362
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,208
- SERIOUSLY, I DON'T KNOW WHY
ANYONE WOULD TORTURE THEMSELVES

363
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,333
BY GOING THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

364
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,250
- EXCEPT MAYBE OTHER
MEMBERS OF CLASS F

365
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,833
WHO ARE USED TO THE STENCH.
- ( both laughing )

366
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,333
- Tsunemura: CAN I HELP YOU,
GORGEOUS?

367
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,375
- ( Natsukawa whistles )
DAMN, YOU'RE HOT.

368
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,833
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
A LITTLE LOWE--

369
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,166
- Akihisa: GO TO HELL!

370
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,291
- I'M IN TROUBLE.
- NO WAY.

371
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,875
YOU'RE THAT DUDE FROM CLASS F.
- DAMN IT.

372
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,875
ARGH! HELP ME.

373
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,208
THIS DISGUSTING BOY WON'T STOP
LOOKING UP MY SKIRT.

374
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,000
- WHAT?
THAT'S NOT A CHICK.

375
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,875
- HOW CAN ANYONE DEGRADE A WOMAN
LIKE THAT, AND IN PUBLIC TOO?

376
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,541
- THAT IS B.S.  WE WERE
JUST DEFENDING OURSELVES.

377
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,166
- Yuuji: I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT.  I SAW YOUR BUDDY

378
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,666
TRY TO GIVE HER
A T-TWISTER.

379
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,541
- ARGH!  THAT PERVERT
SNAPPED OFF MY BRA.

380
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,625
- WHAT THE HELL?

381
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,791
WHY WON'T IT COME OFF?

382
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,958
- LOOK AT HIM.
MAN, TALK ABOUT DESPERATE.

383
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,291
- THAT IS SO NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

384
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,500
- ( people chattering )

385
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,208
- WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF TOOLS.

386
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,250
- HEY, HOLD IT.

387
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,250
- IT LOOKS GOOD,
BUT IF IT ISN'T AUTHENTIC,

388
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,875
IT WON'T HAVE
THE SAME EFFECT.

389
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,958
I JUST NEED TO FIND
SOMETHING SCARIER IN GENERAL.

390
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,250
- BASTARDS.  THEY'RE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

391
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,458
- THEY'RE BEGGING FOR US
TO MAKE THEM PAY FOR THAT CRAP

392
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,375
AND I DON'T CARE
IF IT TAKES US ALL YEAR.

393
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,166
- WHAT DO WE DO?
- I HAVE AN IDEA.  FOLLOW ME.

394
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,333
COME ON.

395
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,375
- WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

396
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,875
I MUST HAVE JUST FALLEN ASLEEP
AND HAD A NIGHTMARE.

397
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,708
MAKES SENSE,
AFTER SEEING THAT.

398
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,375
I SUPPOSE THE WAY
TO REVERSE THAT

399
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,791
IS TO THINK
OF SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.

400
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,916
OH, SO BEAUTIFUL.

401
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,125
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

402
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,375
- IT MUST MEAN I'M THINKING OF
MY SWEET YOSHII FAR TOO MUCH.

403
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,750
THAT GIRL'S FACE--
I COULD'VE SWORN IT WAS--

404
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,666
NO.  WHAT IS WRONG
WITH ME?

405
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,666
AM I TRYING TO MASK
MY FEELINGS FOR YOSHII

406
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,791
BY IMAGINING HIS EYES
ON A BEAUTIFUL GIRL?

407
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,708
WHY DIDN'T I GET
HER NAME?

408
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,458
I KNOW WHY--
BECAUSE I'VE GOT YOSHII.

409
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,541
BUT I STILL SHOULD HAVE
TALKED TO HER LIKE ANY OTHER

410
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,250
TESTOSTERONE-FILLED MAN
WOULD HAVE DONE.

411
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,291
NO, YOSHII IS
ALL THE WOMAN I NEED.

412
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,166
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

413
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,458
- WHATEVER IT IS,
DO IT FAST.

414
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,250
- HELLO THERE.
THANKS FOR COMING.

415
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,958
- MINAMI, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE GETTING MORE CUSTOMERS.

416
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,958
- YEAH, WE ARE.
I GUESS THEY PULLED IT OFF.

417
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,416
- OKAY, DONE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO NOW?

418
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,625
- DAMN, WE LET THEM
GET AWAY.

419
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,708
- WHAT'S OUR PLAN B?
WE CAN'T JUST LET THEM

420
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,708
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE
AND SPREAD THOSE RUMORS.

421
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,875
- ( panting )
- HMM?

422
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,875
- HEY.
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

423
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,583
- BAD NEWS.  ONE OF OUR
WAITRESSES HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.

424
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,583
- ( phone ringing )

425
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,375
- YOSHII'S PHONE.
- Natsukawa: Hey.

426
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,041
You messed with
the wrong guy, limp wad.

427
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,500
- Tsunemura: Now it's our turn.
We're having some fun

428
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,541
with one of your waitresses
while you're out.

429
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,916
- We thought we'd play
a little game with her.

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,041
I wonder what will happen to
your sales now that she's gone.

431
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,875
- DON'T YOU DARE
DO ANYTHING TO HURT HER.

432
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,708
- Are you threatening us now?
I wouldn't if I were you.

433
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,333
DON'T YOU WORRY.

434
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,458
WE'LL TAKE VERY GOOD CARE
OF HER, I PROMISE.

435
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,458
- ( hangs up )
- ( dial tone )

436
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,583
- BASTARDS.

437
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,333
THEY'RE GONNA DIE!

438
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,416
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
WE NEED YOUR SKILLS.

439
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,708
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
WHERE THEY'RE HIDING?

440
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,041
- IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE.
- WELL, GET TO IT.

441
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,458
- HOLY-- ARE THOSE FROM
THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

442
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,125
AROUND THE SCHOOL?
- THAT'S WEIRD.

443
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,416
WHY DO THEY KEEP THE CAMERAS
SO LOW LIKE THAT?

444
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,750
- 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
I KEEP THEM.

445
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,375
I'VE SET UP VIDEO MONITORING IN
32 PLACES THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL.

446
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,458
- I DON'T SEE THEM.
DO YOU THINK THEY LEFT?

447
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,333
- I SET UP AUDIO TOO,
IN 57 PLACES.

448
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,125
- CHECK THAT.
MAYBE WE CAN HEAR 'EM.

449
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,458
- ( overlapping conversations )

450
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,625
Natsukawa: Now you're
asking for it.

451
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,333
Gonna make you
pay double this time.

452
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,208
Tsunemura: Don't threaten me
with a good time, buddy.

453
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,416
Look at your face.
You look so scared.

454
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,125
- Natsukawa: What did I
tell you? ( laughs )

455
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,416
- BINGO.

456
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,791
- CAN YOU TELL
WHERE THEY ARE THEN?

457
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,208
- P.E. STORAGE ROOM.

458
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,875
- LET'S GO.

459
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,500
- HEY.
- OH.

460
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,833
- ( girls scream )

461
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,750
- Boy: WHOA, MY RAMEN.

462
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,041
- WATCH IT.

463
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,750
- ( exclaims )

464
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,166
SORRY.

465
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,333
- MY CUTLETS.

466
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,041
- I'M UP.

467
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,625
- I'M ON THE WAY, MINAMI,
HIMEJI, WHOEVER.

468
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,666
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

469
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,708
- NO WAY.  HOW'D YOU KNOW
WHERE WE WERE?

470
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:32,166
- ( yells )

471
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,125
HIMEJI.  MINAMI.

472
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,083
- HEY, AKI.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

473
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,500
HIMEJI AND MINAMI
ARE STILL AT THE CAFE.

474
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,500
- HIDEYOSHI, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

475
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,500
- THEY SAID THEY WANTED
TO PLAY WITH ME.

476
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,583
I LIKE GAMES,
SO I FIGURED, WHY NOT?

477
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,833
- SAID THEY WANTED
TO PLAY WITH YOU, HUH?

478
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,333
- I HATE MY LIFE.

479
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,333
- Fukuhara: AND THAT CONCLUDED
THE FIRST DAY

480
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,333
OF THE REFRESHING FESTIVAL
FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR.

481
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,333
- DID WE MAKE
ANYTHING TODAY OR--?

482
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,625
- WHOA, AFTER WE
PAY EVERYTHING OFF,

483
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,916
WE HAVE EXACTLY ENOUGH
TO BUY NEW DESKS.

484
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,375
- REALLY?

485
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,125
- HOLD ON.  WHAT ARE THESE
HUGE SALES FROM?

486
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,125
- WOW, THAT'S A LOT.

487
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,125
OVER 500 SOLD,

488
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,875
"PHOTO COLLECTION 'A'
OF EXCLUSIVE SHOOT"

489
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,666
BY KOUTA TRADING
AND COMPANY.

490
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,208
- ALL SOLD OUT,
LIMITED EDITION.

491
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,208
- WELL, IN ANY CASE,
TODAY WAS A TOTAL SUCCESS.

492
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:32,291
- PRINCESS PEA HEAD, CONGRATS.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

493
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,166
- AWW, THANKS.
YOU TOO, HAZUKI.

494
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,625
YOU HELPED US OUT A LOT TODAY.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

495
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,666
- YEAH, A LOT OF THOSE SALES
WERE BECAUSE OF OUR

496
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,000
HOT WAITRESSES TOO.  YOU GUYS
WERE THE MAIN ATTRACTION.

497
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,583
- ALL RIGHT,
THE VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED.

498
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:47,583
SO I CHECKED THEM TWICE TO MAKE
SURE, AND THE WINNER IS...

499
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:00,583
- I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
A BAD SPORT.

500
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,458
I DIDN'T EXPECT US TO WIN.
- THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

501
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,416
HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS
TO MY SELF-ESTEEM?

502
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,916
- FIRST PLACE.
GOOD JOB, MAN.

503
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,041
I KNOW THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
VERY OFTEN.

504
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:14,708
- EVERYTHING'S WRONG HERE!
- STOP THE FUN!

505
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:17,791
LISTEN, TURDLINGS.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

506
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,833
I WENT TO TALK TO THE PRINCIPAL
TODAY ABOUT YOUR EQUIPMENT.

507
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:23,291
SHE SAID SHE'LL CONSIDER THIS
A SPECIAL CASE

508
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,791
AND WILL ALLOW YOU
TO USE YOUR PROFIT.

509
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,250
- ( cheering )

510
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,333
- I'M NOT DONE!
THERE'S ONE CONDITION.

511
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:33,333
THERE WILL BE
A SUMMONER TEST TOURNAMENT

512
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,958
ON THE SECOND DAY
OF THE FESTIVAL.

513
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,958
THE ONLY TEAM WHO WILL BE
ALLOWED TO PURCHASE

514
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,583
THE NEW EQUIPMENT
WILL BE THE ONE THAT WINS.

515
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,416
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

516
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,333
- IT'S A RANDOM TOURNAMENT
BETWEEN TWO SELECTED TEAMS.

517
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,000
THEY'LL KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT EACH OTHER

518
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,333
EXCEPT THAT
THEY'LL BE ENEMIES.

519
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,833
- THAT SUCKS.

520
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,958
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SHOULD WE DO IT?

521
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,041
- DUMB QUESTION.
OF COURSE WE SHOULD.

522
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,333
- IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE,
COME UP WITH A TEAM

523
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,250
AND REGISTER.
NOW GO AWAY!

524
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,708
- ( upbeat song playing )

525
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:37,958
- Fukuhara: AND SO THE DREAMS
OF YEAR 2, CLASS F

526
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:40,208
CARRIED ON
INTO THE NEXT DAY.

527
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,500
SPEAKING OF DREAMS,

528
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,416
HERE COMES SOMEONE
WHO IS CHASING ONE OF HIS OWN.

529
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,750
- ( sighs )

530
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,541
I CAN'T HELP BUT
WONDER WHO SHE WAS.

531
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,708
- CHECK IT OUT.  I'LL GIVE YOU
A DEAL IF YOU LIKE IT.

532
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,750
- THAT-- THAT'S HER.

533
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:03,791
- YES. HOW MUCH?

534
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,291
- HEY THERE.
KOUTA, ARE YOU SLINGING SMUT?

535
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:09,708
- YOSHII, NO.
SHE'S NOT-- IT!

536
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:13,166
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
TO ME, I PROMISE.
