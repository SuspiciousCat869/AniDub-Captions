1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,291
- HEY, YOSHII.

2
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,541
- SIR!

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,416
- SUMMON NOW.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,750
- Fukuhara: THE AVATAR
OF PROBATIONARY STUDENT

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,416
AKIHISA YOSHII
HAS SPECIAL SKILLS.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,916
NOT ONLY CAN HE ACTUALLY TOUCH
OBJECTS IN THE REAL WORLD,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,791
BUT BECAUSE HE HAS
HIGHLY INCREASED STRENGTH...

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,250
- GO GET THE WORLD MAP.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,625
- ALL RIGHT.

10
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,250
- Fukuhara: THE TEACHERS FORCE
HIM TO HELP WITH THEIR CHORES.

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,083
- YOSHII! THEY NEED
SIX MORE DESKS

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,875
IN THE AUDIO-VISUAL ROOM
RIGHT NOW.

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,583
YOSHII! THE SOCCER GOAL POST
NEEDS TO BE MOVED BACK.

14
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,458
- AGAIN? WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO GETS ORDERED AROUND?

15
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,250
- YOU'RE A PROBATIONARY STUDENT.
GET USED TO IT.

16
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,750
- MAN, THIS TOTALLY SUCKS.

17
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,041
- Fukuhara:
THE PROBATIONARY STUDENT

18
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:04,333
FEELS THE EXACT SAME
PAIN HIS AVATAR FEELS.

19
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,666
- YOU'VE GOT A POP
QUIZ COMING UP

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,458
SO BE SURE TO REVIEW WHAT
YOU'VE LEARNED SO FAR.

21
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,083
- I'LL POP YOUR QUIZ
NEXT TIME MISTER JERKFACE.

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,666
- IDIOT.

23
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,000
- ( theme song playing )

24
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,833
- Fukuhara: TODAY IS SUNDAY.
HOWEVER...

25
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,333
- THAT'S IT FOR TODAY.

26
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,708
BUT MAKE SURE YOU GO OVER
IT AGAIN WHEN YOU GET HOME.

27
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,250
- Students: YES, SIR .

28
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,541
- Fukuhara: BUT EVEN
ON A SUNDAY,

29
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,750
CLASS F SOMETIMES HAS A
REMEDIAL LESSON.

30
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,083
- HE'S GONE, YOSHII. NOW TELL
US WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

31
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,458
- WELL, I TRIED TO
KICK HIS FACE IN.

32
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,625
- IT APPEARS TO HAVE
BACKFIRED ON YOU.

33
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,041
( stomach rumbling )

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,333
- I'M SO HUNGRY.

35
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,500
MY STOMACH'S NOT USED
TO ALL THAT HEAVY LIFTING.

36
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,000
HE REALLY WORKED ME HARD.

37
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,833
- YOUR AVATAR SEEMS REALLY COOL
BUT HE'S KIND OF A DRAG.

38
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,125
- ( bell rings )

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,625
- YUUJI. LUNCHTIME.

40
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,416
- SHOUKO. WHY ARE YOU HERE?

41
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,666
CLASS A DOESN'T HAVE
REMEDIAL WORK, DO THEY?

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,833
- I WAS STUDYING BY MYSELF.

43
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,375
IF YOU'RE AT SCHOOL ON A SUNDAY
THEN I'LL BE AT SCHOOL TOO.

44
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,791
- HOW 'BOUT... 'DON'T'.

45
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,083
- I STAY AT HOME WHEN YOU DO,
EVEN DURING THE WEEK.

46
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,125
- I HOPE YOU MEAN YOUR HOME.

47
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,041
- LOOK WHO DECIDED TO MAKE
THEIR OWN LUNCH TODAY.

48
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,541
- WHAT IS THAT THING?

49
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,000
- ONE SIXTY-SEVENTH
OF A CUP OF NOODLES.

50
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,750
- WHY ONLY ONE SIXTY-SEVENTH?

51
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:52,458
- ONE HALF OF ONE HALF
OF ONE HALF OF ONE HALF...

52
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,083
- AKIHISA. THAT'S ONLY ONE
SIXTY-FOURTH, YOU GOOBER.

53
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,083
- YOU'RE NOT REALLY A WHIZ
WITH THE FRACTIONS, HUH?

54
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,500
- I'M ALL DONE EATING.

55
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,791
- THAT'S PATHETIC.

56
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,541
- A HOBO WOULD LAUGH
AT THAT LUNCH.

57
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,458
- SOMEBODY HAS TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

58
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,208
AKI, DO YOU WANT TO
SHARE MY LUNCH WITH ME?

59
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,416
- REALLY?

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,208
- YEAH, I MADE LIKE THIS
MASSIVE LUNCH TODAY

61
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,791
AND IT'D BE SILLY FOR
ME TO THROW IT OUT.

62
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,250
- DO YOU WANT SOME?
- OF COURSE!

63
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,375
- GIVE ME A SEC, OKAY?

64
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,625
MY BAD. LOOKS LIKE
I LEFT IT AT HOME.

65
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,208
- AW, MAN.

66
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,041
- AND AFTER I WORKED SO HARD...

67
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,208
- DON'T PRETEND.

68
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,125
IT'S AGAINST THE LAWS OF NATURE
FOR YOU TO DO GIRLIE THINGS

69
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,291
LIKE SHARE YOUR LUNCH
WITH A DUDE OR CROCHET.

70
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,250
IT'S LIKE A SPINE CRUSHING
PILE DRIVER!

71
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,916
I TOLD YOU THAT I JUST FORGOT
TO BRING IT! YOU IDIOT!

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,833
- CLOSER. LOWER.

73
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,083
- ( both grunting )

74
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,375
- LOOKING IS NOT ALLOWED.

75
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,958
- Yuuji: MY EYES!
MY FREAKIN EYES!

76
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,041
- IT'S CERTAINLY
NEVER BORING IN HERE.

77
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,750
- EXCUSE ME.

78
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,125
IS THIS THE CLASS
FOR ALL THE IDIOTS?

79
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,583
- HAZUKI? WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

80
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,625
- HEY, SIS...

81
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,000
- YOU'RE HAZUKI?

82
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,791
- YUP. AND YOU'RE THE IDIOT.

83
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,250
- IMPRESSIVE, MAN.

84
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,833
I DIDN'T THINK EVERYBODY
IN THE WHOLE WORLD

85
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,291
KNEW HOW STUPID YOU WERE.

86
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,791
- NOT THE WORLD, JUST THIS AREA.

87
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

88
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,833
- HEY, HAZUKI.
EXACTLY HOW DO YOU KNOW AKI?

89
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,208
- SIMPLE. HE'S GOING TO BE
MY HUSBAND SOMEDAY.

90
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,625
WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR A WHILE

91
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,375
AND LATELY WE'VE STARTED TO TALK
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED.

92
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,125
- All: WHAT?

93
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,416
- Fukuhara: THE TWO OF THEM
KNEW EACH OTHER BEFORE TODAY

94
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,416
BUT THAT'S A STORY I WILL
HAVE TO SAVE FOR ANOTHER TIME.

95
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,000
- OKAY AKI. WHAT'D YOU DO
TO MY SISTER?

96
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,333
- ORDER. THE INQUISITION
IS NOW IN SESSION.

97
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,875
- Akihisa: WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU GUYS DOING TO ME?

98
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,375
- THE INQUISITION
ACCUSES AKIHISA YOSHII,

99
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,625
OF BREAKING OUR BLOOD
BROTHERS BOND,

100
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,666
WHICH PROHIBITS US
FROM ALL CHICK STUFF

101
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,000
LIKE DATING OR FEELING THINGS.

102
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,416
HOW DO YOU FIND?

103
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,208
- All: GUILTY! GUILTY!

104
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,250
- ANY LAST WORDS
FROM THE DEFENDANT?

105
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,625
- LAST WORDS? WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE WHOLE TRIAL THING?

106
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,375
- GUILTY. DEATH PENALTY.

107
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,541
- SO WHAT GRADE
ARE YOU IN HAZUKI?

108
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,416
- I'M IN FIFTH GRADE!

109
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,000
- SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU'RE
WAY TOO SMART FOR THIS GUY.

110
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,375
- WOW. I REALLY LIKE
YOUR PINK HAIR.

111
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,791
- YOU'RE SO SWEET, HAZUKI.

112
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,208
- ( screams )

113
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,208
- WELL, WHAT BRINGS YOU
OUT THIS WAY?

114
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,333
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

115
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,333
HERE. YOU LEFT THESE
THIS MORNING.

116
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:21,958
- THE LUNCHES I MADE.
THANKS A LOT, HAZUKI. HOW SWEET.

117
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,250
I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT ME
MY REALLY BIG LUNCH.

118
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,583
- SEE? TOLD YOU I WASN'T LYING.

119
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,208
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF MAKING
LUNCHES AND ALL THAT STUFF.

120
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,625
- NOW I SEE. IT'S STARTING
TO MAKE SENSE.

121
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,125
YOU NEVER WAKE UP EARLY AND
YOU WERE TAKING SO MUCH TIME

122
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,333
GIGGLING AND MAKING NOISE
IN THE KITCHEN. I DIDN'T GET IT.

123
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,750
BUT NOW I SEE YOU WERE
DOING IT ALL FOR A...

124
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,416
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,958
SHE'S SO WEIRD.

126
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,375
- I KNOW. WHAT SHE'S TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT YOU GOT UP EARLY

127
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,791
TO MAKE LUNCH FOR YOSHII.

128
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,416
- AS IF! I WOULDN'T BOTHER
MAKING A LUNCH FOR AKI.

129
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,875
- WELL, WHY'D YOU
WAKE UP EARLY THEN?

130
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,541
- I DIDN'T MAKE AN EXTRA LUNCH.
IT'S A GERMAN TANK.

131
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,666
- I MAKE MODELS.
- A GERMAN TANK?

132
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,416
- A SWEET KING TIGER
AT ONE THIRTY-FIFTH SCALE.

133
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,000
- IT'S NOT FOOD?

134
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,166
- Yuuji: THAT SHOULD BE A TASTY
LUNCH AND IT'S BIGGER THAN

135
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,166
ONE SIXTY-FOURTH
OF A CUP OF NOODLES.

136
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,500
- WHO CARES HOW BIG IT IS?

137
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,250
- NEVER KNOW. IT MIGHT
BE GOOD, JUST SAYIN'.

138
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,166
- IT'S A PLASTIC MODEL.
I CAN'T EAT IT.

139
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,375
- NOBODY IS EATING MY ONE
THIRTY FIFTH KING TIGER TANK.

140
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,000
HAVEN'T THE GERMANS
BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH?

141
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,083
- HEY, IS SOMETHING
WRONG? HIMEJI?

142
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,375
- WHAT? NO.
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH ME.

143
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,541
- IS THAT YOUR LUNCH?

144
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,166
- YOU MADE YOUR LUNCH TODAY TOO?

145
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,875
- I DID. BUT I'M
TERRIBLE AT MAKING FOOD.

146
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,250
- ( stomach rumbling )

147
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,083
- OH, WOW.

148
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,250
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

149
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,166
I ACTUALLY MADE THIS
FOOD FOR YOSHII.

150
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,958
YOSHII, IF YOU'RE STILL HUNGRY
YOU CAN HAVE THIS.

151
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,000
- ORDER! THIS INQUISITION
IS NOW IN SESSION.

152
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,916
- Akihisa: HEY!
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,291
- Sugawa: GUILTY. DEATH PENALTY.

154
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,458
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M BEING ACCUSED OF.

155
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,500
- Mizuki: PLEASE DON'T!
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT!

156
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,750
WELL, UM...

157
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,041
YOU SEE, I...

158
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,500
GIVE ME A SECOND.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,666
YOU'RE ALL JUST STARING.

160
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,041
I MADE IT FOR...

161
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,583
- WE TORTURE FIRST, THEN DEATH!

162
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,416
- THAT'S A FRIKKIN
REAL FIRE PEOPLE!

163
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,041
( screaming )

164
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,166
- WHERE'S MY SISTER?

165
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,125
- IDIOT.

166
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,541
- Mizuki: BAKA AND TEST.

167
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,083
- I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE SMOKING.

168
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,250
- I'LL BE FINE.

169
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,250
BEING BURNED ALIVE
IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

170
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,166
FOR A BITE OF THE FOOD
YOU BROUGHT ME.

171
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,291
- SWEET. YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

172
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,666
I THOUGHT IF YOU ATE IT HERE,

173
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,708
WE WOULDN'T... YOU WOULDN'T
BE BOTHEREDBY ANYONE.

174
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,833
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

175
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,208
WHOA! THAT LOOKS SO GOOD!

176
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,833
- YOU'RE TOO NICE.

177
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,541
I TOTALLY FORGOT TO GET
YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK.

178
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,666
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

179
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
- HIMEJI, SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL

180
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,250
AND SMART AND ON
TOP OF EVERYTHING,

181
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,541
SHE'S AWESOME AT COOKING.

182
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,458
- Yuuji: IN OTHER WORDS,
TOO GOOD FOR YOU.

183
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,666
- STOP THAT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

184
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,500
- Hideyoshi: I THINK I SHOULD
TRY SOME AS WELL.

185
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,708
- HIDEYOSHI, NO!

186
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,166
DIAL IT DOWN.
WHEN DID YOU GET SO STINGY?

187
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,500
( choking )

188
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:29,833
- YUUJI?

189
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,958
HIDEYOSHI? WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU GUYS?

190
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,500
WE HAVE TO GET THEM TO THE
NURSE'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW, DUDE!

191
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,000
NOT KOUTA TOO!

192
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,125
NO, DON'T TELL ME.

193
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,583
THEY ALL ATE THE LUNCH.
WELL, THAT SUCKS.

194
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,250
IT LOOKED LIKE REALLY GOOD FOOD.

195
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:50,958
( exclaims in disgust )

196
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,833
( screams )

197
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,625
THAT WAS CLOSE.

198
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,750
THE HANDS OF DEATH
NEARLY TOOK AWAY MY SOUL.

199
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,208
THAT PROVES IT THEN. THEY'VE
ALL BEEN POISONED BY HER FOOD.

200
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,375
THE SMELL ALONE NEARLY KILLED
ME. I GUESS I'M LUCKY.

201
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,250
- AKIHISA.
- YOU'RE NOT DEAD!

202
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,750
- HIGH FIVE. COME ON. DON'T
LEAVE ME HANGING LIKE THIS.

203
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,583
- HIGH FIVE?

204
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,833
- IF THIS IS THE END FOR ME,

205
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,625
I WANT TO GO OUT WITH A
SEMBLANCE OF MACHISMO.

206
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,708
THOUGH PERHAPS I'VE DISPLAYED
ENOUGH THROUGH THE YEARS

207
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,625
IN MY CROCHET CIRCLE.

208
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,833
- OH, MAN. HER FOOD
HAS STARTED TO WARP HIS BRAIN.

209
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,583
- I MADE SOME OF MY SPECIAL TEA.

210
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,708
- THANKS, HIMEJI.

211
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,833
- WHAT'S WRONG?
ARE THEY ALL OKAY?

212
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,166
- THEY'RE FINE.

213
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,708
TAKING A NAP AFTER EATING
HELPS YOUR DIGESTION.

214
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,666
- IF YOU DO THAT YOU'LL END UP
GETTING AS FAT AS A COW.

215
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,000
- I'D RATHER BE A
COW EATING GRASS

216
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,166
THAN HAVE TO KILL MYSELF
EATING YOUR FOOD.

217
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,416
- HERE, HAVE SOME TEA.

218
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,625
- YOU MADE IT FOR ME
WITH YOUR VERY OWN HANDS.

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,208
THIS IS BAD. WHAT DO I DO?

220
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,125
( evil laughter )

221
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,458
- WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE EATING?

222
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,458
UH, NO. YOUR FOOD JUST LOOKS
TOO PRECIOUS TO EAT.

223
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,416
- I KNEW IT.
BRINGING YOU LUNCH WAS DUMB.

224
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,041
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS SO AWESOME OF YOU.

225
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,250
LOOK HOW HAPPY I AM.

226
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,541
- THAT'S GOOD.

227
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,875
- I'LL BET YOU'RE THE TYPE

228
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,541
WHO LIKES TO SNEAK LITTLE
NIBBLES OF YOUR COOKING

229
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
IN THE KITCHEN
WHILE YOU'RE MAKING IT?

230
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,833
- THEY SAY IF YOU EAT
WHILE YOU'RE COOKING

231
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,458
THAT YOU END UP GAINING WEIGHT.

232
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,791
AND BESIDES...

233
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,916
BESIDES WHAT?

234
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,666
- I WAS HOPING THAT YOU'D BE
THE VERY FIRST ONE TO TASTE IT.

235
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,500
- THERE'S NO ESCAPE NOW.
SHE HAS YOU TRAPPED.

236
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,083
WHAT A CRAPPY ANGEL. YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO AGREE WITH HIM!

237
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,583
- AKIHISA.
- YUUJI!

238
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,708
- HAVE A NICE NAP?

239
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,458
- YES, THANKS HIMEJI.

240
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,541
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

241
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,958
I REALLY HAVE A CRAVING FOR
SOME OOLONG TEA RIGHT NOW.

242
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,583
- SURE. I'D LOVE TO.

243
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,416
- WHAT DO I DO?

244
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,708
- MY FRIEND, LET ME GIVE YOU
SOME WORDS OF WISDOM.

245
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,833
LISTEN WELL.

246
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,000
SINCE ANCIENT TIMES
THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN SPICES

247
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,083
THAT WERE KNOWN TO ACT
AS ANTIDOTES.

248
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,791
AND BEFORE REFRIGERATION
WAS INVENTED,

249
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,750
SPICES WERE USED TO CURE FOODS

250
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,541
FOR STORAGE.

251
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,500
THAT SAID, WHEN IT COMES
TO A WOMAN AND HER COOKING,

252
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,708
THE ONE SPICE THAT ALWAYS RISES
ABOVE ALL OTHERS IS LOVE.

253
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,875
YOU MEAN I HAVE TO...

254
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,750
- THAT'S RIGHT, AMIGO.

255
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,625
YOU CAN NEUTRALIZE
THE POISON.

256
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,458
WITH YOUR LOVE.

257
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,166
- GOODBYE. I KNOW
WHAT TO DO NOW.

258
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,208
THIS IS JUST THE FIRST TEST
OF MY TRUEST LOVE.

259
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,000
I HAVE FAITH. ANY TRIALS I FACE,

260
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,375
I CAN OVERCOME WITH THE
STRENGTH OF MY HEART.

261
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,000
AS LONG AS I HAVE THE SPICE
OF LOVE STINKING UP MY SOUL,

262
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,625
THERE'S NO POISON
THAT CAN STOP ME!

263
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,791
LOVE DOESN'T PROTECT
AGAINST POISON. CHECK.

264
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,958
- AKIHISA WAS
SUCH A BRAVE FRIEND.

265
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,875
- AMEN.

266
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,416
- OH MY. WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOSHII WHILE I WAS GONE?

267
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,416
- HE SAID AFTER LUNCH
HE FELT LIKE A NAP.

268
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,125
- IF YOU SLEEP AFTER EATING,
YOU'LL BECOME AS FAT AS A COW.

269
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,666
- OH, YEAH. WHATEVER
HAPPENED TO SHIMADA?

270
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,541
- AFTER ALL THAT WORK,

271
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,416
I WISH I WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN
HONEST AND ASKED HIM TO EAT IT.

272
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,916
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,291
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY A SUBJECT
THAT HIMEJI IS BAD AT.

274
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,333
( stomach rumbling )

275
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,416
NOW I'M EVEN HUNGRIER
THAN I WAS BEFORE.

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,083
- AKI.

277
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,708
- HEY, STUPID, WAIT UP!

278
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,125
- HAZUKI, HEY.

279
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,583
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE MY SISTER MIGHT BE?

280
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,166
UH, COME TO THINK OF IT,
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

281
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,000
( stomach rumbling )

282
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,000
- DID YOU HAVE LUNCH?

283
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,541
- THERE'S BEEN A LOT GOING ON

284
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,166
SO I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD
ANYTHING CONSIDERED FOOD.

285
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,125
- THEN YOU MUST BE STARVING.

286
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,041
- MMM, YEAH. I SHOULD HAVE
EATEN MINAMI'S LUNCH EARLIER.

287
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,791
- YOU MEAN BIG SISTER'S?

288
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,250
- UH-HUH. IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN NICE TO SEE

289
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,458
WHAT KIND OF LUNCH
SHE COOKED UP.

290
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,833
I BET IT WAS GOOD.

291
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,583
- OKAY!

292
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,125
AKI! YOU CAN STILL HAVE THIS...

293
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,833
- HEY, BABY ITS LUNCHTIME!

294
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,166
- YOU NEED TO GET SOME FOOD.

295
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,833
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

296
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,166
I WORKED REALLY HARD MAKING
THIS SPECIAL LUNCH

297
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,958
JUST FOR MY GORGEOUS LADY!

298
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,083
- WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?
CLASS D'S NOT MEETING TODAY!

299
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,875
- WELL IF YOU'RE HERE ON A
SUNDAY, THEN I'LL BE HERE TOO.

300
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,250
I'LL STAY HOME WHEN YOU DO,
EVEN ON A WEEKDAY.

301
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,541
- WHY IS THIS STUPID ACADEMY

302
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,583
FULL OF FREAKIN'
SCHIZOID STALKERS?

303
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,000
- AW SWEETIE, CAN'T WE SPEND
AN AFTERNOON OF PURE BLISS

304
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,708
TOGETHER EATING LUNCH?

305
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,750
- I GUESS WE COULD CHECK
FOR HER OVER THAT WAY.

306
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,625
- LEAVE ME ALONE! NO!

307
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,125
GET AWAY FROM ME! GET! NO!

308
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,125
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HER PROBLEM IS.

309
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,541
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
SHY AROUND ME.

310
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,375
HONEY! SUGAR LIPS!

311
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,583
I REALLY DON'T LIKE HER.

312
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,750
FORGET IT, I HAVE TO FIND AKI.
HE'S WAY MORE IMPORTANT.

313
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,625
( panting )

314
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,791
- Hazuki: HI HO SILVER, AWAY!

315
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,875
FASTER! GO HORSEY! GO!

316
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,041
- WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO RUN IN THE HALLWAYS.

317
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,166
- ( laughing )

318
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,250
- AKI. NOW'S MY CHANCE.

319
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,583
NOTHING'S GOING TO GET
IN MY WAY THIS TIME.

320
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,708
- Sugawa: AND SO
THE TRUTH IS REVEALED.

321
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,416
YOSHII HAS HAD TWO GIRLS MAKING
LUNCH FOR HIM THIS ENTIRE TIME!

322
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I FIND THAT
TO BE UNFORGIVABLE.

323
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,291
I SAY DEATH TO THE TRAITOR!

324
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,166
- All: DEATH TO THE TRAITOR!

325
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,208
- HOLD ON. IT'S ALL
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

326
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,291
IT'S NOT TRUE.
I JUST...

327
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,833
WELL, I...

328
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,666
WELL, I...

329
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,875
( laughs )

330
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,791
- WHAT? HEY!
HOW DO YOU GUYS DO THAT!

331
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,708
LET ME GO! COME ON! YOU'RE
ALL A BUNCH OF MOUTH BREATHERS.

332
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,958
I CAN HEAR YOU!

333
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,166
- WHAT AM I TRYING TO DO HERE?

334
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,041
- Hazuki: GO HORSEY! GO! YAH!

335
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,916
FASTER! GO FASTER!

336
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,208
- RUNNING IN THE HALLWAYS
IS FROWNED UPON, HAZUKI.

337
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,125
- THIS ISN'T HALLWAY, SILLY.

338
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,666
- OH, YEAH. LOOKS LIKE
I'M RUNNING OUT OF GAS ALREADY.

339
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,083
- HE'S COMING RIGHT TOWARD ME.

340
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,208
AKI!

341
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,083
- MINAMI.
- THERE YOU ARE.

342
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,333
I'VE BEEN PLAYING HORSEY
WITH MR. DUM-DUM OVER THERE.

343
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,166
- THAT'S NICE.
BUT TRY NOT TO BUG HIM TOO MUCH.

344
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,416
- SURE.

345
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,541
- HEY, AKI.

346
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,125
DID YOU MANAGE
TO GET LUNCH TODAY?

347
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,875
I SORT OF HAD SOME.
BUT NOT REALLY MUCH.

348
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:12,583
I SEE. SO UH, DID YOU, UH...

349
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,000
WELL, IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT
STILL BE HUNGRY...

350
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,000
I THOUGHT... WUH...

351
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,291
- WUH?

352
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,958
WUH... DANG IT...

353
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,250
( stuttering )

354
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,916
WHAT FOOD DO YOU THINK
HOKAIDO'S BEST KNOWN FOR?

355
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,375
- ( screaming )

356
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,750
- EVERYBODY KNOWS HOKAIDO'S
BEST DISH, SOFT SHELL CRABS.

357
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,958
HEY, KUBO.

358
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,833
IT'S WEIRD SEEING PEOPLE UP HERE
ON A SUNDAY.

359
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,708
ARE YOU HERE STUDYING
BY YOURSELF?

360
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,583
CLASS F HAD SOME REMEDIAL WORK.

361
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,708
( stomach rumbling )

362
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,750
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU
HAVEN'T HAD LUNCH.

363
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,041
- YEAH. NO. NOT REALLY.

364
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,875
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO ACCOMPANY ME?

365
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,500
- YEAH. BUT I DON'T HAVE MONEY.

366
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,583
- OH, WELL, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

367
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,958
I SUPPOSE I CAN COVER YOU
SINCE ITS JUST LUNCH.

368
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,416
- HECK YEAH!
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

369
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,708
- I GUESS WE'LL SEE YOU LATER
THEN, SHIMADA.

370
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,166
I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA,

371
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,708
WE CAN QUIZ EACH OTHER FOR
MIDTERMS WHILE WE'RE EATING.

372
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,041
- MIDTERMS? UH, YEAH.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

373
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,166
- WELL, DID YOU EAT?

374
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,791
- NOT AT ALL. I WAS PLAYING WITH
STUPID-HEAD. I GUESS I FORGOT.

375
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,083
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE
SKIPPING MEALS.

376
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,083
IT'LL KEEP YOU FROM GROWING.

377
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,958
- DIDN'T YOU MAKE
THIS ONE FOR AKI?

378
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,791
- NO, GOOFBALL. WHY WOULD I DO
SOMETHING AS SILLY AS THAT?

379
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,625
I MADE IT FOR YOU.

380
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,541
- CAN WE EAT OURS TOGETHER?

381
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,666
- OF COURSE.

382
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,333
SORRY HAZUKI. I FORGOT I STILL
HAVE ANOTHER CLASS TO GO TO.

383
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,875
WHY DON'T YOU HEAD ON HOME?

384
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,125
- SURE. WATCH ME RUN FAST.

385
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,250
- MAN, I'D LOVE
TO SCARF LUNCH A

386
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,416
BUT I SHOULD
PROBABLY BE COOL

387
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,875
AND ORDER LUNCH B
SINCE IT'S CHEAPER.

388
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,208
- HEY, THERE, YOSHII.

389
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,458
- HEY, MR. FUKUHARA.

390
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,916
- PERFECT TIMING. I CAN'T SEEM
TO GET THIS LID TO OPEN UP.

391
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,375
WOULD YOU MIND
SUMMONING YOUR AVATAR

392
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,208
TO SEE IF HE CAN
GET IT OFF FOR ME?

393
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,458
- THAT'S A PIECE
OF CAKE FOR HIM.

394
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,041
I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR.
SUMMON!

395
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,500
OPEN!

396
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,333
( crying )

397
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,583
- THOSE WHO DIE GET
A REMEDIAL CLASS. YOSHII!

398
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,625
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. WHAT?

399
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,250
COME ON! I HAVEN'T
EVEN EATEN YET.

400
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,291
- I ONCE WENT SIX MONTHS

401
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,041
- HE'S SO CUTE. AND
HE DOESN'T KNOW IT.

402
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,250
- Akihisa: IT WASN'T EVEN
A REAL BATTLE!

403
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,750
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

404
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,083
- I WILL EAT NOW.

405
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,875
- WHY ARE YOU SUCH
A FREAKING SPAZ ALL THE TIME?

406
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,291
HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE?

407
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,750
IS ANYONE GONNA
MAKE LUNCH FOR YOU?

408
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,541
NO. YOU EAT LUNCH ALONE
BECAUSE YOU'RE A CHICKEN.

409
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,666
IDIOT.

410
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,583
- NO! NO! NO!

411
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,250
( panting )

412
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,125
- AKI.

413
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,458
- ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA TOSS THAT?

414
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,708
UH, YEAH.

415
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,541
- WELL IT'S JUST BECAUSE...

416
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,583
SOMETHING...

417
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,125
SEE, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO
AROUND WASTING STUFF LIKE THAT.

418
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,875
GLOBAL WARMING
IS KILLING OUR PLANET.

419
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,166
AND IF YOU THROW
THAT FOOD AWAY

420
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,916
THEN YOU'RE
A PLANET KILLER TOO

421
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,208
AND THE GHOST OF A DEAD HOMELESS
DUDE MIGHT HAUNT YOUR BATHTUB.

422
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,833
WHICH IS ALSO WHY YOU SHOULD
RECYCLE AND HUG A SPOTTED OWL

423
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,625
AND TRY TO STOP TALKING
SO MUCH IF YOU CAN,

424
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,166
IT'S MOSTLY HOW I FEEL.

425
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,416
- ( chuckles )

426
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,750
HERE.

427
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,125
DO YOU WANT IT?

428
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,625
YOU DON'T HAVE TO...

429
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,541
- WELL, I GUESS I COULD
TRY TO EAT IT.

430
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,250
I NEVER LIKE TO SEE FOOD WASTED.

431
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,458
MINAMI?

432
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,208
- IDIOT.

433
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,541
- ( theme song playing )

434
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,333
- Fukuhara: QUESTION 5.

435
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,833
WHAT DO YOU CALL THE
SPORT IN WHICH YOU GO

436
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,750
FROM CHECKPOINT TO CHECKPOINT
USING A MAP AND A COMPASS?

437
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,041
- Akihisa: ROLE-PLAYING GAME!

438
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,958
- I KNEW THAT WOULD BE
YOUR ANSWER.

439
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,666
- NEXT TIME! MAPS, TREASURES,
AND STRIKER SIGMA FIVE!

440
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,083
- THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
