1
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,375
Nishimura: IN THIS INFINITELY
LARGE UNIVERSE,

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,083
THERE EXISTS A PREP SCHOOL.

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,375
FUMIZUKI ACADEMY HAS
BEEN DESIGNED TO ENSURE

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,583
ITS STUDENTS CAN SURVIVE

5
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,208
TAKING FIERCELY COMPETITIVE
ENTRANCE EXAMS.

6
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,333
IT'S A SCHOOL FOR
ACADEMIC WARRIORS.

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,625
INTELLIGENCE IS THEIR
ONLY WEAPON.

8
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,958
EACH STUDENT PUTS THE
PRESTIGE OF THEIR ENTIRE SCHOOL

9
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,333
ON THE LINE

10
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,291
BY MAKING MAXIMAL USE
OF HIS OR HER BEST SUBJECTS,

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,833
THEREBY OVERRUNNING
COMPETITORS' STRATEGIES.

12
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,708
THOSE WITH THE MOST POWER
WILL WIN EACH MATCH

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,041
AS WELL AS ACCOLADES,

14
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,375
AND THE RIGHT TO ENJOY
A COMFORTABLE SCHOOL LIFE.

15
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,583
THOSE WHO FAIL WILL NOT
BE SO PRIVILEGED.

16
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,458
THEIR LIVES BECOME WHAT
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED

17
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,083
AS AN INDESCRIBABLE HELL.

18
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,875
THIS IS A STORY OF
ACADEMIC WARRIORS

19
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,666
WHO STOOD UP TO
SUCH A CRUEL FATE

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,250
WITH HIGH HOPES AND
CEREBRAL STEMS BLAZING.

21
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,583
AND HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED

22
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,625
WHEN THOSE SAME WARRIORS
LOST THE SUMMONER TEST WAR

23
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,583
ON A DAY THAT WAS
VERY MUCH LIKE TODAY.

24
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,458
- WHAT? HOW MUCH IS IT BEFORE
THE STUDENT DISCOUNT?

25
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,666
FOR A MEDIUM SODA? COME ON!

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,208
THEY BETTER BE DRIZZLING
THIS POPCORN WITH GOLD-SAUCE.

27
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,291
I'M SPENDING ALL THIS SO I CAN
HANG OUT FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS?

28
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,083
THESE THEATERS ARE FILLED
WITH EVIL AND HATE!

29
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,041
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,541
- UH, THINK ABOUT WHAT?

31
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,416
- THIS ONE. WANNA SEE IT?

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,125
- YEAH. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

33
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,583
WE'RE GONNA SEE THAT ONE, 'KAY?

34
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,625
- OH... I, UH...

35
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,250
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TWO
SEE IT WITHOUT ME?

36
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,583
- Both: WHAT? BUT WHY?

37
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,916
- FINE, WE'LL SEE AN ANIME.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,833
- THAT'S NOT IT!
IT'S NOT THE MOVIE!

39
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,750
- Yuuji: YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET OUT OF THIS, AKIHISA.

40
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,833
( all exclaiming )

41
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,458
WE'VE LOST THE BATTLE.
JUST ACCEPT IT.

42
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,750
- WHAT THE...
- YOU PICK.

43
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,083
WE'LL SEE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

44
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,250
- I WANNA SEE MY WRISTS.

45
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,666
- APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX.
GREAT CHOICE.

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,333
- OH, HELL NO! THAT THING
RUNS OVER THREE HOURS!

47
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,833
- WE'LL WATCH IT TWO TIMES.

48
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,500
- THAT'S LONGER THAN ALL
THE DAY'S CLASSES COMBINED!

49
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,750
- THEN IT'S PERFECT.

50
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,500
THIS'LL MAKE UP FOR ALL
THE TIME I USUALLY LOSE

51
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,291
WITH YOU SINCE WE'RE
IN DIFFERENT CLASSES.

52
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,375
- THAT'S IT, I'M OUT!

53
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,500
- OH, YEAH? I DON'T THINK SO.

54
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,916
( buzzing )

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,041
- YOU DON'T THINK WHAT?
OH, CRAP WHAT'S THAT?

56
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,916
( screams )

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,916
- NEXT TWO SHOWINGS.
TWO PLEASE.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,833
- 'KAY... ONE STUDENT
AND ONE PASSED OUT

59
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,458
TO WATCH IT TWICE
FOR NO REASON.

60
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,208
- AREN'T THEY JUST
PERFECT TOGETHER?

61
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,583
- THE PERFECT-EST!

62
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,291
- ( theme song playing )

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,458
- Nishimura: THIS IS
AKIHISA YOSHII.

64
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,458
HIS PARENTS
ARE WORKING OVERSEAS

65
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,208
AND HIS OLDER SISTER IS STUDYING
ABROAD WHICH MEANS HE IS, AGAIN,

66
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,666
ENJOYING ANOTHER MORNING
HERE AT HOME ALONE.

67
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,625
- HELLO BREAKFAST.
PREPARE TO DIE!

68
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,916
THANKS TO YOUR GREAT SACRIFICE,
DINNER WILL BE MASSIVE.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,041
HMM. WELL, MAYBE NOT MASSIVE,

70
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,041
BUT AT LEAST SLIGHTLY BIGGER
THAN THE BREAKFAST HALF.

71
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,250
- Nishimura: ENJOYING HIMSELF
A LITTLE TOO MUCH, PERHAPS.

72
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,166
- OH. HEY MR. FUKUHARA.
HOW'S IT GOING TODAY?

73
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,458
- AH, GOOD MORNING!

74
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,458
( screams )

75
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,458
- PLEASE DON'T BE BROKEN.
PLEASE DON'T BE BR...

76
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,250
- YOSHII! YOSHII FROM CLASS F!

77
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,875
- YEAH. YOU'RE KUBO
FROM CLASS A. THAT RIGHT?

78
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,250
- CORRECT. TOSHIMITSU KUBO.
SECOND YEAR, RANK TWO.

79
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,750
AND RUNNING LATE.

80
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,541
IF YOU'LL PLEASE EXCUSE ME
I MUST PREPARE FOR CLASS. LATER.

81
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,041
- HOLD ON!
- WHAT IS IT?

82
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,708
- UH, ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

83
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,208
- OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S CONTAMINATED.

84
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,250
- YEAH, GROSS. CAN I HAVE IT?

85
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,708
- PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE GONNA EAT THAT.

86
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,666
- WHY NOT?
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

87
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,708
OF COURSE. IT'S BECAUSE MY LIPS
HAVE ALREADY CARESSED IT.

88
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,458
THIRTY-SECOND RULE.
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.

89
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,458
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE THAT ANT.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,166
- ACTUALLY, I'D PREFER
THAT YOU NOT.

91
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,916
- WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,916
- THAT WAS A LITTLE FORWARD,
DON'T YOU THINK?

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,500
BESIDES, THERE ARE
OTHERS WATCHING.

94
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,416
- OH, RIGHT.
GUESS THAT'S TOO WEIRD.

95
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,625
- QUITE. SEE YOU
ANOTHER TIME THEN.

96
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,958
- SURE. BYE.

97
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,291
IT'S LUNCHTIME!

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,083
( groans )

99
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,166
- UH-OH. I THINK I STEPPED
IN SOMETHING.

100
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,583
- IT'S COOL. JUST MY LUNCH
BUT WHO NEEDS FOOD THESE DAYS?

101
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,708
- OH, GOOD MORNING!
HIMEJI?

102
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,916
- YES! A GOOD MORNING, I MEAN.

103
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,583
- THAT LETTER.

104
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,000
I WONDER IF IT'S
A LOVE NOTE FOR YUUJI.

105
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,333
BUT HE'S WITH SHOUKO SO THEN...

106
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,875
- WOW. LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO BE EARLY FOR A CHANGE.

107
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,333
SO HOW'D IT GO YESTERDAY?

108
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,583
- GREAT. I WATCHED A MOVIE

109
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,166
AND THEN MY FOOD BUDGET
DID A DISAPPEARING ACT.

110
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,125
YOU?

111
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,375
- I WOKE UP DURING THE SCENE

112
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,500
WHERE A BUFFALO WAS TIED
TO A POLE AND KILLED.

113
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,625
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
THE PERFECT TIME TO ESCAPE.

114
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,666
THEN AN ANGRY ELECTRIC SHOCK
KNOCKED ME UNCONSCIOUS AGAIN!

115
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,375
WHEN I WOKE UP, IT WAS
THE SAME BUFFALO SCENE!

116
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,125
- YOU REALLY WATCHED IT TWICE.

117
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,708
- SIX HOURS.
I GAVE UP TRYING TO RUN AWAY.

118
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,250
NOTHING IS WORTH
GETTING ELECTROCUTED

119
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,041
AND THE LAST THING I WANTED
WAS TO WAKE UP

120
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,958
TO THE WORST SCENE
IN CINEMATIC HISTORY.

121
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,583
- I'M SO SORRY. YOU NEVER
EVEN GOT TO SEE

122
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,500
THE FIRST HALF OF THE MOVIE.

123
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,916
- WHAT AM I GONNA
DO FOR FOOD

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,125
UNTIL MY PARENTS CAN
SEND MORE MONEY?

125
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,291
- YOU HAVE A CRAP TON
OF GAMES YOU CAN SELL.

126
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,791
- SACRILEGE!

127
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,250
THOSE ARE BRILLIANT WORKS
HATCHED FROM MINDS OF GENIUSES!

128
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,625
YOU CAN'T JUST TRADE THEM FOR
SOME NOODLES AND A SANDWICH!

129
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,291
- HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE
SAYING, "YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW?"

130
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,833
- YES! AND DON'T YOU LECTURE ME
MR. "I STILL HAVE FOOD!"

131
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,875
THIS IS LIFE OR DEATH HERE!

132
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,333
- AKIHISA, DO YOU HONESTLY
THINK YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE

133
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,291
WHO HAS ANY FEARS?

134
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,625
- I'M SORRY.

135
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,291
- IT'S OKAY.

136
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,083
- NO FREAKING WAY.

137
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,166
I DIDN'T THINK THEY
COULD FIND EQUIPMENT

138
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,958
THAT WAS WORSE THAN OURS.

139
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,750
GUESS WE HAVE YOU TO THANK!

140
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,416
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO US!

141
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,125
- THROWING A TANTRUM ISN'T
GOING TO CHANGE THINGS

142
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,250
AND, FOR THE RECORD,

143
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,541
IT WASN'T JUST ME,
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW!

144
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,208
- BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO LOST IT!

145
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,375
- AKI, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

146
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,625
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO POINT FINGERS AT ANYONE.

147
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,333
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US SCREWED
UP DURING THE WAR AT SOME POINT.

148
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,666
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

149
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,791
I'M SORRY, YUUJI.

150
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,333
IT WASN'T JUST YOU.

151
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,208
LADY MINAMI ALSO HELPED
TO TRANSFORM...

152
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,500
- "LADY MINAMI," HUH?
ARE YOUTRYING TO MOCK ME?

153
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,333
- YOU TOLD ME
TO CALL YOU THAT, REMEMBER?

154
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,041
- NO! JUST CALL ME MINAMI.
- I TAKE IT BACK!

155
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,958
MINAMI DIDN'T MAKE US LOSE,
SHE WAS JUST WRONG!

156
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,875
OW! STOP! YOU'RE SQUEEZING
MY TEMPLES TOO TIGHT!

157
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,125
- I'M GONNA GO BLIND.
- ALRIGHT. I'M BORED WITH THIS.

158
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,500
- I'M NOT WRONG!
WE WERE ALL COUNTING ON HIM!

159
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,125
IT WAS AN ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL LEVEL TEST

160
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,125
AND HE COULDN'T SCORE A HUNDRED?

161
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,250
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO HARD
ON POOR YUUJI.

162
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,041
I STILL LOVE THIS ROOM.

163
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,958
EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT LOOK
A LITTLE DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,708
- I KNEW IT. SHE LIKES YUUJI.

165
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:42,041
- AT LEAST IN THIS CLASS I CAN
CHOOSE TO SIT ANYWHERE I WANT.

166
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,625
- DING, DING, DING, DONG.

167
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,291
HEY! IT'S HOMEROOM TIME, KIDS!

168
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,500
EVERYONE HAVE A... OH!

169
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,833
YOU'RE ALREADY SITTING. PERFECT.

170
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,916
- ( giggles )

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
- UH, WHY ARE YOU HERE,
MR. NISHIMURA?

172
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,708
- WELL, WE FIGURED YOU WERE
TIRED OF BEING STUPID.

173
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,125
SO WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU
BRING UP YOUR POOR TEST SCORES.

174
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,583
SOMEONE CAME TO THE
BRILLIANT CONCLUSION

175
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,666
THAT SINCE I'M IN CHARGE
OF REMEDIAL CLASSES,

176
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,958
THAT I SHOULD ALSO BE
YOUR NEW HOMEROOM TEACHER.

177
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,083
- Students: OUR WHAT?

178
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,375
- LEAVING ME...

179
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,958
WELL, TO TAKE OVER THE ROLE
OF YOUR NARRATOR.

180
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,125
- OUR WHAT?

181
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,833
- IRON MAN'S OUR TEACHER NOW?

182
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,541
- PREPARE TO FLY VIGOROUSLY AND
MERCILESSLY THROUGH THE WRINGER.

183
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,375
- THEY SERIOUSLY WANT US TO BE
TAUGHT BY THE DEVIL EVERY DAY?

184
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,708
- Hideyoshi: IT'S ABUSIVE.

185
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,458
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS.

186
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,875
- THERE IS.

187
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,833
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGHT IN A
SUMMONER TEST WAR AND WIN.

188
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,958
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
- WHY NOT?

189
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,625
- THE RULES SAY THAT ONCE
A CLASS LOSES,

190
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,500
THEY CAN'T DECLARE WAR
FOR THREE MONTHS.

191
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,166
- THREE?
- YEP. BUT IT'LL GO BY FAST.

192
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,625
YOU'LL SEE.

193
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,208
PLENTY OF TIME FOR US
TO COME UP WITH A NEW STRATEGY.

194
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,541
- MY LIFE IS SO MUCH HARDER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S!

195
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,791
- LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, MAN.
- HMM?

196
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,625
- JUST FIVE HUNDRED YEN.

197
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,541
- HELL YEAH!
- PLEASURE AS ALWAYS.

198
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,125
- THIS IS AN ORIGINAL.
I CAN TELL. THANKS.

199
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,583
- SO MUCH FOR YOUR FOOD BUDGET.

200
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,500
- ( screaming )

201
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,916
- ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT
OVER THERE?

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,708
- I DON'T CARE!
I'M A MAN WITH NEEDS, DAMN IT!

203
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,083
- WHAT A BRAVE MAN.
- IT'S FINE.

204
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666
I'LL JUST LIVE ON ONE
CUP OF NOODLES A DAY

205
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,708
UNTIL I HAVE MORE MONEY.
TOTALLY WORTH IT!

206
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,083
- GREAT PLAN, BUT...

207
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,208
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'RE
PROBABLY NOT THINKING ABOUT.

208
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,250
- THERE YOU ARE! I'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

209
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,166
- YEAH, SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

210
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,291
WHERE ARE WE GOING THIS WEEKEND
AND WHAT TIME ARE WE MEETING?

211
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,000
- MEETING? WHAT?

212
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,791
- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
FORGET ABOUT THIS.

213
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,875
- I BELIEVE I SCORED
SOME CREPES, DIDN'T I?

214
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,833
- WHAT? BUT WAIT A MINUTE!

215
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,375
WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME I TOOK
YOU GUYS TO THE MOVIES?

216
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,375
- THAT WAS YESTERDAY,
I WAS PROMISED CREPES.

217
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,875
- OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN!
WOULD YOU MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

218
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,625
- PAY FOR BOTH OF YOU?

219
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,125
- WHILE WE'RE OUT, THERE'S THIS
REALLY GREAT MOVIE

220
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,208
I'VE BEEN DYING TO SEE
WITH YOU, YOSHII.

221
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,583
- YEAH, GREAT. MY FOOD BUDGET!

222
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,208
- Kouta: BAKA AND TEST.

223
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,583
- Fukuhara: IT'S BEEN
JUST ONE WEEK

224
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,833
SINCE THE NEW NARRATOR STARTED.

225
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,500
AND OUR CUP OF NOODLE
ARTISAN IS AT WORK EARLY.

226
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:03,083
- RIGHT THERE! NOW WE'VE
GOT DINNER AND... OH SNAP.

227
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,833
IF I ONLY EAT ONE HALF NOW, I'LL
HAVE THE OTHER HALF FOR LATER

228
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,958
AND I CAN MAKE TWO
HALVES OUT OF THAT.

229
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,208
AND THEN I'LL JUST CUT ANOTHER
HALF IN HALF AND HAVE TWO MORE,

230
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,583
WHICH MEANS IF I KEEP
DOING THAT,

231
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,500
I COULD PROBABLY CREATE
MILLIONS OF SMALL MEALS OUT

232
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,083
OF ONE CUP OF NOODLES

233
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,333
WHICH WOULD FEED ME FOREVER AND
THAT WOULD MAKE ME... A GENIUS.

234
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,125
- Fukuhara: HIS ENJOYMENT
WAS MULTIPLIED.

235
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,291
- OKAY THERE'S GOTTA
BE A WAY TO DO THIS

236
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,875
AND NOT COMPLETELY WASTE
MONEY, RIGHT?

237
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,375
OH, WAIT! PROBLEM SOLVED!

238
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,625
EVEN THOUGH I'M GOING
OUT TO MOVIES

239
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,083
AND BUYING OVERPRICED CREPES,

240
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,416
I'M DOING IT WITH GIRLS,

241
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,791
WHICH AUTOMATICALLY MAKES
IT A DATE, DOESN'T IT?

242
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,875
I RULE! I DIDN'T LOSE ANYTHING.

243
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,083
I'M JUST GOING ON A DATE!

244
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,791
SO, OF COURSE I'M SPENDING
A LITTLE EXTRA!

245
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,500
I'M THE GUY, THAT'S WHAT WE DO
ON DATES SO IT'S TOTALLY FINE!

246
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,833
HEY, HIMEJI!

247
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,416
NO WAY! IS THAT...

248
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,291
I WAS WRONG. THIS ISN'T A DATE.

249
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,916
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OVER THERE, AKI?

250
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,083
( giggles )

251
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,250
OH YA KNOW, JUST GETTING BEATEN
DOWN BY THE CRUELTY OF LIFE.

252
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,875
- HI, YOSHII!

253
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,666
- HEY MIZUKI! YOU LOOK ADORABLE
TODAY. I LOVE THAT OUTFIT.

254
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,875
- THANK YOU, THAT'S SO SWEET!
TOOK ME FOREVER TO DECIDE ON IT.

255
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,666
I WAS SO AFRAID
I WAS GONNA BE LATE!

256
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,000
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

257
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,916
I DIDN'T DECIDE ON THIS
'TILL I WAS OUT THE DOOR.

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,250
I'M SO GLAD THIS SHIRT
FROM LAST YEAR STILL FITS.

259
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,125
- YEAH. HAVING ETERNAL MOSQUITO
BITES PROBABLY HELPS THAT

260
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,291
AND MAKES IT OKAY FOR YOU

261
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,791
TO TWIST MY KNEES IN
THE WRONG DIRECT...

262
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,708
OW! I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH
WHAT I WAS SAYING!

263
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,875
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

264
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,541
I COULD SMELL YOUR
THOUGHTS AND THEY STINK!

265
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,625
- HAND ME THE ROPE!
- AW, PERFECT.

266
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,041
AND THAT'S NOT HALF BAD.

267
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,041
- AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
PERVERT DOING HERE?

268
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,333
- INDEPENDENT STUDY.

269
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,375
- WHICH ONE DO YOU
WANT TO SEE, YOSHII?

270
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,083
- YEAH, WE THOUGHT
WE'D LET YOU PICK TODAY.

271
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,208
- ME?

272
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,916
THEY'RE ALL
THE SAME PRICE, RIGHT?

273
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,791
SO SEEING THE LONGEST ONE THEY
HAVE IS PROBABLY THE BEST DEAL.

274
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,000
- TAKE YOUR PICK, YUUJI.

275
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,166
- ANY MOVIE THAT I WANT?

276
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,208
THERE ARE SO MANY,
I'LL HAVE TO THINK.

277
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,041
- Shoukao: WAR AND PEACE.
GOOD CHOICE.

278
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,291
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT!
IT'S A SEVEN HOUR FEATURE!

279
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,416
- WE'LL WATCH IT TWICE.

280
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,375
- NO! I CAN'T SIT STILL
FOR 14 HOURS!

281
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,000
- IF YOU GET BORED,
YOU CAN JUST TAKE A NAP.

282
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,250
- ( Yuuji screams )

283
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,958
- I'LL BE RIGHT HERE WITH YOU
SO IT'LL FEEL JUST AS NICE.

284
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,750
TWO STUDENTS,
FOR THE NEXT TWO SHOWINGS.

285
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,125
- 'KAY. THAT'S ONE STUDENT

286
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,791
AND ONE CUTE ZOMBIE TO WATCH
THE NEXT TWO SHOWINGS

287
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,708
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

288
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,875
- IT'S SO GREAT THEY'RE ABLE
TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS

289
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:22,916
TOWARD EACH OTHER.

290
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,041
- THEY'RE SO LUCKY!

291
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,833
- MAYBE THE SHORTER ONE
WOULD BE BETTER.

292
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,458
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET ANYTHING?

293
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,041
- THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

294
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,083
- OH, NO. SEE WHAT'S WEIRD
IS I'M ACTUALLY A FOOD SNOB.

295
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,250
AND I'M AFRAID THAT CREPES
JUST AREN'T MY THING.

296
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,666
LOOK, I GOTTA SAVE SOMETHING

297
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,375
OR I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE
ANY MONEY TO EAT TOMORROW.

298
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,416
- AW. WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

299
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I'M ALREADY PRETTY FULL
FROM THIS BANANA CREPE.

300
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,916
I WAS GONNA SEE IF YOU WANTED
TO HELP ME FINISH EATING IT.

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,375
- HUH?

302
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,750
- I WANTED YOU TO SHARE MY
STRAWBERRY CREPE TOO BUT...

303
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,500
IT'S TOO BAD THAT
YOU'RE A FOOD SNOB.

304
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,666
I HAD NO IDEA.

305
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,375
- BUT I GUESS YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

306
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,333
- OH, WELL. I'LL JUST
THROW OUT THE REST.

307
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,541
- ( crying )

308
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,333
- WHAT THE HECK
IS WRONG WITH ME?

309
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,375
HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?

310
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,541
I MISSED MY CHANCE TO SHARE
A CREPE KISS WITH HIMEJI!

311
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,666
ONE BITE OF HER CREPE
PROBABLY HAS MORE CALORIES

312
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,541
AND NUTRITION IN IT
THAN MY ENTIRE BREAKFAST!

313
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,500
- YOU SHOULD TRY IT.
ONE BITE WON'T KILL YOU.

314
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,583
OH COME ON. IT'S GOOD.

315
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,958
- WELL, I GUESS IF YOU INSIST.

316
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,791
- YOSHII WAIT!
I WANT YOU TO TRY MINE TOO!

317
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:28,666
- MINE FIRST!

318
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,791
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

319
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,291
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HE TRIES FIRST.

320
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,208
- Both: SAY, AH. AH!

321
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,583
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!

322
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,208
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING!

323
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,291
YOU WEREN'T REALLY GONNA LET
YOUR SWEET LIP-CARESSED FORK

324
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,791
COME IN CONTACT WITH
THAT FILTHY RAT

325
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,375
AND SHARE YOUR CREPE WITH HIM!

326
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,291
HE WAS HARASSING
YOU, WASN'T HE?

327
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,291
LISTEN UP, PIG! YOUR DISGUSTING
RUDE-BOY DAYS ARE OVER!

328
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,458
- WAIT. PIG?

329
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,250
- JUSTICE IS ABOUT TO BE SERVED!

330
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,916
- WHAT? ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

331
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,833
MOVE ! MOVE! MOVE!
MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!

332
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,375
( crying )

333
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,500
OH, NO! THE CREPES!

334
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,875
IT'S OKAY. IT HASN'T BEEN
30 SECONDS YET.

335
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,208
- JUST GIVE IT UP, PIG!

336
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,750
- MIHARU STOP IT!

337
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,083
- WAIT FOR ME, YOU GUYS!

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,916
- MY DEAR YOSHII.
YOU'VE MADE A MESS OF MY FACE.

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,833
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND!
WHAT DID I DO?

340
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,416
- NOTHING. SHE'S JUST CRAZY!

341
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,958
- YEAH, I GOT THAT.

342
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,291
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS?
HOW'S EVERYONE DOING TODAY?

343
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,250
- MAGICAL. COME ON.
WE GOTTA GO!

344
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,000
- WHAT THE...
- GET BACK HERE, PIG!

345
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,666
IF YOU GET ONE OUNCE
OF YOUR GROSS ON MY ANGEL...

346
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,958
I'LL BURN YOUR FILTHY BONES
TO A CRISP!

347
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,333
- WHAT? OH EXCUSE ME,
FOOD SNOB! WHAT'D I DO?

348
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,708
- NOTHING! I JUST DON'T WANT
HER TO BURN MY BONES.

349
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,166
- I'M GONNA GO OUT ON A LIMB

350
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,750
AND GUESS THAT YOU GUYS ARE
RUNNING AWAY FROM SOMEONE?

351
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,166
WE'RE TRYING, BUT THERE
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

352
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,166
AN EASY WAY TO DO THAT.

353
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,750
IF I COULD JUST USE MY
AVATAR RIGHT NOW

354
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,333
THAT WOULD SOLVE EVERYTHING.

355
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,000
- I'M SORRY. THE SUMMONING
SYSTEM WON'T WORK

356
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,333
OUTSIDE OF THE ACADEMY.

357
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,666
- LAME.

358
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,458
- IT'S A GOOD THING I JUST
HAPPEN TO HAVE A COSTUME

359
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,875
FROM DRAMA CLASS WITH ME.

360
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,875
YOU COULD PUT IT ON
AND USE IT AS A DISGUISE.

361
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,000
- THAT'S GENIUS.

362
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,458
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING
I SHOULD BE WEARING.

363
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,708
- OH. I HADN'T LOOKED.
I JUST ASSUMED IT WOULD WORK.

364
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,500
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE
IT'S MEANT FOR A GUY, DOES IT?

365
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,000
- OF COURSE NOT. IT'S SOMETHING
THAT WAS MEANT FOR YOU TO WEAR.

366
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,416
- I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT HE
LOOKS ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!

367
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,916
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO
MY BODY RIGHT NOW?

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,583
- I HATE IT! I HATE IT!
I HATE IT!

369
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,875
( girls giggling )

370
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,000
- Miharu: THERE YOU ARE!

371
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,000
I KNEW I'D FIND! WHAT THE
CRAP... IS THAT A DRESS?

372
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,041
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
DOES IT LOOK LIKE ONE?

373
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,166
- IF YOU THINK
DRESSING LIKE A GIRL

374
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,750
IS ALL IT'S GOING TO
TAKE TO REPLACE ME

375
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,458
IN MY HONEY MUFFIN'S EYES
YOU'RE NOT ONLY AN IDIOT,

376
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,750
YOU'RE A DEAD ONE!

377
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,625
- NO, WAIT,
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

378
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,583
- YEAH, STARTING WITH THE FACT
THAT I'M NOT INTO GIRLS.

379
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,791
- YOU TRIED TO COME
BETWEEN SOMETHING

380
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,333
THAT IS SACRED AND PURE.

381
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,875
AND NOW YOU'RE
GONNA PAY FOR IT!

382
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,666
- BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

383
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,000
- THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT
THE WAY I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

384
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,583
- Kouta: BUT IN SOME WAYS
IT WAS BETTER.

385
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,625
- SHE'S STILL BACK THERE.
WHAT DO WE DO?

386
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,250
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IF WE
SPLIT UP, IT'LL THROW HER OFF.

387
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,750
- WHAT? THAT'S JUST GONNA MAKE
IT EASIER FOR HER TO GET TO ME!

388
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,083
- I KNOW. WHY DON'T WE
GO TO THE ACADEMY?

389
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,625
WE CAN USE OUR AVATARS THERE!

390
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,958
- Both: GREAT IDEA, MIZUKI!

391
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:11,958
- YES!

392
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,833
A TEACHER!

393
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,625
- THAT'S MS. TAKEUCHI.
SHE TEACHES MODERN JAPANESE.

394
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,875
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK!

395
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,750
- YOU'LL BE FINE.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE!

396
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,583
- ( all panting )

397
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,083
- MS. TAKEUCHI, WE
WERE WONDERING

398
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,791
IF WE COULD PRACTICE AN ST WAR?

399
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,833
- OH, SURE! I DON'T
SEE WHY NOT!

400
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,625
- OKAY. TIME TO SUMMON
MY AVATAR! SUMMON!

401
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,750
- SUMMONING AVATAR!

402
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,291
SUMMON!

403
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,916
- AVATAR.

404
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,375
SUMMON!

405
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,291
HOW RUDE! I'LL TEACH YOU TO
COME BETWEEN ME AND MY LOVE!

406
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,666
SUMMON!

407
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,375
- WE'VE GOT HIMEJI'S AVATAR,
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

408
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,875
YOU GUYS READY
TO WIN THIS THING?

409
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,958
- I'M SO SORRY, SHIMIZU.

410
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,375
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA BE.

411
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,625
- ( screaming )

412
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,333
- WHAT?

413
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,416
- THOSE WHO DIED, MEET ME
IN THE REMEDIAL CLASSROOM!

414
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,458
- NOW? BUT IT'S A HOLIDAY!

415
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,333
- REMEDIAL CLASS WITH
THE DEVIL IS LIKE HEAVEN

416
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,708
WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

417
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,250
JUST ME AND MY SWEET MUFFIN!

418
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,666
- YOU KNOW, YOSHI,
SELF-DISCOVERY IS A GOOD THING.

419
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:36,958
- IT ISN'T MINE!

420
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,541
I'M SO EXHAUSTED.

421
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:47,458
- ME TOO. I WONDER IF MINAMI
AND MIHARU ARE OKAY.

422
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,166
- I'M SURE THAT WHACK
JOB'S PERFECTLY FINE

423
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,958
BEING ANYWHERE WITH MINAMI.

424
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,666
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

425
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,375
YOSHII, I'M SORRY.

426
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,666
I MEAN, I HAD A LOT OF FUN,

427
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,458
BUT IF WE HADN'T DRAGGED
YOU AROUND ALL DAY,

428
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,625
THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD TO DEAL WITH MIHARU.

429
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,166
- ITS OKAY. I HAD A LOT
OF FUN TODAY TOO,

430
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,333
'CAUSE I WAS WITH YOU.

431
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,458
- YOU'RE SWEET, YOSHII.
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.

432
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,250
EVER SINCE WE WERE
IN GRADE SCHOOL.

433
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,916
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT TIME
WE TOOK THE PLACEMENT TEST

434
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,125
AND I GOT REALLY SICK
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

435
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,916
I HAD TO LEAVE CLASS AND
YOU TOLD THE TEACHER

436
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,583
IT WASN'T FAIR TO GIVE ME A ZERO

437
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,125
BECAUSE I COULDN'T HELP IT.

438
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,416
- YEAH, AND THEN
HE WAS A JERK-WAD

439
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,625
AND SAID THAT STAYING HEALTHY

440
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,625
WAS LIKE PART OF THE TEST.

441
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,750
MAN, TALK ABOUT FAILURE, HUH?

442
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,916
- WHAT ABOUT THE ST WAR
WE DID THE OTHER DAY?

443
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,750
YOU SUGGESTED IT
WITH ME IN MIND, DIDN'T YOU?

444
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,916
- WHAT?

445
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,041
- YUUJI TOLD ME.

446
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,250
- HE DID?

447
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,458
- THANK YOU.

448
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,916
IT MADE ME HAPPY.

449
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,625
- SURE. UH, HIMEJI?

450
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,875
- YES?

451
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,166
- UH, I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT

452
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,541
THE LETTER YOU WERE
HOLDING THE OTHER DAY.

453
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,416
WHAT WAS IT REALLY?

454
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,916
YOU MEAN THIS ONE?

455
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,833
IT MIGHT SOUND SILLY, BUT IT'S A
CHAIN LETTER JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

456
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,125
- ( gasps )

457
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,166
- I'VE BEEN CURSED,
KEPT FORGETTING ABOUT IT.

458
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,375
YOU HAVE THREE DAYS TO MAIL IT

459
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,375
OR SOMETHING BAD'S
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

460
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:19,375
OR I GUESS, MAYBE I WAS
TOO AFRAID TO MAIL IT.

461
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,750
AND NOW IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.

462
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,333
AND I CAN TELL THAT THIS ONE
IS EXTRA CURSED, TOO.

463
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,291
I MEAN LOOK HOW MUCH
HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.

464
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,125
IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART
TO THINK THAT I'M THE ONE

465
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,625
WHO CAUSED ALL OF IT.

466
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,000
- SORRY. THAT BLOWS.

467
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,500
WELL, HEY, IF YOU WANT I CAN...

468
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,333
- YOU KNOW...
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

469
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,875
BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEDAY

470
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,208
I WON'T BE AFRAID ANYMORE AND
CAN MAIL IT MYSELF.

471
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,666
- I SEE.

472
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:55,625
- YOSHII, IT WOULD HELP IF
YOU WOULD BE THERE FOR ME.

473
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,250
- ALWAYS. I REALLY HOPE
IT WORKS OUT FOR YOU.

474
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,458
- THANK YOU SO MUCH!

475
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,166
- ( theme song playing )

476
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,458
- TIME FOR BREAKFAST!

477
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,375
- Fukuhara: DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT'S GOTTEN OLD YET.

478
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,333
- WHAT... THE?

479
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,666
"DEAR YOSHII,

480
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,666
I'M SURE THIS LETTER MAY COME AS
A SURPRISE TO YOU.

481
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,875
"I KNOW YOU'RE NOT ACCUSTOMED
TO RECEIVING SUCH THINGS,

482
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,458
"BUT IT IS THE ONLY WAY,

483
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,083
AND PERHAPS BEST WAY I CAN THINK
OF TO EXPRESS MY TRUE FEELINGS."

484
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,833
SO WAIT.
IT'S A LOVE LETTER!

485
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,958
"YOU'RE ALWAYS SO
CHEERFUL, THAT'S TRUE,

486
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,708
"AND I FIND THAT YOUR SMILE
NOT ONLY CARESSES MY SOUL,

487
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,875
AND WARMS MY HEART,

488
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,666
"BUT JUST ONE LOOK
SENDS A TINGLE TO MY...

489
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,666
"SOMEDAY I MIGHT BE MAN
ENOUGH TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS

490
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,916
TO YOU IN PERSON

491
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,916
"BUT UNTIL THEN TAKE
CARE OF YOURSELF.

492
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,166
"I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS,
DEAR, SWEET YOSHII."

493
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,208
( screams ) MAN ENOUGH?

494
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,916
IT'S FROM A GUY?

495
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,500
( sobbing )

496
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,333
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOIN? WHERE'D
THAT LETTER COME FROM?

497
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,125
- IT'S GONE! THE LETTER!
WHERE'D IT GO?

498
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,666
I JUST BOUGHT THAT PHOTO, TOO!
IT WAS AN ORIGINAL!

499
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,250
GREAT. OH WELL, GUESS IT'S
A GOOD THING I DECIDED

500
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,666
TO LEAVE THE
LETTER ANONYMOUS.

501
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,875
THIS COULD'VE BEEN BAD.

502
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,666
- NO WAY!

503
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:41,958
BEST OF LUCK, MAN.

504
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,916
- ( screaming )

505
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,708
HE FORGOT TO MENTION
THE ENCLOSED PHOTO.

506
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:48,833
- YOU'LL SEE.

507
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,000
SOMEDAY I'LL DO IT!

508
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,958
- Fukuhara: QUESTION FOUR.
IN A POPULAR MOTHER GOOSE RHYME,

509
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,208
WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS BEING

510
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,125
"MADE OF SUGAR, SPICE
AND EVERYTHING NICE?"

511
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,208
- Akihisa: CURRY AND RICE.

512
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,083
- LITTLE GIRLS.
BUT YES, FOOD IS NICE.

513
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,125
- NEXT TIME, "LOVE, SPICES,
AND BOXED LUNCHES!"

514
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,708
- THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
