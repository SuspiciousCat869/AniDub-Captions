1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,208
- LET ME THINK.

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,291
HOW SHOULD I DO THIS?

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,791
HMM.

4
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,916
I THINK I'LL MAKE IT FUN.

5
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,041
- ( murmuring )

6
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,541
- HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING, YUUJI?

7
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,166
- CLEARLY, SOMETHING'S GOING ON.
- WHAT KIND OF SOMETHING?

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,750
SPONSORED BY FUMIZUKI ACADEMY,

9
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:48,541

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,125

11
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,583

HAS FOUND A TREASURE.

12
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,000
- I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
I ATE THIS GOOD.

13
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,125
SURPRISE ATTACK!

14
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,375
( munching )

15
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,541
OH, MAN, THESE BREADCRUMBS ARE
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT THEY'D BE!

16
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,625
THEY TASTE JUST LIKE REAL BREAD!

17
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,250
I WISH I HAD SOME JELLY
OR SOMETHING.

18
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,958
THEN THIS BREAKFAST
WOULD BE PERFECT!

19
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,583
- Fukuhara: ONE MAN'S TRASH
IS ANOTHER MAN'S TREASURE.

20
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,000
- ( stomach growling )

21
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,166
MAN, I WONDER HOW LONG

22
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,458
THOSE BREADCRUMBS ARE
GOING TO LAST ME.

23
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,875
- Fukuhara: THIS IS FEE THE FOX.

24
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,750
A MASCOT CHARACTER
FOR THE LOCAL AMUSEMENT PARK.

25
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,750
SHE IS VERY POPULAR
AMONG YOUNG CHILDREN.

26
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,208
- HEY, THIS IS...

27
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,458
- I JUST EXPLAINED WHAT IT WAS
IN MY NARRATION.

28
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,750
- WHAT IF THE KID WHO DROPPED
THIS COMES BACK FOR IT?

29
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,458
THEY JUST MIGHT. I'LL LEAVE
IT HERE SO THEY CAN FIND IT.

30
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,041
- COME ON, WHERE ARE YOU?
WHERE DID YOU GO?

31
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,291
- WELL, HEY THERE, HAZUKI. WHAT
ARE YOU DOING ON THE GROUND?

32
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,250
- OH, HI, STUPID YOSHII!
HOW ARE YOU?

33
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,416
I DROPPED SOMETHING EARLIER,
SO I'M LOOKING.

34
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,916
- DID YOU FIND IT?

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,208
- NO. I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE!

36
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,916
IT WAS A LIMITED EDITION
FEE CELL PHONE STRAP.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,541
- NO WAY! I JUST SAW
ONE OF THOSE OVER THERE!

38
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,583
- I'M FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW!
- FEE!

39
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,458
- IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, YOSHII?

40
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:47,083
- OH, SWEET, MR. FUKUHARA?
NICE TIMING! I NEED MY AVATAR!

41
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,166
- AND WHY EXACTLY
DO YOU NEED IT?

42
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,416
- BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE!
IT'S AN EMERGENCY!

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,875
- YOU'RE OVERREACTING, BUT I'LL
APPROVE IT JUST THIS ONCE.

44
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,333
- ALL RIGHT! I'M ON THIS!
SUMMON!

45
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,458
NOW, GO BRING BACK FEE!

46
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,416
IT'S UP TO YOU!
DON'T LET IT DIE!

47
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,333
- ( crashing )
- ( Akihisa exclaiming )

48
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,416
( whimpering )

49
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,166
- ARE YOU OKAY?
MY GOODNESS, THAT WAS REAL DUMB.

50
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,250
- ( groaning ) YEAH, I KNOW.

51
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,791
- JUST WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
OR WERE YOU THINKING AT ALL?

52
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,166
- MORNING, PRINCIPAL.
HOW ARE YOU?

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,166
- THAT WAS IDIOTIC! YOU'VE BEEN
TOLD YOUR AVATAR IS NOT A TOY!

54
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,875
- I KNOW THAT. I'M NOT STUPID!
I WAS JUST TRYING TO RESCUE FEE.

55
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,500
- ( both gasp )

56
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,625
- ( Akihisa exclaiming )

57
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,958
- WELL, MAYBE THIS WILL
TEACH YOU

58
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,125
NOT TO GET TOO ATTACHED
TO CHILDISH THINGS.

59
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,583
- ( crying )

60
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,750
- OH, YEAH?

61
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:06,416
WELL, MAYBE THIS WILL TEACH
YOU NOT TO BE SO RUDE!

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,375
- I'M WITHDRAWING
MY SUMMONING APPROVAL.

63
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,541
YOU SHOULD NEVER USE YOUR
AVATAR FOR VIOLENCE, YOSHII.

64
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,875
- VIOLENCE? WHAT?
I WAS TRYING TO HELP HAZUKI!

65
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,958
- AVATARS WEREN'T MEANT TO
BE USED BY IDIOTS.

66
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,875
WHEN YOU'RE UPSET TRY MAKING
THE INTELLIGENT DECISION.

67
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,875
AND THEN YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY GET
SOMETHING YOU WANT FOR A CHANGE.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,416
- ( Hazuki sobbing )

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,916
- YOU ALL RIGHT, KIDDO?
- I'M FINE. DON'T WORRY.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,416
- SORRY.

71
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,875
- I WONDER IF THIS IS WHAT
THE PRINCIPAL WAS TALKING ABOUT.

72
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,083
- THEY'VE LISTED
ALL THE PRIZES RIGHT HERE.

73
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,583
- WHAT? FREE CAFETERIA
MEALS FOR A YEAR? NO WAY!

74
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,500
- BRAND NEW VIDEO GAMES?
- THIS SEEMS RATHER EXTRAVAGANT.

75
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,833
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.

76
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,250
IT SAYS THEY'RE ALSO GIVING
AWAY A SECRET ITEM.

77
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,833
- FEE, NOIN, AND EIN LIMITED
EDITION CELL PHONE STRAPS!

78
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,250
- GIVE ME! GIVE ME! GIVE ME!
- WHAT ARE YOU LIKE FIVE NOW?

79
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,458
WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU WANT
THOSE THINGS?

80
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,625
- WHY DO YOU CARE?

81
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,750
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET THEM!

82
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,666
- Hideyoshi: THIS IS A MAP
OF THE ACADEMY.

83
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,791
- Akihisa: SO, I HAVE TO
SEARCH FOR IT HERE?

84
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,750
THAT'S COOL. I'M REALLY GOOD AT
FINDING TREASURE BOXES IN RPG'S.

85
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,000
- Hideyoshi: AND THESE
ARE THE TEST QUESTIONS.

86
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,333
- CRAP.

87
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,875
- ANSWERING QUESTIONS WILL
GIVE YOU THE COORDINATES

88
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,375
TO THE PRIZE LOCATIONS.

89
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,333
THEY PUT TICKETS THERE
THAT YOU CAN EXCHANGE

90
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,666
- FOR WHATEVER IT IS
YOU ACTUALLY WON.

91
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,166
- THAT'S JUST GREAT.

92
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,333
YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO KNOW
STUFF IN ORDER TO WIN THINGS!

93
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,500
HOW LAME!

94
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,208
- THIS IS FIRST COME
FIRST SERVE.

95
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,083
BUT IF YOU RUN
INTO DIFFERENT TEAMS,

96
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,625
YOU CAN USE YOUR AVATARS TO TAKE
THEIR TICKETS AWAY FROM THEM.

97
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,250
- SO, BASICALLY THERE'S NO
WAY I'M GOING TO WIN

98
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,500
THIS STUPID THING.

99
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,500
HOLD ON! I'VE GOT HIMEJI!

100
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,333
- EVERYONE SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN.

101
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,125
CHECK THIS LIST TO FIND THE TEAM
YOU'LL BE ON FOR THE CONTEST.

102
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,083
- WHO'S ON MINE?
YUUJI AND HIDEYOSHI?

103
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,250
WAIT, WHO ARE THE GIRLS
PAIRED WITH? KOUTA! NO FAIR!

104
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,875
- I DECIDED TO GROUP
TROUBLED STUDENTS TOGETHER.

105
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,916
IT'S MORE FUN FOR ME THAT WAY.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,083
- WHAT! NO!
THAT'S JUST NOT FAIR!

107
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,125
I'LL TAKE HIDEYOSHI
SINCE HE'S CUTE.

108
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,916
BUT WHY WOULD YOU GIVE ME YUUJI?
HE'S NO HELP AT ALL!

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
- WHATEVER. LIKE WORKING WITH
YOU IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

110
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,791
- YOU HAVE UNTIL AFTER
THE SCHOOL BELL RINGS.

111
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,083
DON'T SCREW IT UP CLASS F!

112
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,833
YOU WILL BE GRADED ON THIS.

113
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,458
- Yuuji: EACH SET
HAS THREE QUESTIONS.

114
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,958
- THE ANSWER TO
THE FIRST QUESTION

115
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,958
SHOWS AN X-AXIS ON THE MAP.

116
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,458
THE SECOND ONE SHOWS
THE Y-POINT,

117
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,958
AND THE THIRD SHOWS THE Z,

118
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,500
WHICH WILL TELL US
WHAT FLOOR IT WILL BE ON.

119
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,250
- SWEETNESS! ALL OF THE
ANSWERS ARE MULTIPLE CHOICE!

120
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,916
PIECE OF CAKE, MY FRIENDS.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
-WHY, ARE YOU GOOD
AT MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS?

122
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,958
- I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
MY AREA OF SPECIALTY.

123
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,125
WELL, THEN,
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW I ROLL.

124
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,166
- YOU KNOW FOR A SECOND,

125
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,791
I ACTUALLY BELIEVED
YOU WERE SMART.

126
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,625
- I USE MY STRIKER SIGMA FIVE
FOR MATH!

127
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,958
FOR MODERN LANGUAGE,
THE PROBLEM BREAKER!

128
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:51,000
AND I USE THE SHINING FOR
HISTORY! THEY ALMOST NEVER FAIL!

129
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,625
- YEAH, I'M SURE THEY DON'T.

130
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,166
DID YOU USE THOSE TO FIGURE
OUT IF YOU LIKED HIMEJI?

131
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,416
- SHUT UP. JUST WATCH.
- DO WE HAVE TO?

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,625
- ROLL! STRIKER SIGMA FIVE!

133
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,250
FINISH!

134
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,000
HECK, YEAH! I GOT IT!

135
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,750
SIX-FIFTY-TWO FOR THE X-AXIS,
TWO-THIRTY-SEVEN FOR THE Y...

136
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,291
AND Z IS FIVE! FOUND IT!

137
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,833
THE TARGET IS OVER THERE!

138
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,875
- SO THE TARGET IS IN THE SKY?
- YOU CAN GO GET IT.

139
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,125
- THIS IS WEIRD.

140
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,375
I THINK THEY MUST HAVE
SCREWED UP THE QUESTION.

141
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,500
- IT'S NOT THE QUESTION
THAT'S SCREWED.

142
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,791
- Yuuko: WE FOUND IT!
- Aiko: COOL!

143
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,500
- YAY, US! WE FOUND
ONE OF THE WINNING TICKETS!

144
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,166
- I GUESS WE GOT
THE ANSWERS CORRECT!

145
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,583
- BECAUSE WE'RE AWESOME!

146
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,500
- WELL IT APPEARS YOUR X AND Y
NUMBERS WERE ACCURATE.

147
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,666
- SEE? I TOLD YOU STRIKER
SIGMA FIVE WAS INCREDIBLE!

148
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,291
- WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS
YOU BELIEVE THAT CRAP.

149
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,041
- IT'S A YEARS WORTH OF FREE
DESSERT FROM THE CAFETERIA!

150
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,541
- WE SHOULD SPLIT IT, YOU GUYS!
- I DON'T WANT IT.

151
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,958
- WHY NOT? YOU ON A DIET NOW?

152
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,416
- NO. INSTEAD, IF WE FIND THIS,
LET ME HAVE IT.

153
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,625
- YOU WANT TWO TICKETS SO YOU
CAN GO TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK?

154
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,458
- SHE'S GONNA TAKE
HER BOYFRIEND WITH HER!

155
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,750
- NO, I'M GOING TO TAKE
MY HUSBAND.

156
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,875
- I JUST GOT A REALLY
CREEPY CHILL.

157
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,041
- YOUR LIFE IS CERTAINLY
COMPLICATED.

158
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,750
- ( grunting ) BESIDES MATH,
I'VE GOT NOTHING!

159
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,125
WOW, YOU'RE ON FIRE.

160
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,291
- HEALTH AND PHYS ED.
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

161
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,375
- I'M ALL DONE!

162
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,875
- YOU'RE SO GOOD!
LET'S GO GET SOME TICKETS!

163
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,000
- WAIT! DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THIS IS?

164
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,000
WHOA. I'M GOING
IN THE GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM.

165
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,250
- COME ON!
WE'VE GOT PRIZES TO FIND!

166
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,750
- ( breathing heavily )

167
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,791
CAN'T BELIEVE I'M IN THE GIRLS'
LOCKER ROOM RIGHT NOW.

168
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,583
BUT WHERE ARE ALL THE GIRLS?

169
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,041
- Fukuhara: THEY'RE NOT HERE.

170
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,500
- THIS WOULD BE EASIER
IF IT WASN'T SO MESSY.

171
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,916
- YEAH, SOME CHICKS CAN BE HUGE
PIGS WHEN GUYS AREN'T AROUND,

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,125
YOU KNOW?

173
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,000
- NO VALUE HERE.
WHAT WITH NO GIRLS CHANGING.

174
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,875
- WHAT'S WRONG KOUTA?
YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.

175
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,875
- I'M JUST FINE!
AMAZING ACTUALLY.

176
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,916
- OH, NO! KOUTA!

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,750
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M STRONGER THAN THIS.

178
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,791
- KOUTA!

179
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,416
- Kouta: THIS IS HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

180
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,208
- WELL, NOW,

181
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,625
LET'S SEE WHAT AN IDIOT'S
DETERMINATION LOOKS LIKE.

182
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,000
- Minami: BAKA AND TEST!

183
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:00,500
- LET'S ROLL. PROBLEM BREAKER!

184
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,250
- SHOULD BE AROUND HERE.

185
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,000
- IN OUR CLASS?

186
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,916
WONDER WHAT THIS IS.

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,333
- WELL, GENIUS, ITS CLEARLY
NOT A TICKET.

188
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,583
- TALK ABOUT WEIRD.

189
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,958
MAYBE I SHOULD SHARPEN IT
DOWN OR SOMETHING.

190
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,375
- LIKE ALL THE WAY DOWN.

191
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,833
- OH, I GUESS YOU FOUND IT, HUH?

192
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THIS YOUR BASKET?

193
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,708
- UH-HUH. IN THE BASKET
THERE'S SOME... UH...

194
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,250
- YOSHII?
- YES? WHAT IS IT?

195
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,125
- I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU LIKED SWEETS AT ALL?

196
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,916
- YEP. I LOVE THEM.
- WONDERFUL!

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,708
BECAUSE INSIDE THE BASKET
ARE SOME DELICIOUS CHIFFON CAKES

198
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,541
I BAKED EARLIER THIS MORNING.

199
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,666
- WAIT, ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU
KNOW HOW TO BAKE STUFF, TOO?

200
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,375
DON'T TELL ME!

201
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,833
- THAT'S RIGHT, YOUR
LITTLE PROBLEM BREAKER,

202
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,583
IT REALLY DID FIND A PRIZE.

203
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,375
- YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SUCH A GREAT GUY.

204
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,208
- WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU.

205
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,833
- WHY ARE YOU ALL TALKING
LIKE YOU'RE AT MY FUNERAL?

206
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,708
- IF YOU BOYS ARE HUNGRY, YOU'RE
MORE THAN WELCOME TO HAVE ONE.

207
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,791
GO ON. EAT UP!

208
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,083
OH, I'M SO SORRY, BUT IT
LOOKS LIKE I'M SHORT A CAKE.

209
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,166
- ( all exclaiming )

210
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,708
- THERE ARE THREE CHIFFON CAKES,
BUT THERE ARE FOUR OF US!

211
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,208
THAT MEANS,
ONLY ONE CAN SURVIVE.

212
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,833
- ( crowd cheering )

213
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,500
- WELCOME TO THE FIRST
CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH,

214
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,583
GUYS AND GIRLS! ROCK, PAPER,
SCISSORS TO THE DEATH!

215
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,041
- ( cheering )

216
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,291
- IF I LOSE... I DIE!

217
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,125
- WHERE'D KOUTA AND MIZUKI GO?
THEY'VE BEEN GONE FOREVER.

218
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,375
- ( all grunting )

219
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,208
- MAN! THIS TOTALLY SUCKS!

220
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,041
I CAN'T ANSWER ALL THESE
QUESTIONS BY MYSELF!

221
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,583
- DON'T WORRY, BABY!
- MIHARU?

222
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,166
- I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

223
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,000
- I ANSWERED ALL YOUR QUESTIONS.
- HEY! STOP!

224
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,916
- OH, PLEASE DON'T
BE LIKE THAT, BABY!

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,375
DON'T YOU KNOW HOW HARD
I WORKED ON THOSE FOR YOU.

226
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,333
IF WE CHECK THE COORDINATES
TO THE ANSWERS AGAINST THE MAP,

227
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,916
I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE
HARD TO BELIEVE.

228
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
BUT IT TURNS OUT
THE BEST PRIZE CAN BE FOUND

229
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,875
- UNDERNEATH YOUR BRA!
- WHAT?

230
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,833
- YOU BETTER LET ME
SEARCH MYSELF.

231
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,833
I PROMISE TO BE
AS GENTLE AS I CAN.

232
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,208
- NO WAY FREAK JOB!
GET OFF OF ME!

233
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,625
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

234
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,875
REMEMBER WE'RE GOING TO BE
GRADED ON OUR PERFORMANCE.

235
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,958
THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE.
LUCKY FOR YOU I GOT HERE FIRST!

236
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,166
- YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.
STOP!

237
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,458
- WELL IF THAT'S TRUE,

238
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,416
THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL MAKE A
MISTAKE TOGETHER,

239
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,333
- DON'T YOU THINK, BABY?
- NO!

240
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,833
- SERIOUSLY,

241
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,708
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE WASTING
EVERYONE'S TIME LIKE THIS.

242
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,166
I'M HERE TO ADVANCE MY
EDUCATION NOT PLAY GAMES.

243
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,833
THE MAP POINTS
TO THESE COORDINATES.

244
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:08,750
THIS IS YOSHII'S SHOE LOCKER!
I CAN'T BE FOUND AROUND HERE!

245
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,750
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE NOW.

246
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,583
SOMEONE MIGHT THINK I'M ABOUT
TO PUT A LOVE LETTER IN THERE!

247
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:19,000
BUT STILL, I MEAN, I'M HERE AND
THE TICKET COULD BE INSIDE.

248
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,791
NO, STOP!

249
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,958
I GOT TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

250
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,500
NOW SOMEONE MIGHT
GET THE IMPRESSION

251
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:27,000
I'M ABOUT TO STEAL A LOVE LETTER
FROM HIS LOCKER INSTEAD! NO!

252
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,958
IT'S THE PRIZE IN HERE
I'M AFTER

253
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,583
AND THAT'S THE EXCUSE I'LL GIVE
IF ANYONE ASKS ME ABOUT IT!

254
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,250
BUT, WHAT IF IT'S
A CREEPY PERSON?

255
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,041
THEY COULD THINK WHATEVER
IS INSIDE HIS SHOE LOCKER

256
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,833
IS A PRIZE IN AND OF ITSELF!

257
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,291
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE
THAT KIND OF COMPETITION!

258
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:44,625
NO! WHAT NOW?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

259
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,291
- Fukuhara: YOU COULD
STOP SCREAMING.

260
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:51,791
- I SHALL TRY.
LET'S ROLL SHINING! ANSWER!

261
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,958
- HERE IT IS!
WAY TO GO, HIDEYOSHI!

262
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,291
- I DON'T BELIEVE I HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. HA!

263
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,166
- OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT.
WHAT? TRY AGAIN?

264
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,125
- SO THIS WASN'T
THE RIGHT PLACE AFTER ALL.

265
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,583
- SHOOT! I BET THEY GAVE US
A TRICK QUESTION.

266
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,250
- I GUESS YOUR MAGIC STICK
FAILED. SHOCKER.

267
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,625
- MAYBE I SHOULD CHANGE THE WAY
THE POINTY PART IS ANGLED.

268
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,833
- I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT
WILL INCREASE ITS ACCURACY.

269
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,041
- WELL, HOW ABOUT...
THIS? LOOK.

270
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,625
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
YOU ANSWERED THEM?

271
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,416
- YOU SURE YOU GOT
THEM RIGHT, YUUJI?

272
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,041
I MEAN, I DON'T
WANNA GO ANYWHERE WEIRD

273
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,291
BECAUSE THEY'RE WRONG.

274
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,125
- Yuuji: UNLIKE YOUR STUPID
PENCIL ANSWERS?

275
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,416
- WELL, ACCORDING TO YUUJI,
THIS SHOULD BE THE PLACE.

276
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,958
- YOU WERE RIGHT! IT'S HERE!

277
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,958
HEY, HOW'D YOU FIGURE OUT
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS?

278
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,583
- SIMPLE, I JUST LOOKED
FOR ALL THE ONES I KNEW

279
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,833
AND ONLY ANSWERED THOSE.

280
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,541
- I'M STILL FAIRLY
IMPRESSED THOUGH.

281
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,958
- BUT YOU'RE RANKED LIKE LAST
IN ALL THE TESTS...

282
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,833
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T CHEAT, YUUJI!

283
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,666
- HARD TO BELIEVE I MIGHT
KNOW SOMETHING?

284
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,333
- YOSHII. WHAT PRIZE DID WE WIN?
- LET'S SEE.

285
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,750
IT'S THE VIP TICKET
TO THAT AMUSEMENT PARK.

286
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,208
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR A COUPLE.

287
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,375
- ACCORDING TO THE TICKET,

288
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,750
THE COUPLE IS INVITED
TO A SPECIAL EVENT

289
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,625
REFERRED TO AS THE
WEDDING EXPERIENCE.

290
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,625
- NICE. THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

291
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,041
YUUJI, YOU WANNA USE IT
AND TAKE SHOUKO?

292
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,958
- PUT THAT AWAY
BEFORE SHE HEARS YOU!

293
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,625
IT WON'T JUST BE AN EXPERIENCE.
SHE'LL MAKE IT REAL!

294
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,833
GET THAT DISGUSTING
THING OUT OF MY FACE!

295
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,458
I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT!

296
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,083
- IF YOU'RE SURE. HIDEYOSHI?

297
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,791
YOU WANT TO GO WITH
ME ON SUNDAY?

298
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,208
- NO. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR A COUPLE!

299
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:19,041
- SO THEN ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE ME?

300
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,791
- I'M A GUY.

301
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,583
- REJECTED!
THE PAIN IS MAKING ME COLD.

302
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,291
I HAVE TO END THIS MISERY!
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY!

303
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,875
BUT HIDEYOSHI! I LIKE YOU!

304
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,625
- WHY ARE YOU ACTING
LIKE A JACKASS?

305
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,250
- HOW CAN YOU ASK
ME THAT QUESTION?

306
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,375
YOU KNOW WHY I'M DOING THIS.

307
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,833
IT'S CAUSE OF THE
LEGEND THAT SAYS

308
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,708
IF YOU CONFESS YOUR LOVE
UNDER A SPECIAL TREE,

309
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,125
YOU'LL NEVER FEEL PAIN AGAIN!

310
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,750
- THERE'S NO LEGEND LIKE THAT.

311
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,166
-THERE IS TOO. THE TREE WAS USED
TO BUILD OUR SCHOOL, DUH.

312
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,833
AND ACCORDING TO THE LEGEND,

313
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,083
HIDEYOSHI IS THE NAME
OF A HOT CHICK.

314
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,416
IN OTHER WORDS,

315
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,541
IF I CONFESS MY LOVE TO
HIDEYOSHI IN THIS SCHOOL,

316
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,958
I'LL BE HAPPY FOREVER!

317
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,958
- All: WHAT DID YOU SAY, YOSHII?

318
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,041
- THERE ARE SO MANY HOLES
IN THAT LOGIC,

319
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,541
- I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN.

320
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,375
- All: WE LOVE YOU,
HIDEYOSHI KINOSHITA!

321
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,958
- ( all chattering )

322
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,166
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HAVE YOU ALL GONE CRAZY?

323
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,750
- OF COURSE. EVERYTHING WE FOUND
WAS COMPLETELY WORTHLESS.

324
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,708
- THIS CHALLENGE IS DIFFICULT
FOR IDIOTS.

325
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,666
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE ARE
A LOT OF PRIZES LEFT ANYMORE.

326
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,291
- I WONDER WHAT THE SUPER SECRET
PRIZE MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

327
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,666
- HEY! NO ONE'S FOUND THE FEE
CELL PHONE STRAP YET!

328
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,875
- YOU WANT TO KEEP PLAYING?
REALLY?

329
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,791
- THE ONLY QUESTIONS REMAINING
ARE THE HARDEST ONES.

330
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,416
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D WANT TO
RANDOMLY DIG

331
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,333
THROUGH THE SCHOOLYARD FOR IT?

332
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:39,333
- RANDOM? MAYBE? I GOT IT!
I KNOW THE REST OF THE ANSWERS!

333
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

334
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,916
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

335
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,250
I'M CHOOSING EVERY SINGLE ANSWER
THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE TEST!

336
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,250
- EVERY ONE?

337
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,625
- BECAUSE, THERE'S
A TICKET HIDDEN

338
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,000
WHERE AT LEAST ONE OF THESE
X'S AND Y'S ARE CROSSED.

339
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,833
WHY DIDN'T I
THINK OF THIS BEFORE?

340
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,833
- WHAT ABOUT THE HEIGHT?
- EASY. CHECK ALL FLOORS!

341
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,375
- THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY.

342
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,583
WE CANNOT GO THROUGH ALL
OF THESE AND SEARCH THEM.

343
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,208
- SURE WE CAN. WE'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING ELSE, ARE WE?

344
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,375
- THIS IS UNREASONABLE.
- YEAH, IT IS,

345
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,625
BUT IT SOUNDS INTERESTING.

346
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,666
WE CAN'T SOLVE THE
QUESTIONS ANYWAY.

347
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,083
LET'S SHOW THIS SCHOOL
IDIOTS

348
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,833
CAN THINK OUTSIDE
OF THE BOX TOO!

349
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,208
- I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR IT.
- ME TOO.

350
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,958
LET'S GO!

351
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,333
- I'LL GO CHECK THE
FOURTH FLOOR!

352
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,750
AKIHISA, YOU'RE ON THE FIRST.

353
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,291
HIDEYOSHI, YOU TAKE THE SECOND!

354
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,625
- OKAY!
- GOT IT!

355
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,958
- CLEANING CLOSETS? NOPE!

356
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,833
- NOPE!
- NOPE!

357
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,375
- ( exclaims )

358
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,416
- NOPE!
- NOPE!

359
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,125
- OCCUPADO.
- LOCKER! NOPE!

360
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,458
- NOPE!
- A DOG?

361
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,833
- ( screaming )

362
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,375
- WHICH ONE?

363
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,916
- ( girls screaming )

364
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,791
- ( screaming )

365
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,916
- TRASH BIN!
- NOPE!

366
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,916
- NOPE! WHY ME?

367
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,791
- LADIES ROOM! NOPE!
- NOPE!

368
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,583
- OH?
- Toudou: SOMEONE IN HERE.

369
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,833
- FISH TANK! NOPE!
- NOPE!

370
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,166
- SON OF A...

371
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,000
- ONE MORE TIME! NOPE!
- NOPE!

372
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,291
- OCCUPADO.

373
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,791
- ONE MORE TIME!
- I'M IN HERE.

374
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,625
- I'M IN HERE.

375
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,708
- OH, GOOD. IT'S OPEN.

376
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,625
WHAT AM I DOING IN HERE?

377
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,083
- ( all panting )

378
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,125
- Yuuji: DAMN IT.
WE FOUND NOTHING!

379
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,875
- MAYBE THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LEFT.

380
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,791
- NO, WAIT! WE HAVEN'T
CHECKED UP HERE YET!

381
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,458
- BUT, WHERE COULD THEY HAVE
POSSIBLY HIDDEN SOMETHING?

382
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:32,083
- GET OUT OF TOWN. THE FEE
STRAP STILL HASN'T BEEN FOUND.

383
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,666
IT HAS TO BE HERE.

384
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,833
THIS IS IT! I WAS RIGHT!

385
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,250
CHECK THIS!

386
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,541
WE FOUND IT EVEN THOUGH WE
KNEW NONE OF THE ANSWERS!

387
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,000
- REALLY?

388
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,291
THAT'S FUNNY CONSIDERING I
FOUND IT BECAUSE I DID KNOW.

389
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,000
- ( gasping ) IT'S HER!

390
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,166
- YUUKO! WHY ARE YOU HERE?

391
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,500
- ACCORDING TO THE RULES,

392
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,125
WE CAN TAKE IT BY FIGHTING WITH
OUR AVATARS, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

393
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,166
- THIS IS BAD.
- I'LL APPROVE IT.

394
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,875
- Girls: SUMMON!

395
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,083
- Boys: SUMMON!

396
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,375
- THIS IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL WIN.

397
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,791
- WHO'D HAVE GUESSED WE'D END UP
HAVING TO FIGHT THESE GIRLS?

398
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,875
- YOU GUYS, WHAT NOW?

399
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,375
- WE WILL NOT HOLD BACK.

400
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,166
- ARE YOU JERKS READY?
- OKAY THEN, BYE-BYE!

401
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,000
- ( girls screaming )

402
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,625
- ( bell chiming )

403
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,750
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- YOU RAN OUT OF TIME.

404
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,166
- WAIT, DOES THAT MEAN...
- WE GOT IT!

405
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,833
- WE WON!
- YES. WE ROCK!

406
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,958
( laughing )

407
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,416
AWESOME!
IT'S THE FEE CELL STRAP!

408
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,291
OH, SWEET! IT'S A SET OF THREE!

409
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,375
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

410
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,708
- I CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE
THEM TO HAZUKI.

411
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,958
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

412
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,416
- Hideyoshi: MAYBE WE ENDED UP
WITH THE SECRET ITEM.

413
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,958
- I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO. LOOK, THERE'S A MANUAL.

414
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,750
"IRON BRACELETS... THEIR
ACTIVATION WORD IS, AWAKEN."

415
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,083
- THAT DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING.

416
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,666
- YEAH, WHAT HAPPENS AFTER
THEY ACTIVATE?

417
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,958
- WELL, LET'S TRY IT!

418
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,458
- All: AWAKEN!

419
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,833
- IT'S A FIELD!
- AND NO TEACHER!

420
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,041
- All: SUMMON!

421
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,625
- THIS IS BEYOND COOL!

422
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,083
- WITH THESE BRACELETS,

423
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,750
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SUMMON OUR
AVATARS WHENEVER WE WANT.

424
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,125
- THE FIELD MIGHT BE KIND OF
TINY, BUT WHO THE HECK CARES?

425
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,666
- HOLD ON! WHY DO MY CLOTHES
ALWAYS END UP TORN OFF?

426
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,416
- AKIHISA, NOTHING HAPPENED
TO YOURS, RIGHT?

427
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,208
- NO, I GUESS NOT.

428
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,250
- LOOKS LIKE ONLY AN IDIOT
CAN USE THEM.

429
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,541
- WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

430
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,583
YOU'RE AN IDIOT, TOO, YUUJI!

431
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,125
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
A FIRST RATE IDIOT.

432
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,291
- WHAT?

433
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,333
- AN ULTIMATE IDIOT.
- UH-UH!

434
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,625
- YOU'RE THE SUPREME IDIOT!
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

435
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,083
- INTERESTING.

436
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,833
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE STILL
IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE.

437
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,708
FUNNY.

438
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,625
BLUNT SCISSORS AND
FOOLS CAN BE VALUABLE

439
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,583
IF YOU MAKE WISE USE OF THEM.

440
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,583
REDEEMING QUALITIES CAN BE
FOUND ANYWHERE IN ANYONE.

441
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,000
- ( theme song playing )

442
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,125
- Fukuhara: QUESTION SIX.

443
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,708
WHAT STROKES DOES THE INDIVIDUAL
MEDLEY IN SWIMMING CONSIST OF?

444
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,625
- Akihisa: ANIME SONG MEDLEY,
POP MUSIC MEDLEY, AND CHOCOLATE!

445
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,666
- Fukuhara: I DO
HAPPEN TO LIKE CHOCOLATE.

446
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,333
- Akihisa: NEXT TIME, ME, POOLS,
AND SWIMSUIT PARADISES AND...

447
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,000
- Fukuhara: THIS WILL BE
ON THE TEST.
