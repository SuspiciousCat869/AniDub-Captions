1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,916
- ( insects chirping )
- ( dog barking )

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,500
- Fukuhara: BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
AKIHISA YOSHII WAS STUDYING.

3
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,625
- I'VE GOT TO WIN THAT SUMMONER
TEST TOURNAMENT TOMORROW

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,250
NO MATTER WHAT.

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,958
I HAVE TO, FOR HIMEJI'S SAKE.
WE CAN'T LOSE.

6
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,416
- NOW THEN, I'LL START
WITH JAPANESE HISTORY.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,333
I DON'T SUCK AT THAT.

8
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,375
- YOU'RE STUDYING SO HARD.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,875
GOOD BOY.

10
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,458
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,250
- I'M A NICE SISTER
WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU.

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,958
MY INITIAL PLAN WAS TO MAKE
SOMETHING HOMEMADE

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,833
FOR YOU TO EAT, BUT I DIDN'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME,

14
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,875
SO I HOPE THIS INSTANT RAMEN
WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH.

15
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:46,833
- WAIT, WHAT'S THAT?

16
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,416
- IT'S MAYONNAISE.
I WROTE ON IT TO LET YOU KNOW

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,250
I PUT MY WHOLE HEART
INTO MAKING IT

18
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,291
SO YOU'D BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR
WHOLE HEART INTO STUDYING.

19
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,666
- OH, HOW NICE.

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,750
- I WILL NEVER BACK DOWN
FROM A CHALLENGE.

21
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,000
- THANK YOU.

22
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,458
THIS SOUP KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF THAT SZECHWAN STYLE

23
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,083
SUPER-SPICY RAMEN,
EXCEPT NOT NEARLY AS SPICY.

24
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,375
IT'S SOUR BUT AT THE SAME TIME
HAS A FLAVOR

25
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,750
THAT MIGHT BE FROM A FRUIT
OR A VEGETABLE.

26
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,208
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
WAS IN THERE?

27
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,458
- AT FIRST I WROTE
ON THE NOODLES WITH KETCHUP,

28
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,458
BUT THEN IT GOT
ALL DISSOLVED ON ME.

29
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,625
- I THINK YOU FORGOT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOUP.

30
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,791
- WELL, WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
RICE BALLS INSTEAD?

31
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,875
- SURE.
THEY'RE NORMAL ENOUGH.

32
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,375
- OKAY, IT'S WRAPPED
WITH A PIECE OF SEAWEED

33
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,083
THAT STILL SMELLS
LIKE THE OCEAN.

34
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,083
MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT HAS
SO MUCH SALT IN IT.

35
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,708
THE RICE IS COOKED SLIGHTLY
SWEET AND FLUFFY SOFT.

36
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,208
BUT THIS TEXTURE IS,
WELL...

37
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,416
- HEY, AKIRA, WHY IS THE TEXTURE
OF THIS RICE BALL

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,166
NOT THE SAME AS LIKE
A REGULAR RICE BALL?

39
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,166
- DON'T WORRY,
I ALREADY KNOW

40
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,083
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
TO ME, AKI.  YOU'VE HEARD

41
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,500
OF THAT SPANISH DISH CALLED
PAELLA BEFORE, HAVEN'T YOU?

42
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,375
- YEAH, IT'S KIND OF
MY FAVORITE MEAL EVER.

43
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,958
- TO MAKE PAELLA TASTE THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO, THEY COOK

44
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,583
THE RICE AL DENTE, WHICH MEANS
THEY DON'T LET IT GET SOFT.

45
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,791
I PUT MY HEART INTO
NOT COOKING THE RICE

46
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,125
SO IT'D BE JUST LIKE YOUR
FAVORITE MEAL EVER.

47
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,125
AND VOILA-- LOOK AT ME.

48
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:03,416
APPARENTLY I DID IT PERFECT.
THE RICE IS AL DENTE, RIGHT?

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,583
- ( giggles )
- ( groans )

50
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,875
RICE BALLS AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE AL DENTE!

51
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,500
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO UNDERCOOK
RICE IN A RICE COOKER ANYWAY?

52
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,083
- Fukuhara: GOOD QUESTION.

53
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,541
THE WORLD IS FULL
OF MYSTERIES, ISN'T IT?

54
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,500
- ( upbeat song playing )

55
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,416
- Fukuhara: THE SECOND DAY
OF THE REFRESHING FESTIVAL.

56
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,708
- OKAY, GUYS,
THIS IS HOW MUCH WE SOLD.

57
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,291
- ( cheering )
- AND NOW, WITH ALL THE MONEY

58
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,291
WE MADE, WE CAN BUY SOME NEW
DESKS AND STUFF.

59
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,291
- NOT SO FAST.
WE CAN'T BUY ANYTHING

60
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,333
UNTIL WE GET APPROVAL.
- TO GET THAT APPROVAL,

61
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,125
WE HAVE TO WIN
THE SUMMONER TEST TOURNAMENT.

62
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,541
- IT'S THIS RANDOM STYLE
TOURNAMENT WITH TWO-PERSON TEAMS

63
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,166
THAT FIGHT OTHER
TWO-PERSON TEAMS.

64
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,083
HIMEJI AND MINAMI
WILL BE OUR MAIN DUO,

65
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,083
AND YOSHII AND I
WILL PLAY AS THEIR BACKUP.

66
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,208
- DOES THAT MEAN THE REST OF US
DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING?

67
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,916
- NOT AT ALL.
WE NEED YOU AND KOUTA.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,750
YOU TWO WILL HAVE
A SEPARATE MISSION.

69
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,000
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
WE'LL SO ROCK THIS.

70
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,666
- HEY, IF WE DO REALLY WELL, WE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE EVERYONE

71
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,375
RESPECT CLASS F
A LITTLE BIT MORE TOO.

72
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,750
- WE HAVE TO WIN IF WE WANT
TO STOP HIMEJI'S PARENTS

73
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,625
FROM MAKING HER
SWITCH SCHOOLS.

74
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,166
- YOU PROMISED TO STUDY.

75
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,958
PLEASE TELL ME YOU WERE
TELLING THE TRUTH, AKI.

76
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,166
- UNLESS YOU BRING UP YOUR
SCORES IN THE RECOVERY TEST

77
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,041
BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT STARTS,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

78
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,833
TO COMPETE, YOU KNOW.
- I'M GOOD.

79
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,666
I STUDIED WITH AN EXTRA EMPHASIS
ON JAPANESE HISTORY.

80
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,208
- THAT'S GREAT.
HERE, CHECK THIS OUT.

81
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,750
- I DON'T GET IT.

82
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,958
- JAPANESE HISTORY ISN'T
ON THE LIST FOR THE TOURNAMENT.

83
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,416
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THAT?

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,875
- Nishimura:
WE WILL NOW GET

85
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,208
THE SUMMONER TEST TOURNAMENT
UNDERWAY!

86
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,625
- ( fanfare )

87
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,583
- HOORAY, WE'RE HERE TODAY AT
THE SUMMONER TEST TOURNAMENT.

88
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,625
IT'S THE MAIN EVENT OF THIS
YEAR'S REFRESHING FESTIVAL.

89
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,458
ANY THOUGHTS YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE
WITH US, MISS TAKAHASHI?

90
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,000
- MY PREDOMINANT
THOUGHT IS

91
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,791
I'D LIKE TO SEE OUR STUDENTS
DO THEIR BEST.

92
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,916
- Nishimura: IN THE BLUE CORNER,
FROM YEAR TWO, CLASS F,

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,875
YUUJI SAKAMOTO
AND AKIHISA YOSHII!

94
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,625
- IT'S ON,
LIKE DONKEY KONG.

95
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,625
- YEAH.
- OH, COME ON.

96
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,291
DON'T GIVE UP JUST BECAUSE YOU
PROBABLY ALREADY MADE US LOSE.

97
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,208
- AND IN THE RED CORNER...

98
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,000
- YOU SEE?
STOP BEING A CHICK.

99
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,541
WE'RE STARTING
WITH CLASS E.

100
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,333
THOSE GUYS ARE ALMOST
AS STUPID AS YOU ARE.

101
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,000
- THAT'S TRUE.  I GUESS
WE'VE FOUGHT THEM BEFORE,

102
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,791
SO WE MIGHT WIN IF WE DON'T
SCREW UP TOO MUCH.

103
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,791
- ...YEAR 2, CLASS B,

104
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,500
RITSUKO IWASHITA
AND MAYUMI KIKURI.

105
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,333
- SAY WHAT?
THEY CHANGED IT.

106
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,750
- WE HAVE TO FIGHT
CLASS B?

107
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,875
- HOLD THE PHONE!
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

108
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,083
- I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
FIGHT SOMEONE FROM CLASS E.

109
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,083
- SORRY.  I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT HAPPENED.

110
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,833
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

111
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,791
- LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME KIND
OF MECHANICAL ISSUE.

112
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,333
- WELL, THEN TAKE CARE OF IT.
WE'VE GOT OTHER MATCHES TOO.

113
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,833
- THEY'RE IDIOTS.
AT LEAST WE'LL WIN.

114
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,333
- YEAH, MIGHT AS WELL
GET IT OVER WITH.

115
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,750
- WOW, THIS WAS SURE UNEXPECTED.
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, YUUJI?

116
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,125
- NO CHOICE.
WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS THING.

117
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,750
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
WILL HAPPEN, MISS TAKAHASHI?

118
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,458
- WE'VE JUST STARTED
THE TOURNAMENT,

119
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,666
SO MANY OF THE BATTLES WILL BE
SIMILARLY UNBALANCED.

120
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,291
THIS ONE IS
F VERSUS B,

121
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,375
SO I HIGHLY DOUBT
IT'LL BE MUCH OF A FIGHT.

122
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,375
- Nishimura: THE SUBJECT
FOR THIS ROUND IS...

123
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,500
MATH!  BEGIN.

124
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,291
- SUMMON!

125
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,583
- SUMMON!

126
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,791
- NOT BAD, BUT I'D EXPECT
AS MUCH FROM CLASS B.

127
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,291
OUR TURN.

128
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,625
SUMMON!

129
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,958
- NICELY DONE, YUUJI.

130
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,666
HOW COME YOU HAVE
SUCH A HIGH SCORE?

131
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,375
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
I'VE BEEN STUDYING NONSTOP

132
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,291
SINCE I FOUND OUT WE NEEDED
TO WIN THE TOURNAMENT.

133
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,750
- WE'D HAVE TO BEAT
CLASS A.

134
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,791
YUUJI, YOU REALLY THINK
WE'LL GO THAT FAR?

135
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,791
- WE HAVE TO.
- FOR SHOUKO?

136
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,791
- ( bell ringing )
- Shouko: HERE COMES THE BRIDE.

137
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,625
- SHE ASKED ME WHERE I WANT
TO HAVE OUR WEDDING.

138
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,000
THIS IS IT.  IF I DON'T WIN,
MY LIFE MIGHT AS WELL BE OVER.

139
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,500
I'VE GOT TO SHOW HER
I'M THE ONE IN CHARGE FOR ONCE.

140
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,750
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK
WE CAN BEAT THEM.

141
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,166
- DUDE, YOU'RE
IN THE SAME BOAT AS ME.

142
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,750
NOW PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
AND GET ONBOARD, DAMN IT.

143
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,750
- OKAY, YUUJI.
LET'S TAKE THOSE B-GIRLS DOWN.

144
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,250
SUMMON!

145
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,708
- NOT WITH THAT SCORE,
WE WON'T.

146
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,125
- SHUT UP.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

147
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,916
- OH, LOOK,
THEY'RE NO MATCH FOR US.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,458
ARE YOU AS SHOCKED AS I AM?
- CAN BARELY CONTAIN MYSELF.

149
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,541
WE SHOULD GIVE 'EM A BREAK
AND END IT FAST.

150
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,125
RITSUKO.
- MAYUMI.

151
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,333
- Together: READY, SET, GO!

152
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,875
- HOW NICE.  YOU SEEM TO BE
IN SYNC FOR THE MOST PART.

153
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,666
- FOR A COUPLE OF CHICKS
WHO'RE ACTING LIKE THEY'RE NOT

154
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,833
FRENEMIES, YOU GIRLS ARE
PULLING OFF A BANG-UP JOB.

155
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,000
- PREPARE YOURSELVES, LADIES,
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET

156
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,875
A LOAD OF REAL TEAMWORK
RIGHT IN THE FACE.

157
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,000
- ALL RIGHT, AKIHISA.
- YUUJI.

158
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,708
- Together: THEY'RE ALL YOURS.

159
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,791
- HUH?
- WE CAN'T LEAVE IT

160
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,916
UP TO EACH OTHER.
THEN NO ONE'S DOING ANYTHING.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,583
- YOU TOOK MY LINE,
YOU DEMENTED BONEHEAD.

162
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,750
- SO IT APPEARS OUR TEAMWORK MAY
BE ON PAR WITH YOURS AFTER ALL.

163
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,875
- Girls: WHAT?
- AKI, SHUT UP.

164
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,458
IT'S TIME FOR SOME STRATEGY.
- UH, STRATE-WHAT?

165
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,916
- WHILE AKIHISA ATTRACTS
ONE OF THE GIRLS' ATTENTION.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,666
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MOVE
AND TAKE DOWN THE OTHER ONE.

167
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,125
- HOW CAN I DO THAT?
BOTH OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE ME!

168
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,541
- BE LIKE THAT THEN.

169
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,083
FINE, I GUESS WE CAN
JUST FIGHT TOGETHER.

170
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,625
- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
FIGHT TOGETHER.

171
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,458
- I'LL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE ATTACKING.

172
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,083
YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN
TO BE THE SHIELD.

173
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,833
- BUT IF I DO THAT,
I'M GONNA GET HURT!

174
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,041
I FEEL WHAT HAPPENS
TO MY AVATAR, REMEMBER?

175
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,041
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TERM
"TEAM PLAYER."

176
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,333
SINCE YOU DON'T GET IT, WE'LL
HAVE TO FIGHT HEAD TO HEAD.

177
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,375
- WHAT A GREAT IDEA.

178
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,416
- YE GODS.
- HIYAH!

179
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,041
- WHAT'S WRONG?
I'M NOT HITTING HIM.

180
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,791
- Fukuhara: A PROBATIONARY
STUDENT,

181
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,875
AKIHISA IS ACCUSTOMED TO USING
HIS AVATAR FOR CHORES.

182
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,125
THAT HAS MADE HIM QUITE ADEPT AT
MOVING HIS AVATAR QUICK AS HELL.

183
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,583
- ALL RIGHT, MY TURN.

184
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,083
KA-POW!

185
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,708
YES!
HOW ARE YOU DOING, BRO?

186
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,291
- NO.  THIS IS BAD.

187
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,333
- IN YOUR FACES!
- SUCK IT, LOSERS!

188
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,666
- ( crowd murmuring )

189
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,541
- SO, UH, JUST ME, OR DOES THIS
MAKE US LOOK LIKE JERKS?

190
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,291
- THIS IS NOT WHAT I WOULD CALL
A PROUD MOMENT FOR OUR SCHOOL.

191
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,791
- AS AN EDUCATOR, THE ONLY
RESPONSIBLE RESPONSE

192
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,833
I CAN HAVE IS TO HOPE
THE SAKAMOTO-YOSHII DUO LOSES.

193
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,541
- YOU WHAT?
NO FAIR.

194
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,375
YAY.
- THE WINNER IS

195
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,083
THE SAKAMOTO-YOSHII TEAM
IN THE BLUE CORNER!

196
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,958
- OH MY GOD,
THAT WAS AWFUL.

197
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,791
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO
EMBARRASSED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

198
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,416
- ( crowd yelling, booing )

199
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,833
- AWW, MAN, PEOPLE CAN BE
SO HARSH SOMETIMES.

200
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,208
- WE WON THIS ROUND, YAY.

201
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,875
- Fukuhara: AND SO,
BATTLE AFTER BATTLE

202
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,625
WAS FOUGHT
IN THE FIRST ROUND.

203
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,833
THE LOSING TEAMS
WERE DISQUALIFIED.

204
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,916
- Nishimura: IN THE BLUE CORNER,

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,583
FROM YEAR 2, CLASS F,

206
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,166
YUUJI SAKAMOTO
AND AKIHISA YOSHII

207
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,750
UP AGAINST,
YEAR 2, CLASS C,

208
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,083
KYOUJI NEMOTO
AND YUUKA KOYAMA.

209
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,708
- WE'RE FIGHTING
CLASS B AGAIN?

210
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,291
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
- SO WE'RE TAKING ON NEMOTO.

211
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,875
- YOSHII AND SAKAMOTO?  NO.
HOW DID WE END UP WITH YOU?

212
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,583
- WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF,
KYOUJI?

213
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,458
THEY'RE TWO OF THE DUMBEST KIDS
IN THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

214
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,041
YOU KNOW THIS BATTLE IS,
LIKE, TOTALLY IN THE BAG.

215
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,541
- YEAH, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

216
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,666
- THE SUBJECT THIS ROUND IS...

217
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,375
ENGLISH!  BEGIN.

218
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,541
All: SUMMON!

219
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,916
- YUUJI.
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU, AKI?

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,791
YOU SAID YOU'D BEEN
STUDYING NONSTOP

221
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,208
SO WE COULD BEAT
CLASS A!

222
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,000
- I CAN ONLY STUDY
ONE SUBJECT AT A TIME.

223
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,458
- WE BOTH HAVE CRAPPY SCORES.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

224
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,291
- CALM DOWN, BRO.
I'VE GOT AN IDEA

225
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,125
THAT JUST MIGHT
HELP US WIN.

226
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,500
HEY, KOUTA.
THE JOURNAL, PLEASE.

227
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,791
- UH, WHAT JOURNAL?

228
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,916
- Fukuhara: KYOUJI NEMOTO'S
PHOTO COLLECTION.

229
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,708
"PLEASE TAKE A LOOK
AT THE NEW ME."

230
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,791
NEMOTO, AFTER LOSING A PREVIOUS
SUMMONER TEST WAR,

231
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,833
WAS FORCED TO DRESS LIKE A WOMAN
WHILE KOUTA PHOTOGRAPHED HIM.

232
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,541
KOUTA HAS SINCE GATHERED THE
PHOTOS AND PUT THEM TOGETHER

233
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,166
IN A LESS THAN FLATTERING
COLLECTION.

234
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,458
- I THINK THIS SHOULD HELP
WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS.

235
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,250
- I SEE.

236
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,708
I STILL HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
HOW AWFUL HE WAS TO HIMEJI.

237
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,291
OKAY, LET'S NAIL HIM WITH IT.
NEMOTO!

238
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,541
IF YOU DON'T WANT US TO PASS OUT
THIS PHOTO COLLECTION,

239
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,541
YOU'D BETTER LISTEN UP.
- BACK DOWN.

240
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,083
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

241
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,083
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA
LET HIM OFF.

242
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,791
- GIVE ME
SOME CREDIT, DUDE.

243
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,958
NEMOTO, TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS!

244
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,958
- THAT'S ME IN A DRESS!

245
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,708
YOU WIN THIS ONE, SAKAMOTO.
WE SURRENDER.

246
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,375
YOU GUYS ARE OFFICIALLY THE
WINNERS OF THIS ROUND, MAN.

247
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,208
JUST DON'T--
DON'T SHOW THOSE PICS.

248
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,375
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT, KOYAMA?
DO WE WIN THIS ROUND?

249
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,083
- YOU WIN.
WE DON'T WANT TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

250
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,708
- Nishimura: THE WINNER IS
THE SAKAMOTO-YOSHII TEAM

251
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,125
IN THE BLUE CORNER.

252
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
- PLEASE, YUUKA,
YOU HAVE TO LET ME EXPLAIN.

253
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,625
- KYOUJI...

254
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,916
WE'RE SO BREAKING UP.
- OH, PLEASE NO!

255
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,291
BUMMER.

256
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,791
- Fukuhara: BUMMER.

257
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,500
THUS THE SECOND ROUND
ENDED ON A HIGH NOTE.

258
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,333
- GOOD JOB.
WAY TO GO.

259
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,375
- GOOD JOB, YEAH.
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

260
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,250
- YOU'RE THE SMARTEST
IDIOT EVER.

261
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,916
- THAT'S SO SWEET, HAZUKI.
HOW DID YOU GUYS DO ANYWAY?

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,583
- WE DID WELL.
WE WON TOO.

263
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,833
- A PIECE OF CAKE.
- THAT'S SO AWESOME.

264
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,791
WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF BOTH OUR
TEAMS MADE IT TO THE FINALS?

265
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,708
- THIS IS STRANGE.
- YOU MEAN, LIKE, SPECIFICALLY?

266
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,625
- WHY'D WE ONLY FIGHT
SMART CLASSES?

267
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,333
- I FIGURED IT WAS JUST BAD LUCK
SINCE IT'S ALL PICKED RANDOMLY.

268
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,333
- IT DIDN'T SEEM
THAT RANDOM TO ME.

269
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,750
HIDEYOSHI, KOUTA,
PREPARE OUR NEXT STRATEGY.

270
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,166
- ROGER.
- SURE, YOU CAN COUNT ON US.

271
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,875
- Akihisa: WHAT STRATEGY?

272
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,458
- IF I'M RIGHT, THE NEXT TEAM
WE'RE UP AGAINST

273
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,291
WILL HAVE EVEN HIGHER SCORES
THAN THE LAST ONE.

274
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,000
- Nishimura: IN THE RED CORNER,
FROM YEAR 2, CLASS A,

275
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,750
SHOUKO KIRISHIMA
AND YUUKO KUNOSHITA.

276
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,500
- BIG SURPRISE.  THEY'RE PUTTING
US UP AGAINST CLASS A.

277
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,708
TOLD YOU SO.
- YEAH, YOU DID.  GOOD CALL.

278
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,708
- HIDEYOSHI, LIKE A BOSS.

279
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,041
- I GET IT.  HIDEYOSHI TOTALLY
TRADED PLACES WITH HIS SISTER.

280
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,958
IT WAS A STRATEGY FOR TWINS,
WASN'T IT?

281
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,583
- DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT WOULD HAPPEN?

282
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,333
- HIDEYOSHI?

283
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,291
- I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M NOT AN IDIOT LIKE HE IS.

284
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,500
- SORRY, THAT WAS MY BAD,
YOU GUYS.

285
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,958
- Yuuji: WHAT THE HELL?

286
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,041
- YOU FORGET--
I KNOW HOW YOU THINK, YUUJI.

287
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,958
- NOW I HAVE NO CHOICE.
IT'S TIME FOR OUR TRUMP CARD.

288
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,958
- OUR TRUMP CARD?
ARE YOU SAYING YOU HAVE A PLAN?

289
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,708
- I AM.  NOW THEN,

290
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,250
I WANT YOU TO SAY WORD FOR WORD
EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU TO.

291
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,208
- SOUNDS GOOD, MAN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

292
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,833
I'LL DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES.

293
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,291
- "SHOUKO, I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANT TO TELL YOU."

294
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,291
- SHOUKO, I HAVE
SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU.

295
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,833
- "I WANT TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT
NO MATTER WHAT."

296
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,875
- I WANT TO WIN THIS
TOURNAMENT NO MATTER WHAT.

297
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,666
- "AND IF I DO, I SWEAR..."
- AND IF I DO, I SWEAR...

298
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,708
- "I WILL PROPOSE TO YOU."
- I WILL PROPOSE TO--

299
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,458
- "I LOVE YOU, SHOUKO."
- WHAT THE HELL?

300
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,458
WHY WOULD YOU WANT ME
TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

301
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,833
- JUDO CHOP!

302
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,916
- ( groans )
- ( clears throat )

303
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,375
( deep voice )
AND IF I DO, I SWEAR

304
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,791
I WILL PROPOSE TO YOU,
BECAUSE...

305
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:30,583
I LOVE YOU, SHOUKO!

306
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,333
- HOW AWFUL.  WE JUST LOST.
- BAD SHOUKO!

307
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,041
FINE.  I'LL FIGHT THESE
JACKWAGONS BY MYSELF.

308
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,958
- Nishimura: THIS ROUND'S
SUBJECT--

309
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,708
HEALTH AND
PHYSICAL EDUCATION.

310
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,666
BEGIN.
- SUMMON!

311
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,833
- YEAH, WELL, I'VE GOT ANOTHER
PLAN.  YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

312
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,583
WAIT TILL YOU GET A LOAD
OF MY AVATAR THIS TIME, FOOL.

313
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,916
SUMMON!

314
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,916
- SUMMON!

315
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,625
- SEE THAT?
SUMMONING A SUBSTITUTE.

316
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,458
GO AHEAD AND BEAT THAT
KILLER TECHNIQUE IF YOU CAN.

317
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,250
- THEY ARE TOTALLY CHEATING.

318
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,750
- THIS IS SO NOT GOOD.

319
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,916
- ( moans )
- ( punch lands )

320
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,166
- ( deep voice ) I LOVE YOU.
HELP ME, SHOUKO!

321
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,833
- WE'D LIKE TO WITHDRAW.
- BAD SHOUKO!  NO!

322
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,291
- SINCE THE TEAM IN THE RED
CORNER WITHDREW, THE WINNER IS

323
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,083
THE SAKAMOTO-YOSHII TEAM
IN THE BLUE CORNER.

324
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,375
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!  WHAT THE
HELL KIND OF STUNT WAS THAT?

325
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,375
- DON'T BLAME ME.
IT'S YOUR FAULT SHE SAW THROUGH

326
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,416
YOUR STRATEGY TO START WITH.
- SO WHAT IF IT WAS?

327
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,458
THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO
RUIN THE REST OF MY LIFE.

328
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,458
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY ACTUALLY GOT AWAY

329
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,250
WITH THAT STUNT.
- PLEASE, THERE'S NO REASON

330
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,416
TO FIGHT.  WE ALL ADVANCED
TO THE SEMIFINALS,

331
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,458
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.
- YEAH, GOOD POINT.

332
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,083
BOTH OF OUR TEAMS
MADE IT THIS FAR,

333
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,291
SO ONE OF US MIGHT BE ABLE
TO WIN THE WHOLE THING.

334
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,416
- THAT'S WAY COOL.
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOU 100%

335
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,416
NO MATTER HOW CRAZY TINY
YOUR LITTLE BRAIN IS.

336
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,250
- YOU ALWAYS SAY THE SWEETEST
THINGS.  THANK YOU, HAZUKI.

337
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,458
- KICKING OFF THE SEMIFINALS
IN THE RED CORNER,

338
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:07,041
FROM YEAR 2, CLASS F, MIZUKI
HIMEJI AND MINAMI SHIMADA.

339
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,458
- WELL, THAT'S AWKWARD.
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

340
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,333
THIS JUST MEANS
A TEAM FROM CLASS F

341
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,125
WILL ADVANCE TO THE FINALS
NO MATTER WHAT,

342
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,250
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PUSH
TOO HARD TO WIN HERE.

343
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,750
- YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.
WE CAN JUST LOSE FAST SO THAT

344
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,083
HIMEJI AND MINAMI WON'T HAVE TO
LOWER THEIR SCORES ANY.

345
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,708
- DON'T BE STUPID, YOU DUMMY.
GO FOR IT.

346
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,166
- HAZUKI?
- I'M CHEERING FOR YOU,

347
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,458
SO IF YOU LOSE,
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

348
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,041
- ( Akihisa's voice ) I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND

349
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,791
WHY I HAVE TO DO
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO.

350
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,791
- IF YOU WIN, I'LL GIVE YOU
A GROWN-UP KISS

351
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,291
FOR DOING A GOOD JOB.
- HUH?

352
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,291
- NOT ONLY THAT, BUT I'LL EVEN
TAKE A BATH WITH YOU TOO.

353
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,666
- Both: WHAT?

354
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,583
- A BATH TOGETHER?

355
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,375
- AND I BET YOU'LL BE WAY TIRED,
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

356
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,041
ABOUT WASHING YOUR BACK.
I CAN DO IT.

357
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,583
- Both: WHAT?

358
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,666
- ALL OF A SUDDEN
I FEEL AS THOUGH WE SHOULD

359
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,416
TAKE THIS ROUND SERIOUSLY.
- HOLD ON.

360
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,333
NO NEED TO GET ALL PSYCHO.
- IT'S TIME TO DIE.

361
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:03,375
- All: IT'S TIME TO DIE.

362
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,791
- EXCEPT WE MIGHT THINK
IT'S RUDE IF YOU GO EASY ON US.

363
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,916
- PLEASE DON'T.
IF WE FIGHT SERIOUSLY,

364
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,541
I'LL BE IN PAIN
FROM AVATAR FEEDBACK.

365
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,333
- KILL THE TRAITOR!

366
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:15,000
- KILL HIM.

367
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,875
- WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM,
SO WHY DO I FEEL

368
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,041
LIKE I'M PLAYING
AN AWAY GAME RIGHT NOW?

369
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,750
- THERE'S NO REASON
TO FREAK OUT, DUDE.

370
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,666
WE'RE JUST GONNA LOSE FAST
AND WALK AWAY.

371
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,750
- YOU WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN
IF YOU LOSE ON PURPOSE.

372
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,000
- SHOUKO?
- YOU DID SWEAR TO ME

373
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,250
WE'D GET ENGAGED IF YOU WON
THIS TOURNAMENT, RIGHT?

374
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,708
SO IF YOU LOSE ON PURPOSE,
WE'LL GET MARRIED NOW.

375
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,541
- EITHER WAY
I'M GETTING PUNISHED.

376
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,458
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, MAN?
- WE HAVE TO WIN.

377
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,250
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
WE CAN DO AT THIS POINT.

378
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,000
- BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BEAT THEM?

379
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,500
THEY'VE GOT
BETTER SCORES.

380
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,083
- THE SUBJECT THIS ROUND--
CLASSIC JAPANESE.

381
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,458
BEGIN.
- Girls: SUMMON!

382
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,666
- MINAMI'S AVATAR
ONLY HAS SIX POINTS.

383
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,250
SHE MIGHT AS WELL
ALREADY BE DEAD.

384
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,750
- MIGHT AS WELL.
OKAY THEN, LET'S GET 'EM.

385
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,708
- OKAY.
- Both: SUMMON!

386
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,625
- SERIOUSLY?

387
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,291
- I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT,
IF THAT HELPS.

388
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,708
- YOU GUYS NEED TO GIVE UP,
SO QUIT RUNNING AWAY FROM US.

389
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,291
- LET US SEND YOU TO THE
AFTERLIFE WITH A SINGLE BLOW.

390
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,583
- YEAH, AS GREAT AS THAT SOUNDS,
IF I LET THE TWO OF YOU

391
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,291
BEAT ME RIGHT NOW, I MIGHT
ACTUALLY DIE FROM THE PAIN.

392
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,916
- FOCUS.
FIND A WAY TO BLOCK

393
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,916
HIMEJI'S WEAPON
AND LET ME TAKE CARE OF THEM.

394
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,041
- RIGHT, I'M ON TOP OF IT.
HERE GOES.

395
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,000
- HUH?  WHA--?

396
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,750
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.  YOU LET GO
OF THOSE RIGHT THIS INSTANT.

397
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,708
- BOOBY SNATCHER!
- OKAY, YUUJI, YOU'RE UP.

398
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,666
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HIT ME
WITH THAT ATTACK.

399
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,041
- THE WINNER IS
THE SAKAMOTO-YOSHII TEAM

400
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,625
IN THE BLUE CORNER.

401
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,791
- WHATEVER.
I MEAN, IN THE END

402
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,916
SOMEONE WAS GONNA WIND UP
BEATING ME ANYWAY.

403
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,500
- DEATH TO THE TRAITOR!
- WAIT.

404
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,375
YOU GUYS ARE OVERREACTING.
LET ME GO.

405
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,500
WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS
HAPPEN TO ME?

406
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,041
- DON'T WORRY, MAN.

407
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,750
I WON'T LET YOUR USELESS DEATH
BE IN VAIN.

408
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,833
- HOW IS A USELESS DEATH
NOT IN VAIN?

409
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,208
- I'VE OBTAINED
SOME INFORMATION.

410
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,208
INFORMATION?
- YOU WERE RIGHT, YUUJI.

411
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,583
- I KNEW IT.
THANKS A LOT, KOUTA.

412
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,333
AKI, WE'RE TAKING
THE FINALS SERIOUSLY.

413
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,583
- COOL.

414
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,583
- Fukuhara: THE FINAL BATTLE

415
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,041
WILL BE HELD IN FRONT OF
THE REST OF THE STUDENT BODY.

416
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,833
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
ONE OF THE TEAMS IN THIS BATTLE

417
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:38,666
IS FROM CLASS F, COMMONLY KNOWN
AS THE STUPID ONES.

418
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,583
- APPARENTLY WE MAY HAVE TO
REVISE OUR PREVIOUS PERCEPTION

419
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,583
OF THIS PARTICULAR CLASS
FROM THIS POINT ON.

420
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,958
- MAYBE NOT.
THEIR OPPONENT

421
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,791
IS THE DUO
FROM YEAR 3, CLASS A.

422
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,958
- DUO FROM YEAR 3, CLASS A?

423
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,291
- Nishimura: IN THE RED CORNER,
FROM YEAR 3, CLASS A.

424
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,916
SHUNPEI NATSUKAWA
AND YUSAKU TSUNEMURA.

425
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
- THEY'RE FIGHTING
THE TSUNEKAWA DUO?

426
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,125
- THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.
- NOT AT ALL.

427
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,500
- Natsukawa: HOW DID YOU
FATHEADS MAKE IT THIS FAR?

428
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,750
- ( Akihisa whimpering )
- WELCOME TO THE END, JOKERS.

429
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,916
- I HATE THAT GUY.

430
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,375
- WE'RE GONNA CRUSH YOU,
MORONS,

431
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,666
UNTIL WE CAN'T
CRUSH YOU ANYMORE.

432
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,916
- ( both laughing )

433
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,958
- YOU STILL HAVE A BRA
ON YOUR HEAD.

434
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,583
- I KNOW.
IT WON'T COME OFF.

435
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,041
- PERVERT ALERT, YO.

436
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,041
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PUT IT ON ME, ASS.

437
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,000
- HEY, CHEATERS.
YEAH, WE KNOW THE TRUTH.

438
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,500
- WHAT?  WE DO?
- YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FIXING

439
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,041
OUR OPPONENT SELECTIONS
THIS WHOLE TIME, HAVEN'T YOU?

440
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,250
- WHAT?  WE WERE TRYING
TO PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY

441
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,000
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.  DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO GET EMBARRASSED.

442
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,000
- EVEN THOUGH IT'S A SHOCK
YOU MADE IT THIS FAR,

443
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,500
AT LEAST WE'LL BE ABLE TO SETTLE
OUR SCORE FROM YESTERDAY.

444
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,125
- Yuuji: FINE WITH US, ASSHATS.
LET'S RUMBLE.

445
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,541
- Tsunemura: GUESS WHAT--
ENGLISH IS GOING TO BE

446
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,583
OUR SUBJECT THIS ROUND,
AND THAT HAPPENS TO BE MY FORTE.

447
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,666
- Nishimura: PREPARE FOR BATTLE.

448
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,500
- SAY WHAT?
- HOW COME IT'S NOT ENGLISH?

449
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,625
- Yuuji: NICELY DONE, KOUTA.

450
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,541
- EASY AS PIE, FELLAS.
- YOU READY, MAN?

451
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,541
- YEAH, WE GET TO PULL
THE STRINGS THIS TIME.

452
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,708
AND THE HANDICAP SHOULDN'T BE
TOO MUCH FOR YOU.

453
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,666
- NO.
- Both: SUMMON!

454
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,833
- SUMMON!

455
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,541
- WHAT THE WHAT?

456
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,208
- NO.  THEIR SCORES
ARE EVEN WITH OURS.

457
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,166
- AKI NORMALLY ONLY HAS, LIKE,
60 POINTS AT THE MOST.

458
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,208
- HE DID STUDY.
GO GET 'EM, BOYS.

459
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,375
- YOU'D BETTER BE READY,
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT HOLDING BACK.

460
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,166
- BRING IT ON.

461
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,791
- FACE.

462
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,208
OH, NO.

463
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,833
HOW DARE YOU?
YOU'RE JUST CLASS F.

464
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,916
- YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

465
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,000
- I'VE GOT A LITTLE
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

466
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,958
THE DIFFERENCE
IN OUR EXPERIENCES.

467
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,333
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE A PROBATIONARY STUDENT,

468
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,500
AREN'T YOU?  WOW, SO ALL
THOSE HITS ON YOUR AVATAR

469
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,875
MUST HAVE HURT YOU TOO.

470
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,000
( laughs )

471
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,916
- AKIHISA.

472
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,416
HEY, YOU NEED TO PULL
YOURSELF TOGETHER, MAN.

473
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,375
YOU CAN STILL FIGHT,
CAN'T YOU?

474
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,541
- HELL YEAH.

475
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,958
- THE POOR LOSER
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT.

476
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,750
I GUESS I MIGHT AS WELL
FINISH HIM OFF.

477
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,000
- I'M GONNA GET YOU,
SUCKER!

478
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,083
- TAKE THIS.

479
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,666
- I DON'T THINK SO.

480
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,750
- I CAN THROW MY WEAPON TOO.

481
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,958
THIS IS REALLY GONNA HURT.
HERE IT COMES.

482
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,500
- HEADS UP.

483
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,833
- Nishimura: THE WINNER IS
THE TEAM IN THE BLUE CORNER!

484
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,000
- NO WAY.
- WE LOST.

485
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,875
- ( crowd cheering )

486
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,583
- Woman: THE CHAMPIONS OF
THE SUMMONER TEST TOURNAMENT

487
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,208
HAVE BEEN DECIDED--
THE YUUJI SAKAMOTO,

488
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,958
AKIHISA YOSHII TEAM
FROM YEAR 2, CLASS F.

489
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,375
- WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

490
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,166
WE DID IT.
- GO US.

491
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,166
- Tsunemura: NO WAY IN HELL
ARE WE GONNA LET THIS HAPPEN.

492
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,250
- Yuuji: OH, REALLY?  AND WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

493
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,833
- Natsukawa: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

494
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,791
YOU GUYS CHEATED ON EVERY
SINGLE BATTLE YOU HAD.

495
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,500
- CAN'T CHEAT
AT A BATTLE OF WITS.

496
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,208
- PLUS, WHO ARE YOU
TO CALL US CHEATERS?

497
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,041
- SHUT UP.  WE'RE THE ONES
WHO ARE GONNA

498
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,041
RAT OUT YOUR CHEATING
TO EVERY TEACHER IN SCHOOL.

499
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:14,500
- YEAH, IF WE CAN'T BE
THE WINNERS, NO ONE CAN.

500
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,125
- THEY'RE HEADING
TO THE P.A. SYSTEM.

501
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,375
THEY'RE GOING TO EXPOSE US.
- HOLD ON.

502
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,958
IF THEY DO THAT, THEY'LL GET
OUR WIN TAKEN AWAY FOR SURE.

503
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,500
- AKIHISA.
- OF COURSE.

504
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,083
- I NEED TO BORROW THIS
REAL QUICK.

505
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,666
- STOP.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

506
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,750
- THEY WILL NOT
RUIN THIS FOR US.

507
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,750
WE HAVE TO WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP

508
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,666
SO WE CAN BUY STUFF
TO MAKE OUR CLASS LOOK BETTER.

509
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,125
NO ONE IS GONNA MAKE HIMEJI
CHANGE SCHOOLS.

510
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,083
I SWEAR IT!

511
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,375
NAILED IT.
- YES, YOU DID, AKI.

512
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,333
- ( both scream )

513
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,208
- Both: NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO!

514
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,250
- UH...
- WHOOPSIE.

515
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,500
- YOU IDIOTS.

516
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,375
- Both: HAVE MERCY ON US!

517
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:30,708
- Hazuki: THAT DOESN'T LOOK SO
GOOD.  BEING STUPID HURTS, HUH?

518
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:32,375
- Minami: YEAH, SERIOUSLY.

519
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,375
I MEAN, THERE IS SUCH A THING
AS OVERKILL, YOU KNOW.

520
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,208
- Akihisa: YOU JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND THOSE GUYS.

521
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,291
- Kouta: WE HAD TO PAY TO GET
THE DAMAGED BUILDINGS ALL FIXED.

522
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,916
SO MOST OF THE MONEY
WE MADE

523
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,125
WAS USED FOR THAT
INSTEAD OF BUYING NEW STUFF.

524
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,875
- ( Akihito groans )

525
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,041
- Yuuji: WE HAVE JUST ENOUGH
LEFT TO BUY A FEW SMALL TABLES.

526
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,875
- Hideyoshi: CLEARLY,
WE GOT AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

527
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,500
- Akihisa: LOOKS LIKE IT.

528
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,416
I WONDER WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WITH HIMEJI NOW.

529
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,000
- HI, EVERYONE.
- Akihisa: HIMEJI.

530
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,541
- Minami: OH, HEY, WHAT'S UP,
GIRL?  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

531
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,208
- I WAS JUST TALKING WITH MY
FATHER FOR A LITTLE BIT.

532
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,416
- Hideyoshi: YOU MEAN YOUR
FATHER SAW THE TOURNAMENT?

533
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,000
- Kouta: WELL,
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

534
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,500
NO, ACTUALLY IT WAS FINE.

535
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,791
MY FATHER SAID IF I WANT TO STAY
HERE, I NEED TO STUDY HARD

536
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,416
AND THAT I PROBABLY NEED TO WORK
ON MY PHYSICAL STRENGTH TOO.

537
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,541
- HUH?
- Minami: ARE YOU SERIOUS?

538
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,833
- I AM.

539
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,833
HE ALSO SAID
I HAVE REALLY GREAT FRIENDS.

540
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,041
- HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

541
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,958
- ( upbeat song playing )

542
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,958
- Takahashi: THE CLOSING PARTY
HAS NOW STARTED.  ALL STUDENTS,

543
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,583
PLEASE REPORT TO THE SCHOOL
BUILDING FOR THE FESTIVITIES.

544
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,083
- ( students chattering )

545
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,666
- YOU HAVE TO
LET ME EXPLAIN.

546
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,833
THIS IS ALL JUST A NASTY
MISUNDERSTANDING.

547
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:17,750
CAN'T WE START OVER?
PLEASE LISTEN, PLEASE.

548
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:21,833
DON'T WALK AWAY.
PLEASE COME BACK TO ME, YUUKA!

549
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:25,541
- YUUJI, YOUR PROMISE.
IT'S TIME TO PROPOSE.

550
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:28,583
- DAMN IT.  YOU CAN'T
TORTURE A PERSON INTO MARRIAGE.

551
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,583
THAT'LL NEVER HOLD UP
IN COURT.

552
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:32,750
( screaming )

553
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:35,458
- UM, SO, AKIHISA...

554
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,458
- WE WERE KINDA WONDERING
IF YOU'D--

555
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:38,958
I MEAN,
WE'D LIKE MAYBE--

556
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:41,958
- I WANNA FOLK-DANCE!
COME ON, STUPID!

557
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,916
- OKAY, I WOULD LOVE
TO DANCE WITH YOU, HAZUKI.

558
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,333
- SHE STOLE OUR
DANCE FROM US.

559
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,833
- HOW COULD YOU, AKIHISA?
HOW?

560
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:52,500
- I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER
UNDERSTAND CHICKS, MAN.

561
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:55,000
- Fukuhara: CHEEKS BLUSHING
FROM THE BURNING FLAMES,

562
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,125
THE STUDENTS
HELD THEIR HEARTS CLOSE,

563
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,750
EVEN IF THEY WERE
ON THEIR SLEEVES.

564
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,958
AND THE NIGHT WORE ON.

565
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,000
THE END.
