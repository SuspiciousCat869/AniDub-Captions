And then there's this guy--

00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,500
a Protean turned
pseudo-fire dragon.

7
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,083
We're totally screwed.

8
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,083
Yet for some reason I have
a hunch that we won't lose.

Yeah, well, I'm not interested
in your little hunches

Tricksters can
manipulate probabilities,

but not even they can
escape from gravity.

The Raki brothers are losing.

62

[MOULDEEN] This is
quite the surprising twist.

63
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,333
I never expected her to
have that kind of power.

64

I'm on the edge of my seat.

No.

[MOULDEEN] We're nearing
the end of our performance.

71
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:53,458
Now, let's sit back
and enjoy the fireworks.

72
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,041
Why did you choose
to save our lives?

73
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,208
[NIDVORK] Because I'm
determined to annihilate you

74
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,125
with my own two hands.

75
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,000
I couldn't let them
take that from me.

76
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,250
I'm onto you.

77
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,666
[groans]

78
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,125
[GAYUS] You're the wife
of the black dragon we killed.

79
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,458
And if I'm not mistaken,

80
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:16,625
you're a black dragon, too,
aren't you, Nidvork?

81
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,375
I know that's not the name of
any human gravity Jushikiist.

82
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:24,875
And no human could fly under the
radar with abilities like that.

83
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,583
Plus, the scrap of clothing
you left on Gigina's sword

84
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,125
resembled scales.

85
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,666
Almost like the
skin of a reptile--

86
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,875
It's an insult to compare
my kind to reptiles.

87
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,375
[GAYUS scoffs]
Well, excuse me.

88
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,125
So, why did you
take on a human form?

89
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:43,500
I gave my word--a solemn
vow to my Eningluud.

90
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,208
I promised him your death--
your second death, in fact,

91
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,958
would be my doing.

[NIDVORK]
Yes.

96
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,875
When you were mortally wounded,
I cast a dragon's spell

97
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,166
to bring you back
from the brink of death.

98
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,791
You saved me. But what for?

99
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,416
Haven't I made that clear?

100
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,875
You killed my beloved. I want
the satisfaction of killing you!

Be on guard.

103

[NIDVORK] Now I can
finally exact my revenge.

How's it possible for her
to use Jushiki to fly,

112
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,833
put up a barrier, and throw
so many powerful attacks at us

for what you've done!

wanna know this,

but what just happened to me?

124
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,250
You died briefly. But then...

125

[NIDVORK]
Oh, I'm nowhere near satisfied.

126

I'll kill you and revive you

Look, lady, I've had
enough outta you!

Unlike you, whenever I kill
somebody, they stay dead!

131
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,125
So far, we've been
making the mistake

132
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:47,000
of using fighting tactics
meant for humans.

133
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,125
But we're toe-to-toe
with a dragon

134
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,625
and she's armed with an

Hm. Here we go.

137
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,375
Her class level
must be near a thousand.

138
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,541
Safe to assume she's an Altar.

139

What to do.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,541
You're asking me that?

Right, you're
too stupid to plan.

who I'm talking to.

I'm not stupid. I just
tend to leave strategizing

[GIGINA grunts, groans]

165
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,541
[GAYUS groans]

166
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,083
This is only the beginning.

167
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,875
So savor this pain.
It's just going to get worse.

168
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,250
[NIDVORK]
You can't die yet.

169
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,791
You monsters made my
poor Eninguluud suffer

170
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,458
through far greater
agony than this.

171
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,375
[gasps]

172
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,625
[GAYUS]
Damn it.

173
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,708
I can't figure out
a way to beat this chick.

174
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,416
Then think of it... this way.

175
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,541
What'd be the most...
unexpected thing to do?

176
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,125
Pulling a magic potion out of
my pocket that would kill her

177
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,250
and solve world hunger
at the same time?

178
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,666
Oh, and I would grow
giant muscles, too.

179
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,666
[GIGINA chuckles]
Something actually possible.

180
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,250
[GAYUS] If you've been
waiting to shock us

181
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,291
with a big, cheesy reveal about
being the son of a demon king

182
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,916
or some legendary family
of super-Drakens,

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,875
now would be a good time
to bust that out.

184
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,583
I won't even make fun of you.

185
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:45,000
I hate to say it, but...
for my true power to awaken,

186
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,291
a friend's life
has to be sacrificed.

187
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,583
That said... [coughs]

188
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,333
...for all intents and purposes,

189
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,458
you were dead after Nidvork
attacked you a moment ago

190
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,083
and yet... nothing happened.

191
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,583
Oh, I see.

192
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,333
Thinking I'm dead doesn't
affect you at all, is that it?

193
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,875
[chuckles]
If that's true, then...

194
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,416
...maybe I'll just
try dying for real.

195
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,458
You do not deserve
the sweet mercy of death!

196
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,791
Hey, Gayus.

197
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,083
D'you still know that Jushiki?

198
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,708
[GAYUS]
Of course I know it, Helodel.

199
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,458
I'm a 13th-grade now.

200
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,708
If only you were still alive.

201
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,500
[GAYUS]
Getting revenge is pointless.

202
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,333
Why is everyone...

203
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,833
...so stupid?

204
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:38,875
[gasps]

205
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,458
[NIDVORK grunts]

206
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,541
[GAYUS] I'm using your
Par Ee Mon, buddy.

207
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,458
Just like old times!

208
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,541
[groans]

209
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,791
[GIGINA grunts]

210
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,750
You're not dying. Not yet.

211
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,000
[panting]

212
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:36,666
I suppose... I've
been... defeated... then.

213
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,750
You fool! That Jushiki's strong.

214
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,500
Why'd you take it head-on?

215
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,458
[panting]

216
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,708
[GAYUS]
She had no choice, Gigina.

217
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:56,625
She just... couldn't bear to
lose him... for the second time.

218
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:04,625
I love him... so I wanted
to fight beside him.

219
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:08,041
Surely you can
understand that sentiment.

220
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,291
[GAYUS]
Let me ask you something.

221
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,416
You said you were trying
to avenge your husband.

222
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,791
And I get that.

223
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:25,958
So why not kill Jiv?
You know, my beloved.

224
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,333
I mean, you knew where
she lived and everything.

225
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,333
Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,833
That woman did nothing to me.

227
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,708
You two killed Eninguluud.

228
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,166
[NIDVORK]
And earlier,

229
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,416
those brothers only
attacked me out of fear.

230
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,041
[groans] So no other human
but you, not even your lover,

231
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,083
could be deserving
of my vengeance.

232
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,666
[NIDVORK]
And now...

233
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,000
...I must accept that
I've done everything I can.

234
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:10,833
I'm off to... the next world,
so... I can hold him...

235
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,125
...the way... I did... before...

236
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:21,208
[NIDVORK] But then...
will he even recognize me?

237
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:26,333
Or... turn his head... in shame?

238
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,958
After I made a vow and...

239
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,500
...failed to keep my word.

240
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,500
To think that could happen...

241
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:41,250
...frightens me...
more than anything.

242
00:14:55,833 --> 00:15:00,125
[GAYUS groans]

243
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:04,375
Look who's awake--
Patient 4970701.

244
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,625
Czahn, it's you.

245
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,416
That's right,
your lovely doctor

246
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,208
who's sweet and
kind in every way.

247
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,041
Well, every way except the bill.

248
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,041
[GAYUS groans]
Oh man, what happened?

249
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,500
[gasps]

250
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,791
Wow, would you look at that?

251
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,583
I still have human hands!

252
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,958
[CZAHN]
What do you mean?

253
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,458
Are you suggesting my
treatment could have failed?

254
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,541
No, you're the best when
it comes to healing Jushiki.

255
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,583
The problem is
you're an unhinged maniac.

256
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,916
Last time I was here, you tried
to replace my nose with a dog's.

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,041
I still think it'd be handsome.

258
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,375
Besides, dogs have
a keen sense of smell.

259
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,916
[CZAHN]
Say...

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,791
...does this one suit you?

261
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,083
How about no?

262
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,166
You know, Doc,
you could at least

263
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,000
pretend to care
what your patients want.

264
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,875
[CZAHN]
Fine, if that's a no-go,

265
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,708
I'll operate on your
painfully average penis.

266
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,375
Ha, God knows you need it.

267
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,833
One quick surgery could
make it 35 percent larger.

268
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,291
Your girlfriend
would be thrilled.

269
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,583
Thirty-five percent, huh?

270
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,000
Nope. I'm happy with what I got.

271
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,791
Size isn't everything, you know!

272
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,750
[CZAHN chuckles] Aw, you're
so adorable when you lie,

273
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,333
Mr. Average-Size.

274
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,208
You've got some
beautiful organs, though.

275
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,625
As a professional organ
artist, I have to admit,

276
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,708
I'm more than a little envious.

277
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,625
That's it. Time for
me to get dressed.

278
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,333
Now beat it, vulture.

279
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,958
Oh, right, I forgot.

280
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,458
A man came to see you.

281
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,625
[GAYUS]
Hm?

282
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,666
[CZAHN] Although,
I'd call him a monster.

283
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Human towns are so quaint.

284
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,791
Idyllic and chaotic
at the same time.

285
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,583
[GAYUS] Well, if it isn't
His Eminence Cardinal Mouldeen.

286
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,708
So, did you come
here to kill me?

287
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,958
Of course not.

288
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,125
You did send Gigina
and me to hell and back

289
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,958
for your own sick entertainment.

290
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,333
But my Jesper and Beldritt
are critically maimed as well.

291
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,166
Genon's floating in a vat,

292
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,750
reduced to barely more
than a brain and spinal cord.

293
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,125
My side suffered.

294
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,250
It appears you've
won this round.

295
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,125
I congratulate you, my boy.

296
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,791
Oh, save it.
You had the whole thing

297
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,625
scripted out from the start.

298
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,250
You coordinated
everything that happened.

299
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,875
I figured out what
you're really after:

300
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,250
equilibrium among the Dragon
Empire, the Seven-City Alliance,

301
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,666
and the dragonkind, Vaisen.

302
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,333
Care to explain?

303
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,625
[GAYUS]
The hardliners don't want

304
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,041
the Holy Land of Alsok to cede,

305
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,958
so you used your rigged
self-assassination attempt

306
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,208
to get them out of the assembly.

307
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,416
And as for the
Seven-City Alliance,

308
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,166
you made a promise to mediate
the once-failed Tienlun Accord

309
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,125
at some unspecified
point in the future

310
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,000
in order to create more
favorable conditions

311
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,166
for Alsok to step
out of the way.

312
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,750
Correct me if
I'm wrong, Cardinal,

313
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,833
but I think you tanked the
Accord in the first place.

314
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,166
You traded to make sure
each of the three powers

315
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,916
got the thing they
wanted most, in order.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,916
So the Empire gets Alsok,
the Alliance gets the Accord,

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,333
and the dragons get--

318
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:02,416
[MOULDEEN] Hmm. It seems
you've finally found the answer.

319
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,833
Guess so.

320
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,916
You had the two Vaisen
defectors hunted down,

321
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,166
gaining favor with the dragons.

322
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,750
Smart move.

323
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,291
Since Gigina and I
killed Eninguluud,

324
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,708
you knew we'd be the perfect
bait for Nidvork's rampage.

325
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,125
You led us to believe
we were your bodyguards,

326
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,458
but we were just puppets
for the Twelve Winged Generals.

327
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:26,583
And we weren't the only bait
you had on your hook, were we?

328
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,875
Your poisoned promises
sealed the deal.

329
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,541
Poison, eh?

330
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,500
[GAYUS] Nidvork's pride
and thirst for revenge

331
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,916
led her to drink that poison,
and now she's dead.

332
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,791
But that's exactly what
you planned for, isn't it?

333
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,958
That's very astute of you.

334
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,583
[GAYUS]
One last thing.

335
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,791
I'm sure you offered more to the
Vaisen than those two defectors.

336
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,791
What is it?

337
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm afraid I can't
disclose that.

338
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,750
[MOULDEEN] The Twelve Winged
Generals may have failed,

339
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,750
but luckily I had the two
of you as my insurance policy.

340
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,750
Insurance?

341
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,041
Hold on, are you saying you're--

342
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,875
Even if my actors improvise
or abandon the script entirely,

343
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,958
whether by choice or necessity,

344
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,708
they remain confined to a stage

345
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,375
within the theater
I have built for them.

346
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,458
You see, as any good
playwright knows,

347
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,000
we ought to make the
entire world our stage.

348
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,833
Wouldn't you agree?

349
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,000
[GAYUS] Yeah, well, I never
auditioned for your little show,

350
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,500
so why was I a part of it?

351
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,041
[MOULDEEN]
You're an observer.

352
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,375
A performance cannot exist
without an audience.

353
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,916
And besides, I tend to
prefer a bit of mystery.

354
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,083
The best spectacles
leave you with questions.

355
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,083
But why did it have to be me?

356
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,875
[GIGINA]
What kind of unsavory business

357
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,125
are you up to this time?

358
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,791
Hello, Gigina.

359
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,958
I see you're as well as ever.

360
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,291
Our righteous God must
have heard my prayers

361
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,541
for your good health.

362
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,333
[GIGINA]
And which god is that?

363
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,958
[MOULDEEN] Whichever one
you'd like it to be.

364
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,250
I should've chopped off
your head last time

365
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,833
and that foul brain with it.

366
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:02,875
[CURACAO gasps]

367
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,791
[MOULDEEN]
Now, now, you two.

368
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,291
I simply wish to
congratulate you.

369
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,916
And of course, it's only right

370
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,250
to reward a standout actor
with acclaim and a prize.

371
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,291
[GIGINA] I'm not interested
in any of your rewards.

372
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,583
[MOULDEEN]
Gayus?

373
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,208
Saying this kinda
makes me want to throw up,

374
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,791
but I agree with Gigina.

375
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,416
[MOULDEEN]
That's too bad.

376
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,708
Here, then.

377
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,541
[gasps] But that's--!

378
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,083
[MOULDEEN] I'll leave
this here as your trophy.

379
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,541
Taking it or not is your choice,

380
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,375
but I assure you
it's extremely valuable.

381
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,958
Listen.

382
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,250
[MOULDEEN]
Hmm?

383
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,625
You can't make me play
your little mind game.

384
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,958
I'm still going to win.

385
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,458
If doing so protects the lives
of the meek and innocent,

386
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:00,708
I'll gladly kill dragons,
as well as abhorrent beings,

387
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:05,041
and cackle in the face
of the darkest Jushiki curses.

388
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,333
[MOULDEEN]
I'll prove that although mankind

389
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,166
is weak and brittle,

390
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,083
our own mettle is
enough for us to survive.

391
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,208
[MOULDEEN]
The glory of humanity

392
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:27,000
will soon be seen in
every corner of the earth.

393
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,791
Take care.

394
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,583
[MOULDEEN]
Oh, would you two like to

395
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,125
join the Winged Generals?

396
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,291
The job pays well,
with excellent benefits.

397
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,541
[BOTH]
Forget it.

398
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,166
[MOULDEEN]
That's a shame.

399
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,166
You've finally begun
to stand on your own.

400
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,666
[MOULDEEN]
I'm sure we'll meet again

401
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,416
after you've gotten
out of your own way.

402
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,666
May the sword
and moon bless you.

403
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,833
I'll try not to be wounded
by such blatant sarcasm.

404
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,166
I think it's really
over this time.

405
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,375
Let's hope so.

406
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:24,000
What the hell did we
accomplish in all this?

407
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,666
[GIGINA] Even if I can't see
a purpose, I keep on living.

408
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,375
And you do it too, Gayus.

409
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,125
That's good enough.

410
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,208
[GAYUS]
Yeah, I guess when you're

411
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,708
an Offensive Jushikiist like us,

412
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,791
you take whatever
reason you can get.

413
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,541
Right.

414
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,958
What am I doing,

415
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,375
admitting that I have
something in common with you?

416
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,625
People will say
that I've abandoned

417
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,958
my Draken sense of dignity!

418
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,083
[GAYUS chuckles]
Sorry, Gigina.

419
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,916
What?

420
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,250
[GAYUS]
You never had any dignity.

421
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,833
[ZEMUNN] How can you
do such a thing to me?

422
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,000
Do you know who I am?

423
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,708
You can't kidnap Zemunn
of the Aurora Front!

424
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,166
I am the figurehead
of your whole damn party!

425
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,750
[MAN 5A]
Not anymore, you aren't.

426
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,708
No. It can't be!

427
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:27,875
I... I thought you were dead!

428
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:31,125
[MAN 5A] You're going to
pay dearly for your betrayal.

429
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:36,583
[MAN 5A] But first, let's
make use of you one last time.

430
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,625
Please, don't!

431
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:45,125
[ZEMUNN screams]

432
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,250
[MAN 5A]
Najik. Navarro.

433
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,583
We're about to incite disaster.

434
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,041
You are aware that this
will cost you your lives.

435
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,791
I'm well prepared
to die for our cause.

436
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:02,708
The same goes for me.

437
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,833
[MAN 5A]
Let us begin our revenge.

438
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,916
This is the first call.

439
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,916
I curse this world...

440
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,958
...for it does nothing but
take from those who are weak.

441
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,333
Today marks our awakening.

442
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:20,875
At dawn, we will strike
with an iron hammer!

443
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,541
[GAYUS] People take
no interest in things

444
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,666
that don't directly
involve them.

445
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,083
Praise, slander, love, hate.

446
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,791
They're only as important as
the object attached to them.

447
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,250
Perhaps the greatest
threat to someone's life

448
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,958
is their own apathy.
