167

She closed her eyes and
dove into the dragon's mouth.

168

[NARICIA]
Imbued with newfound power,

169
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,708
Zhuo Lu broke free
of the mountain

170
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,625
and descended upon the palace,

171
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:05,000
where he tore the corrupt king
and his henchmen to shreds.

172
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,750
That's when Zhuo Lu
told the people,

173
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:12,166
"Give your flesh and blood and
I will appear to devour any foe

174

who dares threaten
any harm to Urmun."

175
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,541
Finally, with a mournful howl,

176
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,791
Zhuo Lu vanished
into the distant sky.

177
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,416
To this day,
the Sand Dragon slumbers

178
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,000
somewhere deep within Derilla,
the Mountains of Hell,

179
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:31,500
waiting to be offered another
sacrifice of flesh and blood.

180

[REMEDIUS]
That was an awfully sad tale.

181

From what it sounds like, your
people were never really saved.

182

Right. So we put our
faith in a fairy tale.

It's less depressing that way.

One of these days
I will become Zhuo Lu

I'm lost.

209

Who am I to hold accountable

00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,875
for everything that's
taken place here?

I'm sorry.

There might've been things
we could've done better...

...but still, our assignment
was to protect you.

I'd say we managed
to do that much.

215
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,083
So, who were
those other attackers

I don't know.

The police didn't learn
anything else about them

from the scene, either.

I haven't seen Egurrd
since the incident.

Well, do you think that
he had anything to do

223
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,291
with what happened?

224
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,208
I couldn't say.

225
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,625
What's that?

226
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,083
This is a piece
from a chells set.

227
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,583
The board is arranged
to recreate

228
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,708
the exact same play
Remedius used

229
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,500
in the game that earned him the
title of continental champion.

230
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,166
It's weird that the pieces
are birds and elephants.

231
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,500
Indeed.

232
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,333
But apparently that used
to be the standard design.

233
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,791
These days,
the elephants are bishops.

234
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:05,208
And at some point, the birds
and boats were changed to rooks.

235
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,958
Anyway, I've come to realize

236
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,291
that I treated
Remedius unfairly.

237
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,958
I forced him to give up chells

238
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,541
and devote his life
to company research,

239
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,375
but he loved this game.

240
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,500
He had such solid ethics.

241
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,666
The boy must've been
so devastated to learn

how his inventions
were being used in Urmun.

There's no way this
could be Mouldeen's work.

[YAHKTO] We still don't
know what Magatsushki is.

356
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,375
Some people believe
they are information

manifested as creatures
that exist in the same phase.

Yet another common

their very existence
is a type of Jushiki.

Therefore,
in order for Magatsushki

to form their bodies,

362
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,583
it is necessary for
them to absorb matter

them and rearrange it--

In short,

367

Magatsushki have a completely
different makeup than humans do.

368
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,208
So, their minds and motives
can be difficult to understand.

There's one thing that's
pretty clear, though.
