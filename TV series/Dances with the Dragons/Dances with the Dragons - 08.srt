We're in position.

00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,666
[SOLDIERS]
Cheers!

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,333
Here's to another win.

5
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,916
Nothin' can stop us!

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,916
We're undefeatable
with Remedius on our side!

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,291
[chuckles]

8
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,083
Y'know, I didn't expect you
to have so much talent

9
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,416
as a tactical commander.

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,000
Glad I surprise you.

11
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,750
Thanks, Zemunn.

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,833
But, my strategic thinking
is merely the result

13
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,375
of my fondness for chells.

14
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,708
I'm curious.

15
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,500
Why do you continue to
partake in this battle?

16
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:20,083
No one would hold it against you
if you went home to Tsevellen.

17
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,875
Maybe.

18
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,083
[REMEDIUS]
But I can't turn my back

19
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,708
on the truth I've learned
since coming here.

20
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,750
Jushiki was meant
to bring happiness,

21
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,166
but it's being used
for oppression.

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,000
I simply can't allow
such injustice.

23
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,916
Injustice, huh?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
[REMEDIUS] Diplomacy will
change nothing at this point.

25
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:46,083
Action is the only
true means for reform.

26
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,833
Although, all of our actions
utilize force and violence.

27
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,583
That's right, but it's pure.

28
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,875
You use force for
the right reasons.

29
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,708
It's the only option
you've been given.

30
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,041
[YAHKTO] Father. I wholly
surrender myself unto your hand.

31
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,291
[FUNERAL ATTENDEES cry]

32
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,916
I am prepared for anything
and I accept it.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
May your soul dwell in me

34
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,166
and may it reside within
all beings of your creation,

35
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,083
illuminating their lives
with solace and love.

36
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,250
[GAYUS]
Hm?

37
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,500
What's wrong?

38
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,000
[GIGINA]
I can't do this.

39
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,458
Participating in these rituals
would betray my homeland.

40
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,750
C'mon, dude.

41
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,916
[thud]

42
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,583
[GIGINA] You shall drench
your body of abundant dreams

43
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:07,250
in blood, weaving a heavenly
robe of moonlight and stardust.

44
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:12,041
Henceforth, idleness
and transience shall vanish,

45
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,708
as the pale messengers disperse

46
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,750
and forget the need to
compare their own ferocity.

47
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,875
[GIGINA] Even our most
joyous days are somehow sad.

48
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,333
Making a child's
dream come true...

49
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:31,166
...is still not enough
to end the loneliness.

50
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,666
I believe in love--

51
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,208
a love that is without
reason, without words,

52
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,000
with only an intense passion.

53
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,708
[GIGINA]
Youth was no more than a scar.

54
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,083
Naivety tumbles forward,

55
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,708
falling from immortality
to the ephemeral.

56
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,500
That fleeting eternity,
that smile of yours

57
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,000
perished so quietly.

58
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,083
[GIGINA] It is all that remains,
singing from within my heart.

59
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,416
That's just a silly song
Premelena would sing

60
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,125
for a night chat.

61
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,333
Seemed fitting for
such a somber occasion.

62
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,833
[sighs]

63
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,333
[GAYUS]
So we done here?

64
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,166
This all you got?

65
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,250
A river of useless tears
spilt over a dead coworker?

66
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,625
Lotta good that's gonna do him.

--Heartless creep!
--You wanna die?

Leave your arms
holstered, fools!

00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,500
Gayus has a point.

70
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,708
We need to focus on
who killed our peer.

71
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,125
The damn Magatsushiki
and the Great Magatsushiki

72
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,416
who control them.

73
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,666
Amupura and Janahn Ghalan.

74
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,291
Am I wrong?

75
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,250
Right. We've shed enough tears.

76
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,250
Who's gonna kill the bastards so
our comrade can rest in peace?

77
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,875
[FUNERAL ATTENDEES]
We are!

78
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,833
[LARGONKIN] Then what the
hell're you waiting for?

00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,583
Thank you for that,

playin' the bad guy and all.

85
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,083
Only reason you
called me, isn't it?

86
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,750
You're a pain
in the ass, y'know.

87
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,166
So, I've been doing
some thinking.

88

Why don't you guys
join our agency?

89
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,291

I'm being serious here.

I respect the two of you...

92
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,500
...more than you think I do.

93
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,500
Sorry, Largonkin, but no thanks.

94
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,833
We're comfortable with this
master-pet situation we've got.

95
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,208
I'm surprised to say it, but
I agree with what the pet says.

96
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,625
So, what then?

97
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,041
Am I just not good enough
to fill Diorg's shoes?

00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,791
--Watch it, man.
--Largonkin!

99
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,000
[LARGONKIN]
My apologies.

100
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,291
Please forget I said that.

101
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,208
[LARGONKIN]
Oh, one more thing.

102
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,708
For what it's worth, a colleague
saw Cuello in Eridana.

103
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,083
[gasps]

104
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,875
[LARGONKIN] I thought it
only right to let you know.

Cuello doing here?

[VINNEL] Regarding the
Aurora Hammer research

107
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,625
you've requested.

108
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,291
We've uncovered some
rather perilous info

109
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,500
regarding a man named Parumuwei.

110
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,208
He's a former Rahzel employee,

111
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,666
but he makes his living selling
weapons in Eridana these days.

112
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,458
Our intel shows
that Aurora Hammer's

113
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,375
been in contact with him.

114
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,375
We just got the same info from
the police, so that confirms it.

115
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,791
Are they in Eridana
to obtain weapons?

116
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,875
Certainly looks
that way, at least.

[VINNEL] At the moment,
it's still hard to say.

I haven't been able to
pinpoint their hideout yet.

top is regulating information.

enough to notice me.

Heh. Well, thanks for
being so obvious about it.

We're really getting
surrounded a lot lately.

Yeah, everyone
wants a piece of me.

00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,375
Guess the world's finally
taking note of my charms.

There are too many.

It's a pain, but should we?

00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,750
Not just yet.

135
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,541
So, Egurrd.
You've got us trapped,

136
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,708
but you haven't actually
bothered attacking us.

137
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,250
Am I wrong in assuming you
don't actually want us dead?

138
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,083
Brass wants to meet you.

Hey, Egurrd.

There's a thousand
better ways to say that.

[EGURRD]
Hm?

143
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,166
And each one of them includes
a single common word. "Please."

144
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,625
I've brought them as requested.

145
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,250
Good work.

146

Welcome, Offensive Jushikiists.

Glad you're here.
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Gohhel.

I'm the head director
of Dragon's Jaw.

149
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,500
I assume that you're
familiar with our work?

150
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,333
Yeah, I know of Dragon's Jaw.

151
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,333
They're a strategic
special ops task force

behest of Queen Xenobia of Ilm.

of a military man on him.

Excuse me?

I noticed you opened your

The unique habit of
a man who's seen combat.

157

You could've shared that
observation with me, y'know.

158
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,416
Not my fault you're
too dumb to use your eyes.

00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,833
I imagine you'd like to know
the reason we revealed our hand.

161
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,583
We would like you to refrain
from any further investigation

162
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,333
into the Rahzel Company
or the Aurora Hammer.

163
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,625
Our mission is to eliminate
all hostile forces

164
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,833
plotting against
the Dragon Empire.

165
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,083
We can't risk the involvement
of amateurs complicating things.

166
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,541
I hope you understand.

167
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,083
[GAYUS]
Can't say I do.

168
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,791
The Aurora Hammer is unwavering

169
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,791
in their intent to overturn
the dictatorship in Urmun.

170
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,416
And we both know
Dochetta's a thorn

171
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,750
in the side of
the Dragon Empire.

172
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,125
I could understand if you were
maneuvering to assist them,

173
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,833
but defeating them
doesn't make any sense.

174
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,125
It does sound like a
backwards plan of action.

175
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,458
[GAYUS] The only logical
reason I can conjure up...

176
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,333
...is that you've
got tracks to cover.

177
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,208
Like Viscount Remedius
joining the Aurora Hammer.

178
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,125
[EGURRD gasps]

179
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,625
[GOHHEL]
Stand down.

180
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,791
[GOHHEL]
I'm afraid you're right.

181
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,666
After witnessing
the misery in Urmun

182
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,625
while being held as a hostage,

183
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,875
the Viscount came to sympathize
with the Aurora Front.

184
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,958
And to make matters
even worse...

185
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,541
Colonel, sir!

186
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,875
[GOHHEL]
Party Leader Zemunn's followers

187
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,041
didn't care for his planned
reconciliation with Dochetta.

188
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,791
So they joined up with a man
named Zhuo Lu and ousted Zemunn.

189
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,333
From there, they formed an
even more extreme organization

190
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,291
known as Aurora Hammer.

191
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,916
You're telling me a hostage took
over an anti-government outfit?

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,083
[GOHHEL]
The Viscount is Tsevellen.

193
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,250
With this turn of events,
it could be perceived

194
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,958
the Dragon Empire is meddling
in the affairs of Urmun.

195
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,500
Yes, it could.

196
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,791
So that raid during the hostage
exchange was a distraction.

197
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,375
Your real objective there...

198
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,291
...was to assassinate
Viscount Remedius.

199
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,291
That exchange was a farce.

200
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,166
Nothing more than a
show by the Viscount

201
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,458
to secure funds for his group.

202
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,958
We simply played along
to take advantage.

203
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,458
So the poison in the
identifier device--

204
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,958
that was your nasty
handiwork, wasn't it?

205
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,208
We had all of Aurora
Hammer right there.

206
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,333
It's not like we could pass up

207
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,500
the opportunity
to eradicate them.

208
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,541
You understand now, don't you?

209
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,208
We'll take it from here
with no further interference.

210
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,083
And this isn't
a request, gentlemen.

211
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,541
It's an order.

212
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,458
To be perfectly clear,

213
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,500
even if Calpulnia comes begging
tearfully on her hands and knees

214
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,416
for you to help her,
you firmly turn her down.

215
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,291
That's all I have to tell you.

216
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,750
And please try not to forget

217
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,666
that this order is coming
from the government.

218
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:11,958
[creaking, clattering]

219
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:18,208
That all adds up to
1,023,420,000 yen.

220
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,833
Gotta say, it's a pleasure
doing business with you.

221
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,416
I'm impressed that you
hid all of this, Parumuwei.

222
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,833
Quite crafty.

223
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,458
I was informed you're
a former Rahzel employee.

224
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,666
Yeah, I am.

225
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,833
I'm curious.

226
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,041
How in the world
do you intend to

227
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,958
covertly transport all of this?

228
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,791
[ZHUO LU] I don't see how
that's any of your concern.

229
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,958
Say... are you, um...

230
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,625
Are you actually serious
about purchasing that?

231
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,666
I feel like I should be
more upfront with you.

232
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,208
The thing was
never even completed.

233
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,916
Rahzel and the military
only got so far with the project

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,458
before abandoning it.

235
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,958
[ZHUO LU]
I couldn't care less.

236

You don't plan on
actually using it?

237
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,541
It was only intended
as deterrence.

238
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,583
And besides, one would
need to complete

239
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,916
the entire composition
shiki in order to use it.

has a taste for wild kittens

why we've captured you.

a walking, talking pestilence.

and bury the hatchet?

argued with Gigina today.

that's not utter crap.

you should be agreeing on!

you had the day off.

You know what would
make it better, though?

Hm?

For an uncultured Draken, you're
actually pretty well-versed.

But can you tell me
which period it's from?

329
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,958
[GIGINA]
Hm. Middle.

330
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,083
If you want me to
be more specific,

331
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,583
it's from when he was working
with painter Iem Adder.

332
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,958
It's an exceptionally
rare piece.

333

Looks like you and I share
more than a few hardships.

334
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,000
I guess that's true.

335

But you two seem like
you work well together.

What? You're not happy?

Our agency? We're all
basically family.

340
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,833
I was a mess before
Largonkin took me in.

341
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,583
I was reeling from a recent
divorce, just lost my job,

342
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,625
and had nowhere to go.

343
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,791
Same with Iegie.
He's got a similar story.

344
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,791
He's come to adore
Chief Largonkin like a father.

00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,208
Family, huh?

346
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,125
Don't say it like a bad thing!

[ROLCA] There ya go.
I'm all done with the repairs.

with the seventh-order
Jushiki on this thing.

353
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,125
Talk about overkill.

354
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,041
No wonder it broke down.

355
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,875
You swapped the engine chamber
with a Rahzel one, huh?

356
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,833
[ROLCA]
Yeah.

Great job, as always.

360

Now then, go on and
hand over that Majouken.

[GAYUS gasps]
Wait, are you saying--

362
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,375
Yeah, well, you had a part

363
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,166
in that Magatsushki
incident, didn't you?

364
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,166
Consider this an
early investment.

365
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,583
A temporary rental.

366

Are you sure?

Just don't die on me.

Or at least pay your tab first.

And besides.

[GAYUS]
What?

371
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,166
Let's talk inside.

372
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,958
[ROLCA] Gayus, where exactly
did you come across this?

373
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,916
It was a rotten gift left behind
by a man I utterly despise.

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,416
It's called the
Eye of the Cosmos.

375
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,333
The Eye of the Cosmos, eh?

376
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,833
So? What were the
analysis results?

377
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,833
Well, I wasn't able to find
much, but I can tell you this.

378
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,416
The carving on it's engraved
from the scales of a dragon

379
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,250
that's been alive
for over 10,000 years.

380
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,750
Ten thousand?

381
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,625
As in nine more than a
1,000-year class Altar?

382
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,500
That's right.
We're talkin' about a dragon

383
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,208
that far outranks that.

384
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,208
And I've put this
through the ringer.

385
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,166
Ran it through
all kinds of equipment,

386
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,333
but it's unidentifiable.

387
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,375
Although I did get
one analysis report

388
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,875
that something was
pulsating within it.

And what does that mean?

[ROLCA] Well, simply put, this
ring of yours is somehow alive.

391
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,000
Alive?

I hope you take my advice here.

393

that back to the man you hate.

Or only... with this Cuello?

474
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,416
Listen.

475
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,958
[JIV]
Go home for the night.

476
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,625
Please leave.

477
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,291
[GAYUS]
Such a hard-ass.

478
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,458
You're a genuine
hard-ass, Gayus.

479
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:30,083
Someone goes and digs up a few
old scars and look at you now.

480
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:33,416
It doesn't matter
how hard I try to forget.

481
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,666
My past is right
where I left it.

482
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,458
Always questioning me...

483
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,541
...whispering in my ear

484
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,166
and asking if I
made the right choice.

485
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,166
Damn it.

486
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,750
Such a hard-ass.

487
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,583
You really wanna prove yourself?

488
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,333
Impossible.

489
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,458
You can't escape your past!

490
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,333
I see. Well done.

491
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,666
I swear.

492
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,291
I simply can't help but loathe
myself on nights like these.

493
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,708
[GAYUS]
A kind angel flies into the sky,

494
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,291
trying to save the earth.

495
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,000
It mistakenly flew at a height
the people could reach.

496
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,125
So the angel of salvation's
wings and flesh

497
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,916
became the people's desire,

498
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,291
until there wasn't a single
feather left to save them.
