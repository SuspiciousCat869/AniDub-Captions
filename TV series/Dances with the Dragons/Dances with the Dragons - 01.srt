00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,000
[GAYUS]
Tsevellen Year 223.

2
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,208
Using the Event
Induction Computer,

3
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:48,416
humanity successfully creates
its first space-time bubble.

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,250
The fundamental rules of physics
within the bubble are altered,

5
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,416
breaking the law of
conservation of energy,

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,958
including the Planck constant,
causing the emergence

7
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,666
of matter derived from
quantum field instructions.

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,250
The hyper-physical phenomenon
that allows matter to be

9
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,958
extracted at will
from vacuum fluctuations

10
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,083
forms the basis of
the system of technology

11
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,458
that will soon come
to be known as Jushiki.

12
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,208
[GAYUS] And now, we find
ourselves in Imperial Year 497.

13
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,458
[GAYUS] What was once called
"magic," and thought of as

14
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,083
the domain of dragons and
other abhorrent creatures,

15
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,958
has been correctly
identified as the power

16
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,625
that humans have gained
through Jushiki.

17
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,708
[GAYUS] Therefore,
dragons and the abhorrent

18
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,708
are no longer the subject
of awe and fear,

19
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,750
but enemies to be hunted down
and slain by humankind.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,166
[growls]

21
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,166
[GAYUS] Those who specialize
in eliminating these foes

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,916
by weaving attack Jushiki

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,791

Offensive Jushikiists.

24
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,791
[GAYUS sighs]

25
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,416
Don't look at me like that.

26
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,375
This might be the buffer zone
between us and the dragons...

27
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,708
...but if you're
gonna eat people,

28
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,125
then you leave us with
no choice but to kill you.

29
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,458
So...

30
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,750
[GIGINA]
Bit late for apologies.

31
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,416
This is our job.

32
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,375
We are Offensive Jushikiists.

33
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,208
[GAYUS]
It still sucks.

34
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,500
[GIGINA]
But fighting the dragons

35
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,500
is the highest honor there is.

36
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,333
I'm okay with it.

37
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,166
Well, sure, honor's
really important to you.

38
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,458
I mean, you're one
of the fighting race.

39
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,791
But not all of us are

00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,833
the noble Gigina Jardi
Doruk Meleios Ashley-Bufh.

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,291
If you're so smart, then what
was that sad excuse for an Aini?

42
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,791
[GAYUS]
What do you mean?

43
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,583
[GIGINA] You didn't generate
enough to cover the distance

44
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,208
between you and the target.

45
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,666
If I'd gotten there a
fraction of a second later,

46
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,833
you'd be dead right now.

47
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,916
[GAYUS]
Yeah, but--

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,875
I just figured
it'd be a good idea

49
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,000
to buy us a little
time, that's all.

50
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,916
I totally knew you'd
be there to back me up.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,208
Come on, Gigina.

52
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,000
Any dragon killer
with half a brain

53

would expect his
loyal Draken to--

You're such a pain in the ass.

Are all your people this touchy?

61
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,916
[GAYUS] I knew we
wouldn't get off that easy.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,541
The report said we were
looking for a pair of dragons.

63
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,041
And they're 500-year class,

64
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,416
so they're gonna
put up a good fight.

65
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,041
Well, at least we know
what we'll be up against.

Quite unfitting of the
Oujes Emperor's proxy.

In that case, what do you think?

Enlighten us,

165
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,583
I think between the fight
for the Alsok territory,

166
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:07,625
and the prevailing dragonkind
Vaisen, as well as the Kenryu,

167
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,250
we've got multiple headaches
to contend with.

I call it the Jushikiist
Murder Spree!

The story hasn't gotten much
attention in the media so far,

but three Offensive Jushikiists
have been assassinated recently!

All three were pretty strong,

246

but the perp eighty-sixed
each one with a single blow!

247
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,541
I think the murders are
connected. And if I'm right,

248
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:06,000
that means we've got a seriously
nasty killer on our hands!

each time this guy
offs another victim,

00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,875
he gets a little bit closer
to the center of town.

252
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,416
I'm guessing from the M.O.
that he's hunting Jushikiists

253
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,041
'cause he wants to zero in
on a specific target.

I ordered from Rolca's shop.

318
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,083
But don't worry. The payment's
already been sent to the office.

00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,166
[door slams shut]

320
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,541
Is he sick? He doesn't
seem very happy.

321
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,791
[ROLCA] All right, pleasure
doin' business with ya.

322
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,125
Huh?

323
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,333
You're extra smiley
today, Rolca.

324
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,166
What's with you?

325
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,958
Oh, don't give me that.

326
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,541
You wiped out a
semi-Altar black dragon.

327
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,041
I'm guessin' you made a
killin' on a job like that.

328
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,500
Sorry, things are a
little messy right now.

329
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,416
You mind if I pay my tab
at the end of the month?

330
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,416
It's startin' to add up, kid.

331
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I know.

332
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,833
By the way,
where did you find out

333
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,000
about me slaying that dragon?

334
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,541
[ROLCA]
Everybody's heard.

335
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,833
You've been advertising
it all over town.

336
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,125
I've never seen this ad!

337
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,125
[ROLCA] They were
postin' 'em everywhere.

338
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,541
Even handin' 'em out
at city hall.

339
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,250
[GAYUS] Is Chief Sutherland
trying to pull something?

340
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,666
[ROLCA]
Hey, it's free buzz!

341
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,833
--[CITIZENS cheering]
--I'd be grateful if I were you.

--[popping]

343
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,500
You have any idea why it's
so lively out there today?

344
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,000
You gotta be kiddin'.

345
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,625
Tomorrow's the annual
Eridana festival, remember?

346
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,708
Is it really that time already?

347
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,708
Oh, no.

348
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:49,375
[CITIZENS chattering]

349
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,541
You're telling me you actually
remembered it this year?

350
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,583
Uh, yeah. Why wouldn't I?

351
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,125
I mean, I had to stand you up
last year 'cause of my job.

352
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,916
So this time I decided
to make arrangements

353
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,916
a whole month in
advance, just for you!

354
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,958
Why would I lie to you?

355
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,291
Fine, I believe you.

356
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,375
Now! Eat up, darling!

357
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,458
It's a traditional Alurian dish,

358
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,833
pigeon falusi with
cranberry sauce!

359
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,166
Uh, Jiv?

360
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,708
Question.

361
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:25,916
Is Alurian food always this
purple and poisonous-looking?

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,083
[JIV]
Mmm, delicious!

363
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,041
Go ahead and dig in
before it gets cold, okay?

364
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,083
--[JIV chewing]
--Um... thanks, honey.

[MAN 1A]
Excuse me.

367
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,916
[MOULDEEN]
Hm? There you are.

368
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,708
Tell me, have we
selected our guards yet?

369
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:47,791
Yes, sir.

370
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,125
I think they'll do quite well.

371
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,541
[MOULDEEN]
Hmm. Interesting.

372
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,583
He went to Lyunerg
Imperial University.

373
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,750
It's too bad he
quit graduate school.

374
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:02,291
Did the two of you attend
at the same time, by chance?

375
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,166
[MAN 1A]
Yes. We were friends, actually.

376
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,083
In fact, he was one of
the elite students

377
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,875
in the research facility.

378
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,291
[MOULDEEN] So he could have
made his career in research.

379
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,708
[MOULDEEN] Were they the ones
who defeated that black dragon?

380
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,166
[MAN 1A]
Yes, sir.

381
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,291
[MOULDEEN]
I see.

382
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,166
That's excellent.

What's the matter?

390
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,208
[GAYUS] Uh, nothing.
I was just lost in thought.

391
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,208
You're always thinking about
something, aren't you, Gayus?

392
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,291
I guess so.

393

I'm a science-oriented
Jushikiist.

394

The gears are
constantly turning.

I don't mean that.

396

What I'm saying is, I never know
what you're thinking about.

397
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:03,333
But your mind always seems like
it's somewhere far away from me.

You wanna know what
I was thinking about?

399
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,083
I was sitting here watching
my beautiful girlfriend Jivenya

00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,625
making some coffee,

401
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,708
and I thought, "Wow,
look at that sexy little ass.

402
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,541
How lucky am I to have her?"

--[GAYUS] Yup.

There's nothing better
than being with you.

406
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,500
Nothing.

407
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,583
[NIDVOLK]
How unfortunate.

408
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:34,625
What would possess this man
to try and do me harm?

409
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:39,166
[NIDVOLK]
Alas, regardless of the reason,

410
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,250
I was wrong again.

411
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,666
My enemies will soon pay.

[GAYUS]
Screaming, we ask the question

413

in search of the

my chest is adorned.

roses within the truth.
