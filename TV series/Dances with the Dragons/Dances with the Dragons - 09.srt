1
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,791
[JIV]
Morning already?

2
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,375
[JIV sighs]
Right.

3
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,625
I have to go to work.

4
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,208
Your appetite is impressive for
it being so early in the day.

5
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,958
Anyone who can't
eat this much food

6
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,875
has no business being
an Offensive Jushikiist.

7
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,625
I like your style.

8
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,458
I ate like that in my day.

9
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,791
Sure brings back memories.

10
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,750
All right.

11
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,666
You and I both know you
didn't just ask us here

12
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,791
to have a nice breakfast.

13
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,333
Right. It's been three days now.

14
00:02:56,416 --> 00:03:00,625
Which means it's time
for this "evening party."

15
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,833
This map illustrates all
the places the Magatsushiki

16
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,166
have emerged
during the past month.

17
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,791
Wow, they're really scattered.

18
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,291
Yes. So we decided to expand
our investigation to include

19
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,208
any similar incidents that
occurred in the past six months.

20
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,625
[GAYUS]
That's a lot!

21
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,125
They may not all be connected,
but it's safe to assume

22
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,958
preparations for
the "evening party"

23
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,416
have been underway for a while.

24
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,583
Either way, we're sure
to end up trading blows

25
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,541
with those Great
Magatsushiki somehow.

26
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,125
[GAYUS]
Yeah, but without knowing

27
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,791
what the "evening party" is or
what Jushiki they'll be using,

28
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,125
we can't really
make any solid plans.

29
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,250
Magatsushiki are wildcards.

30
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,875
Every one of them is unique,
with its own skills and quirks.

31
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,041
We'll just have to wait.

32
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,458
[YAHKTO]
We hypothesized in the past

33
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,541
that the Magatsushiki's
very existence

34
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:55,583
was in itself a form of Jushiki,
which appears to be correct.

35
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,708
The Magatsushiki
seem to have originated

36
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,666
from somewhere in
high-dimensional phase space,

37
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,875
which also happens to be

38
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,791
the fundamental
qualifier of Jushiki.

39
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,083
So they're creatures
from some other dimension?

40
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,208
Indeed.

41
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,708
That's what we've
come to understand.

42
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,291
But they need a medium in
order to appear in this world,

43
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,500
so they have to latch onto
something or someone

44
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,333
that already exists.

45
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,500
Uh-huh.

46
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,416
In other words,
those things are only here

47
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,083
because something
is hosting them.

48
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,416
So this is called "food," eh?

49
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,083
It's a fascinating concept.

50
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,208
Don't you agree,
Baron Janahn Ghalan?

51
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,625
It tastes no different
than steel to me.

52
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,541
My.

53
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,958
I do believe our neighbors here

54
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,125
have forgotten
their table manners.

55
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,833
You should have a seat.

56
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,458
I assure you we didn't come
to pick a fight with anyone.

57
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,541
Now that the evening
party is underway,

58
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,416
we're going to
play by the rules.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,625
They're entities of information,

60
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,291
so rules mean
everything to them.

61
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,333
Got it.

62
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,708
[AMUPURA]
Forgive my eavesdropping,

63
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,791
but I heard every word of that.

64
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,333
Clearly, you still
don't understand

65
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,958
the purpose behind this
little soiree of ours.

66
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,416
So, allow me to
give you a little clue.

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,833
The "evening party" is actually
one big, bad Jushiki curse.

68
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,625
If you want to
stop the festivities,

69
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,375
you'll have to
defeat the caller.

70
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,791
The caller?

71
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,458
Are you saying
somebody summoned you?

72
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,541
Tell me!

73
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,250
Sorry, that's
privileged information.

74
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,916
[JANAHN] We haven't yet
become the masters

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,958
of our own destinies,
you understand.

76
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,791
[AMUPURA] If you want
my advice, your first move

77
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,250
should be to study the board
with extreme precision.

78
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,000
Although, if I'm being
honest with you,

79
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,166
you're not going to
like what you find out.

80
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,708
Oh, and about that Eye of
the Cosmos you've got there.

81
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,625
I would hold on tightly to it.

82
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,458
Damn.

83
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,625
[phone rings]

84
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,583
Hey, Iegie.

85
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,000
Go get Jabeira.

86
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,500
Those two clowns are back.

87
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,291
We need the team.

88
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,208
Shall we go with them?

89
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,041
No.

90
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,083
[phone rings]

91
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,250
[VINNEL]
I have some intel, for a price.

92
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,291
[VINNEL] Here's the location
of the Aurora Hammer's hideout.

93
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,916
The weapons dealer
Parumuwei tipped me off.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,791
Of course, he died not long
after sharing that information.

95
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,000
[GAYUS]
This is it.

96
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,375
[GIGINA inhales]

97
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,666
Careful! What if there's a trap?

98
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,291
[GIGINA]
I already used Agane.

99
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,750
We'll be fine.

100
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,125
Look, that's a smart move,

101
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,208
but not even dogs can
sniff out sealed bombs.

102
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,375
Well, I don't smell any humans
on the other side, at least.

103
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,416
That's good enough for me.

104
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,250
[GIGINA] Hurry up, Gayus.
In the wise words of my people,

105
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,750
"Last one there has dragons
feast on his flesh."

106
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,375
You should talk.

107
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,583
Your fiancée probably says
your sense of urgency

108
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,458
conveniently comes and goes--

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,958
Less talking, more walking.

110
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,666
[gasps] Egurrd?

[GOHHEL]
What are you two doing in here?

113
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,625
You were told to wash
your hands of this matter.

114
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:46,041
I made myself perfectly clear!

115
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,416
Yeah, well,

116
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,750
last time I checked,
we don't answer to Dragon's Jaw.

117
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,875
This isn't a coincidence.

118

[gasps]

119
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,083
The hell is that?

120
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,416
[GIGINA]
Viscount Remedius.

121
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,125
[ZHUO LU]
How kind.

122
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,291
I didn't expect
such a warm welcome.

Zhuo Lu!

[ZHUO LU] I don't see what
you would gain from attacking

126
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,541
a three-dimensional

127

[groans]

128
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,625
[ZHUO LU]
I pity you, Remedius.

129
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,250
You were closer to me
than anyone in this world.

130
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,041
I've called you all here
to tell you something.

131
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,375
It's a message from the
late Viscount Remedius.

132
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,750
[EGURRD]
What did he say?

133
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,333
His death couldn't
have been avoided.

134
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,250
And I think you know
the reason why.

135
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,666
[GOHHEL grunts]

136
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,208
But it's the truth.

137
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,291
The Dragon Empire created the
anti-government organization

138
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,083
known as Aurora Front.

139
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,916
It was later re-named
Aurora Hammer,

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,625
but there's no
denying its origins.

141
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,583
That is some serious
foreign interference.

142
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,916
Then, what happened
at the hostage exchange--

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,333
that was meant to be a cover-up

144
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,416
for the Dragon Empire's
own scandal.

145
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,541
No. That can't be right.

146
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,708
[GIGINA]
Hm?

147
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,416
If the Dragon Empire wanted to

148
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,875
take out the
Dochetta administration,

149
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,916
then the Aurora Hammer
would be very helpful to have.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,666
And so would the
Viscount, of course.

151
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,583
Remedius was a civilian,

152
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,708
which is why nobody picked up
on the Empire's scent.

153
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,708
There would have been no
obvious incentive to kill him.

154
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,250
[ZHUO LU chuckles]

155
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,041
The one part that
doesn't make sense

156
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,458
is why Remedius hated
Rahzel and the Empire

157
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,416
enough to risk his own life.

158
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,583
Why doesn't your organization

159
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,000
have a way of
explaining that, I wonder.

160
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,000
Dragon's Jaw should know.

161
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,666
That's the thing you
ought to be investigating.

162
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,916
Now, you must listen
to Remedius's words.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,791
You're about to be
filled with more hatred

164
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,875
than you've ever known.

165
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,791
By the time anyone sees
this video recording,

166
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,375
I will have already passed on.

167
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,166
But if it serves to gain control
of the twin Jushiki warheads,

168
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,041
my life will not have
been sacrificed in vain.

169
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,041
I speak of the Jushiki
born from my research,

170
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,708
sealed away before anyone
had a chance to initialize it.

171
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,833
The one called Ava Dorn.

172
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,000
[gasps]

173
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,541
[REMEDIUS]
I built an initialization curse

174
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,166
that was never finished.

175
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,000
To use it requires the Jushiki
power of several dozen people.

176
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,708
That, and the
computational power,

177
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,208
need to be akin to an Altar's.

178
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,458
Now, the time has come.

179
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:41,041
Ava Dorn... is a
devastating weapon

180
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,833
that joins this
world to the other.

181
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,250
Both of the Jushiki
warheads will be detonated

182
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,541
at high noon today, and
their target is Rahzel Island.

183
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,458
[ALL gasp]

184
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,458
This is your warning.

185
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:58,083
The Dragon Empire will cease
all exports of Jushiki weapons.

186
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:02,875
This message is being sent to
Eridana City and the Empire.

187
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,458
Should even one person
attempt to escape the island,

188
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,875
the two warheads
will instantly detonate.

189
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,000
The Rahzel Company
has betrayed me

190
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,708
in the most despicable
way imaginable.

191
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,041
So, to them, I happily say...

192
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,416
...die.

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Die.

194
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:26,166
Die. Die. Die.

195
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,833
Die. Die. Die. Die.

196

Die. Die. Die.

00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:57,291
Die. Die. Die. Die.

Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.

202
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:08,750
Die. Die. Die.

203
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,958
All of you, die!

204
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,208
That is my one and only
desire-- that you be

205
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,416
forced to taste the hell
that I've passed on to Zhuo Lu!

206
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,291
Every member of Rahzel
deserves to face

207
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,041
the same despair and
suffering Naricia endured!

208
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:30,875
[laughs]

209
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,541
What will you do?

210
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,333
It's almost high noon.

211
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:39,041
Before long, Remedius's curse
will decimate the island. Well?

212
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,708
Let's go.

213
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,208
Gigina.

214
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:47,583
[GAYUS] Jiv is on
Rahzel Island... right now!

215
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,416
[JIV]
Hey, it's Jivenya!

216
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,958
Sorry, but I'm currently
at the Rahzel Company.

217
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,250
Feel free to leave a message--

218
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,375
You can call her all you want,
but if your woman is there,

219
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,750
no phone message will
get her out of danger.

220
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,291
I know that!

221
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,000
Everyone on that island
is being held hostage.

222
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,375
Damn it!

223
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,833
Why is this happening?

224
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,500
Why's everything so hard?

225
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,666
Stop it, Gayus.

226
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,916
What am I, cursed or something?

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,458
Everywhere I go,
bad things always follow me!

228
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,500
No matter how hard I try
to do what's right,

229
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,041
it blows up in my face!

230
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,208
Gayus!

231
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,458
[GAYUS gasps]

232
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,833
[GIGINA] I'm not as good at
expressing myself as you are,

233
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,833
but my past, every
decision I've ever made,

234
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:40,416
for better or worse,
is a part of who I am today.

235
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,458
I can't pretend
any of it didn't happen.

236
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,250
That doesn't help.

237
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,125
[GIGINA]
I know.

238
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,416
Gigina.

239
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,125
What would you do?

240
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,000
Speaking as a Draken,

241
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,458
I gladly face any battle
that's in front of me.

242
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,750
But if I'm speaking
as an individual,

243
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,250
I pay my debts.

244
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,875
That's all.

245
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,125
[GAYUS]
Okay, then let's pay our debts.

246
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,833
[YAHKTO] On the screen
is a top-secret experiment

247
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,875
on the seventh-order metatheorem
Jushiki conducted 13 years ago.

248
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,875
It's known as Ava Dorn.

249
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,208
Whoa!

250
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,875
They made a
dimensional hole, huh?

251
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,291
What's next is the issue.

252
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,083
This is the world
of Magatsushiki.

253
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,541
Because of the enormous
computational capacity

254
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,916
in their environment,

255
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,791
a multitude of wretched
plague demons were summoned

256
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,333
from deep within
the pits of chaos.

257
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,833
They're simple beings that can't
even be defined as Magatsushiki,

258
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,083
but that makes them
all the more--

259
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,875
Hey. What's going on?

260
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,541
[gasping]

261
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,708
[chokes]

262
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,291
[gags]

263
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,541
[YAHKTO]
Fifty-eight seconds

264
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,000
following the initial
plague demon infection,

265
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,583
its Jushiki causes
mass cell death.

266
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:03,250
At 113 seconds, victims
bleed from every orifice...

267
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,041
...then fall into a coma.

268
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:10,166
Finally, 137 seconds from
contact, the infected die.

269
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,958
There is no cure.

270
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:16,541
The fatality rate
is 100 percent.

271
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:21,625
Ava Dorn has a large radius--
about 600 meters wide.

272
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,916
If it were to be activated
above Rahzel Island...

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,666
Just say it.

274
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,125
Then all 1,205 people
on the island

275
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,541
would suffer through hell,
followed by death.

276
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,250
The Rahzel Company's
taking action right now.

277
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,541
They're evacuating
non-island staff members

278
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,750
to outside the city.

279
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,416
Everyone thinks it's
just a training drill.

280
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,875
[GAYUS]
But everyone else!

281
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,125
Can't we at least contact
the island and make a plan?

282
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:54,166
No, all communication and
transportation's been cut off.

283
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,833
This was the mayor's call.

284
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,916
The police's hands are now tied.

285
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,041
[gasps]

286
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,875
So we're just gonna
let them all die?

287
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,083
We could stop this if we
disarm the two warheads

288
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,875
before they detonate, though.

289
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,958
Yeah, but if we knew
where they were,

290
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,291
we wouldn't be sitting here.

291
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,666
Course not.

292
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,333
But finding 'em
is our only hope.

293
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,083
We have two hours.

294
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,833
Let's think.

295
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
[GAYUS]
This is a crisis, Gigina.

296
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,916
How can you sit in a chair
relaxing like that?

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,708
I'm enjoying this chair
because there's a crisis.

298
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,458
[GAYUS] Well, it looks
like the staff evacuation

299
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,625
is going smoothly, at least.

300
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,958
Imagine how much we could
smuggle during this.

301
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,958
[beeping]

302
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,375
There's obviously an
electromagnetics Jushikiist

303
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,541
jamming it.

304
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,541
You can't get through.

00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,916
[GAYUS gasps]

306
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,083
[JIV] What's going on?
I've got tons of messages--

307
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:54,916
Listen!

Oh, right.

I did hear a few people say

00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,166
they were having trouble
getting a good signal--

I'm sorry... about last night.

[GAYUS]
Jiv...

321
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,166
Just gimme a second, okay?

322
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,416
Gigina.

323
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,166
Your flight Jushiki...

324
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,791
Couldn't that save her?

325
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,625
It is possible.

326
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,583
But, then...

327
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,083
Please!

328
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,125
You're serious?

329
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,958
Yeah.

330
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,583
Let me tell you one of the
wisest of Draken sayings.

331
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,541
"Whether you speak from
your mouth or from your ass,

332
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,625
the results can often
be quite similar."

333
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,083
You shouldn't resign yourself
to the curse of a deceased man.

334
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,041
His murderous ambitions
are dog feces

335
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,958
on the side of the road to us.

336
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,500
And you should never accept
the death of your woman,

337
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,708
especially without
so much as a fight.

338
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,541
[GAYUS]
Jiv.

339
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,666
I want to apologize in person.

340
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,125
[JIV]
What's wrong with you?

341
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,541
You're acting weird today.

342
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,791
[GAYUS] We should
go out to eat next Sunday.

343
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,000
I know a restaurant
that has amazing crab.

344
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,958
You'll love it.

345
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,458
Let's go, Jiv.

346
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,875
Promise me.

347
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,416
That's fine, Gayus.

348
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,166
But why...?

349
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,583
Are you sure?

350
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,708
Yeah.

351
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,958
No matter what happens,

352
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,750
I swear I'm gonna
win this fight!

353
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,250
[GAYUS]
Okay.

354
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,708
So, let's assume our famous
chells prodigy Remedius

355
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,500
put together a perfect
game board for us.

356
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,000
There are two
Jushiki warheads...

357
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,375
...but how are they set off?

358
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,125
[GAYUS] The Jushiki power
of several people combined,

359
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,875
which is comparable
to that of an Altar.

360
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,375
And that's the core
of alchemy Jushiki.

361
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:15,083
So what are the two keys
that unlock the two warheads?

362
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,500
And what's the equation for
the plague demon's Jushiki?

363
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,291
Wait! I've got it!

364
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,708
It's so clear.

365
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,208
Hey, Gigina!

366
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,208
I figured out how this "evening
party" is gonna go down.

367
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,166
[GAYUS]
It was Remedius who summoned

368
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,958
those two Great Magatsushiki.

369
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,125
With the power they hold,

370
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,083
plus the Jushiki gathered
from all those people,

371
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,791
the two warheads can activate.

372
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,250
For the grand finale,

373
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,125
Amupura and Janahn Ghalan
will become the core,

374
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,375
fulfilling the
detonation conditions.

375
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,583
That's the "evening party"
they kept talking about.

376
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,041
So, that means Ava Dorn
is actually...

377
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,291
If we aren't able to
destroy those warheads,

378
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,541
they will initialize.

379
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,625
Remedius is a genius,

380
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,625
but there's one thing
he couldn't stop.

381
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,375
And that's the will of
the Great Magatsushiki.

382
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,208
They want to fight us
during the evening party,

383
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,583
but not because of the plan.

384
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,125
They're provoking us for
their own entertainment,

385
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,916
which is why they decided to
draw us in by leaving us a hint.

386
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,500
The Magatsushiki locations?

387
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,625
How's that gonna help?

388
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,708
The ones at Boshor Point
had human-like faces.

389
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,875
Giant fangs at
the dental clinic,

390
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:37,125
then Deacon Sarvey and a model
castle at Largonkin's office.

391
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,250
Elephant at the zoo.

392
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,375
Large bird at the storage place.

393
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,375
You're right!

394
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,875
I get it now.

395
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,916
It all makes perfect sense!

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah.

397
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,416
The appearances
might've seemed random,

398
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,125
but they were abiding
by a set of rules.

399
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,375
[IEGIE]
Rules? You're confusing me.

400
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,750
[gasps]

401
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,458
When the pawn gets over there,
it turns into a dragon.

402
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,875
If you're trying to
win a game of chells,

403
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,916
you need to make your
dragon the strongest.

404
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,625
I've heard rumors
that you've memorized

405
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,708
every move of every chells
game you've ever played.

406
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,333
Is that the truth?

407
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,250
Yes!

408
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,458
I remember it all, actually.

409
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,916
Everything I've seen, or heard,
or felt since I was born.

410
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,250
Every last detail.

411
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,166
That's quite a tragedy.

412
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,500
Huh?

413
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,166
[MOULDEEN]
Indeed.

414
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,708
What a sad existence.

415
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,875
Once human, now a dragon.

416
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,583
You've lost yourself.

417
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,875
[GAYUS] The chells pieces
that you typically see nowadays

418
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,208
have changed a lot from
the original designs.

419
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,500
For instance, the bishops
were once elephants.

420
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,833
Sometimes fangs, too.

421
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:54,208
And the castles used to be
ships or large birds.

422
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,583
Okay, I'm with you when you say

423
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,875
the Magatsushiki
are chells pieces.

424
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,583
But how does that
tell us the locations

425
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,208
of the damn Jushiki warheads?

426
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,291
[GAYUS] The "evening party"
is a chells match,

427
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,458
and the board is Eridana.

428
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,875
So, the Magatsushiki appeared

429
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,041
according to the
rules of the game.

430
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,708
And I know exactly
what the last move is.

431
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,250
It's going to be identical to
Remedius's famous winning play--

432
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,000
the one from the
continental championship.

433
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,083
Are you saying that you've
figured out where they are?

434
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,583
There's a white king that's
gonna lose the battle.

435
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,458
It's here-- Rahzel Island.

436
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,791
And the black dragon piece

437
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,291
that's going to put
the king in check...

438
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,750
...is Osedek Clock Tower!

439
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,000
[REMEDIUS]
Both of the Jushiki warheads

440
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,666
will be detonated
at high noon today

441
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,458
and their target
is Rahzel Island.

442
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,500
[GAYUS]
Take it from me, friend,

443
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,291
you shouldn't waste time
seeking eternal paradise.

444
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,166
Drink in the possibilities
of this realm

445
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,125
and set sail into
the sea of stars.

446
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:35,250
For your opportunities are
as infinite as the night sky.
