First Cuello and now her.

325
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,916
Why must you always
hide behind a woman?

326
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,291
[sighs]

327
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,166
That was scary.

328
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,250
Don't do that anymore.

329
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,833
He threatens me all the time.

330
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,333
Gayus! He could've hurt you!

331
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,333
Oh, Jiv.

332
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,666
[JIV]
So, who's this Cuello?

333
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,041
[gasps]

334
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,458
She's just... an Offensive
Jushikiist I knew once.

335
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,208
[JIV]
Hmm...

336
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,375
Okay, I had a thing with her.

337
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,083
But trust me.

338
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,166
I am all yours now.

339
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,583
[doorbell rings]

340
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,083
Every time!

341
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,833
[JIV]
You've got a visitor, stud.

342
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,541
I'd better be getting
to work anyway.

343
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,083
At least I got to
make you sweat a little.

344
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,500
Try not to die or cheat
on me while I'm gone, 'kay?

345
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,958
[sighs]

346
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,958
My name is Egurrd Lasgrissid.

347
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,875
I'm an Offensive Jushikiist
specializing in diplomacy.

348
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,958
And this is Calpulnia
Levvinakes Rahzel.

349
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,500
She'll be your client.

350
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,666
A pleasure.

351
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,375
I've come here
as a representative

352
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,208
of the Rahzel Foundation.

353
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,916
Rahzel? Really?

354
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
As in the company?

355
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,000
[EGURRD] Correct. In fact, she's
the head of the Rahzel Company--

356
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,916
one of the few corporate giants
in the Dragon Empire.

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,666
Okay, and what do you want

358
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,541
with a small private
agency like ours?

359
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,416
[CALPULNIA] I don't suppose you
know anything about my nephew,

360
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Remedius Levvi Rahzel?

361
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,791
Yeah. He's the
genius chells player

362
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,333
who became a
continental champion

363
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,458
at only 11 years of age.

364
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,666
And that's not all
he's famous for.

365
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,000
He's responsible for creating

366
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,625
almost all of
the Rahzel Company's

367
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,166
cutting-edge
technology, as well.

368
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,375
Wait, don't tell me he's--

369
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,291
That's right. Captured.

370
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,375
I'm not sure how it happened,
but it was two years ago.

371
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,208
He had traveled to the Urmun
Republic, though at the time

372
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,208
they were the Aurora Hammer
or the Aurora Front.

373
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,083
He never came home.

374
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,000
We've just come to an agreement
with them under the table

375
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,708
and the plan is to send them
a doctor and some ransom money

376
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,708
in exchange for Remedius.

377
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,958
The trade is in two days and
it's right here in Eridana City.

378
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,333
We have brought them
two billion yen.

379
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,958
[gasps] Two billion?

380
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,333
So what part do we
play in all this?

381
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,458
It's simple.

382
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,083
You two will act
as our bodyguards

383
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,875
and accompany us to
make the rendezvous.

384
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,458
Egurrd.

385
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,875
Have I given you permission to
smoke those disgusting things

386
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,125
in my presence?

387
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,375
No, ma'am. My apologies.

388
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,458
We have our own Jushikiists,

389
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,541
but they're not accustomed
to violent missions.

390
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,833
I've heard that the two
of you are 13th-grade,

391
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,333
so you're well-equipped
for the task.

392
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,125
I do hope you'll assist us.

393
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:07,666
Of course, the reward will be
very handsome. I promise.

394
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,208
Excuse me, there's
no smoking in here.

395
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,041
I'm not lightin' it.

396
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,333
Cuttin' back.

397
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,666
Wife only lets me
have so many a day.

398
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,625
[GAYUS] The report on
the Jinorei Firehouse.

399
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,250
Did you make me
hand-deliver this here

400
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,916
just so you could trap me in a
room with Largonkin the loner?

401
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,250
[LARGONKIN] If Baylick doesn't
wanna come right out and say it,

402
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,166
then I might as well.

403
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,625
Come work for the
Largonkin Company.

404
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,458
What?

405
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,583
[GIGINA]
Hm?

406
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,291
This is what
we're dealing with.

407
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,416
[BAYLICK]
The points on this map

408
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,458
represent all the
Magatsushki appearances

409
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,291
in Eridana this past month.

410
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,708
That is kind of a lot.

411
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,708
[BAYLICK]
That's why we received

412
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,333
a personal request
from the mayor

413
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,583
to hire some privately
contracted Jushikiists.

414
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,166
Normally, our company could
handle a problem like this

415
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,458
on our own.

416
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,625
But our HQ is on
the Alliance side.

417
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,458
So, we're enlisting you guys
from the Dragon Empire

418
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,083
in hopes of setting
up a joint front.

419
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,208
I don't mind teaming up with you
as long as the price is right.

420
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,541
That said... you're too late!

421
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,083
Hate to break it to you,

422
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,000
but we took a different job
right before you guys came in,

423
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,333
so we're booked solid!

424
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,000
[LARGONKIN] We'll gladly
accept any conditions.

425
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,791
Any?

426
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,166
[LARGONKIN]
Agreed.

427
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,083
With the help of contractors
Solei and Ashley-Bufh,

428
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,375
my company will
wipe out the Magatsushki.

429
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,666
Heh, heh.

430
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,916
Looking forward to it.

431
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,291
[yawns]

432
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,375
[BAD GUY 6A]
Look at that!

433
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,416
It appears our
marvelous evening party

434
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,208
is going off without a hitch.

435
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,458
[BAD GUY 6B]
Aside from your scouts

436
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:57,083
being defeated by the
Jushikiists, I suppose.

437
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,458
It's time to let
my men have a go.

438
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,291
Try to go easy on me,
if you don't mind.

439
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,625
[BAD GUY 6B]
No promises.

440
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,916
[BAD GUY 6A chuckles]

441
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,791
[BAD GUY 6A] This foul city
of conspiracy and deception

442
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:13,541
will make the ideal venue
for our dazzling performance.

443
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:18,333
Now, let's lift the curtain on
this comedy of blood and death.

444
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,166
[BAD GUY 6B]
Spilling blood to spill blood.

445
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,291
Murdering to murder.

446
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,666
Hell for the sake of hell.

447
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,916
We've created the game board.

448
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,458
The only question is,

449
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:36,041
who's going to set up the
first move and the last move?

450
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:40,166
[BAD GUY 6A]
Will it be you, me, or him?

451
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,500
Who's going to
get the final bow?

452
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:48,500
Let's sit back
and enjoy the show!

453
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,916
[GAYUS] Each human
is one piece of a puzzle.

454
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,458
If there was a world
that could be saved

455
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,583
by the strength of just one,

456
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,708
then there'd be no reason
for anyone else to exist in it.

457
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:34,625
And that would be a
wretched world indeed.
