I ran into her at
the library one time.

That's when she
introduced herself to me.

Since I had her name,
I found her in the phone book.

[GIGINA]
That woman is terrifying.

65
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,875
She had the nerve to lecture
a Draken warrior like me.

66
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,958
"Don't give Gayus any
problems," she said.

"If you cause him
trouble, you'll pay."

68

Her intensity was surprising.

Is she a master martial artist?

00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,250
Course not.

71
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,125
She's just your average
half-Alurian office worker.

Well, I was for a while.

But then I did a
little self-reflecting.

[GIGINA]

For a bureaucrat to
visit us in Eridana,

100
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,291
you must have some
important business.

give you a name.

a major figure staying in town.

down to business?

locals as your guides,

but why did you request us?

Welcome to the Eridana Festival.

135
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,166
It commemorates the
historic achievements

136

of the Singing Princess Eridana,

137

who united the
residents of our town

138

and led them to a
triumphant victory

during a time when this area
was occupied by foreigners.

That's the story of our home.

It's the City of
the Singing Princess.

Pretty interesting, huh?

143
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,166
Was this too
short-notice for you?

Huh? No, it's fine!

Your Eminence, forgive me
if I'm overstepping,

148
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,083
but you're not forgetting
your responsibility

Bear in mind, citizens.

We cannot hope to gain
anything from violence.

Nor can Lapetodes
gain from fighting us.

We mustn't engage them
over control of Alsoak.

His name is Genon.

He can disguise
himself as anyone.

00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,625
[MOULDEEN]
That's correct.

163
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,041
Including Genon and myself,

164
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,541
there are a total of
seven identical Mouldeens

165
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,708
scattered across the empire.

166
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,125
They're a courageous group.

167
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,083
They've saved my life
several times now.

168
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,041
The more insurance,
the better, you know.

169
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,625
I like to think of it
as a little game.

170
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,416
Game, huh? That's harsh.

172

Ah.

173
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,958
That's Jushiki, isn't it?

174
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,500
[GAYUS] Yeah. It's a first-order
chemical manipulation Jushiki.

175
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,041
We call it Lorei.

176
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,750
It's practically magic!

177
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,791
[GAYUS] It's just technology
bound by the laws of physics.

178
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,958
Well. You're quite the
pessimist, aren't you, boy?

179
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:55,000
More like a
pessimistic optimist.

180
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,166
I see.

181
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,083
I consider myself to be
an eternal optimist.

182
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,708
As long as children
can laugh and play,

183
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,541
I'll look upon this
world with a smile.

184
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,666
For the sake of that ideal,

185
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,125
I have betrayed, deceived,
and spilled the blood of many.

186
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,708
And that's not likely to change.

187
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,375
That's the cause I've
chosen to fight for.

188
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,791
If that's not reason enough,
I'll find another.

189
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,500
I'd say it's about
time to have lunch.

Let's see. Uh...

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,958
I know.

192
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,625
We'll have Urk cuisine.

193
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,458
That's my favorite kind.

[PROTESTER 2A]
The Lapetodes City Alliance

200
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,666
is ready to ratify
the Tienlun Accord!

201
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,083
We can't let them!

202
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,791

My, that policy is unpopular.

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,333
Can't they understand
that the Tienlun Accord

206
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,708
is nothing but an agreement

207
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,083
between all of dragonkind's
moderate parties?

208
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,458
It's designed to stop
unnecessary conflict

209
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,750
amongst the factions.

210
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,708
True.

211
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,791
I am familiar with it.

212
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,708
It says that if
hardline dragonkind

213
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,208
encroach on us
past the buffer zone,

214
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,291
then we can eliminate them.

215
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,625
Ah, that's right.

216
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,875
The black dragon that was
defeated not long ago...

217
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,666
You two did that, didn't you?

218
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,708
Yes. The Accord does
have its shortcomings,

219
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,375
but we do need it.

220
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,166
Right now, it's
shielding humanity

221
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,375
from an all-out war
with the dragons.

222

[GAYUS]
Well...

Look at it this way.

225
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,708
If you're one of the people

to dragon attacks,

this whole thing probably seems
like too little, too late.

Yes, perhaps.

you can change the world

I thought joining the military

was the right thing to do.

297

But no.

I'm different now.

won't bring her back.

brought this up.

search of their pound of flesh.

outside their homeland

far, but I've sent a signal.

Yes.

Have you forgotten all
the sacred Draken teachings?

I take my eyes off you.

Now, it's time to go.

[chukles] Hey, Gigina.
Long time no see.

00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,791
When did you get in here?

338
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,000
Have a good evening, then.

339
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,625
Barkeep.

340
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,333
Since I'm a connoisseur,

341
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,250
I must compliment
your choice of furniture.

342
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,625
I couldn't help but notice
the gentle demeanor

343
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,000

of the chairs.

00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,958
You should be
very proud of them.

345
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,208
[BARTENDER 2A]
Uh, thank you.

346
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,625
You should try not to
overwork them.

347
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:22,208
Give each one a nice break,
so she has some time to herself.

348
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,875
Let her see the
mountains and beaches.

Y-Yes, sir.

[GAYUS]
You suck, Gigina!

351
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,333
Why are you such a hardass?

352
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,791
And stop spending more
money than we bring in,

353
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,458
or we're gonna
go broke in a month!

354
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,041
I can't keep carrying you
like this forever!

355
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,916
My whole life would be
so much simpler

356
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,375
if you hadn't picked me up.

357
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,833
I bet that's never once
occurred to you, has it?

358
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,416
[hiccups]

359
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,625
I'd be working a
cushy job at the academy

360
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,541
as an assistant or researcher,

361
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,500
and have a cute
wife and kids.

362
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,875
Correct me if I'm wrong,

363
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,458
but the academic option
was already closed to you

364
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,458
before you even met me.

365
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,375
Also, you shouldn't
have a family.

366
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,666
You'd be a terrible father.

367
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,291
Wha...?

00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,541
Eh, I 'unno.

Regardless.

[GAYUS]
Huh?

371
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,208
We're stuck with each other.

372
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,791
We did inherit Diorg's
will and office together.

373
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,916
I'd say this is
as good a time as any

374
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,875
to air your grievances with me.

375
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,291
Hold on.

376
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:22,000
You bought expensive furniture
again, didn't you?

377

That book I borrowed
from the library,

378

called <i>One Hundred Ways</i>
<i>to Train an Animal</i> ...

379
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,458
It says that with
particularly stupid creatures,

380
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,541
it's good practice to
talk to them occasionally.

Believe it or not, I'm doing
this to aid your mental health.

Did I mention I hate you?

And I hate you just
as much if not more,

Could you two be the monsters
who murdered my beloved?
