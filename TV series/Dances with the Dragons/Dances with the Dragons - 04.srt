1
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,250
[DOCTOR 4A] You gave us
quite a scare, Mr. Soleil.

2
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,333
Your heart stopped for a
moment and we were worried

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,500
because we couldn't
detect your brain waves.

4
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,416
--[groans]
--I'm sorry, sir.

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,250
I'll try it again, okay?

6
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,916
Let me guess, you're
new here aren't you?

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,791
Yes, I am. My name's Nojé.

8
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,083
You were in a deep coma

9
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,125
and the staff and I were
prepared for the worst,

10
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,833
but you look
perfectly healthy now.

11
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,291
I must say, it's an
absolute miracle.

12
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,000
Miracle. Huh.

13
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,750
Kinda like the miracle of love.

14
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,958
[NOJÉ]
Hm?

15
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,250
Anyway, it seems
like you've recovered,

16
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,791
so I'm discharging
you, Mr. Soleil.

17
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,166
I guess my vacation's over.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,291
[GAYUS] It's almost like
that black claw swooped in

19
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,416
and pulled me back
from the dead.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,208
[NOJÉ]
Mr. Soleil, did I hear correctly

21
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,166
that you're an
Offensive Jushikiist?

22
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,500
I am. Why?

23
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,500
Well, sir, I may need
your help with something.

24
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,708
[GAYUS] Great, I can
always use some work.

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,166
You'll have to
give me your number.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,666
I give a discount
for pretty girls.

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,916
[NOJÉ giggles]

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,250
Uh?

29
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,208
We've received reports
that Elder Orkentius

30
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,791
has been called upon
to give testimony

31
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,833
regarding a botched
assassination attempt

32
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,083
on Cardinal Mouldeen

33
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,125
and Seven-City Alliance
Representative Azu Bita.

34
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,250
Orkentius is
challenging investigators

35
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,583
to provide evidence
of his involvement.

36
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,833
Next, new developments
concerning the Tienlun Accord.

37
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,083
Senator Yah Wen of
the Seven-City Alliance

38
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,416
has begun negotiations
with the Vaisen

39
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
to open dialogue
with the dragons.

40
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,291
How about that.

41
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,583
Apparently the moderates
are calling the shots now.

42
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,875
[MOULDEEN] Would that
it was as easy as that.

43
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,125
[GAYUS]
Hm?

44
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,541
Cardinal Mouldeen, it's you.

45
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,541
[HELODEL]
Gayus! I'm so glad you're--

46
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,750
[HELODEL groans]

47
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,166
Ow... That hurt.

48
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,416
If it wasn't for you,

49
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,791
I wouldn't be caught up
in all this nonsense.

50
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,666
You owe me one, buddy.

51
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,583
You seem better.

52
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,791
Now, Helodel.

53
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,458
I'm going to have a
word with Gayus alone.

54
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,375
Please bring the car
around to the parking lot

55
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,416
if you don't mind.

56
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,708
Sir!

57
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,333
[GAYUS]
What an honor.

58
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,958
To think I'm meeting
Cardinal Mouldeen...

59
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,791
...from the proud
royal dragon family.

60
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,125
That's an unusual
choice of greeting.

61
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,875
I don't think so. This is the
first time I've spoken to you.

62
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,791
The Mouldeen I escorted around
was Genon Kal Darius,

63
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,250
one of the
Twelve Winged Generals

64
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,625
and infamous master of disguise.

65
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,958
Correct.

66
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:38,458
Tell me, when did you
realize that was the case?

67
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,791
I wasn't a hundred percent sure,

68
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,333
but the moment
I became suspicious...

69
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,583
...was when the other you
mentioned liking Urk cuisine.

70
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,250
You and Genon are
right-handed, aren't you?

71
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,833
Typically, when a
right-handed person

72
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,125
recalls a familiar location,

73
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,541
their eyes go to the upper left.

74
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,333
And when the memory
is something auditory,

75
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,583
it is said that the eyes
will move to the bottom left.

76
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,125
When you, or the copy of you,
brought up Urk food,

77
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,541
he looked down and to the left.

78
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,958
If I had to guess,
I'd say he was remembering

79
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,583
what someone had
told him to say.

80
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:17,250
I see. So how do you know that
this Mouldeen is the real one?

81
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,708
Because, back at the church,

82
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,083
Genon promised me he
would tell me the truth.

83
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,666
[MOULDEEN] Yes, but what
good is the word of someone

84
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,250
who aims to deceive by
masquerading as another person?

85
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,875
I haven't gotten to the
main point of my argument.

86
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,416
Look, Your Eminence.

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,250
I know you attempted to get
yourself assassinated, but why?

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,416
[MOULDEEN]
Aren't you insightful.

89
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,583
I'm just saying, you're
cautious enough to have

90
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,333
seven body doubles,
and your attackers

91
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,125
still knew where to find you.

92
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,791
Someone has to be a traitor.

93
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,166
My theory is you purposefully
leaked that info yourself

94
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,875
and it led them to that
well-guarded meeting.

95
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,666
--[engine starts]
--[MOULDEEN] What a shame.

96
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,500
You were close,
but not quite right.

97
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,500
Helodel is the real traitor.

98
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,333
[gasps]

99
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,833
[MOULDEEN]
The basket of flowers and fruit

100
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,250
that Helodel brought for you

101
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,833
must have exploded
in the car just now.

102
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,083
No way. Helodel did it?

103
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,083
He's the traitor
and now... he's dead?

104
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:25,166
The truth always turns out
to be so mundane, doesn't it?

105
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,625
[GAYUS gasps]

106
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,333
As a general rule I try
to avoid consuming fruit

107
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,375
that contains high-performance
explosives, don't you?

108
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,291
Tell me why!

109
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,291
Why would he betray you?

110
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,666
And then turn against me
at the same time?

111
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,708
[gasps]

112
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,041
[MOULDEEN]
It's simple, really.

113
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,875
Helodel could never
come to terms

114
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,041
with the death of his fiancée.

115
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,583
By the time he
joined the military,

116
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:51,166
he had already become a
loyal lapdog to the hardliners.

117
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,791
[GAYUS] Maybe, but you
didn't have to kill him!

118
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,708
You could have just
brought him to justice!

119
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,875
[MOULDEEN] You mustn't become
detached from reality, Gayus.

120
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,791
Don't forget,
I just saved your life.

121
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:07,166
Besides, Helodel isn't the
only one who was manipulated.

122
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,416
[GAYUS]
Wait a minute.

123
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,458
You called in the
assassins too, didn't you?

124
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,791
Precisely.

125
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,916
Every single one of those
ninjas is my servant.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,125
I ordered their leader,
Curacao Opte Kouga

127
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,666
of the Twelve Winged Generals,

128
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,333
to pretend to be one of the
hardliners and mount an assault.

129
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:27,000
Every move of that assassination
attempt from start to finish

130
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,708
was pre-planned to
result in a safe failure.

131
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,125
[GAYUS gasps]

132
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,541
[MOULDEEN] However,
the meeting itself was real,

133
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,458
and responsibility for the
fallen ninjas and guards

134
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,791
is all mine.

135
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,500
Though the ultimate purpose
was to save lives,

136
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,750
I recognize that it was
an unforgivable act.

137
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,958
This is war.

138
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,875
The war before the war.

139
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,250
Or rather, the war
to prevent the war.

140
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,125
As long as I live, I'll never
run from such a fight.

141
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,166
It's the war to prevent a war.

142
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,625
So that meeting must've
been about Alsok...

143
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,916
...and the Ninth
Holy Land War, right?

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,458
[MOULDEEN] Yes, it's a feud
between the Dragon Empire

145
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,625
and the Seven-City Alliance.

146
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll ask the Alliance's
occupational forces

147
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,750
to retreat to the
Daef Front in Alsok.

148
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,208
Why would you do
something like that?

149
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,250
It's only gonna help
the Dragon Empire!

150
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,000
How do you gain from this?

151
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,833
Why did you bother
toying with us like that?

152
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,750
If you must know,
our primary directive

153
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,750
was to ensure that
the traitor Helodel

154
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,416
believed his nasty little scheme

155
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,250
would play out
according to plan.

156
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,000
Secondly, we wanted to make
the incident more believable

157
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,916
by involving outsiders.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,208
Third, we knew that you
would be neither foolish

159
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,666
nor heroic enough to
stand up to the Empire.

160
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,416
Lastly, you'll see what
price the Dragon Empire

161
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,750
will be paying to
the Alliance for this,

162
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,000
but you'll have to be patient.

163
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,541
Wait, you mean you're...?

164
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,583
I like to think I have not
only our land, but all things,

165
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,625
even this entire planet,
in my sights.

166
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,041
[GAYUS] I still believe
that you're a hero and all.

167
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,666
But, now...

168
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,250
It's interesting, Gayus. In
many ways you and I think alike,

169
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,666
while in others
we differ completely.

170
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,625
I am somewhat
fond of you, though.

171
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,666
Perhaps that fondness
is what inspired me

172
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,250
to choose you as an observer
for my little project.

173
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,125
I'm eager to try your
home cooking, Curacao.

174
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,500
Have you got it all prepared?

175
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,375
[CURACAO]
I believe we're all set, sir.

176
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,666
You'll be happy to know
I've brought the full barrel.

177
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,458
[CURACAO gasps]

178
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,458
That idiot had a bad feeling
about you from the beginning

179
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,291
and still turned a
blind eye to your scheme.

180
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,833
I guess he's even more
dense than he looks.

181
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,291
He just wanted to believe
the lie your decoy told him--

182
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,458
that you strive to protect
the smiles of children

183
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,500
as they play and eat candy.

184
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,750
He has my eternal gratitude.

185
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,541
[GIGINA] We don't accept
gratitude as payment.

186
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,666
There's a part of me that
believes you're a threat.

187
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,500
That's why I'll take
half your head!

188
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,541
[GIGINA] A high-order
Jushiki-proof barrier?

189
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,291
How strange.
Though I'm protected

190
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,875
by Jushiki master
Jokanne's handiwork,

191
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,125
I'm still quite terrified.

192
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,916
Two people now
think me dangerous.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,708
However, you were the only one

194
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,708
who actually decided
to do something about it.

195
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,916
It's easy to deceive people
who spend their time thinking,

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,833
but difficult to trick someone
who acts on instinct.

197
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,291
You're just like Gayus.

198
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,083
Both of you place
your lives on a scale

199
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,250
to test your effectiveness.

200
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,416
Now go to hell and take
your word games with you.

201
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,916
Well, now.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,583
I think it's about time for our
rambunctious cohorts to arrive.

203
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,875
[BELDRITT yawns]
That sure took forever,

204
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,500
didn't it, Bro?

205
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,791
I'm gonna go on ahead.
Catch you later!

206
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,833
[laughs]

207
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,416
It's so rude just to
take off like that.

208
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,833
Oh, Gayus. I was so frightened.

209
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,250
I know.

210
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm so sick of you almost
getting yourself killed...

211
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,666
...and the hospital trips.

212
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,666
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,208
I'm not... just some
scared little girl.

214
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,375
I had all these plans
to put on a brave face

215
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,083
and welcome you home like a
real woman would, but then...

216
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,875
[sighs]

217
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,291
From now on, when you're
setting off for battle,

218
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:58,208
you have to warn me
gently before you go.

219
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,541
Because that way,

220
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,208
when someone comes back
to me holding your body,

221
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,541
at least it could possibly
spare me half of the tears.

222
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,833
Can you do that? Promise me.

223
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,500
[JIV]
Gah, I'm already embarrassed

224
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,458
for saying something like that!

225
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,791
Uh, Gayus!

226
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,833
I want you to drink
till you forget what I said!

227
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,958
[chuckles] Fine by me.

228
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,750
Several things have changed in
Eridana while you slept, Gayus.

229
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,583
[GAYUS]
Yeah.

230
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,750
I got the gist of it.

231
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,958
[GAYUS]
Hm? What's this?

232
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,916
"Still No Agreement"?

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,333
"Dragons failed to
attend Tienlun Accord

234
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,625
negotiation meeting
set by Alliance.

235
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,541
Senator Yah Wen,
who proposed the summit,

236
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,333
is sure to suffer
a considerable hit

237
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,375
to his reputation
after this failure."

238
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,041
Huh. Wait a sec.

239
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,458
Senator Yah Wen is

240
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,041
Representative Azu Bita's
political opponent, right?

241
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,208
[GIGINA] It's possible
Cardinal Mouldeen interceded

242
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,541
on behalf of the dragons.

243
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,083
[gasps]

244
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,916
[MOULDEEN] Lastly, you'll see
what price the Dragon Empire

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,166
will be paying to
the Alliance for this,

246
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,791
but you will have to be patient.

247
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,333
[GAYUS]
That's crazy.

248
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,041
The Dragon Empire's
got no bargaining chips.

249
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,166
Have you gotten any word
from Rolca or Vinnel recently?

250
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,250
[GIGINA] Who knows.
I turned off communications.

251
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,125
Damn, Gigina. How you manage
to survive in modern society

252
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,125
is a mystery to me.

253
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,666
Anyway, we got some
solid info from Vinnel.

254
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,666
There's no gravity
Jushikiist in existence

255
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,083
by the name of Nidvork.

256
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,250
So, then, who was that woman
we fought with that night?

257
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,666
[GAYUS]
No clue.

258
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,875
Hello?

259
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,708
[ROLCA] Glad to hear
you pulled through, kid!

260
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,333
Well, are you glad
enough to let me slide

261
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,625
on this month's payment?

262
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,708
[ROLCA] Yeah, sorry,
you're breakin' up. What?

263
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,125
[sighs]

264
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,833
So, you find anything out
about that strange cloth?

265
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,500
[ROLCA]
Yeah.

266
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,916
It's biological tissue
that's been modified

267
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,583
by gravity Jushiki.

268
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,125
Sending you the analysis.

269
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,833
It's tissue?

270
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,375
[ROLCA]
What do you two think? What's...

271
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,000
Thanks, Rolca. See ya.

272
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,083
[ROLCA]
Wait, Gayus!

273
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,541
[GAYUS sighs]

274
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,041
[GAYUS] Jushikiist
Supreme Advisory Court?

275
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,625
Hm.

276
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,375
They say they wanna make me a
13th-grade Jushikiist like you.

277
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,375
[panting]

278
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:49,125
Gayus. Do you think
we'll see her here?

279
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,666
Yeah.

280
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,375
[GIGINA] We could ask other
Offensive Jushikiists for help.

281
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,000
There's always
the mighty Largonkin,

282
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,916
or the terrible
scarlet Panhaima,

283
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,708
or the hermit wizard, Imhotep.

284
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,625
Any would be a wise option.

285
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,375
Why would we work with them?

286
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,750
Most likely they'd just
end up killing us instead!

287
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,833
[GIGINA]
Why don't we find Cuello?

288
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,291
[GAYUS] We don't have
the money to hire anyone.

289
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,666
And we're not on
good enough terms

290
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,583
to go asking people for favors.

291
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,791
[GIGINA] We'll have to
fend for ourselves...

292
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,291
...which is pretty much
how it's always been.

293
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,125
[GAYUS]
Well, at least I came prepared.

294
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,208
The most immediate concern

295
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,750
is that it's going
to take too long.

296
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,875
Plus there's the focusing ratio.

297
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:27,958
[GAYUS]
Yeah.

298
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,750
Our best bet is
to draw her out here

299
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,000
and then use Jushiki
to trap her.

300
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,416
[GIGINA]
Same one again?

301
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,333
[GAYUS]
Well, it's better than nothing.

302
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,750
[phone rings]

303
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,166
[NOJÉ]
Please, help me!

304
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,458
[gasps]

305
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,041
Woman. What's this all about?

306
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,375
I apologize.

307
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,708
You see, I saw some
hospital malpractice.

308
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,041
I informed the president, but
he made me keep quiet about it.

309
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,291
And now you've got bad people
chasing you, right?

310
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,541
[NOJÉ]
Mm-hm.

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,583
[NOJÉ] I'll take you two to
where I'm hiding the evidence.

312
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,166
Quick question, Genon.

313
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,750
[gasps]

314
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,041
What, did you think I didn't
know this was all a trap?

315
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,250
[GENON]
What gave it away?

316
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,708
[GAYUS] Your disguise and
your acting are perfect, but...

317
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,083
...as much as I
hate to admit it,

318
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,250
a beautiful nurse
taking a liking to me

319
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,166
and pleading for my help?

320
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,833
Come on now. That isn't
believable in the least.

321
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,958
Besides--

322
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,166
[BELDRITT]
You know Gayus actually has

323
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,166
a pretty good point, Genon.

324
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,000
And "Nojé" sounds
like a faké name.

325
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,041
Pick something more
realistic next time!

326
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,750
[JESPER]
Your job is complete.

327
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,333
We'll finish things up here.

328
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,250
You mind introducing yourselves?

329
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,083
We work for that old guy.
You can call us--

330
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,708
Shut it. We work
for Cardinal Mouldeen.

331
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,208
[groans] That hurt!
You're being so mean!

332
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,666
I'm Beldritt Livet Raki.
Clearly I'm the lovable one!

333
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,916
And my grumpy big bro
is Jesper Livet Raki.

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,291
Well, actually,
we're fraternal twins.

335
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,791
I know them!

336
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,291
I hear they're 14th-grade.

337
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,541
There's no way you're brothers.

338
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,166
I thought you were his son.

339
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,041
Does that matter?

340
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:14,208
Hey, if you knew this was a
setup, why'd you come here?

341
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,666
[GAYUS] Better than getting
attacked in my sleep.

342
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,625
'Kay, I'm gonna
come kill ya then.

343
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,500
Put up a good fight for me!

344
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,541
[gasps]

345
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,750
[roars]

346
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,291
I want you to meet my
good friend and servant.

347
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,333
Picked this one
just for you. Heh.

348
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,208
[BELDRITT laughs]

349
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,083
[BELDRITT] So I'm sure
you'll have tons of fun!

350
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,083
[GIGINA grunts]

351
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,958
A sword, huh?

352
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:07,000
[GIGINA grunting]

353
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,750
You're quite rude.

354
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,333
I'm returning the disrespect
you showed His Eminence.

355
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,125
You wield your blade
with Jushiki.

356
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,000
[JESPER]
And you're about to die by it.

357
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,875
[GIGINA]
Hmm.

358
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,041
Take care of him for me.

359
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,833
[panting]

360
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,083
[GENON]
There you are.

361
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,125
[GAYUS]
Huh?

362
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:39,958
[GAYUS grunts]

363
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,750
[GAYUS gasps]

364
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,875
[GENON] Now, look closely
and see through my disguise!

365
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,291
[BOTH grunt]

366
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,833
What an excellent battle.

367
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,708
You'd better have faith
in that weapon.

368
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,708
Like my partner,
you appear to be the type

369
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,291
who relies on reason.

370
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,833
I have no use for such things
when it comes to combat.

371
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,750
Either way, it'll take more than
that brittle sword to defeat us.

372
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,458
Now embrace your death,

373
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,083
but not before you witness
the unspeakable devastation

374
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,333
of the Nine-Headed
Dragon Fang Blade!

375
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,083
[GIGINA chuckles]

376
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,750
[yells]

377
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:29,750
[GIGINA grunting]

378
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,875
[GIGINA]
Hmm...

379
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,875
[GIGINA grunting]

380
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:49,958
[JESPER groans]

381
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,458
[GIGINA]
Heh.

382
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,750
[GENON chuckles]

383
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,708
Let's do this!

384
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,750
[GENON gasps]

385
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,250
[roars]

386
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,625
[sighs]

387
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,875
Hey, that was pretty smart.
You guessed my next move!

388
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,375
Well, I'm going to go
meet up with my brother.

389
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,666
[GAYUS sighs]

390
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,791
Either they want to separate
me and Gigina, or else...

391
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,916
[MOULDEEN] So, what exactly
caused Genon's undoing, Curacao?

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,791
[CURACAO] He most likely fell to
a sixth-order chemical alchemy

393
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,291
by the name of Astarte.

394
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,250
Simply put, it's a deadly
Jushiki that emits an odorless,

395
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,750
tasteless poison gas
over a limited range.

396
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,583
It's prohibited
around the world.

397
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,083
[MOULDEEN]
I didn't expect Soleil to have

398
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,833
such a trick up his sleeve.

399
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,500
I see Jesper's also having
some trouble with Gigina.

400
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,000
[panting]

401
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,666
You charged the blades of
the Dragon Fang head-on.

402
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,125
You're mad!

403
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,875
I noticed that your Jushiki
doesn't increase in mass.

404
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,583
All it does is
manipulate metals.

405
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,833
Each of your nine blades only
does a ninth of the damage.

406
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,375
So, unless one hits a
vital spot, it can't kill me.

407
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,333
[BELDRITT]
I'm back! Miss me?

408
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,166
[gasps] Oh, no! You're hurt!

409
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,750
I'll be fine.

410
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,125
[sighs]

411
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:42,041
Hey! You should probably
take a break, Genon.

412
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,541
[GENON] No! It'll take
more than that to best me.

413
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,291
Much more!

414
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,291
His Eminence Cardinal Mouldeen
specifically instructed us

415
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,333
to take our time and
not end this quickly.

416
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,041
What do you say
to two Dragon Fangs?

417
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,875
Oh?

418
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,416
I like that even better.

419
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,958
Perhaps now it'll
actually be a challenge.

420
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,500
Hey!

421
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,500
Where have you been, Gigina?
I thought you died!

422
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,041
Course not.

423
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,041
Your ugliness may be enough
to kill most people on the spot,

424
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,000
but I'm pretty tough.

425
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,125
Time for round two.

426
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,875
[MOULDEEN]
What an exciting spectacle.

427
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,333
And now, the final actor
is waiting in the wings

428
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,625
to make a dramatic entrance.

429
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,666
The moment of rebirth
is drawing near.

430
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,333
When I posted those
flyers all over town,

431
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:39,750
I was certain the audience would
be ready to watch it unfold.

432
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,708
At last our
glorious stage is set.

433
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,375
The thrilling climax
is about to begin,

434
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:49,666
leading up to the
long-awaited grand finale.

435
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,750
[GAYUS] Humanity never
learns to love wisdom.

436
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,833
We've always been prone
to choose foolishness.

437
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:34,875
[GAYUS] And the truth is, we're
predestined to behave that way.
