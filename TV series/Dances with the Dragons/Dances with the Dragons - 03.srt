ran away from home,

Earlier today on Wella Street
near the middle of Eridana City,

00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:31,083
this man, a Jushiki engineer
named Lolorf Iscafendler.

was attacked with
offensive Jushiki.

Gimme all you got on
somebody named Nidvork.

Green eyes and dark hair.

93
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,041
Either Alurian or from
the eastern Seg region.

94
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,083
From what I can tell,
she's a gravity Jushikiist

95
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,666
working at the Enlightened
level, or possibly even higher.

96
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,708
Oh, and she kept going
on about her husband.

97
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,166
I think she said his
name was Eninguluud.

98
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,458
[VINNEL] That's more
than enough to find her.

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,791
[VINNEL]
Hmm, nothing.

100
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,833
Yeah, I didn't find a thing
when I looked her up.

their personal information

the government's data stores.

should handle that?

There's info about
why the other side

is in favor of the accord, too.

how both parties must feel.

with the dragons.

But, anyway,

139
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,500
I told you about the
Jushikiist murders, right?

Have you heard

Not a thing.

160
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,708
After today,
no more bodyguard duty.

[elevator dings]

162
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry for the early start.

163
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,625
Actually, I seem
to be a bit late.

164
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,083
To think His Eminence
Cardinal Mouldeen of all people

165
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,416
is 30 minutes late
to an appointment.

166
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,958
Forgive me, sir, but
have you never heard of

167
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,083
the ancient piece of
Draken wisdom that tells us,

168
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,583
"No one can swing their blade
without their head"?

169
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,541
Obviously I'm stealing
Gigina's line here,

170
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,250
but my impression of him is
pretty spot-on, don't you think?

171
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,291
Well, as much as I'd like to do
my impression of you, Gayus,

172
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,875
I doubt the Cardinal
would appreciate

173
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,125
seeing me make a drunken fool
of myself in the streets.

174
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,458
That's some big talk
there, Draken-boy.

175
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,791
How about we discuss
your diary instead?

176
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,208
I should mention
all your entries

five-year-old wrote them.

178
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,041
How dare you!

179
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,000
You broke into
the office cabinet?

180
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,916
It wasn't hard to unlock
it with that technique

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,291
we learned from our old bounty.

182
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,541
You should probably
be more careful

183
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,750
where you hide your stuff.

184
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,416
Oh, like you?

185
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,333
As I recall, you make it a point
to choose your storage devices

186
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,791

than you'd choose a wife.

[gasps] I know damn well
I didn't say that to you!

188

You didn't have to. I heard
you muttering to yourself

189
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,708
while I was repairing
the inside of the dresser.

190
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,166
"Repairing" it, huh?

191

I hope it comes to
life and eats you!

192

That'd be the greatest

You put on quite a show.

196

Staying here to
watch your antics

197
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,875
might be even more entertaining

198

than all the sightseeing
I had scheduled.

Meleios Ashley-Bufh, eh?

201
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,708
I'm surprised you
remember our names.

202
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,250
We're supposed to
just be temporary help.

203
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,125
Whenever I become
involved with anyone,

204
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,666
the least I can do is remember
names, wouldn't you agree?

205
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,416
Yeah, maybe.

206
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,208
Anyway, what sights would
His Eminence the Cardinal

207
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,041
like to see on his final day
in our beautiful city?

208
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,625
Ah, that's right.

209
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,125
The first engagement for today
is the tea party I've arranged

210
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,916
with another visitor from afar.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,625
If my expectations are correct,

212
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,375
it's sure to be an
interesting event.

213
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,416
You aren't praying.
Do you not believe in God?

214
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,833
That's a difficult question.

215
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
Judging by the state
of the world these days,

216
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,333
it's hard for me to believe
He exists in any physical way.

217
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,041
I assume you don't
need me to tell you

218
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,208
those are blasphemous
words to utter

219
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:24,875
in front of the faith's
guardian... and in church.

220
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,666
Helodel's late fiancée, Shifaka,
she died because of a dispute

221
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,916
between the Dragon Empire
and the Seven-City Alliance.

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,291
If there really are
such things as "gods,"

223
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,041
then why do they
let so many people die

224
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,083
because of things like
accidents, disease, and wars?

225
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,750
And what possible reason
could they have had

226
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,000
to take my
innocent sister Aleciel?

227
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,458
You think it's blasphemous
of me to ask that question?

228
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,166
[MOULDEEN]
Well, perhaps.

229
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,958
Either God does not exist or
He is exceedingly merciless.

230
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,208
Huh?

231
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,625
But how painful would
life be without Him?

232
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,875
The dead cannot return to us.

233
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,250
Miracles aren't real.

234
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,833
Religion exists to give people a
sense of purpose and direction.

235
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,625
That's why the
majority of society

236
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,500
has no choice but
to shut their eyes

237
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,250
and pretend in order
to go on living.

238
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,166
You should be careful not to
search too hard for reasons.

239
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,083
You tend--well, all Jushikiists
tend to be desperate

240
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,250
to find some greater
meaning in all this.

241
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,583
But that's being arrogant.

242

We can never hope to achieve
that level of wisdom.

some of your own.

After all, my boy,
facing questions

that have yet to be
answered is the inspiration

that drives humankind
above all else, is it not?

And of the countless paths we
human beings can take in life,

252
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,375
it is also the most
honorable and rewarding.

That one is easy.

of a chair--

noble and beautiful
in equal measure.

If Gigina and I can
stop them, we will.

316
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,875
If not, we'll at least
buy some time trying.

317
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,250
Compared to you,
we're expendable.

318
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,208
But if you were to die,
a war would break out

319
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:51,083
between the Dragon Empire
and the Seven-City Alliance.

320
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,750
We don't want to see
history repeat itself.

321
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:54,750
[gasps]

322
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,708
[MOULDEEN]
Yes, you may be right.

323
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,208
I applaud your willingness to
give your life for someone else,

324
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,041
and I believe
such acts of courage

325
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,791
should be generously rewarded.

326
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,708
In that case, there's
something that matters to me

327
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,458
a lot more than money or medals.

328
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,500
If I manage to
leave here with my life

329
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,958
then I will consider
no payment too great.

330
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,416
All I want from you
is the truth, sir.

331
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,333
[MOULDEEN] Hmm. As much
as you'd like to hear.

332
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,166
Heads up!

333
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,666
Let us now share in
the banquet of battle!

334
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,791
[GIGINA] Sparks fly as the
blades of two separate lives

335
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,958
meet in combat.

336
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,250
And for a single moment,

337
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,291
the world and I
share the same pulse.

338
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,791
This is your chance
to demonstrate

339
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,375
the extent of your power!

340
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,041
Show me what you can do!

341

I guess that about does it.

[GAYUS groans]

348
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,791
That's quite impressive.

349
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,791
I had no idea there was
an assassin in the world

350
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,083
skilled enough to challenge
a Draken warrior.

351
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,000
Leave your name as you die.

352
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,750
[CURACAO]
No. All I can tell you

353
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,791
is that I'm a ninja who
protects the Kouga clan.

354
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:44,833
[GIGINA grunts]

355
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,000
What's that?

356
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,541
Nothing good.

357
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,291
It's a third-order chemical
alchemy Jushiki called Chilliat.

358
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,625
[GAYUS] It generates
hundreds of millions

359
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,458
of monomolecular needles.

360
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,625
And they can pierce through
almost anything.

361
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,750
[GIGINA]
I noticed that.

I wish I could've died, too.

00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,208
But this is how
it's supposed to be.

[GAYUS gasps]

Please, let me go!

Oh. You're awake.

00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,666
Am I in a hospital bed?

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,083
[JIV]
Um, yes.

387
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,500
You've been admitted to
Eridana Private Hospital.

388
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,916
At least I have a beautiful
nurse watching over me.

My Gayus came back to life!

00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,666
[GAYUS]
Uh... You're hurting me.

392
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,208
You're okay.

393
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,125
Oh, Gayus, I was so afraid.
I thought I'd lost you forever!

[NIDVORK panting]

396
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,041
It would seem even for
someone of my fortitude,

397
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,708
a spell that strong
is difficult to endure.

You don't seem to
fear me in the least.

403
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,875
[NIDVORK] I swear,
darling, these hands of mine

404
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,625
will do everything in
their power to avenge you.

405
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,833
[GAYUS] There are certain
things that are even deadlier

406
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:27,208
than pure, unadulterated malice.

407
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,541
Nothing is more dangerous

408
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:31,083
than benevolence to
the point of foolishness.

409
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:35,250
After all, how can you stop
a disaster caused by goodwill?
