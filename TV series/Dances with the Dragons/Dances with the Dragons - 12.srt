Agh, damn.

I can't believe that bastard
used me as a meat shield.

00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,541
I'm a powerless,
low-level Jushikiist

without a penny to my name.

8
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,375
They used me up
and now they'll let me die.

00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,458
What a pain.

[GAYUS, GIGINA]
This is a load of crap.

11
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,500
[GIGINA] A victory
that's less than triumphant

12
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,750
is an insult to the
proud Draken people.

13
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,291
[DIORG] Yeah. And it's a shame
we lost one of the rearguard.

14
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,416
Man. If only we
could find a good,

capable Jushikiist
lying around somewhere.

16
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,750
Forget it, Chief Diorg.
If they were worth anything,

17
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,750
they'd be snapped up
by another agency.

18
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,708
We should all just die now.

19
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,625
We've lost one man, Stratos.

We can't afford more casualties.

21
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,708
Too bad.

22
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,375
I guess that means I'll have to
come up with another way to die.

Look, Diorg.

24

There's garbage in the road.

Straight ahead.

I thought it was
dead already,

This is a story from back when

were slightly higher.

[GIGINA]
You idiot!

If you keep putting
the front line at risk,

36
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,583
you're a worse threat than him!

Hey!

It's not my fault if you're
too slow to dodge an attack!

Wow, thanks.

You're standing in the way
of a Draken sword.

47
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,500
You must not
value your life much.

48
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,083
I do value my life.

49
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,291
I just have a policy

50
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,958
not to allow unnecessary
killing, that's all.

51

So back off!

Are you suggesting it's
pointless to clear the street

of useless pieces of trash?

54
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,208
We both know that's
Chief Diorg's decision.

55
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,666
And since I'm the deputy chief,

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,625
I call the shots
when he's not around.

Well then, you'd better
get compatible, and fast.

You couldn't have done it alone.

You should have waited
for Gigina's help,

or for me to use
my electricity Jushiki.

used was excessively large.

No, I'm pretty fond of most men.

Oh well, at least you
recover quickly.

00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,583
So, do you think you got
the guts for a mission, Gayus?

128
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,916
[CUELLO] Our target today
is Maslow Gossum.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
[GAYUS]
Handsome guy.

130
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,041
Marriage fraud, right?

131
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,541
Actually, he attacked a
jewelry store about a month ago

132
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,125
and murdered two
security Jushikiists.

133
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,250
The losses added up to
a hundred million yen.

134
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,416
Later Maslow was apprehended
by the Largonkin Company's men.

135
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,125
But he escaped while
waiting for trial

136
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,375
and never revealed
the whereabouts

137
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,250
of the stolen jewelry.

138
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,250
So he was out on bail
after killing two people?

139
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,208
Yeah, and in order to come up
with enough to pay that bail,

140
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,708
Maslow had to borrow an
incredibly large amount of money

141
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,333
from a bail bond agent.

142
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,708
But that doesn't
make any sense.

143
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,125
If you run away,

144
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,750
then doesn't the court get
to pocket your bail money?

145
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,250
What's his endgame here?

146
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,000
That's exactly what we're
supposed to figure out.

147
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,916
The bail bondsman
is who hired us.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,875
Wants us to capture him
in time for his trial

149
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,833
before the police do.

150
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,333
And, of course,
we can't kill the guy.

151
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,958
Plus, there's this.

152
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,208
[GAYUS]
Claymore.

153
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,041
He's a chemical
manipulation type.

154
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,625
And a tenth-grade
Jushikiist at that.

155
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,583
Are you scared?

156
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,291
Of course not!

157
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,833
Now, what's the plan?

158
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,583
First, we need to
dig up his past

159
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,041
and try to figure out
where he's hiding.

160
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,041
Till then, we lay low.

161
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,208
[GAYUS] Sure was easy to get
that informant to sell him out.

162
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,750
These are tough times.

163
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,250
Just goes to show you

164
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,250
humans are selfish creatures
and everyone's got a price.

165
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,750
Well, if it hadn't
been for that,

166
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,125
we might've never
found his exact location.

167
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,708
So, I guess I can't complain.

168
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,333
Now all we have
to do is catch him

169
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,291
and bring him back,
dead or alive.

170
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,625
[CUELLO]
I told you, no killing.

171
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,583
Can we skip past the
self-righteous talk, Cuello?

172
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,250
Killing is part of the job.

173
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,583
Sometimes we-- What?

174
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,666
[CUELLO] I'm going to go in
first and neutralize the target.

175
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,333
You're only here to serve as my
backup, are we clear about that?

176
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,041
Yeah, I know.

177
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,208
[knocking]

178
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,541
[CUELLO]
Hello?

179
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,458
It's the power company.

180
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,333
Routine inspection.

181
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,708
Anybody home?

182
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,541
[clattering]

183
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,541
[gasps] He's running!

184
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,500
Say goodbye!

185
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,541
[GAYUS]
Crap!

186
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,583
[gasps]

187
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,375
[CUELLO yells]

188
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,000
[MASLOW grunts, yells]

189
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,916
[MASLOW groans]

190
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,916
[gasps] Get him!

191
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,291
[CUELLO groans]

192
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,708
Almost.

193
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,750
[gasps]

194
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,875
[CUELLO]
Hey!

195
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,166
Gayus!

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
This looks bad. Hang on!

197
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,208
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,333
I am nothing but... trouble...

199
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,666
Let's save the self-deprecating
comments for later!

200
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,041
[GAYUS]
Oh, god. I'm...

201
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,458
[CUELLO]
Try to stay calm!

202
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,625
[GAYUS]
...gonna die.

203
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,500
Hold on!

204
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:54,083
[CUELLO humming]

205
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,208
[gasps] You're awake!

206
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,708
Stop looking!

207
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,833
Uh... sorry!

208
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,583
Uh-- wait, did you
do stuff to me in my sleep?

209
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,875
[CUELLO]
Ugh. You wish I did!

210
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,750
Why did you save me back there?

211
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,666
What?

212
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,875
[GAYUS]
I disobeyed your orders.

213
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,291
If that Maslow guy
had killed me,

214
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,583
it would've been my own fault.

215
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,916
So, there was no reason
for you to put your life at risk

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,958
to protect me.

217
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,583
I'm a sixth-grade.

218
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,208
You're five grades higher.

219
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,791
Your life is worth
more than mine.

220
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,750
[sighs]

221
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,583
Oh, Gayus. Listen.

222
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,958
I don't know what
you've been through,

223
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,416
but that's not how we
view things here.

224
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,208
It's normal to put
your life on the line

225
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,958
to help out a teammate.

226
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,791
That's just the way the Diorg
Jushikiist Agency operates...

227
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,500
...and it's my
own personal code.

228
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,875
You won't get far
in this business

229
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,083
without learning to lean
on people, okay, rookie?

230
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,125
There's no need
to be embarrassed.

231
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,375
It's natural.

232
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,125
I slowed everyone down
when I was new, too.

233
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,916
I used to get cocky
and ruin everything,

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,750
then cry at how useless I was.

235
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,625
Just take it slow.

236
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:34,500
As long as you keep on learning,
then... you'll be fine.

237
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,708
Hey, Cuello.

238
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,875
[CUELLO]
Yes?

239
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,500
Uh... thanks for saying that.

240
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,916
Now then.

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,375
I'm not gonna let you
stay in bed forever.

242
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,208
I had the Chief call
for Gigina to help us.

243
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,625
Once we all meet up,
it's time for a rematch.

244
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,041
I've already set up
a trap for him.

245
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,500
You're pretty strong.

246
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,333
[CUELLO]
No, not really.

247
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,375
It still scares me
that my enemies and I

248
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,208
won't stop until
we kill each other.

249
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,291
But still.

250
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,625
What's stronger than my fear...

251
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,583
...is my hatred for
anyone who hurts others.

252
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,875
That's what drives me.

253
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,291
I want to do
everything in my power

254
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,500
to keep the people I love
safe from danger.

255
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,416
[CUELLO]
And if possible,

256
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,291
I'd like to avoid killing.

257
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,375
I know it sounds like
self-righteous hypocrisy to you,

258
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,125
but...

259
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,291
...even if you laugh
or people mock me,

260
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,375
it will not change my resolve.

261
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,625
I'll still believe.

262
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,083
Oh, Cuello.

263
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,791
The way you're
making me feel is--

264
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,750
[doorbell buzzing]

265
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,416
That must be Gigina.

266
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,208
Come on in.

267
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,333
Well, lookie here.

268
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,458
Didn't think you'd survive.

269
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,958
That's too bad.

270
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,166
[scoffs]

271
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,750
Get outta the way or
die, you damn slowpokes!

272
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,750
Come on!

273
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,708
Put the pedal to the metal!

274
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,791
I'm Cuello,
the queen of the highway!

275
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,083
Hey, Gigina!

276
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,750
Why the hell did you
have to let her drive us?

277
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,041
Easy now, Cuello.

278
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,416
Hold on tight.

279
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,875
Mama's got a serious
need for speed, baby.

280
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,208
Let's race!

281
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,750
[GAYUS] All right, we still
haven't captured Maslow.

282
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,791
So, what's our next move?

283
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,375
[CUELLO]
This part's simple.

284
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,916
He's probably on edge
since our run-in yesterday.

285
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,375
And even if he isn't,

286
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,208
it's hard to sell high-value
gemstones in this nation.

287
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,750
Either way, his best strategy
at this point in time...

288
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,375
...is to leave the country.

289
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,416
But, this Maslow is
a high-profile criminal.

290
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,041
For him to get through
border security,

291
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,875
he would need a fake passport.

292
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,791
Yes, exactly.

293
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,291
Hence the trap I told you about.

294
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,958
If you use the right bait,
your quarry will catch itself

295
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,666
without you having
to do a thing.

296
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,750
I know you're here.

297
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,666
I've got the cash
for the passport.

298
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,666
What kind of moron
doesn't pay the forger

299
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,541
some hush money first?

00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,208
Don't bother resisting.

302
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,083
I think you're outnumbered here.

303
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,541
Think again!

There we go.

326
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,166
Let's get this jerk
tied up, huh.

327
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,541
What now?

328
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,208
[GAYUS] 
Wait, Gigina!

329
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,708
I told you already.

330
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:56,541
No one who values their life
stands against a Draken sword.

331
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,833
I have no choice but to
kill someone who does that.

332
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,083
You're not the only one
with personal rules, Gigina.

333
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,625
I'll say this again.

334
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,208
You're not killing anybody
as long as I'm around!

335
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:12,083
Those are just some
pretty words and nothing more!

336
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,708
If they are, then at least
I've still got my pride,

337
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,875
the same as you have yours!

338
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,250
If you haven't spilled
enough blood, here's mine!

339
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,416
[GIGINA]
Save it.

340
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,875
What would I gain
from taking your blood?

341
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,791
[groans, pants]

342
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,708
[GIGINA]
Cuello, hold out your arm.

343
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,416
[GAYUS]
That's pretty impressive.

344
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,875
Gigina's mastered the art
of healing-type Jushiki.

345
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,250
That's much better.

346
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,875
Thanks a lot.

347
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,375
You're an excellent
warrior, Cuello.

348
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,208
I truly admire your intensity.

349
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,666
Someday, I hope we get the
chance to fight to the death.

350
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,208
[chuckles]

351
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,375
I'm just doing the best
I can, one day at a time.

352
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,791
I refuse to be
a heartless killer.

353
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,250
There's always another way.

354
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,250
[DIORG] All right,
all together now, team!

355
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,625
Let's smile big.

356
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,500
This photo will commemorate
our newest member!

357
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,750
Hey.

358
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,583
Why does the chief look
like he just got beat up?

359
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,416
Thought he was at a meeting.

360
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
It was a meeting.

361
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,333
He said he got injured in of one
of Stratos's suicide bombings.

362
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,875
I almost had me this time.

363
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,125
Can we just take this picture
and get it over with?

364
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,833
[DIORG]
Sorry, Gigina.

365
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,916
Scoot a little to the
left for me, would ya?

366
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,708
Lift your head up, Stratos.
You're not dead yet.

367
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,666
Good!

368
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,083
We're ready!

369
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,541
[gasps]

370
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,083
Come on. Look at
the camera and smile.

371
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,125
Learn how to lean on us, Gayus.

372
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,333
We're your teammates.

373
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,333
And, here we go!

374
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,625
[GIGINA]
You could really use a shelf.

375
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,458
[GAYUS gasps]

376
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,000
Sorry, what did you say?

377
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,416
I said you ought
to have a shelf

378
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,958
to organize all those
dusty old things.

379
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,375
I suppose that I could
build one for you.

380
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,708
Well, if it's gonna
look anything like

381
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,500
that other piece of junk
you made recently...

382
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,625
...no thanks.

383
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,000
What's that?

384
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,083
You dare show disdain
for my beloved son Tarelk?

385
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,541
Yeah!

386
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,458
The trash apple doesn't fall
far from the garbage tree!

387
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,416
[GIGINA] If I'm garbage,
you're toxic waste!

388
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,708
--Huh?!
--[GIGINA] Yeah!

389
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,291
[BOTH groan]

390
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,291
I don't have time for this.

391
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,916
If we keep fighting,
I won't finish.

392
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,791
[scoffs] Maybe you would if
you'd stop getting caught up

393
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,958
in your silly memories.

394
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,583
[GIGINA]
Did you see that Remedius died?

395
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,833
[GAYUS]
Yeah.

396
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,416
Interesting.

397
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,416
[GAYUS]
Following the death of Dochetta,

398
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,583
Urmun descended
into a nasty civil war.

399
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,708
The Dragon Empire
deployed the military

400
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,916
in the name of peace, but...

401
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,625
...I doubt Mouldeen
will do anything else

402
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,708
to try and fix things.

403
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,708
[GAYUS] As long as Urmun is
consumed by political turmoil,

404
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,416
the Dragon Empire's economy
can continue to thrive.

405
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,708
I don't see why he'd
want to upset that.

406
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,666
In the end, most of
the people of Urmun

407
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,708
failed to respond
to the rallying cries

408
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,916
of the Aurora Hammer.

409
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,333
After a few sporadic
revolts and resistances,

410
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,541
the organization disintegrated,

411
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,833
and Remedius eventually
met his death,

412
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,541
still inhabiting
the identity of Zhuo Lu,

413
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,708
the Man-Eating
Dragon of the Sand.

414
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,000
His headless corpse
was found outside the city.

415
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,083
Most people presume
he must have been assassinated.

416
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,250
--[sighs]
--[knocking]

417
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,250
[JIV]
You there, Gayus?

418
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,291
Hurry up!

419
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,583
Jivenya,
where are you taking me?

420
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,500
The seabird shop!

421
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,958
I got all of us an invite
to Largonkin's big

422
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,916
welcome-home-from-
the-hospital party!

423
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,583
Jabeira and Iegie are
supposed to be there, too!

424
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,250
Wait, we're not about to have
a repeat of last time, are we?

425
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,583
Oh, probably.

426
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,291
The two of you never learn
from your past mistakes.

427
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,375
Sorry.

428
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,791
I didn't hear that.

429
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,125
But guess what?

430
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,291
Crab dinner!

431
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,333
Let's go feast on some crab!

432
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,708
[GIGINA]
What the--? Unhand me, woman!

433
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,833
[JIV]
Not happening!

434
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,458
[GAYUS]
The golden age is over.

435
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,166
[GAYUS] The sky that I saw
before has faded away.

436
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,208
But still...

437
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,750
I promise you'll have fun!

438
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,083
You'll never force me to say...

439
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,458
[GAYUS] ...I've got the
woman I love by my side...

440
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,583
...and a partner who
always has my back.

441
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,625
[GAYUS]
Beneath this new sky is a world

442
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,541
that I somehow both
despise and adore.

443
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,250
And that means...

444
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,125
[JIV]
Gayus!

445
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,833
[JIV]
Hurry up or we'll be late!

446
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay.

447
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,250
Be right there.

448
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,458
[GAYUS]
...I have everything I need...

449
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,708
...right?
