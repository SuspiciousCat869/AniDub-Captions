[GIGINA]
The sky looks beautiful.

3
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,541
[GAYUS]
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

4
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,708
What kind of person
can talk about the sky

5
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,708
at a time like this?

6
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,583
Are you afraid?

7
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,833
No way, don't be stupid--

8
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,416
Yup, super afraid.

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Since we're probably gonna die.

10
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,583
[IEGIE] Let me guess, "Draken
warriors don't feel fear."

11
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,000
More accurately, we're not
as disposed to fear death.

12
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,041
But still.

13
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,166
Even if I were to feel afraid,

14
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,333
I would never let it
influence my judgement.

15
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:15,208
If I'm to die, it'll be
due to my own choices.

16
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,708
A decision is a noble thing.

17
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,916
Every move a person makes

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,750
can modify their entire
existence for years to come.

19
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,791
[LARGONKIN]
Agreed.

20
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,250
Just like how the lives of all
1,200 people on Rahzel Island

21
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,000
are hinging on this one battle.

22
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:36,333
We've gathered you all here
to fight the Great Magatsushiki.

23
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,416
You can flee now if you'd like.

You won't be blamed.

25
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,583
We won't run, Chief.
We're Offensive Jushikiists!

26
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,875
Good answer.

27
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,000
Now then!

28
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,916
Let's show those monsters
what we're made of!

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,916
We'll send them back
where they came from--

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,375
into the darkest depths of hell!

this guy off his high horse.

37

Stop with the one-liners
and kill him already!

it looks like the party's over.

[GAYUS]
Well played.

That would be the bishop.

46
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,958

cheating somehow!

[MOULDEEN]
Shame about Remedius.

53
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,333
That boy was truly a genius.

54
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,958
[CURACAO] I didn't realize
you knew each other.

[MOULDEEN]
It was years ago.

56
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,750
I challenged him on
this very chells board,

57
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,583
but he bested me, of course.

58
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,875
You lost?

59
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,833
[MOULDEEN]
Yes. Remedius was one of a kind.

60
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,333
If he hadn't been the one
to inherit Rahzel...

The play has already been made.

You're gonna pay for that!

66
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,541
[JANAHN] So, you finally
solved the riddle

67
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,000
and found your way to us.

68
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,833
But this wouldn't be much of
an ending to the evening party.

69
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,666
The air is much too stale.

70
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,250
Allow me to dust things
off for our guests.

[GAYUS] And wove it
together in an instant!

they can win this fight?

93

Yes or no?

94
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,625
[YAHKTO] Hmm.
The probability of success is--

95
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,208
Eh, forget it.

96
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,208
[BAYLICK] Please don't let
there be any more casualties.

So much for dual-wielding.

100

Now I'm "One-Sword Iegie."

101

Sounds pretty lame, huh?

Stop talking.

103

the bleeding worse.

I'm so pleased we invited you
to our little party!

107
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,541
How does his
swordsmanship stack up?

108
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,791
Let's just say,
if we were in ancient times,

109
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,916
he would be revered
as a god of war.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,541
I think I've got an idea.

111

You in?

112
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,166
I have my doubts about you,

113
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,208
but seeing as how there
aren't many options here,

114
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,458
I'm willing to listen.

I do not like you in the least,

A win's a win, dude.

141
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,500
Wait just a minute.

142
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,041
What did you actually
use to do him in?

143

Wait, no.

145
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,333

146
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,000
block something
like that attack.

Cigars. Now I get it!

148
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,416
[GAYUS]
Yup, bingo.

149
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,750
Some of the chemicals that were
commonly found in tobacco

150
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,166
were used to create a natural
insecticide back in the day.

151

Looks like Janahn Ghalan's
summon mediums

were a human and a spider.

153

A spider's respiratory system

154
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,375
isn't good at
filtering out toxins.

155
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,583
And since he was new to
having a physical body,

156
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,833
he didn't know he shouldn't
inhale the smoke.

157
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,541
Burning the tobacco
was a chemical reaction.

158
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,250
His barrier couldn't
respond to it.

159

Figured I'd take a gamble.

Jeez, man.

161
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,041
Do you think this hard about
every fight you get into?

I told you not
to talk, remember?

164
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,916
You two should stay here
for a little while.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,291
The rest of us can go--

166
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,833
[IEGIE] No! I want to
fight till the bitter end--

You're always a
handful, aren't you?

00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,458
Keep him safe, Jabeira.

170
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,041
You two are gonna
turn my hair gray!

171
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,708
I'm tired. Let them
handle the rest.

[chuckles]

173
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,916
Get ready, Gayus.

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,833
There's another freak upstairs.

175
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,708
We should hurry.

Remedius.

178
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:10,125
If I die, you have to...
eat me, okay?

179
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:14,958
Because that way,
at least you can survive.

180
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,750
Don't be absurd.

Naricia.

182
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,291
We're both going home.

183
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,291
We have to kill Dochetta...

184
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:29,625
[coughing] ...so that
Urmun can be at peace.

Look. Remedius.

186
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,791
I need you to promise me
that you'll save Urmun,

no matter what happens.

Come on, say something!

I know how you must feel,
but... it's no use.

00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,750
They must be dead.

[REMEDIUS laughs]

[REMEDIUS]
I ate her.

She offered her body
to me and I accepted it.

216

[NAVARRO]
Ate her...?

217
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,958
No...

[REMEDIUS]
This... is all that's left.

219
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,291
Oh, god.

220
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,541
You didn't!

221
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,958
With this, I'll have
every bit of her in me.

222
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,416
So thank you, sweet Naricia.

223

[REMEDIUS] The weak Remedius
you once knew is now dead.

Yes. I am the

[REMEDIUS, ZHOU LU]
I've come to avenge you.

[ZHOU LU]
Cower before Zhuo Lu,

the great Man-Eating
Dragon of the Sand.

[ZHUO LU]
Zemunn.

233
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,791
You set up the board
by sacrificing yourself

234
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,500
as the late Viscount Remedius.

235
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,416
This is the final move.

236
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,625
Let us cast Rahzel
into oblivion!

237
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,625
[GAYUS panting]

238

[GAYUS groans]

239
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,041
[GIGINA] I've had enough
of their surprises.

240
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,583
[LARGONKIN]
Heh. At least we're alive.

241
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,333
Salmak consumes your Jushiki
power and turns you to stone,

242
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:20,041
while Otis necrotizes
cells with venom.

243
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,208
So, I'm guessing that
Amupura's medium was a snake.

244
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,125
It was also using that
ability to teleport itself.

245
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,250
But still. Judging
by that explosion,

246
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,208
I'm guessing we're
rid of him for good now.

247
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,916
[AMUPURA]
Nope, guess again!

248

[GIGINA coughs]

252

Oh, but wait, that's not all!

253
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,083
This model has 46 percent more
Amupura than the leading brand!

254
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,250
[LARGONKIN]
How did he regenerate

255
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,416
without me even noticing?

256
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,958
I can't figure this scumbag out.

257
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,000
[GAYUS]
Wait, hold on!

258
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,041
I think I understand it now!

259
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,666
All he's doing is
using Goarp continuously!

260
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,625
He's turning his body
into information

261
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,500
and converting that
to subatomic particles.

262
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,458
Then he transfers that as
waves and rebuilds himself

263
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,333
as soon as he reaches
his destination!

264
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,333
And even though the before
and after may look similar,

265
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,291
they are entirely different.

266
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,833
He switches his body out

267
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,458
--[clapping]
--each time.

268
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,291
[AMUPURA]
Correcto!

269
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,125
Now let's get on to the last
of this evening's events.

270
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,583
Oh, by the way.

271
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:42,125
The twin Jushiki warheads
are still here with us now.

272
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,333
[GAYUS]
Tell me, Gigina.

273
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,625
What's the Draken secret
for beating this guy?

274
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,000
You take a four-eyed redhead,

275
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,083
let him get eaten, and kill
the thing from the inside.

276
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,000
As the one four-eyed redhead
in the room, I vote no.

277
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,750
[GIGINA]
Then how do we win?

278
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,166
You know, there are plenty of
other important things in life.

279
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,000
I think it's time for society to
end this obsession with victory.

280
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,166
Well, that won't make
much difference to us

281
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,625
if we die right now.

282
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,875
Yeah, guess not.

283
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,875
[GAYUS coughs]

284
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,333
[GAYUS] If only we could
blow this place up

285
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,625
along with that damn warhead.

286
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,833
[GAYUS]
Hm?

287
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,375
Ah, look who we have here.

288
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,750
If it isn't the
Baron Janahn Ghalan!

289
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,333
[JANAHN]
I'm afraid it's... over for me.

290
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,791
You mean you don't have
enough Jushiki power left

291
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,625
to regenerate yourself?

292
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,916
My, my, isn't that humiliating?

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,416
[JANAHN] According to the
rules of the evening party,

294
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,541
I suppose it's only right
for you to eat me now.

295
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,333
If I must.

296
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,666
[GAYUS]
You ate your own comrade!

297
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,541
[AMUPURA]
Yes. To our species,

298
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,083
the protection
of our information

299
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:57,666
takes priority over the survival
of individual entities.

300
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,416
Speaking of which,

301
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,708
I must express my
admiration for Remedius.

302
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,708
By ingesting the little
ingénue he so adored,

303
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,375
his body was imbued
with her heroic spirit.

304
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,458
Anyway, the party's been fun,
but it's getting late.

305
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,041
It's the moment
you've been waiting for.

306
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:23,041
Now that the Baron and I
are one, the warheads can fire.

307
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,916
[ALL gasp]

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,875
[AMUPURA] Observe as the
gods of death take flight

309
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:36,916
and their catastrophic fury
is unleashed upon Rahzel Island!

310
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,666
[LARGONKIN]
Not today!

311
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,375
[LARGONKIN groans]

312
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,458
Eridana is my home!

313
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:50,583
I'm not letting
a single person die today!

314
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,125
[groans]

315
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:56,625
Your determination's inspiring,
but I'm as hellbent as you.

316
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,083
[LARGONKIN groans]

317
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,750
Gayus, do it now!

318
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,875
Right!

319
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,791
--No, Largonkin!
--[GIGINA] Largonkin!

320
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,458
[GAYUS] Looks like your evening
party's just been crashed!

321
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,000
[AMUPURA chuckles]

322
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,583
Do you honestly think Remedius

323
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,833
didn't plan for
things like this?

324
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,833
[AMUPURA groans]

325
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,208
--Hey!
--Got it!

326
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,541
[GIGINA]
I can't keep this up for long.

327
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,916
Can you stop that thing?

328
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,125
Here goes nothing--

329
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,166
[GAYUS groans]

330
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,458
I just told you.

331
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,083
I'm not playing around here.

332
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,708
[screaming]

333
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:02,375
My goodness. What a delicate
little lady-scream you have.

334
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,458
Farewell!

335
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,333
[GIGINA]
Gayus, are you all right?

336
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,583
Great. Think that kick
woke me right up!

337
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,125
[AMUPURA] The evening party
is now complete!

338
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,625
I fulfilled my agreement
with the Viscount Remedius!

339
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,833
At last, my family
can enter this world!

340
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,208
So he did this to
summon his kind here?

341
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,750
Nice try!

342
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,708
But now that I know how his
teleportation trick works,

343
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,916
it's not like
the guy's unstoppable.

344
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,791
This'll be easy!

345
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,500
Sorry, Amupura,

346
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,083
but you're just another
piece on the chells board

347
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,291
and this is checkmate!

348
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,791
[AMUPURA screams]

349
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,833
[AMUPURA growling]

350
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,083
[AMUPURA]
You insolent fools!

351
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,708
[AMUPURA]
How dare you do such a thing

352
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,125
to the all-powerful ruler
of the Magatsushiki!

353
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,958
I mustn't allow myself
to be defeated yet!

354
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,875
The Eye of the Cosmos!

355
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:28,958
[AMUPURA screams]

356
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,875
It's over.

357
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,541
Uh-huh.

358
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,958
[sighs]

359
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,458
--[bang]
--[gasps]

360
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,666
[GAYUS]
What?

361
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,083
[GIGINA]
So Remedius even managed

362
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,750
to trick the Great Magatsushiki!

363
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,458
[GIGINA]
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,166
Oh, Jiv.

365
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,625
[BOTH groan]

366
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,416
[GIGINA]
Wait a minute.

367
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,458
Does this mean Largonkin
deployed Jushikiists over there?

368
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,291
[GIGINA]
Oh, I take back what I said.

369
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,333
Huh?

370
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,416
Don't remember, I guess.

371
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,708
Well, anyway...
my Jushiki is out.

372
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:43,416
[GAYUS] Would've been nice
if you'd mentioned that sooner!

373
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,125
[CROWD chattering]

374
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,708
[GAYUS groans]

375
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,500
[GIGINA]
Oh, good, you're still alive.

376
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,791
Yeah, and from the looks of it,

377
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,333
I don't think I've died
and gone to heaven.

378
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,041
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here with me.

379
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,333
Unless you're my
eternal punishment.

380
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,125
Since I know how much
it'll hurt you to hear this,

381
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,708
today happens to be the luckiest
day of your life, Gayus.

382
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,458
It's all downhill
from here, huh?

383
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,041
[JIV]
Huh? Gayus?

384
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,625
Gayus?

385
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,041
[gasps]

386
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,333
Hey, Jiv.

387
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,083
I wanted to apologize
about last night--

388
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,083
[JIV]
No!

389
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,625
I don't care.

390
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,666
Forget that, okay?

391
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,083
But I... acted like such a jerk.

392
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,750
[exhales] Hey.

393
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,375
Welcome back. I missed you.

394
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,916
How about that?

395
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,708
I finally got to
say it that time.

396
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,083
I'm home now...

397
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,458
...Jiv.

398
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,375
[GAYUS]
The mind is a powerful weapon.

399
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:26,916
It can easily turn hell into
heaven and heaven into hell.

400
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,333
Because of that, there's
no way to know for certain

401
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,208
whether the world I see
and the world you see

402
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,583
are one and the same.

403
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:35,083
But that's exactly
the way it should be.
