Here we are.

00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,541
How'd she trick you
into showing up, Gigina?

3
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,666
She said that there was
a secret furniture shop here.

4
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,125
Damn, even a kid could
see through that lame excuse.

5
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,125
I wanted us all to have
a surprise get-together!

6
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,666
You know, to help
you all get along.

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,375
Sorry, but Gayus and I have
a gentlemen's arrangement

8
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,166
to never become friends
under any circumstances.

9
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,541
Yeah, what he said.

10
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,791
The only thing we agree about

11
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,416
is that we never agree
about anything ever.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,333
Uh? But doesn't that mean
you are on good terms?

13
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,208
Or no?

14
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,875
I'm lost.

15
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,875
[JABEIRA]
Don't hurt yourself, Jivenya.

16
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,291
[JIV]
Jabeira! Hi!

17
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,125
Long time, no see.

Hm? Hey.

The four-eyed nerd and
the Draken dumbass are here.

21
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,875

[yawns]

23
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,166
[JIV]
Jabeira's really great!

24
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,458
She helped me out a lot when I
first started with the company.

25
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,541
You're as adorable as ever.

26
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,833
Why'd you go and leave us, huh?

27
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,208
 Damn, Gayus.

28
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,208
You landed a girl who's
totally out of your league.

29
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,458
Wanna run that by me again?

30
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,041
What about this guy with you?

31
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,583
I don't think I know him.

32
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,916
Is he your boyfriend, or...?

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,458
Of course not!

34
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,333
Just a fellow Jushikiist!

35
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,583
Aw, Iegie.

36
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,375
Come over here and give
an old woman some sugar!

00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,958
[gasps] What the--

00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,375
Could you please stop
talking like a grandma?

39
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,208
Ugh.

40
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,250
By the way.

41
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,500
How's Largonkin doing?

42
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,333
He'll be out of the hospital
soon, thanks to you guys.

43
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,875
Aw, yeah!

44
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,666
Takes more than some lame
Magatsushiki to beat my old man!

45

[CZAHN]
Oh? Is someone injured?

46
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,291
[JABEIRA]
Hey there, Czahn.

47
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,500
It's good to see ya.

48
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,666
How ya been?

49
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,750
Oh, great.

50
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,083
Are you BFFs
with the doctor, too?

51
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,625
Oh, no, Jabeira and I
are cousins.

52
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,458
[GAYUS] A hothead who
changes personalities

53
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,208
at the drop of a hat

54
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,791
and a quack with
an organ fetish.

55
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,625
Your family tree has
got serious root-rot.

56
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,875
Ha, ha. You're hilarious.

57
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,416
Ooh! I just had a great idea!

58
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,750
Since you're here, the six of us
can all party together!

59
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,333
[JIV giggles]

60
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,041
'Kay, 1, 2, 3!

61
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,166
Yeah, yeah, 4, 5, 6.

62
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,875
I don't understand how
this qualifies as a game.

63
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,250
Just roll with it,
all right, Doc?

64
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,458
Now, I say "7, 8, 9."

65
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,666
Okay, 10, 11...

66
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,375
[GAYUS] I'm sure Jiv
doesn't realize this,

67
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,875
but nothing good can come
from Offensive Jushikiists

68
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,166
drinking together.

69
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,708
That is to say,
it ends in bloodshed

70
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,333
about 80 percent of the time.

71
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,625
...22, 3, and 4 then.

72
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,583
[GAYUS]
So, in my infinite cleverness,

73
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,291
I came up with a fun
little drinking game.

74
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,541
The rules are simple.

75
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,916
Everyone counts
numbers in order.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,958
If you have to say 100,
then you lose

77
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,666
and you're punished.

78
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,791
You can say one
to three numbers

79
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,083
and the game starts to
get really interesting

80
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,708
during the last few turns.

81
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,750
[JIV]
Um, let's see... 97?

82
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,666
Nice knowin' ya.

83
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,708
98 and 99.

84
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,291
I can't believe
I've lost already.

85
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,791
One... hundred.

86
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,833
[GAYUS] But, of course,
that's according to my plan!

87
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,416
The loser's punishment is chosen

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,458
by the player who
went right before them.

89
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,833
Naturally, as the night
goes on and people get drunker,

90
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,875
the game becomes more ruthless.

91
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,833
In other words, the person
who loses the starting round

92
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,916
will inevitably end up suffering
less than everyone else does.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,791

make a fuss, Patient 49707015.

This is bad.

I guess I underestimated...
how much you... guys hate... me.

99
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,250
Come now, don't worry!

100
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,666

with my precious baby.

skin like butter.

believe you lied to me

That's a vital one.

I can certainly understand that.

Nope, I don't
think so, Czahn.

116

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,583
Now, you say 100!

165
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,250
[whines]

166
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,875
[JIV]
Oink! Oink!

167
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,458
Oink! Oink...

168
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,250
[JABEIRA]
You're not convincing enough!

169
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,541
I've never seen a piglet with
a scrunched-up face like that.

170
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,541
Now be cuter!

171
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,208
Come on, she's
been through enough.

172
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,250
[JABEIRA]
Think so?

173
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,625
[gasps]

174
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,916
[JABEIRA]
Nope!

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,791
Ow!

176
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,750
Squeal some more!

177
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,583
What a shame.
Rest in peace, my love.

178
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,750
[laughs]

179
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,375
Hey. Gayus?

180
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,416
[GAYUS]
Don't say it.

181
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,083
[GAYUS] Offensive Jushikiists
can work together,

182
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,833
but it's impossible
for us to get along.

183
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,958
And so, the game continued.

184
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,375
Ahh, it's round ten!

185
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,708
This is the last one
of the night!

186
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,875
--Who's going first?
--Dude.

187
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,250
Should we stop?

188
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,375
I'm worried about your girl.

189
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,041
Seems like she's been
kind of off ever since--

190
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,666
Mind your own business.

191
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,958
Quit bothering me,
or your penalty's gonna be

192
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,208
jacking off in public.

193
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,916
He'll do it, too.

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,083
If you're afraid, you can
shove your head up your ass

195
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,000
and wait for the
end of the game.

196
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,375
I don't know if I'd call it
a game at this point.

197
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,875
It's more like we're shooting
dice on a battlefield in hell.

198
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,750
[sighs]

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,250
Albertacadabra,
and away we go, kiddos!

200
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,333
I'm the magical gabby
granny gal Jabby Jabeira!

201
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,208
With my dark,
decrepit Jushiki power,

202
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,875
I'll make all your worst
nightmares come true!

203
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,500
For a price, of course!

204
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,000
Mommy! [cries]

205
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,000
[MOM 11A]
I won't let her get you, dear.

206
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,500
Why was I cursed to be
born into this world!

207
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,791
Is this the glamorous
Offensive Jushikiist's life

208
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,541
I always dreamed of?

209
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,250
No! It can't be!

210
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,375
No. No!

211
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,875
--[JABEIRA crying]
--Well, that's depressing.

212
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,791
--[JABEIRA crying]
--Are we supposed to laugh now?

213
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,458
[JIV]
Jabeira.

214
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,000
It's you.

215
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,958
I think that's enough...

216
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,666
...of rehearsal.

217
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,750
--[JABEIRA screams]
--[JIV] Stop whining!

218
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,291
I say we get ready to take
"the magical granny girl show"

219
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,625
on the road...

220
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,333
[CZAHN] I assume they'll
need a doctor after this.

221
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,916
My fiancée's wicked,
but not like that.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,291
Eh. I'm just happy she took
everybody else along, too.

223
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,916
Did you notice them?

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,166
Yes.

225
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,625
The incident's over now,

226
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:01,083
so why are they still
concerned with us?

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,833
[GAYUS] Man, this was a
last-minute invitation.

228
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,250
Lemme guess. A surprise party?

229
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,375
[XENOBIA] Are you the two
heroes who saved Eridana?

230
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,916
Oh yeah, I thought it was about
time for our fame and fortune,

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,916
Queen Xenobia.

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,541
Indeed it is a party...

233
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,041
...to thank you
for all you've done.

234
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,416
What an honor.

235
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,916
Couldn't have done it
without the information

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,958
you provided us with.

237
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,500
[XENOBIA]
Information?

238
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,791
Of course.

239
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,916
Someone told
Parumuwei the arms dealer

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,125
to spill the location of
the Aurora Hammer's hideout.

241
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,125
It was you, right?

242
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,708
And since he wasn't
useful anymore,

243
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,125
you had him killed and made it
look like Aurora Hammer's work,

244
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,000
didn't you?

245
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,750
My goodness, what an
intelligent young man you are!

246
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,166
I'm shocked.

247
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,416
No wonder Mouldeen
took a liking to you.

248
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,958
Listen.

249
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,750
There's one thing I've been
trying to wrap my head around

250
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,583
since we saw Zhuo Lu
at that hideout.

251
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,708
What's that?

252
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,458
Zhuo Lu was saying Aurora Hammer

253
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,083
was originally established
under the name "Aurora Front"

254
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,791
by none other than
the Dragon Empire itself.

255
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,166
If that's true,
why did you want to crush it?

256
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,625
You created the group in secret

257
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,583
to interfere with
Urmun's internal affairs.

258
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,291
Nothing would have been
more convenient for you

259
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:28,208
than having a civilian like
Remedius take the reins.

260
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,291
Is that your only question?

261
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,375
Not quite.

262
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,250
Why did Remedius
have such a big grudge

263
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,208
against Rahzel and
the Dragon Empire?

264
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,708
He said it was the
worst betrayal imaginable.

265
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,833
[GAYUS gasps]

266
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,208
[GAYUS]
No way. It... can't be!

267
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,250
I don't believe it!

268
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,500
[GAYUS]
The Dragon Empire is conspiring

269
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,125
with that monster
Dochetta, isn't it?

270
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,166
[XENOBIA] I'm sure you know
that this nation's economy

271
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,125
is highly dependent on
various Jushiki industries.

272
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,833
It's not an overstatement
to say that

273
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,583
cutting-edge Jushiki technology
is integral to our survival.

274
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:08,791
And to continue making those
products, we need resources.

275
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,583
I'll just cut to the chase.

276
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,041
Both the Seven-City Alliance
and the Dragon Empire

277
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,375
have fallen in line
with Dochetta's regime.

278
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,583
[BOTH gasp]

279
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,833
[XENOBIA] In return,
we share mining rights,

280
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,083
which means we have access
to Urmun's rare metals.

281
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,041
Then just join forces
with the Aurora Hammer!

282
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,000
That's not as sketchy as--

283
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,541
[XENOBIA]
We can't do that.

284
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,750
Because the
Aurora Hammer insists

285
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,541
that anything in Urmun's domain
belongs solely to Urmun.

286
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,125
We don't benefit
from that policy.

287
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,666
The Empire does not
make compromises.

288
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,750
Therefore, our only
remaining option

289
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,625
was for Remedius
to die as a hostage.

290
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,625
Wait, as a hostage?

291
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,875
What do you mean?

292
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,416
Well, I have to
protect our economy

293
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,375
and the everyday lives
of the people I rule over.

294
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,333
As royalty of the Dragon Empire,

295
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,916
I'll stop at nothing to
ensure that that happens.

296
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,625
I'll sink to any depth.

297
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,583
The suffering of other
nations is of no concern.

298
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,583
After all, why should I
have any sympathy for fools

299
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,416
who are unable to
create solutions

300
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,625
for their own
country's problems?

301
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,625
What kind of ruler--

302
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,916
[XENOBIA]
Don't be cross with me.

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,750
It was Mouldeen's decision.

304
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,416
He declared it
at the secret meeting

305
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,791
with the Seven-City Alliance
you happily escorted him to.

306
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,833
[GAYUS]
I should have known.

307
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,291
You and Mouldeen are so alike.

308
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:31,166
This whole royal family
is one big man-eating dragon!

309
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,750
Answer me one more thing.

310
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,416
What do you gain from revealing
that to us at this point?

311
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,458
Just pure amusement.

312
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,916
You two did survive
that madman's plot,

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,583
so I was curious to discover

314
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,166
what kind of interesting
people you might be.

315
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,666
But this wasn't nearly
as fun as I had hoped.

316
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,125
[XENOBIA]
My goodness.

317
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,000
They left me with
some harsh words.

318
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,958
Young people like those two
have no tact at all.

319
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,166
[MAN 11A]
It's time, Your Highness.

320
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,791

00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,875
our tears and blood
will surely be enough

480
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,916
to drench an entire desert.

481
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,416
None of us will ever
truly be complete.

482
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,208
We'll never have the chance
to walk through paradise.

483
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,375
But, even so, I wonder...
