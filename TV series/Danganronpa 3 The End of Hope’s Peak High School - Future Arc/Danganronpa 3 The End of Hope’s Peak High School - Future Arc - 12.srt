Miss Yukizome. You'd be proud.

I've worked out
what's important.

She was absolutely right.

In and of itself,

Because that was never the aim.

Still, I can live with
myself as I am.

Yes, I've used my power

But by that same power,
I did bring everyone back.

Uh... I, uh-- Ah!

Wow! It's a real honor!

Forgive me, sir.

No, wait, that's not right.
Yours far outstrips mine.

Though I'm quite lucky
to have you as a colleague.

Sorry! Upperclassman, sir.

Come on, time to go.

Okay, Nagito, hold it together!

Is it just me or is he
getting creepier with age?

How're your injuries? Better?

would ask, but okay.

What's that?

185
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:04,208
The 77th Class is broadcasting a
video to the Future Foundation.

[HINATA] Hope you got a kick
out of our little game.

You understand now, we assume.

188
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,333
The Future Foundation is boring.

189

You want your happy endings,
your perfect, ideal world.

190

Your heroes saved
at the last minute

Where's the fun in that?

Good thing we're here.

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,166
If we had a mission statement,

195
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,416
it'd be to make life
more interesting.

196
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's face it. This world
may need a little Despair.

197
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,500
Ugh. Sounds like Junko.

guys all along?!

[TOGAMI]
Well, people now believe

203
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,791
the Remnants of
Despair were behind

00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,625
the Future Foundation's
Mutual Killing Game.

205
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,541
No one ever need be troubled
with the knowledge

206
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,166
that our late Chairman
was responsible.

207
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,583
By and large a positive thing.

208

They did this for us?

Wow. That was nice of them.

Yes. Well done, Naegi.

[NAEGI]
Mh-hm.

Thank you, but I
didn't do anything.

213
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,750
In the end, those guys
were the heroes.

214
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,708
You sound as though heroes
are made in a vacuum.

215
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't expect our friends

216
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,000
would've gotten far
without Hope.

217
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:26,625
And Hope is contagious.
Is it not?

218
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,000
Even when the cost is dear.

[MITARAI chuckles]

There are only two
certainties in this life.

Yeah, carbs and high
fructose corn syrup!

00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,458
Full disclosure?

228
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:20,708
Sure, I don't see why not.

229
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,125
That day, when you entered
the New World Program,

230
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:28,958
a cutting edge AI was created to
sort of keep an eye on everyone.

231
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,583
Codename: Nanami.

232
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,208
First, they mined
your hippocampus,

233
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,208
compiled memories of
esteemed authority figures.

234
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,166
The idea was to
fuse those memories

235
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,750
into a single personality
you could all trust.

236
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,583
Imagine the surprise
when it turned out

237
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,416
they didn't have to bother.

238
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,916
One memory overrode the rest.

239
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,583
It was the same for all of you.

240
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,958
Strange, yes, but
undeniably sweet.

241
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,500
There was one person you'd all
give anything to see again.

242
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,625
Of course, I'm not
a prefect replica.

243
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,666
But you know what they say.

244
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,000
If someone lives in our memory,
they're never truly gone.

245
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,875
What do you think?

246
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,458
Is this the miracle worth
believing in Hope for?

247
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,375
I don't know.

248

It's a happy ending
at least. So there's that.

So? Shall we?

a lot of work to be done.

This is your time, Makoto Naegi.

[NAEGI]
Munakata.

262
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,833
The burden of being the
hero now belongs to you.

263
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,083
You'll forever be the man
who fought the Remnants and won.

264
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,500
That is the Hope
the world needs.

265
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,791
I'll be that Hope.

266
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,208
Can you bear the weight?

267
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,958
Yeah. I think carrying
that is the least I can do.

268
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:50,000
Heh. The Remnants have their
bag of rocks, I have mine.

269
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,666
That's all well and good,
but what will you do with it?

I'm not sure.

00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,375
Guess we'll see.

Best of luck.

[NAEGI]
Where are you going?

274
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,708
[MUNAKATA]
I have my own cross to bear.

275
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:18,291
[NAEGI] Hard as we try,
none of us can see the future.

276
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,291
The horizon we walk toward
is always obscured.

277
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,208
The future's always hazy.

278
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,416
Hope and Despair mingle.

279
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,875
We can't always tell
which is which.

280
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,916
It's strange.
Sometimes terrifying.

281
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,333
Still though, if all
you do is sit and wait,

282
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,250
nothing happens.

283
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,125
The trick is to take it
one step at a time.

284
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:47,583
See, you don't have to know
the future to move forward.

285
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,083
Just walk with your memories.

286
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,791
Look up at the sky,
and say to yourself,

287
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,708
"There's always Hope
for tomorrow."

[NAEGI]
Kyoko...

289
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:17,916
[KOIZUMI]
Hm?

290
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,750
Hey, what'cha got there?

291
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:20,750
Nothing much.

292
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,000
Just a drug that
delays the poison

293
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,083
those awful bangles were using.

294
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,125
Let me see that.

295
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,250
Wait a second. This is
Kimura's handiwork.

296
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,625
How about that? She was
much stronger than I knew.

297
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:35,708
Even in the middle of all that
death, she concocted Hope.

298
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,083
So it works kind of
like an antidote then.

299
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,500
Break your Forbidden Action
and you could still live?

300
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,458
Well, it puts you in a coma
until you can get help.

301
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,958
I took the liberty of reviving
someone who used it.

302
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,500
So they should be up
and about in no time.
