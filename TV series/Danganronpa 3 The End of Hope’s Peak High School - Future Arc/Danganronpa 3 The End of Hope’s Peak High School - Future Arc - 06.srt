Ticks.

Mindlessly gorging themselves on
the blood of larger creatures.

00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,791
They pair off and reproduce.

5
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,375
That's it.

00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,000
Once upon a time,

lightening in a bottle.

[TRUSTEE A]
I wasn't impressed initially.

In fact, at first blush,

14
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,500

Come on, man. Pick up the pace!

So much for that, I guess.

[PEKOYAMA]
Of course.

43
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,833
What about the rest of it?

44
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,875
I dunno. That's Komaeda's
stuff, so whatever.

45
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,083
Ask Nanami about it later.

46
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,208
[PEKOYAMA]
Understood. And this?

[KUZURYU] Ugh. Will you
knock it off? Damn.

Too late now. I got 'em.

This is weird! Extremely weird!

adding up here!

I think it's lovely.

Ah.

Fie on thee, filthy cur!

that is a sacred offering to
the fallen angel Satanael!

You are not worthy to change
the lining of that cage!

Remove thy impure hands
lest you court calamity!

You're an idiot.
I mean, C'mon! Calamity?

00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,958
I've seen tougher stuff come out
of a vacuum cleaner bag.

office, moving her things.

we see her at all.

Careful with this.

Don't get caught with

When the clock strikes,
it's game over.

I'm well aware. It'll be okay.

[JUZO]
Uh-huh.

92

You say that, but one
of the trustees is MIA.

So yeah, security staff's
a tad on edge at the moment.

You still gonna go
through with it?

I may not get another chance.

But the thing is,

no one person should claim
a monopoly on Despair.

Your capacity for
cold, hard reasoning

That's the curse
of bein' bright.

Everyone goes on
and on about "hope,"

293
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,208
but what they really
mean is "status quo."

294
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,250
Ah, but Despair is a
big ol' mystery box.

295

and paves the way for chaos.

299
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,500
Think about it.

300
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,750
When a single assassin's bullet

301
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,791
can plunge humanity
into world war,

302
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,333
none of us are as
far from the abyss

303
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,666
as we'd like to tell ourselves.

304
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,125
Embrace that simple
fact, and voila!

305

You're in for the
ride of your life!

306

Look at me! Every nerve
ending is at 11!

307
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,458
Despair did that!

308
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:33,791
Come on, punkin' pie. Some part
of you has to understand.

309
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,833
They call you the world's
Hope, Izuru Kamukura.

310
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,541
And who am I to say
you're not the savior?

311
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,333
Therein lies the rub.

312
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,375
Hope only gets us as far
as what we think we want.

C'mon.

315
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,625
Nirvana looks great on paper,

316
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,125
but for someone with
your intelligence,

317
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,833
's more like Purgatory.

318
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,416
You're better than that.

319
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,333
[alarm blares]

320
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,625
They know we're here!

321
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,208
Junko, we have to make
a break for it, now!

322
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,083
You're a god among
insects, Kamukura!

323
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,791
Of course you're bored!
The world's an ant farm!

324
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,791
Embrace Despair and we'll
shatter the glass together!

325
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,916
I am your salvation! It's fate!

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We were destined to
walk hand-in-hand!

327
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,208
Tell me you don't feel it!

328
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,250
[IMPOSTER]
Hey, Mitarai.

329
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,750
C'mon. Wake up.

330
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,125
[MITARAI]
Sorry.

331
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,833
[IMPOSTER] Don't tell me
it isn't done yet.

332
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,166
Nope.

333
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,833
But, hey, I've finally hit
the experimental stage,

334
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,208
so at least there's that.

335
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,125
You've lost me.

336
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,666
I'll explain when
it's more concrete.

337
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,041
You think maybe we can
stop with the hospital?

338
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,666
[IMPOSTER]
Out of the question.

339
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,416
You'll keep going till
the doctor gives you

340
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,083
a clean bill of health and
that's all there is to it.

341
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,083
[MITARAI sighs]

342
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,541
Fine, if I have to.

343
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,750
Oh, darn. You're not in a coma.

344
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,083
[MUKURO] No worries.
We're in the school infirmary.

345
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,041
'S okay, I covered for you.

346
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,875
I told 'em you fell
down the stairs.

347
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,291
'Course they bought it.

348
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,875
You're an accident waiting
to happen in those heels.

349
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,708
What happened to him?

350
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,958
[MUKURO]
Junko! No!

351
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:49,333
[HINATA] When she wakes up,
give her a message for me.

352
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,250
I'll be waiting. Here.

353
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,708
We're not in trouble at all,

354
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,083
so I don't think
he's told anyone.

355
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,500
We probably wouldn't
be in here if he had.

356
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,416
Uh-oh! I better hurry!

357
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,583
A lady doesn't keep a
gentleman in suspense!

358
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,666
There's something
about that guy.

359
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,458
He rubs me the wrong way.

360
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,791
Yeah?

361
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,833
Well snub-nosed, flat-chested
perverts only good

362
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,916
for killin' folks rub me
the wrong way, so there!

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,208
Wait, no! That didn't
come out how I wanted.

364
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,916
Junko, what are you doing?

365
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,416
They said you need rest.
You shouldn't be up yet.

366
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,250
Aww. Relax.

367
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,541
I can't remember the last time

368
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,958
someone gave me
such a thrashing.

369
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,208
Totes invigorating!

370
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,833
Being one-upped actually
has me on Cloud Nine!

371
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,875
[MUKURO]
W-Wait a second!

372
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,291
[yelps]

373
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,291
Can-Can I help you?

374
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,458
What is your name?

375
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,000
Uh, Ryota Mitarai.

376
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,166
And you are?

377
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:11,791
[ENOSHIMA gasps]

378
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,541
[ENOSHIMA laughs]

379
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,750
--Junko, stop!
--[MITARAI] Have we met before?

380
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,666
[ENOSHIMA] This may sound weird,
but for some reason--

381
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:27,000
In my head--oh God--
I keep hearing the words,

382
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,708
"Despairfully
fateful encounter."

383
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,666
Is today my lucky day or what?
