00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,291
[YUKIZOME]
'Kay, have the handouts made it

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,083
all the way to the back?

3
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,208
It's very important
everyone has one.

4
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,625
This is the schedule
for the practical exams.

5
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,125
They start tomorrow so whatever
you need to be ready,

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,916
get on it.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,333
As you all know,

8
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,833
we don't do final exams by
term here at Hope's Peak.

9
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,291
So in lieu of that,

10
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,833
the school holds targeted
practical exams once a year.

11
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,541
Now keep in mind, if your
results are below average,

12
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,541
you might not be
allowed to stay.

13
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,541
Having said that,
I'm sure you'll be amazing!

14
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,375
Put those talents on display.

15
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,458
Show us teachers the
kind of awesomeness

16
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,666
our students are capable of!

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,833
Y'know, just do your best!

18
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,875
[YUKIZOME]
You want me to cancel the exams?

19
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,958
Please.

20
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,958
[YUKIZOME]
Look, I get it. I do.

21
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,416
We're all feeling kinda down
after what happened.

22
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,416
Normally it wouldn't
be a problem.

23
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Compared to me,
everyone has enough talent

24
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,583
to pass with flying
colors, sure.

25
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,833
But, I mean,

26
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,708
wouldn't it be a better
gage of our abilities

27
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,166
if we waited till
we were in top form?

28
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,708
I'm a team player.

29
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,958
The sort of guy who wants
to see his classmates shine

30
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,250
as brightly as possible.

31
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,333
Well, we're on the same page
as far as that's concerned.

32
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,708
But I'm sorry.

33
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,500
I'm told we're expecting
a bit of media coverage.

34
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,583
A cancellation would
gum up the works.

35
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,375
[KOMAEDA]
I see. Never mind then.

36
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,208
Oh, are you sure?

37
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,541
[KOMAEDA]
Of course.

38
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,458
Thank you for your
time, Miss. Good day.

39
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,291
[chuckles]

40
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:26,666
Meh. I was going out
on a limb. Oh well.

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,791
No need to fret we
can always move on...

42
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,583
...to Plan B.

43
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,625
[NANAMI] Hinata. You're
not coming today, either?

44
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:07,416
[HANAMURA gasping]

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,583
I'm overjoyed to see
that you like it, my friend.

46
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,458
[HANAMURA]
This is outstanding!

47
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,833
When it hit the street,

48
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,208
Sayaka Maizono's photo album
sold out in record time!

49
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,500
Mere seconds!

50
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:20,708
To think that I would ever
possess my own copy!

51
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,958
Weird it was just lying there
at the side of the road.

52
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,041
[HANAMURA]
You happened on this by chance?

53
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,333
Yes, well, no matter.

54
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,666
Thank you, my friend.
I am in your debt!

55
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,833
A Manchu Imperial
Feast awaits you!

56
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,750
If you wanted to thank
me actually, uh...

57
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,541
What was that girl's name?
The one who helped you?

58
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,083
Sorry.

59
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,875
I believe she gave you the
stuff for your Doping Corn Soup.

60
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,625
The Super High
School-Level Pharmacist.

61
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,666
[KOMAEDA]
Hi.

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,791
[SEIKO screams]

63
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,083
Why would you surprise me?!
Do you have death wish?

64
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,083
[KOMAEDA]
My apologies.

65
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,458
Unless I'm mistaken,
that's the laxative I ordered.

66
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,250
[SEIKO] It's called a
Re-activator, to be precise.

67
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,333
A drug that promotes
peristalsis of the intestine.

68
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,750
Ah! Wonderful!

69
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,958
Well whatever the name,

70
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,916
it'll be great to get
things moving again.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,250
How lucky am I that
we were introduced?

72
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,791
Yes, the Fates smile--

73
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,666
[RURUKA] Hey, come on!
I know you're in there!

74
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,250
I will break down this
door if I have to!

75
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:20,958
[SEIKO]
It's unlocked.

76
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,708
[RURUKA]
Let me in!

77
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,458
Um.

78
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,666
[SEIKO]
Don't worry about it.

79
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,208
Very back of the storage room.

80
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,875
Top shelf. Far right.
Help yourself.

81
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,541
Use in moderation.

82
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,416
It's strong stuff.
Top shelf. Far right.

83
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,250
Jeez, took ya long enough.

84
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,500
Okay.

85
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,750
[RURUKA] Anyways, not to
bore you with details,

86
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,958
but that's why we need

87
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,208
your signature
performance-enhancing drug.

88
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,000
Delicious, babe.

89
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,125
[giggles]

90
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,333
[SEIKO] Strictly speaking,
it's not a performance enhancer.

91
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,958
That's just a side effect.

92
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,500
Re-animators are complicated.

93
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,375
Sometimes they boost metabolic--

94
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,708
Ah, a side effect
is still an effect.

95
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:08,958
If it gets the job done,

96
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,041
no need to sweat
the particulars.

97
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,166
[SEIKO]
But I'm--

98
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,250
I'm planning to
unveil it for my exam.

99
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,375
Huh?

100
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:21,333
So what I'm hearing is, you're
not gonna give me what I want.

101
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:26,166
[KOMAEDA]
Top shelf. Far right. Let's see.

102
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,833
[KOMAEDA]
Ah. Here we are.

103
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,458
[SEIKO] Why do you always
pick the worst times

104
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,791
to ask me for help?

105
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,291
Yeah, I know.
We rely on you too much.

106
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,083
It's a burden,
but we are totally sorry.

107
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,208
I get it.

108
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,166
My timing stinks.
You've got a lot on your plate.

109
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,833
But if I can't turn to
a childhood friend,

110
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,333
what can I do?

111
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,708
[SEIKO]
Please don't.

112
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,708
[RURUKA]
I'm begging you.

113
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,833
You're the only
one who can help.

114
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,166
That is what friends
are for, right?

115
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,166
And I mean. We are...

116
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,125
...besties.

117
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,416
Forever.

118
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,416
[KOMAEDA]
Huh.

119
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,750
Okay.

120
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,041
[chuckles]

121
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,000
Might as well
leave it to chance.

122
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,833
My luck being what
it is, why not?

123
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,208
This one.

124
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,583
[SEIKO]
Fine. I'll give you the drug.

125
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,625
Yippee!

126
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,333
[RURUKA] Thanks, doll!
I'll grab it myself.

127
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,750
[SEIKO]
Uhh...

128
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,833
You know, you never
eat my sweets.

129
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,833
Hurts a teensy 'lil bit.

130
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,750
[yelps]

131
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,666
Excuse me.

132
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,291
Who're you?

133
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:12,583
[SEIKO] One of the First Years.
He came for a laxative.

134
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,291
[KOMAEDA chuckles]

135
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,750
[SOHNOSUKE]
Hmph.

136
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,083
Well you got what you need,
so get out of here, freak.

137
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,541
[RURUKA]
Hey, so...

138
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,333
Which one of 'em's
the good stuff?

139
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,791
All your fancy containers
look the same.

140
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,666
[SEIKO] They're clearly labeled.
Very back. Top shelf. Middle.

141
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,875
[RURUKA]
Duh!

142
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,041
[RURUKA] Thanks a billion,
Seiko. You rock.

143
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,000
[RURUKA giggles]

144
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,291
[sighs]

145
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,166
[TEACHER A]
Who would do this?

146
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,583
[TEACHER B]
We should let security know.

147
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,916
Can't be too careful these days.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,875
Our job gives us enough
to worry about as it is.

149
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,583
[TEACHER C]
"Flames of Judgment"?

150
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,541
Are we talking arson?

151
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,250
[TEACHER E] Knowing these kids,
it could easily be an explosive.

152
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,958
[TEACHER D] Oh, surely it's
just some stupid prank.

153
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,375
[SEIKO] Oh! I knew I'd
sleep through the alarm.

154
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,708
I shouldn't have pulled
an all-nighter!

155
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,625
Damn it, Ruruka!
This is all your fault!

156
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,666
[SEIKO yelps]

157
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,875
Ugh, right in the--

158
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,500
Uh. Kimura, what are you--?

159
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,875
[SEIKO]
Oh, no. Not again.

160
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,500

You have my word.

320
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,291
[KIZAKURA sighs]

321
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,833
Three exceptional students
all expelled on the same day.

322
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,916
Wounds my sensibilities
as a scout.

323
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,458
[JIN] The bombing garnered
quite a bit of media attention.

324
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,791
The public's clamoring
for the perpetrator.

325
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,333
[KIZAKURA] Yeah, with
something this off the rails,

326
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,500
I suppose we don't
have much of a choice.

327
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,208
So what's the story
on Komaeda?

328
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,791
[JIN] I understand the boy
was an innocent bystander,

329
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,875
unwittingly caught up in
someone else's mischief?

330
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,458
You're sticking by
that assertion?

331
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,708
[KIZAKURA]
Thing is,

332
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,708
there are more than a
handful of eyewitnesses

333
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,583
who'll swear he was
the mastermind.

334
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,208
They're rattling for
his expulsion too.

335
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,708
My negligence is to blame!

336
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,250
If they need someone
to scapegoat,

337
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,166
point the finger at me!

338
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,333
[JIN] Even if your student was
the plot's chief architect,

339
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,541
he didn't administer
the laxatives

340
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,250
or for that matter
trigger the bomb.

341
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,458
Period.

342
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,500
We have to look at
the bigger picture.

343
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,250
If he brought about
a measurable result

344
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,041
without direct intervention,

345
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,625
that's a talent we
don't dare let go.

346
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,375
[JIN sighs]

347
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,833
That said, of course,
the boy has to be suspended.

348
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,291
And his homeroom teacher
placed on probation.

349
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,541
As the assistant
homeroom teacher,

350
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,708
you will be transferred
to the Reserve Course,

351
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,458
which I trust is a
satisfactory compromise.

352
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,625
Very much so. Thank you, sir.

353
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,541
[JIN]
Good.

354
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,625
The practical exams
will be postponed.

355
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,708
[sighs]

356
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,291
Luck is a terrifying thing.

357
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,666
Way to go, kid. Way to go.

358
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:35,833
[sighs]

359
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,166
Hey, there! Good morn--

360
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,708
So you've, uh,
heard the announcement.

361
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,000
[chairs scraping]

362
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,458
C'mon, Teach!
Somebody screwed up, right?

363
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,375
What's this bullshit
about you being transferred

364
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,958
to the Reserve Course?

365
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,291
They want us to finish out the
year with some substitute hack?

366
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,458
D'you hear about Komaeda
gettin' suspended?

367
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,333
He'll return eventually.

368
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,583
He just, uh, got swept up in
unfortunate circumstances.

369
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,583
[SAIONJI] Gee, you think?
The gym was totally destroyed!

370
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,875
[SODA]
What'd the genius do now?

371
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,583
[YUKIZOME]
He was thinking of you.

372
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,083
His only thought was
helping his classmates.

373
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,583
Sure, his methods
were questionable.

374
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,833
Wait, he did all that for us?

375
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,708
That's right. Bear that
in mind when he comes back.

376
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,625
And give him a warm
welcome for me.

377
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,000
[TSUMIKI whimpers]

378
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,958
Do you really have to go?

379
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:44,000
[SONIA crying]

380
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,000
There's no need for tears.

381
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,875
Officially they're
calling it a transfer,

382
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,875
but it's more like training.

383
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,958
I'm not through with you yet.

384
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,375
Oh no?

385
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,375
You haven't seen the
last of me, kiddos.

386
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,666
I'm your teacher.
Don't you ever forget it!

387
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,625
I know me going on hiatus isn't
ideal, but I'll come back.

388
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,291
Look forward to that day
and don't lose heart.

389
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,500
We're all in this together.

390
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,041
Class Representative,
in the meantime,

391
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,750
protect everyone.

392
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,625
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

393
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,333
Hey, hey. Good news.

394
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,916
They busted me down
to the Reserve Course.

395
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,250
So yeah, should make
the investigation easier.

396
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,125
You don't sound
terribly pleased.

397
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,833
There some sort of catch?

398
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:15,833
[YUKIZOME] Oh. Heh...
Nothing like that, silly.

399
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,666
[YUKIZOME]
It's just...

400
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,083
I don't know. Tough saying
goodbye to the kids, I suppose.

401
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,375
Real professional, huh?
What's gotten into me?

402
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,041
I'm conducting an investigation.

403
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,875
[MUNAKATA]
Yukizome.

404
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:41,083
Sorry. Anyway,
the Reserve Course.

405
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,541
Here we go.
