To harbor some special skill,

00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,666
and walk through the gate into
the Academy's main school

One problem...
I don't excel at anything.

No sports. Or music.
Or cooking.

I'm just... average.

Hm?

That's so weird,

the way you stare at
the Main Course building.

Why do you care what I do?

19

Bet'cha don't have
any friends here.

Honestly, your people
skills could use some work.

me into this classroom

My dad's the one who's
calling all the shots.

But someday it's gonna
fall to my big brother.

The Super High School-Level
Gangster himself.

That's a talent?

38
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,125
And since big bro is
such a talented guy,

39
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,750
that means I've gotta be a Super
High School-Level Little Sister.

Go on. You can tell
me how right I am now.

But you're here in the
Reserve Course like us.

You'd be over with the
others if you were elite.

Just because they
haven't let me in

an open slot, huh?

would come down here.

00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,833
Or the puzzles
never made sense.

160
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,958
I wonder if they'd still be fun
for you, if that were the case.

161
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,458
[NANAMI]
Hmm...

162
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,291
Even if I were horrible,
I think I'd love them.

163
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,083
That's how great they are.

164
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,416
But what if somebody else were

165
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,750
the Super High School-Level
Gamer and every time

166
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,541
they left your
score in the dust?

167
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,125
[NANAMI] There's more to
life than just talent.

168
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,708
Huh?

169
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,541
Miss Yukizome likes to tell us
stuff like that all the time.

170
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,541
She says, "Talent is
never a guarantee

171
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,583
of an interesting life."

172
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,333
Making memories with other
people leads to hope.

173
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:23,583
And hope is way more important
than ability in the long run.

174
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,833
The time we spend together
playing all these games,

175
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,250
I like it.

176
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,083
Yeah, me too.

177
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,166
Yeah! This is great fun!

178
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,000
In that case, let's keep going.

179
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,875
Huh? My thumbs are toast.

180
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,000
Can't we switch it up
for a little bit?

181
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,208
No way.

182
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,666
You're finally ready
for the world of co-op.

183
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,958
Yes, ma'am. Ready!

184
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,583
[HINATA] Even without
talent, there is hope.

185
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,875
Maybe things are
startin' to look up.

186
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,375
[SATO] Whatever you're
gonna spring on Mahiru,

187
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,250
forget about it!

188
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,416
Huh? Jeez, not this crap again.

189
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,291
How delusional are you?

190
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,708
All the scheming in the world
isn't gonna change anything,

191
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
so just give it up!

192
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,625
It doesn't matter that
your dad's a big shot!

193
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,375
He can't just buy you a talent.

194
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,666
But even if he could, Mahiru
would always be better than you!

195
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,250
Get bent!

196
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,541
You're just a lovesick hack who
trails after her all the time.

197
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,500
Like toilet paper on a shoe!

198
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,250
[SATO]
You bi--!

199
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,666
[HINATA]
Sato, no!

200
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,916
You just signed your
death warrant.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,250
Natsumi!

202
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,791
Wait, hold on!

203
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,791
[SATO]
I always knew she was evil.

204
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,958
Mahiru, I swear I'll protect
you from that demon.

205
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:47,000
On my life, I promise.
No matter what.

206
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,375
[HINATA]
Natsumi!

207
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,333
Now what?

208
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,166
I know you and Sato
don't get along, but still.

209
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,041
You can't threaten
people like that.

210
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,291
What do you care?

211
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,083
You're just some rando
from the Reserve Course.

212
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,000
I can do whatever
I damn-well please.

213
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,666
They're not gonna scout you.

214
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,541
In fact, once they
catch wind of this,

215
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,625
they'll probably kick you out!

216
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,833
[NATSUMI]
Shut up already!

217
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,125
You don't know a thing!

218
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,666
I'm getting that
transfer no matter what.

219
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,000
I've got talent. I know I do!

220
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,750
Why does this matter to you?

221
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,000
Why's the Main
Course so important?

222
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,250
My brother's the Super
High School-Level Gangster.

223
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,916
If I'm not a Super High
School-Level Little Sister,

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,708
I'm left behind.

225
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,583
Not on my watch. Screw that!

226
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,416
[NANAMI] There's more
to life than just talent.

227
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,250
I get it.

228
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:56,000
Feeling like you're left behind
must be the worst thing ever.

229
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,916
But I-- I don't think you
have to be a top student.

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,166
Or an elite.

231
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,750
What does that even mean?

232
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,833
In this world, you either make
the cut or you don't. The end.

233
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,958
You love your big
brother, don't you?

234
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,750
Talent isn't even a factor.

235
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,791
Just stay with him and
make memories together.

236
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,416
My brother deserves
the very best,

237
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,833
and that includes all of
the people around him!

238
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,375
[gasps]

239
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,291
I want him to be proud of me.

240
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,166
Not looking down from above.

241
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,333
I wanna stand by his side.

242
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:29,541
As soon as I'm a Super High
School-Level Little Sister...

243
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,291
...I can be with him
again, no problem.

244
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,541
[HINATA]
"They deserve the very best.

245
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,083
Including the people
around them."

246
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,958
Why're the police here?

247
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,125
Some kid got murdered, I think.

248
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,625
[HINATA]
Huh?

249
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,666
[STUDENT A] Oh, yeah. We got
a straight up homicide here.

250
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,708
That new girl, supposedly.
Natsumi, or something like that.

251
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,250
[KOIZUMI]
Tell me the truth, Sato!

252
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,791
Please. What happened yesterday?

253
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,375
No. You couldn't have--

254
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,833
[SATO] I wanted... I wanted to
watch the life leave her eyes.

255
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,791
How could I just sit and wait

256
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,833
for her to spring
her trap on you?

257
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,833
She would've!

258
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,375
Look, if she hadn't died,
she would've killed you!

259
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,583
You remember this scar, right?

260
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,833
Remember in middle school

261
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,458
when the two of you
got into an argument

262
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,958
and I jumped in to stop it?

263
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,583
Later that same night,
someone did this.

264
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,708
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

265
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,083
No, there's nothing
to apologize for!

266
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,791
Really! I don't blame
you for asking me!

267
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,791
You didn't kill her, then?

268
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,791
Honestly, I couldn't hurt a fly.

269
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,041
I said those things
to scare her off.

270
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,083
You do believe me, don't you?

271
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,958
Yeah. I believe you.

272
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,208
[KOIZUMI] Okay. I should
probably be going.

273
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,708
See ya.

274
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,208
[HINATA]
Sato.

275
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,708
What exactly were the
two of you talking about?

276
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,500
She's dead. And people
saw her threaten you.

277
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,583
Look, I didn't murder her!
Is that what you want me to say?

278
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,291
[HINATA] So where'd you go after
she stormed off yesterday, huh?

279
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,166
She was yakuza! Of course
she was gonna die young!

280
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,666
Or maybe she offed herself.
Ever think of that?

281
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,458
Maybe she couldn't
face another day

282
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,791
of being a talentless
harpy and gave up.

283
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,125
Suicide. Had to've been.

284
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,208
[HINATA] Natsumi hadn't
given up on anything!

285
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,916
Talented or not, she still
had hope for the future!

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,666
Hope that--

287
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,166
[SATO]
You're wrong.

288
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,583
You're wrong. You're wrong! No!

289
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,041
[SATO screams]

290
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,625
[TEACHER A]
All right.

291
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,791
Let's dedicate our
efforts to Kuzuryu,

292
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,791
who was taken from
us far too soon.

293
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,250
[STUDENT B]
Excuse me, but where's Sato?

294
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:48,333
[TEACHER A] Uh, I couldn't
tell you. Late, perhaps.

295
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,833
[HINATA]
Sato never did show up.

296
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:59,250
Not that day, or the next,
or the one after that.

297
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,791
Then, on the fourth day,

298
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,208
they finally found Sato's body.

299
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,666
[GUARD A] Freeze, kid!
That's a Reserve Course uniform!

300
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,333
The hell do you
think you're going?

301
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,708
I won't be long.

302
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,416
I need to ask Koizumi in
the Main Course a question.

303
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,625
[GUARD A]
No way!

304
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,958
But--

305
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,250
[GUARD A] No buts about it.
You know the rules.

306
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,750
Hey!

307
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,750
Look, I need to get in th-- Ah!

308
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,958
[JUZO] Rules don't apply
to you, is that it?

309
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,708
I... know you.

310
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,750
Then you know I'm in charge of
security for all of Hope's Peak.

311
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:46,291
I'll let it go, just this once.
Now get the hell outta here.

312
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,708
[HINATA]
Hold on!

313
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,916
I wanna know the truth!

314
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,541
Not the version they're
feeding us in class!

315
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,208
What happened?
Please, just tell me!

316
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,791
You want the truth, do ya?

317
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,250
In that case,
hold onto your ass.

318
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,750
Miss Kuzuryu was killed
by an unknown intruder

319
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,583
on school grounds.

320
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,375
And Miss Sato died from the
shock of losing a classmate.

321
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,333
Wish I had more to
tell you, but I don't.

322
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,166
[HINATA]
Don't lie to me!

323
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,958
You're just trying to sweep
the killings under the rug

324
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,916
to save your
precious academy!

325
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,208
There's a waiting list
for the Reserve Course.

326
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,041
Everyone wants a spot.

327
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,791
Their desks'll be filled before
their bodies have gotten cold.

328
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,416
What did you just say?

329
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,166
You bastard!

330
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,791
Only skill you kids
bring to the table

331
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,458
is getting Daddy
to cut a big check.

332
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,166
Useless in life,
and a hassle in death.

333
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,250
You bring down the
whole place either way.

334
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,666
Pitiful. Tch.

335
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,333
So what if they weren't one of
your precious elite students?

336
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,458
Our lives are all
worth the same!

337
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,458
[grunts]

338
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,833
[JUZO]
No. They're really not.

339
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,166
Grow up, kid.

340
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,875
You can't make diamonds
outta empty beer bottles.

341
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,666
Why don't you run
along and play?

342
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,875
Go crawling back to
your dead end buddies.

343
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,625
Go delude yourselves into
thinking you're someone.

344
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,291
Go on.

345
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,458
I can read you like a book.

346
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,458
Hung out with an elite,
and now you're all uppity.

347
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,250
Not gonna lie. S'what I hate
about you normals the most.

348
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,083
Get a little attention
from your betters,

349
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,625
and you cling on
to 'em like a leech.

350
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,291
[HINATA]
You're wrong. Can't you see?

351
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,625
What?

352
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,416
There's more to life
than just being talented.

353
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,958
I think you're onto something.
You're so right.

354
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,041
For a drone such as yourself,

355
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,375
there's all sorts of
things you can focus on.

356
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,458
Like toiling for the
sake of your masters.

357
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,416
Turn off your brain
and fit into your slot.

358
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,458
Anything more is futile.

359
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,416
Be a good little dog and take
to the collar and leash already.

360
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,750
We'll be sure to throw
you the occasional bone.

361
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,541
[HINATA yells]

362
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,083
I'm gonna send you
to the hospital,

363
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,041
you ballsy little punk!

364
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,500
[YUKIZOME]
Knock it off.

365
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,958
Yukizome.

366
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,750
Hinata. Are you okay?

367
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,166
[YUKIZOME]
You're bleeding.

368
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,208
We're staff now,

369
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,541
but I hope you haven't forgotten
what we came back here to do.

370
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,916
Munakata's orders
were very clear.

371
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,791
Investigate the dark
side of Hope's Peak.

372
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,166
There's no point in sticking up

373
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,625
for Reserve Course
burnouts along the way.

374
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,250
I've been investigating.

375
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,250
Don't forget who
you're talking to.

376
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,041
Also don't think I'm gonna
let you beat up a student!

377
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,583
That's inexcusable,
mission or not!

378
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,375
Ugh. Copy that.

379
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,500
I don't remember you
tilting at windmills

380
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,541
back when we were the students.

381
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,500
[growls]

382
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,125
[sighs]

383
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,000
I think Munakata hit the
nail on the head though

384
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,041
when he said the academy
has a sickness.

385
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,125
They're trying to sweep
the whole Kuzuryu incident

386
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,041
under the rug and it's working.

387
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,625
The other teachers have gone
into damage control mode, too.

388
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,833
I've been told to downplay it
to the kids when it comes up.

389
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,625
God, it pisses me off.

390
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,750
Instead of stepping
up in a crisis,

391
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,458
they're just covering
their asses.

392
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,333
Why were you so
brutal with Hinata

393
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,916
if you agree with him?

394
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,625
If he comes anywhere
close to the truth,

395
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,333
he'll be the one on
a slab in the morgue.

396
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,083
I can't argue with that logic.

397
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,666
But you can probably
save his life

398
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,000
without threatening to maim him.

399
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,375
Yeah, yeah. I'll play nice.

400
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,125
You know, it's hard to believe

401
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,583
how bad things have actually
gotten around Hope's Peak.

402
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,541
And Munakata...
is the school's one hope.

403
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,375
You're right. Its fate
is in his hands.

404
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,458
Huh?

405
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,000
[JUZO]
Huh?

406
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,833
If you think you
can steal him away,

407
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,625
you, Mister Boxer, have
another thing coming!

408
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,750
Just 'cause I think he's
the school's salvation

409
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,791
doesn't mean I'm
gunnin' for a piece.

410
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,750
I should be getting back.

411
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,791
Hey.

412
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,500
[YUKIZOME]
Hm?

413
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,833
You were like a real teacher,

414
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,416
defending that boy
the way you did.

415
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,708
[gasps]

416
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,458
Hey, Hinata!

417
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,166
Look! I picked up a new
game for us to play.

418
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,791
I can't. It's just, I have
to go somewhere today.

419
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:54,875
Sorry. It's really important,
and I can't miss it.

420
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,333
Okay.

421
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,875
[NANAMI]
Hinata, wait!

422
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,625
Yeah? What's up?

423
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,791
I...

424
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,125
Nothing.

425
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,250
It was nothing.

426
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,166
[HINATA]
Nanami.

427
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,000
Are you making
memories at Hope's Peak?

428
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:28,416
Uh... I think so. Why?

429
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,041
I want you to make a
bunch of them for me.

430
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,250
There's way more to you

431
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,958
than just a Super High
School-Level Gamer.

432
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,750
Your character stats
are off the charts.

433
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,250
Well, then. See ya later.

434
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,625
Yeah! See ya tomorrow!

435
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,041
[HINATA]
Nanami.

436
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,791
When I saw you,
I wanted to be able to say,

437
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:06,833
"Hey, I have a talent. Look at
this crazy thing I can do."

438
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:11,375
I'm empty though.
I can't do anything.

439
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:15,333
But you can take something
empty... and fill it.

440
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,833
[JIN]
Gentlemen.

441
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,500
The subject has decided
to undergo the procedure.

442
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,125
I'm not a fan.

443
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:29,125
Ain't nothing good gonna come
of cooking up artificial talent.

444
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:32,583
Agreed. But what can
we do about it now?

445
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:38,125
[TRUSTEE A] Finally.
You've come to a decision, boy.

446
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:43,208
[HINATA]
Yes, I've made my choice.

447
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,916
I'll be their Hope.
