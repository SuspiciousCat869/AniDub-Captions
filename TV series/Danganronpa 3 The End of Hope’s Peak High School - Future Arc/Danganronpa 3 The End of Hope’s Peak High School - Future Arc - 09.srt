00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,333
[NANAMI]
Hinata.

2
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,583
You look like him, but don't.

3
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,333
You are Hinata, aren't you?

4
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,958
Your hair's different now.

5
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,916
[HINATA]
You speak like you know me.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,250
[gasps]

7
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,958
[ENOSHIMA] Okay, you crazy
kids, let's wrap it up.

8
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,791
As much as I'm a fan
of the slow burn,

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,666
I think you've stared at
each other long enough.

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,666
You. Then you must be--

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,333
I'm the one making
all you puppets dance.

12
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,791
[NANAMI]
Huh?

13
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,750
You're the representative
for Class 77-A, aren't you?

14
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
Your name's Chiaki
Nanami, Gamer Girl.

15
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,958
Wh-Why do you know that stuff?

16
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,416
[ENOSHIMA]
Hmm...

17
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,458
Because I wanted to
meet your ass!

18
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,666
Getting this kind of attention
from an upperclassman is crazy!

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,416
You takin' the time to come
down here? I can't believe it!

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,041
Am I free to go?

21
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,333
Now you're just gonna
watch a little movie.

22
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,041
It's gonna blow
your mind. Promise!

23
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,500
[YUKIZOME]
Heads up, Nanami!

24
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,791
[ENOSHIMA]
Jeebus!

25
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,833
You can't hit me with detention
like a normal teacher?

26
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,541
[NANAMI]
Miss Yukizome!

27
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,833
Take Komaeda and get to safety.

28
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,375
--What about you?
--Do as I say, dammit!

29
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,833
[ENOSHIMA]
Hmm...

30
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,125
Just leave this to me.

31
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,250
Whether you're in class or not,
I'm still your teacher.

32
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,958
[YUKIZOME] I think you could've
stopped them if you'd wanted to.

33
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,625
[ENOSHIMA]
Gee, ya think?

34
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,666
But who cares about them?
I got bigger game in mind!

35
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,541
Cut to the chase. Who are you?

36
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,625
Who, me? No one special.

37
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm Super High School-Level
Despair, Junko Enoshima!

38
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,625
The girl who's gonna kick this
planet right in the teeth!

39
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,125
An' this is the one-and-only
Super High School-Level Hope.

40
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,416
Kamukura here's a big deal.

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,458
His name is Kamukura?
But that--

42
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,666
I've got a hunch you've been
looking for ol' Red-Eyes

43
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,000
for a while now.

44
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,708
Such a touching reunion
to end things on.

45
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,208
[YUKIZOME]
The end of what?

46
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,458
[ENOSHIMA]
You!

47
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,375
I probably should've led
with this, but whatever!

48
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
After today, you and
your students' minds

49
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,416
will be totally revamped!

50
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,583
[gasps]

51
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,083
In fact, I won't even
have to hunt 'em down!

52
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,291
Those cinnamon rolls
can't resist the urge

53
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,375
to save their teacher!

54
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,541
I can't believe Komaeda
got captured!

55
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,583
And what if that chick
wasn't Tsumiki?

56
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,916
Maybe it was another
bandage-covered school girl.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
[NANAMI]
Everyone!

58
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:41,041
There's no time to waste!
Miss Yukizome's in trouble!

59
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,541
Oh yeah.

60
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,250
They're gonna trot right in
like lambs to the slaughter.

61
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,208
And after I scrape
out all their Hope,

62
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,416
I'll pack 'em full of Despair
like sausage casings!

63
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,583
You mean to tell us that
she's there with that maniac?

64
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,666
[NANAMI]
Yeah!

65
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,375
We need to go save
her right away!

66
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,791
Oh, it's on!

67
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:58,958
I'm gonna make that chick

68
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,291
my Super High School-Level
Punching Bag!

69
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,666
[TANAKA]
Hm.

70
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,041
At last, the time to use
my eldritch powers is nigh.

71
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,291
[ENOSHIMA] Your class was the
very personification of Hope.

72
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,458
Flipping the script is
gonna be such a coup.

73
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,083
They'll join Kamukura
in a new homeroom.

74
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,625
And by their powers combined,

75
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,291
the world will
smother in Despair!

76
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,666
Thank you so much, you guys!

77
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,833
[TSUMIKI] W-We wanna help
save Miss Yukizome, too!

[SODA]
Tsumiki!

79
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,958
What happened to Peko?

80
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,166
How come she looks
all beat to hell?

81
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,708
Please, sir. You need to run.

82
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,708
No. They'll never
agree to help you!

Cute that you think
they're getting a choice.

84
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,041
Your students are gonna be

85

my Super High
School-Level Despairs

no matter how they
feel about the matter.

87
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,375
And I know this for a fact
'cause I got something in mind

00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,041
that'll drive 'em
clean outta theirs!

89
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,791
Spoilers, it starts with a "B"

90
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,833
and it rhymes with
"brainwashing"!

91
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,541
Brainwashing?

92
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,958
Sho' 'nuff!

93
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,958
And just in case you doubt
my ability to pull it off!

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Be a doll and show Miss Yukizome
what you learned today.

00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:13,250
Stop it. Please! I--!

I don't wanna do this,
but I don't have a choice!

98
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,333
No! It hurts! God!
It hurts so bad!

99
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,916
I can feel everything!

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,250
Stop! Make it stop!

101
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,166
I'm killing myself! Why am
I killing myself? Oh, god!

And the pisser is,

your students will feel even
more hopeless than him.

In the name of almighty Despair,

106
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,500
they'll mangle their own bodies
at the snap of my fingers.

107
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,208
They'll kill everyone
they've ever loved

108
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,208
with nary a second thought.

109
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,083
My Super High
School-Level Despairs

110

will have the power to
corrupt the whole world!

Not if you wanna live.

You're elites.

You've been praised your
whole life for being the best.

But you, you can't
hope to defeat them.

121
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:30,083
The depths of their Despair...
it's unfathomable.

122
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:34,416
Challenging them isn't heroic,
it's a suicide mission.

123

off before we even try?

scary this chick is.

around like that!

Understand, I'm only telling
you this for your own good.

You saw what they
could do, Nanami.

The only mort I wanna

We're all Super High
School-Level at something.

00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,250
Maybe it means you
have talent to burn,

140
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,500
but you have to know
when to cut your losses.

You're all... okay
with abandoning her?

144
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,458
Miss Yukizome would come
save us in a heartbeat!

145
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,500
[NANAMI]
If she hadn't been there for me,

146
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,833
I'd be sitting somewhere
by myself right now.

147
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:46,208
I never would've gotten
to know any of you.

148
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,708
Video games with a big
group are so much fun.

149
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,541
I never would've learned that.

Through the good times,
and the sad times,

151

she was there with us.

152
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:04,250
Maybe I'm not strong enough to
save her, but I'm gonna try!

153

You're pretty persuasive
for weighing, like, nothin'.

Bad-ass chicks gotta
stick together!

155

Narrowly dodgin' death
would be quite the aperitif!

All for one, right?

158
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,750
[TANAKA] A Warrior of the Void
who abandons his mentor

159
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,166
is unworthy of his dark calling.

160
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,208
I'll go, as well.

161
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,083
I am not what I seem. But...

162
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,583
I'm still one of you.

163
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,625
What the hell, dude?

164
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,125
[IMPOSTOR]
The one you call Mitarai

165
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,250
is nothing more than a Super
High School-Level Impostor.

166
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,166
I used his identity since
I lack one of my own.

167
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,958
But if you're just a fake,

168
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,166
whatever happened
to the real Mitarai?

169
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,250
[IMPOSTOR]
He must've been captured

170
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,583
by that she-devil Enoshima.

171
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,166
He let me be him.

172
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,416
The least I can do is try to
keep him alive as a thank you.

173
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,166
[KOMAEDA chuckles]

174
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,583
I knew you'd make
the right choice.

175
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,333
I never doubted
you'd pass the test.

176
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:01,500
Their Despair is great, but
I'm sure you all can persevere.

177
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,750
For you tread the path of Hope.

178
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,458
Jeez. If I wanted a riddle,
I'd eat a fortune cookie.

179
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,833
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,916
But I needed you to believe
in yourselves like I do.

181
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,166
Now then, let's go.

182
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,708
Komaeda! You can do it!
Be strong!

183
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,083
Making his way back here
probably took everything he had.

184
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,166
Soda, I hereby order you
to carry him on your back!

Roger! If it makes you
happy, Your Highness,

186
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,666
I'll carry him to
the edge of infinity!

187
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,875
I, uh, don't see how bringing
an unconscious person will help.

188
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,833
Courage! Fate has
guided us here.

189
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,625
And we must face the
coming dark united.

190
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,958
Okay.

191
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,500
All right!

[MUNAKATA]
No word from Yukizome?

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,958
Well, it is during class.

199
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,333

[MUNAKATA]
Noted.

Junko Enoshima was the first
to discover the bodies

202
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,833
in School Building 1A.

203
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,041
I need to know
what she's hiding.

204
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,916
She behind all this?

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,041
Yes. All the evidence on
hand points directly to her.

206
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:34,250
Enoshima's guilt in these
murders is a near certainty.

207
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,041
Get ready for an interrogation.

I'll drag 'er in by
the damn pigtails.

didn't hear you say that.

00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,750
Because I... loved anime.

316
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:25,333
[MITARAI coughing]

317
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,166
[MITARAI]
Why am I... running away?

318
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,500
Why didn't I try to fight back?

319
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,625
Why am I useless?

320
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,833
Dammit, Mitarai, get up!

321
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,208
Be brave, just this once!

322
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:10,125
[MITARAI] I can't.
I'm nothing but a weakling.

323
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,000
[JUZO] Your flunkies,
they seem a little out of it.

324
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,458
Yep. Guilty as charged.

325
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,916
Munakata had your number.

326
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,583
So you were behind
all those students

327
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,250
killing each other off, huh?

328
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,333
Y'just figure that
out, Sherlock?

329
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,500
Give the man a cigar!

330
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,166
You got a smart mouth.

331
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,708
But it's gonna be down
a couple teeth in a sec.

332
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,875
Now, I'm 'bout to get all
kinds of unchivalrous!

333
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,750
[NANAMI]
Stay alert, you guys!

334
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,250
[KOIZUMI] We'll be fine.
We're here as a group.

335
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,291
[SONIA] What about Tanaka and
Nidai? They're all alone.

336
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,750
Don't worry about the big guy,
he can handle 'em.

337
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,458
Hell, he's prob'ly
knocked half of 'em out

338
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,166
and's makin' the other half
run wind-sprints by now.

339
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,083
And Tanaka's no slouch.
He gets it done in the clutch!

340
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,458
You're right, Soda.

341
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,833
He is a very capable
young man, isn't he?

342
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,541
Ugh. Way to talk up your
romantic rival, dumb-ass!

343
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,083
Anyone think Enoshima and
Hope's Peak are in cahoots?

344
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,708
Odd havin' her lair
hidden underneath

345
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,791
the statue of the
school's founder.

346
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,083
I just hope our
teacher's okay, yo.

347
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,166
For now, let's all focus
on doing what we can.

348
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,416
It's weird, but there's this
feeling in my stomach.

349
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,000
Like there's still time to get
the best ending in this RPG.

350
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,250
There's nothing to base it on,

351
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,750
but when you talk like
that, I believe you.

352
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,166
Hope I'm right then.

353
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,500
To be honest,
it was just a hunch.

354
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,333
You okay?

355
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,708
Can we talk alone
for a moment?

356
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,458
[NANAMI]
Uh...

357
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,375
You're kind of a
puzzle to me, Nanami,

358
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,750
did you know that?

359
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,000
You always used to be so
quiet and withdrawn before,

360
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,333
but then you perked up

361
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,625
and became the center
of the class's attention.

362
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,083
No. I mean, I talk
more than I used to.

363
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,458
You even serve as our
class representative.

364
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:09,958
You're the glue that holds our
classroom together, Nanami.

365
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,125
Tsumiki, what's up?

366
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,000
Please forgive me for this.

367
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,083
Huh?

368
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,208
Sorry!

369
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,000
[NANAMI screams]

370
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,666
[YUKIZOME]
Nanami! Please, wake up!

371
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,958
I need to know that you're okay!

372
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,583
Thank goodness.

373
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,083
Miss Yukizome!
What are you doing here?

374
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,833
[YUKIZOME] After you ran,
that long-haired boy let me go.

375
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,250
I don't think he's our enemy.

376
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:43,916
[NANAMI]
Huh?

377
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,125
[YUKIZOME]
Anyway.

378
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,875
What are you doing here,
and alone, no less?

379
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,375
But I wasn't alone!

380
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,291
The whole class came back
with me so we could save you.

381
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,000
Tsumiki pushed me and--

382
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,458
We need to find the
others right away.

383
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,666
They can't save themselves,
but we can.
