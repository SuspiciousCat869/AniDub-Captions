Do you smell yourself?

Hey, get a picture of 'em!

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,375
[BULLY A] Aw, is the
garbage baby gonna cwy?

8
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,333
[BULLY B] Stop nerding up
our school already!

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,125
[MITARAI'S MOTHER] They bullied
him again so he came home.

10
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,666
What if he stops going
to school altogether?

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,958
[MITARAI'S FATHER] Look, I leave
the school stuff up to you.

12
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,208
[MITARAI'S MOTHER] God,
you're like a broken record,

13
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,541
you know that?

14
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,041
Whenever there's a problem,
you just check out!

15
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,666
He's as much your son
as he is mine!

16
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,666
[MITARAI]
So much left to do.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,791
Every frame needs to pop.

18
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:55,083
That takes time.
Time I don't have.

19
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,666
Don't you dare stop!
The world needs this!

20
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,125
[YUKIZOME]
Here we are, self.

21
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,208
Our first day as a
Reserve Course teacher.

22
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,333
Come on.

23
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,000
[YUKIZOME] I'd give you
all the gory details

24
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,083
about my six months with
the Reserve Course,

25
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,583
but we'd be here all day.

26
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,125
The short version:
It sucked, big time.

27
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,458
The loss of my class!
The shame of exile!

28
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,166
Dark days and darker nights!

29
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,458
The embers of hope barely
aflicker in my heart!

30
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,166
Bending my every thought
to the redemption

31
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,000
that might forever
elude my grasp!

32
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,833
Oh, the humanity!

33
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,791
Yeah, for half a year.

34
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,208
[YUKIZOME]
March already, huh?

35
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,458
Time really does fly by.

36
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,333
[YUKIZOME] Thankfully, my
banishment to the Reserve Course

37
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,208
was coming to an end.

38
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,625
[JUZO]
Hey there, stranger.

39
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,041
About damn time they
brought you back.

40
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,250
[YUKIZOME] Sounds like somebody
was kinda worried about me.

41
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,916
Maybe a little bit.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,250
So tell me,

43
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,541
what'd you dig up while
you were stuck over there?

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,833
[YUKIZOME]
Funny you should ask that.

45
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,000
Um, how tough would it be

46
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,625
to lift a Hope's Peak ID card
off one of the trustees?

47
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,458
Pretty freakin' tough.

48
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,708
The principal puts on
a good game face,

49
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,041
but they're the ones
running the show.

50
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:07,500
If I get caught,
they'll fire me. Or worse.

51
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,958
Have you ever heard of a thing
called the Kamukura Project?

52
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,166
I can't say it rings a bell.

53
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,875
[YUKIZOME] It's some
secret plan the principal

54
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,833
and board of trustees
have set into motion.

55
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,458
You know how Reserve Course
tuitions are sky high?

56
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,916
Turns out this thing is where
most of that money ends up.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,708
The name's a red flag, too.

58
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,291
"Kamukura" refers
to Izuru Kamukura,

59
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,000
Hope's Peak's founder.

60
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,083
They wouldn't pin his name
to something mundane,

61
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,416
so whatever it is, it's big.

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,875
Look.

63
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,708
The only way to dig any deeper
is with an ID in hand.

64
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,041
Without it, we're
dead in the water.

65
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,041
When Munakata gives you a job,
you really don't mess around.

66
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, you're as loyal
as I am. 'Fess up!

67
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,583
Tch!

68
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,666
By the way, do you remember
that boy you beat up?

69
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,333
[JUZO]
Huh? Which one?

70
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,541
Hinata, from the
Reserve Course,

71
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,500
you caught him
trying to trespass.

72
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,750
[JUZO]
Yeah, him. Why?

73
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,125
Is he connected to your
investigation somehow?

74
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,791
[YUKIZOME] Back when I was
first hearing whispers

75
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,041
about the Kamukura Project,

76
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,500
I found out he'd been expelled.

77
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,083
[YUKIZOME]
Huh?

78
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,833
So I... I can return to
my first group of kids?

79
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,000
No one ever doubted your talent.

80
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,416
It'd be a waste to leave you
in the Reserve Course.

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,625
Starting today, you're their
official homeroom teacher.

82
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you, sir!
I've missed them so much!

83
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,208
I told ya she's tear up.
Typical Chisa.

84
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,333
Honestly, I should've taken
the blame for that bomb thing.

85
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,416
So, you're gonna focus
on scouting full-time

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,458
from now on, right?

87
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,791
Yeah. I'm way better
at that anyhow.

88
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,666
That class is all yours.

89
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,250
And see to it that your students
don't make the news again.

90
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,583
Hey, uh,

91
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,208
I don't suppose you've had
any luck reaching Komaeda.

92
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,541
No pun intended.

93
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,750
If I know that kid, probably
entered some contest

94
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,541
and won a cruise
'round the world.

95
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,958
That's unfortunate.

96
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,375
Yeah. 'Specially for
our esteemed principal here.

97
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,625
He's been trying to lift
that suspension for a while.

98
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,708
That is so kind of you!

99
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,875
Thank you. But we still
don't have a timeline for it.

100
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,458
Uh, I'm sorry.

101
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,375
I'll come right back here
if you need me to,

102
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,291
but could I go see
my students for a bit?

103
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,250
Of course. Go crazy.

104
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,416
'Kay!

105
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,166
[KIZAKURA chuckles]

106
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,958
Look at 'er. All idealistic.

107
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,416
We need to prep the
entrance ceremony.

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,750
There's still plenty to do.

109
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,500
This year's bumper crop
made for multiple classes.

110
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,583
Next year is kinda slim
pickings by comparison.

111
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,958
[JIN] Blame it on the
talent scout, I guess.

112
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,041
Duly noted.

113
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,208
For whatever it's worth,

114
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,666
the few I got are absolute
top of the heap.

115
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,666
Trust me, you're not gonna sweat
an empty desk here or there.

116
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,250
We shall see.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,333
I'm just that rookie teacher

118
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,208
who got busted down
to the Reserve Course.

119
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,458
They've probably
forgotten all about me.

120
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,125
You've got this!

121
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,000
If I let something
like this beat me,

122
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,125
Kyosuke will think I'm an idiot!

123

Now, as Kyosuke's
future beloved,

124
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,750
I shouldn't give him
any reason to...

125
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,541
Oh my gosh! Did I
say that out loud?

Yeah! Get hype!

You were gone for so long.
I hope that you've been well.

Yes. Thanks.

Grab a plate and go nuts!

140
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,000
I was hardcore pining for
your return all these months.

141

Don't tell me you're

No. I mean. I'm glad
to be back. Honestly.

I just thought that maybe
you forgot about me,

Don't you dare sell
yourself short!

you earlier.

316
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,333
Making sense of all this
is the least I can do.

317
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,041
Feel free to be vague!

318
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,125
Or if you don't wanna tell
me anything, that's okay!

319
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,666
[OTHER MITARAI]
Here's what happened.

320
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,541
It was back around the
start of the school year.

321
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,083
I'd be hanging out
in my room alone

322
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,750
and I'd hear these weird
noises out in the hall.

323
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,666
When did I...
eat something last?

324
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,583
Who're you?

325
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,666
That's the question, isn't it?

326
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,458
There's no proof that I
exist and I have no family.

327
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,500
[IMPOSTER] All I have in
this world is my ability

328
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,291
to pass as other people.

329
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,833
Comes in pretty handy.

330
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,208
I haven't lived as me in forever
now, and no one's the wiser.

331
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,625
That said, this one's got
an expiration date on it.

332
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,125
Clock's ticking.

333
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,666
We've never met before, but
I've done my homework on you.

334
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,291
[MITARAI]
What did you find out?

335
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,833
You're not what I'd call
a well-rounded person.

336
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,416
Animation is all you
give a damn about.

337
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,791
If it were an option,

338
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,375
you'd chain yourself to that
tablet and draw forever.

339
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,708
[MITARAI]
Uh, yeah. You're not wrong.

340
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:45,500
Every waking moment, I just
wanna make more anime.

341
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,750
[IMPOSTER] I could run
interference for you.

342
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,166
Take ol' Ryota Mitarai
out for a spin

343
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,583
and leave you free to create.

344
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,083
[IMPOSTER]
There was Mitarai,

345
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,416
who wanted to mothball
his existence for art.

346
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,125
And there was me, who
needed a makeover anyhow.

347
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,500
It seemed like a
good deal all around.

348
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,708
[IMPOSTER] So yeah,
now you know our secret.

349
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,000
What's the matter?

350
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,375
I've-- I've stumbled into
a secret conspiracy.

351
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,625
I've seen enough movies to know

352
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,375
this is the part
where you kill me!

353
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,708
[sighs]

354
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,291
No one's gonna kill you.

355
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,208
[TSUMIKI] Then is this the part
where I show how grateful I am?

356
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,666
[IMPOSTER]
Hm?

357
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,625
It's just... I've never done
this sort of thing before,

358
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,875
so you'll have to
be patient with me.

359
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,083
[IMPOSTER]
No need for that.

360
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,250
I know that I can
trust you, Tsumiki.

361
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,541
You just said... you trust me.

362
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,166
Thank you so much for telling
me that, whoever you are!

363
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,416
Really, it means...

364
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,541
I don't get why you're
so worked up over it.

365
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,375
That was the single nicest thing

366
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,875
anyone's said to me
in my whole entire life!

367
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,125
[crying]

368
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,250
As of tomorrow, you're a
bona fide upperclassman.

369
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,166
Have more faith in yourself.

370
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,000
[TSUMIKI]
O-Okay!

371
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,291
[NAEGI]
Wow.

372
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,708
So, Naegi. Are you ready?

373
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,166
Let's go!

374
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,333
[ENOSHIMA] "A fateful gust
of wind blew past.

375
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,458
In that moment, the pair who
would plunge the Academy,

376
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,500
and later the whole damn world,
into the depths of Despair...

377
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,541
...first laid eyes on the powder
keg they'd soon ignite."

378
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,875
That's impressive.

379
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,416
You've really taken to
narration, haven't you?

380
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,875
Well, I had. But now, done!

381
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,375
Drink it in, Mukuro!

382
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,166
This is where our lives are
truly gonna kick into gear!

383
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,416
[laughs]

384
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
[ENOSHIMA]
Man, I can't wait!

385
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,500
Maybe Fate will even drop
someone into my lap!

386
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,666
Turn off your brain
and fit into your slot.

387
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,541
Anything more is futile.

388
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,958
Be a good little dog and
take to the collar and leash.

389
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,500
If you're lucky, we'll throw
you the occasional bone.

390
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,708
[HINATA]
Well then, see you later.

391
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,250
[NANAMI]
Yeah! See ya tomorrow!

392
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,583
[HINATA]
Nanami.

393
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,041
I just...

394
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,000
Time to go.

395
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,083
[MAN A]
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

396
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,291
You may feel a tad out of sorts
when you regain consciousness.

397
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,083
But that will pass soon enough.

398
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,375
In exchange, you
become a young man

399
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,875
who embodies the lofty
ideals of this academy.

400
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,666
[HINATA]
I accept.

401
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,583
So I can live the
life I wanna lead.

402
00:21:55,666 --> 00:22:00,541
So that I can become
the hero of my own story.

403
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,166
So that I can hold my head high.

404
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,583
Next to her.
