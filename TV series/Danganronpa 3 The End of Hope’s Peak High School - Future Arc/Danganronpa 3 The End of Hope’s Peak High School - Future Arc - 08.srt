work as hard as she does.

who'd wanna bail on 'em?

For your information, this kind
of thing is right up my alley.

You spend so much
time putting it together.

building order out of chaos,

Allow me to present the specs
of our exciting current project.

133
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,041
To begin, as you so
observantly inferred,

134
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,250
the Mutual Killing
video is responsible

135
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,875
for Tsumiki's current
lapse in mental health.

136
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,541
However, having said that,

137
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,041
the scope of its impact
is rather, well...

I'm proposing we combine our
respective areas of expertise.

00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,166
Together we'll tap into an
exponentially larger demographic

than either one of us
could secure on our own,

145
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,958
which not only maximizes
product reach,

146
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,000
but will incentivize a
market paradigm shift.

[gasps]

161
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,958
[NANAMI]
No sign of her.

162
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,458
I'm starting to have a
bad feeling about this.

163
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,875
[KUZURYU] I sent some of my
guys by her house to check,

164
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,125
but no dice.

165
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,916
She hasn't come back yet.

166
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,625
Behold my Twelve
Zodiac Generals!

Alas! even they could find
no discernable trace!

168
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,916
Huh, 'magine that.

[ALL gasp]

170
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,750
Speak of the devil! Hey, girl!

171
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,958
[KOMAEDA]
Yeah, sorry.

172
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,458
Still a dude.

173
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,666
It's been a while.
I brought gifts!

174
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,041
Now isn't the time.

175
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,000
Who're you?

176
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,375
Good to have you back, Komaeda.

177
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:17,041
I apologize if no one seems
in the mood to celebrate.

178
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,416
Tsumiki's missing.
We're starting to worry.

179
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,958
Okay.

180
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,125
Tell me you've forgotten her
and I'll punch you in the mouth!

181
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,208
Wow, what a coincidence!

182
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,291
I spotted her on the way here.
In the West District.

183
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,625
[CLASS]
Huh?!

184
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,958
I'm gonna need you
to be absolutely sure.

185
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,750
I, uh, don't think I recall
you being such a hardcore guy.

186
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:45,291
[IMPOSTER] O-Oh. Sorry. I, uh,
got a little carried away.

187
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,083
I'm sure it was Tsumiki.

188
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,958
Should we go get her?

189
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,333
Yes. I want to know why
she hasn't been here.

190
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,083
We're owed an explanation.

191
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,333
[SODA]
Damn straight!

192
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,833
Told ya she was just bein'
a pain in the ass.

193
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,458
[KOMAEDA]
Hey, Pekoyama?

194
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,750
Yes? What?

195
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,916
We, uh, kinda need to talk.

196
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,708
No. No!

197
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,500
Your students need you to
push them over the hump,

198
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,250
so that's exactly
what you'll do!

199
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,333
Now's the time for youth
to charge forward,

banners waving in the air!

201
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,916
You can do it.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,750
Good morning, class!

[YUKIZOME]
What were they thinking?

205
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,791
I expressly said
not to go outside!

206
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:56,750
[STUDENTS shouting]

207

[PROTESTER F] We're takin'
the future into our own hands!

Damn it! Punks!

210
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,500
What the hell are you
trying to prove?

211
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,250
[MUNAKATA] Looks like
you could use some help.

212
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Munakata.

213
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,291
This certainly swarmed out of
proportion to our expectations.

214
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,625
[JUZO]
It's my fault.

215
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,583
No. This falls squarely on me.

216
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,875
I made the two of you bite off
more than you could chew.

217
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,625
I put you at risk.

218
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,958
Feels a tad out of character
for you to say that.

219
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,791
Call Yukizome.

220
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,041
Have her join us when
this is under control.

221
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,416
Sure. Sounds like a plan.

222
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,333
[YUKIZOME]

Yeah, not the best way
to get an answer.

she's hiding in the cafeteria?

Maybe?

She's definitely not here.

Hold on.

[KOMAEDA] Why put a statue

Whoa.

We found a secret passage. Cool.
I really am super lucky, huh?

Wait, you didn't
know it was here?

00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,500
Not a clue.

263

Total chance. That's my thing.

264
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,125
[NANAMI]
I guess the real question is,

265
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,708
what would a school need
with something like this?

266
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,916
Right?

267
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,958
Well my guess is
someone's doing something

268
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,708
they don't want anybody
else to know about.

269
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,708
Yeah, but what would a
school have to keep secret?

270
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,291
Could be anything.
Human experimentation?

271

Mitarai? Is that you?

272

You've lost weight.

Better yet, how's an outsider
know about this place?

never be in a position

to tell anyone where
that luck brought you.

backup from Mukuro Ikusaba,

I wouldn't.

So, my little horseshoe,
what do you know?

Why are you following me?

[PEKOYAMA] Someone asked me
to keep my eyes peeled.

298
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,625
Specifically for what
you were up to.

Ah. You and he must be
close then, I take it.

Enough. Tell me what's going on.

Only thing I can say
is I'm being stalked.

00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,958
Which pisses me off!

Hmph.

You've done this before.

So have you.

I'm sure you understand.

See, I'm that kinda guy.
Whatever it takes, I'm in.

I happened to pick
this piece up overseas.

00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,000
No idea it'd ever
come in so handy.

319
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,875
Wait! Stop! You can't do this!

320
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,208
You can't just kill another
human being! It's wrong!

321
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,500
It's not that I
disagree, class rep,

322
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:45,708
but sometimes, very rarely,
two wrongs can make a right.

323
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,416
[ENOSHIMA]
Huh?

324
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,583
At the end of the day,

325
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,291
Despair is just a
stepping stone to Hope.

326
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:56,166
Sometimes... you gotta put
all your weight into it.

327
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,166
Oh yeah?

328
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,166
[KOMAEDA]
I wanted to test myself,

329
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,125
see if I have what
it takes to kill you.

330
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,000
But let's be real for a second,

331
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,250
that's a pretty damn
big step, right?

332
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,833
It's not as simple
as just putting

333
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,416
one foot in front
of the other, oh no.

334
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,375
This only means something if
you're the epitome of Despair.

335
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,750
You may be the biggest
Hope fanboy I've ever met.

336
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,083
I'd be laughing if
it weren't so sad.

337
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,416
[KOMAEDA]
With any luck,

338
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,375
I'll make a hash of it
and you'll get out alive.

339
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,833
Maybe you'll go on to become
an even bigger stepping stone

340
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,166
for someone else.

341
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,208
[gasps]

342
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,708
[KOMAEDA]
Who are you?

343
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,416
[gasps]

344
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,666
Oh, crap! Why you gotta jam?

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,833
Good luck, is it?
Well, I have that too.

346
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,625
[NANAMI]
Komaeda, no!

347
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,666
Hang in there!
We'll get you some help!

348
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,791
Stay with me!

349
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,166
[MITARAI screaming]

350
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,916
[NANAMI]
Please be okay.

351
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,833
[NANAMI]
The student handbook?

352
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,458
[NANAMI]
Komaeda!

353
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,958
[HINATA]
Fortune smiles on him.

354
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,000
[ENOSHIMA]
You, sir, do not disappoint!

355
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,416
[ENOSHIMA chuckles]

356
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:47,333
[YUKIZOME]
Tsumiki! Children!

357
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,458
Give me a break. Where the
dickens could they have gone?

358
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,625
I am so sorry!
Are you all right?

359
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,250
Mitarai? Have you lost weight?

360
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,958
Help me, please!
You've gotta save her!

361
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,833
They're g-- They're
gonna kill Nanami!

362
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,250
Hey, calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.

363
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,000
Just tell me where she is.

364
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,916
I'd show you, except,
I can't do anything.

365
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,375
I'm just a stupid animator.

366
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,791
Only thing I'm good
at is drawin' stuff.

367
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,208
[YUKIZOME]
There, there, now.

368
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,666
Look, it's my job to
protect her, not yours.

369
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,916
So, deep breath.

370
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,666
When I'm back, I wanna
see some of your work.

371
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,208
[MITARAI]
You mean... my anime?

372
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,416
Yes.

373
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,333
Now tell me where to go.

374
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,000
[YUKIZOME]
I have a bad feeling about this.

375
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,208
What am I gonna to do?

376
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,500
I'm a Super High
School-Level Housekeeper.

377
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,708
Still, something's
brought me here.

378
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,125
I'm in the right place at
the right time far too often

379
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,291
for it to be a coincidence.

380
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:53,416
Maybe... this is the big one.

381
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,333
Forgive me, Kyosuke. I have to.

382
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,416
[NANAMI]
Is that you... Hinata?
