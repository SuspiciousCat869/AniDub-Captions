And, of course,

[YUKIZOME]
No excuses.

319
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,791
Get out here, pronto!
Chop chop, Mitarai!

320
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,291
Time to make my
daring escape!

321
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,541
Wait, what?

322
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,083
Weren't you at the front
door just now? H-How?

323
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,458
Funny how that works.

324
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,208
Moral of the story?
Don't try to ditch your teacher.

325
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,250
[MITARAI] I don't wanna
wait for the Blu-Ray!

326
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,291
If you take me away now,
I'll miss the broadcast!

327
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,875
So! One more student to catch,
and my work here is done!

328
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,458
[HINATA'S CLASSMATE A]
He has no talent.

329
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,875
[HINATA'S CLASSMATE C]
His parents are stupid, too.

330
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,416
[HINATA'S CLASSMATE D]
You can just pay your way in.

331
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,083
[HINATA'S CLASSMATE E] They
want him to succeed that much?

332
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,708
Uh. Are you... okay?

333
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,000
[NANAMI]
Uh-huh.

334
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,958
[HINATA]
<i>Gala Omega</i> , right?

335
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,000
Uh?

336
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,291
So you know it?

337
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,416
You're the first, like, ever!

338
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,250
[HINATA]
Uh. Yeah?

339
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,166
It's a classic, don't you agree?

340
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,583
There's nothing else like
it in the whole genre!

341
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,958
Yeah, classic!

342
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,250
I New Game Plussed it
five times in a row once.

343
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,083
[NANAMI]
Are you serious?

344
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,666
Yes! Cross my heart!

345
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,458
I know how tough that is.
I did ten in a row once.

346
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,958
That blows mine
out of the water.

347
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,000
It's just, I've
never met anybody

348
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,041
who could play games
as much as me before.

349
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,500
Someday, I wanna see your
very best run, all right?

350
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,708
Sure. You got it.

351
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,708
[YUKIZOME]
Oh, there you are!

352
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,916
[MITARAI grunting]

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,166
You must be Nanami!
Pleasure to meet'cha!

354
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,250
Huh?

355
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,666
You can call me Chisa Yukizome!

356
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,625
As of today, I'm your
new homeroom teacher.

357
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,458
So who's with me?

358
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,375
Huh? That uniform.

359
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,750
Are you in the
Reserve Course?

360
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,041
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,125
What's the Reserve Course?

362
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,791
You haven't heard of it?

363
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,833
They only just rolled
it out last year.

364
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,583
It's an academic track
for regular students.

365
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,083
But those kids pay through
the nose for enrollment.

366
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,625
I get it.

367
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,458
[MITARAI]
Uh.

368
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,250
--[MITARAI screams]
--[YUKIZOME growls]

369
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,875
You're not gettin'
away that easily!

370
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,250
[MITARAI] Whoa! Time out!
I can't run that fast!

371
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,250
Ah!

372
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,833
Did you just throw
a sword at me?

373
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,583
[YUKIZOME] Oh, you're fine!
I didn't hit anything important!

374
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,708
Y'know, for being enrolled
in the Main Course,

375
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,958
that guy's kind of a mess.

376
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,958
I thought they'd
be way more elite.

377
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,125
But--

378
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:55,625
Quirks aside, all you guys have
incredible talents, don't ya?

379
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,833
Must be nice... being
good at something.

380
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,416
[NANAMI] Whether you
have a talent or not,

381
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
there's no point getting
so hung up over it.

382
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,708
[HINATA]
Huh?

383
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,041
I mean, it's not like
the be-all, end-all.

384
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,083
Yeah, but...

385
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,208
You have greater
freedom than we do.

386
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,666
All I have is a pile
of video games.

387
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,833
Somebody like you
can go anywhere,

388
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,250
and do whatever they
want with their life.

389
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,250
[YUKIZOME]
Sorry 'bout that!

390
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,166
[MITARAI yelling]

391
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,333
[YUKIZOME]
Come on, you.

392
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,000
Let's get to class.

393
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,333
Sorry to drag her away out
of left field like this.

394
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,208
Hey. You do what you gotta.

395
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,958
She's not gonna put down
that handheld willingly, huh?

396
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,375
Ups-a-daisy!

397
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,000
Well then, I guess
I'll see you around!

398
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,500
Uh, okay.

399
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,916
[YUKIZOME] Right on!
I caught the whole class!

400
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,375
[chuckles]

401
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,250
[HINATA] I've got more
freedom than the elites.

402
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,083
Huh.

403
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,291
[YUKIZOME]
Just look at you all,

404
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,458
sitting there in your
tidy little rows!

405
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,833
Also, good job!

406
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,000
The room looks
absolutely immaculate!

407
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,500
I can be kind of a bad-ass
when I give half a damn.

408
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,708
Cleaning is the one
thing I'm pretty good at.

409
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,125
Ugh! I'm so tired,
I think I'm gonna die!

410
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,375
But you literally did nothing!

411
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Great!

412
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,166
And we'll pick up here tomorrow!

413
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,000
That is quite the presumption.

414
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,250
So long as one focuses
on their talent,

415
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,083
I heard we were free to
skip class as we deem fit.

416
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,500
[OWARI]
Freak-face is right!

417
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,041
Sittin' here is hell
on my glutes!

418
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,458
[MIODA] Lemme destroy the music
room, Teach! Everybody wins!

419
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,916
Technically, yes.

420
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,166
The rules say you can leave
whenever you want, but...

421
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,625
...there's more to life than
being good at something.

422
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,791
This time with your classmates
will build character.

423
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,833
Think of the memories
you'll make!

424
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,458
Just this once, let's put
something else front and center.

425
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,791
Like your hope.

426
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,208
Our hope?

427
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,958
That would be amazing!

428
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,083
[SONIA] Hardly! This is
all part of growing up!

429
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,666
[SODA]
Right you are, Princess!

430
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,125
[SAIONJI] Huh? Way to stick to
your guns there, grease-monkey!

431
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,166
[NIDAI] I think this new
plan is the shit, guys!

432
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,625
[TSUMIKI]
Me, too!

433
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,375
In that case, I'll round you
up again bright and early!

434
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,375
[CLASS]
Huh?

435
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,125
Thanks to all your help,
I survived day one.

436
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,416
Glad to hear it.
That's excellent news.

437
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,458
[YUKIZOME] So how are
things going on your end?

438
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,541
Will you be okay out
there without me?

439
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,958
[MUNAKATA] It's almost a letdown
how well things are proceeding.

440
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,666
Opening another Hope's
Peak Academy overseas,

441
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,208
hard to believe it's
finally coming to pass.

442
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,500
[MUNAKATA]
You thought it impossible?

443
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,666
Maybe so for a man
possessed of less resolve.

444
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,375
I'm made of sterner stuff.

445
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,875
[YUKIZOME] Aye-aye, my former
Super High School-Level

446
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,583
Student Council President.

447
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,666
Don't push yourself too hard.

448
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,125
You always did have a
tendency to overdo things.

449
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,916
[YUKIZOME]
Hey, Kyosuke.

450
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,583
Truth is, I really am grateful
to Hope's Peak High.

451
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,666
If I hadn't gone here,
we never would have met!

452
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,458
[MUNAKATA]
What brought this on?

453
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,500
[YUKIZOME]
Oh, nothing.
