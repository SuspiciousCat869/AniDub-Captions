up the pace, 'kay?

I'm sorry, Miss, but are
we going the right way?

a while to get there.

You're imagining things.

We really don't have
much farther to go.

C'mon. Everyone's waiting.

to see their beloved class rep

preoccupied, do you?

Sad-face.

Ah, the world is cruel.

Adding insult to injury.

The apple of his eye is enamored
with his friend. The shame!

Woe betide him for wanting
what society won't let him have!

Why must love be such torture?

Surely 'tis better to have
never known its sting!

it's so powerful.

but for now we call it
the "Video of Despair!"

I don't know what
you're talking about.

[ENOSHIMA]
Oh, come on!

162
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,625
Don't tell me you

00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay, look, think

You watch, you cave.

166
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,833
So now there's a 15 car pile-up

167
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,666
on Miss Yukizome's
synaptic superhighway.

168

How could you do that?

169

[ENOSHIMA] We're still grinding
through the prototype phase,

but the final product is
right around the corner.

171

Just needs a little more,

172
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,291
well, the technical term
is unmitigated Despair.

Tough to find.

174

But, I heard of you and
a light bulb came on.

Oh yes. You're just what
my video's been missing.

You're gonna raise it
to the level of art!

[IMPOSTOR] No sign of
Miss Yukizome or Enoshima.

we're s'posed to be?

She's already reached the
midpoint of my Death Dungeon.

Your friends are waiting
for you at the finish line!

I've heard stories, y'know?

When it's gone, you'll have

Despair needs a springboard.

The grisly death of Hope
seems like the natural choice.

you were gonna save Nanami!

Oh god. This is it.

317
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:52,416
I wanted to help you.
I really did.

318
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,458
I'm sorry. I--

319
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,500
With death so close at hand,

320
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,083
you would still dedicate
yourself to helping others?

321
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,000
It's what I do.

322
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,916
My classmates... are my life.

323
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,958
I... I love them all.

324
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,041
[NANAMI]
No.

325
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,250
I'm not... I'm not ready to go.

326
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,458
I-I had so much
left to do and...

327
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,250
...I thought there'd
be enough time.

328
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:36,541
My classmates... need someone
to stand up and protect them.

329
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:43,041
[NANAMI]
Please. Just one more game.

330
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,041
One more round.

331
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:52,625
We-We had so much fun, right?
