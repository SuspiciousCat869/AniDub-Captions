How I influence
my viewer's brain.

Uh!

[MITARAI]
Tsumiki?

159
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,083
[ENOSHIMA]
Well, fancy that.

160
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,583
I figured she was
just some rando.

Thank goodness!

They-- They didn't
hurt you, did they?

00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,541
No, I'm fine.

164
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,791
[TSUMIKI]
I was so worried, Mitarai.

165
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,291
Why on earth do they have
you locked away here?

166
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,958
[MITARAI] They, uh, gave me
a new work-space, that's all.

167
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,250
Ah...

168

I'm sorry.

171
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:42,750
I get so damn emotional.
What a heartfelt reunion.

172
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,916
That's okay. But who are you?

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,708
[ENOSHIMA] One of Mitarai's
anime friends, naturally.

174
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,083
Boom!

175
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,833
Let's celebrate you cuh-razy
kids finding each other

176
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,041
by watching Mitarai's
masterpiece!

177
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,333
Cue up that bad-boy, dude!

178
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,291
We're not gettin'
any younger here!

[TSUMIKI crying]

[MUKURO]
Having already watched it once,

183
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,750
Junko was able to analyze
it this time through.

184
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,916
Her mind can parse any
information in a flash.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,875
That trait, is my sister's
most formidable skill.

186
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,750
Did an animal die
in your mouth?

187
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,791
[MUKURO]
Huh?

188
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,416
[ENOSHIMA]
Hmm. I got this on lock.

189
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,250
Hey! What time've you got?

190
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,416
[MUKURO]
Uh, 6:50, give or take a minute.

191
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,416
Oh, man, how did the day
get away from me like that?

192
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,166
And why does your breath
smell like a hot stockyard?

193
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,291
So, we gotta go,
but you have fun!

194
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,875
Have Mitarai give you
the ol' mouse-pad

195
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,000
or body pillow treatment!

196
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,458
It'll perk ya up! Bye!

[MITARAI]
Uhh?

198

[ENOSHIMA]
Oh, Kamukura!

199
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,375
Feel like going... on a date?

201

[HINATA] I hope you have
a compelling reason

202
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,541
for dragging me
out here like this.

203
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,625
Oh, I do!

204
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,041
There's something
I wanna show you,

205
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,916
something oh-so-special to me.

206
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,375
I'd get quite the reputation

if you told anyone
about this though.

208
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,458
I want this to be perfect.
I've been so worried about it.

209
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,666
I've barely gotten
a wink of sleep!

210
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,500
Or--

211
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,958
I just made that up!

212
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,875
Boy, I'm a hooker for innuendo
at inappropriate times!

213
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,583
We're out here so I can show
you the wonder of Despair

00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,208
on an epic scale!

[STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBER A]
You! Talk!

I don't know where you
get off threatening us,

but it's not gonna to work!

[STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBER M]
Th-That video... was it real?

219
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,000
Why'd we have to hold
this dumb meeting so late?

220
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,916
This is not at all
how we operate.

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,708
Student council members,

222
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,541
in accordance with
my sister's will,

223
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,416
you will now murder each other.

224

[STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBER B]
Huh?!

225
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,375
Are you crazy?! Why the hell
would we do something like that?

226
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,458
That's enough! It's essential
that we all remain calm!

227
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,875

to panic here--

[MUKURO] You have two options,
and only two options.

231
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,208
Attack your classmates
and hope for the best.

232
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,958
Or end up like
your friend there.

233

What's up? I'm your
host, Junko Enoshima!

234

I brought a little something to
help get this party started,

be way less kumbayah

once I pop these puppies open!

239
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,416
Show 'em what they've won!

240
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,625
Family secrets, hidden scandals,

00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,708
dirty money, sex,
lies, good stuff!

242

Each tape is weapons-grade
blackmail.

243

And you'll notice that I've got
one for every person here.

Gosh. Be a shame
if they got out.

None of us are going
to kill each other!

00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,875
We stand together through
thick and thin, right?

249
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah. He's right.
We're all friends!

250
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,000
And friends don't
abandon each other!

251

We're better than that!

252

You talk a big game about
meeting your end together.

253
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,500
But I know for a
fact you're gonna be

crap out of each other

[MUKURO]
Huh?

What if we all just run?

us, but the rest get to safety!

00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,583
[STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBER N] Don't
do it. Please, I'm begging you!

315
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,708
--No!

317
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,166
[STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBER E]
I did it.

318
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,041
Last man standing.

319
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,041
Them or me, right?

320
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,500

00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,250
[STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBER E]
You. You're with them, huh?

324
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,416
[HINATA] Even armed,
you will not survive this.

[ENOSHIMA laughs]

328
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,583
So, how did you
like the overture?

329
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,625
[ENOSHIMA]
Buddy.

330
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,166
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

331
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,416
Despair is gonna
rock your world.

332
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,166
Once we've had our second date,
this'll seem like nothing.

333
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,166
[YUKIZOME]
H'llo? Yukizome here.

334
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,500
Huh?

335
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,041
Whatever you do,

336
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,625
I need you to make sure the
students don't catch wind of it.

337
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,791
[JIN] This is not over!
I promise you that!

338
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,125
Damn it!

339
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,500
They're planning to
sweep it under the rug?

340
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,875
[JIN]
Those spineless cowards

341
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,583
are going to act as though
it never happened!

342
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,083
I wouldn't say it's the
most ethical choice,

343
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,208
but it might be the
best course of action.

344
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,041
[JIN]
Seriously?

345
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,625
Think of the project.

346
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:37,166
It was already inhumane enough
when everything went as planned.

347
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,208
If word of tonight's
massacre were to spread,

348
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,708
this academy would
cease to exist.

349
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,916
Covering this up is the only way
Hope's Peak survives the night.

350
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,916
We're as guilty as them.

351
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,833
[TENGAN] I've already
tendered my resignation.

352
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,166
Unofficially though,
I'll do what I can.

353
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,125
The choice, ultimately,
is yours to make.

354
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,250
What are we doing here?

355
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,166
[KIZAKURA]
You gotta try to calm down.

356
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,458
You're a logical guy so
flippin' tables won't help.

357
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:24,791
My daughter. Promise me you'll
look after her if... you know.

358
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,958
Huh?

359
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,291
[KIZAKURA]
I know what you're getting at.

360
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,333
Fine, I'll marry her.

361
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,375
Guess I'll have to live forever.

362
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,375
High time we let folks know

363
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,500
what's really going on
here at Hope's Peak High.

364
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,500
An' who better to start with

365
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,750
than the mediocre hacks
who are footing the bill

366
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,875
for all these shenanigans?

367
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,166
Sent!

368
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,916
[ENOSHIMA] "Hope's Peak High
School has been performing

369
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,375
unsanctioned human experiments.

370
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,750
In fact, these
experiments are funded

371
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,333
by your Reserve Course tuition.

372
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,166
And bleeding that cash
out of your parents

373
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,791
is the whole reason the Reserve
Course was implemented.

374
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,500
This behavior is
inexcusable on its own.

375
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,958
But it's not the worst thing
going on here by a long shot.

376
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,833
This very night, 14 academy
students were massacred.

377
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,875
The victims, the entirety
of our student council,

378
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,916
represented the best and
brightest we had to offer.

379
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,333
Their killer?

380
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,541
The guinea pig from those
unsanctioned experiments.

381
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,500
Hope's Peak is
actively suppressing

382
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,291
all this information.

383
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,166
"Why would they
do this," you ask?

384
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,208
Simple. They don't
care about you.

385
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,666
Your parents' hard-earned
cash was squandered

386
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,291
on dangerous, unethical
pseudo-science.

387
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,333
But the bigger cost
was the human one:

388
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,250
14 corpses awash
in their own blood.

389
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,375
Seeing as how your
money led to this,

390
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,958
you're all accomplices
to murder."
