[KIZAKURA]
Hey.

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,833
Lotta circles on that calendar.

4
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,541
[YUKIZOME] Each one is a
day with full attendance!

5
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,041
They've been amazing!

6
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,208
Next on the to-do list
is choosing a class rep.

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,541
Oh, man.

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,333
Sounds like a lot for a
rookie teacher to handle.

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,333
Wanna tag back in, Mr. Kizakura?

10
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,541
Yeah, I would love to, y'know.

11
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,875
But my scouting work
just never lets up.

12
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,833
There's a girl in the gambling
dens who hasn't lost even once.

13
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,041
Right.

14
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,375
Whatever you do,
don't rest on your laurels.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,791
My what now?

16
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,791
If the students ever
go too crazy,

17
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,791
they'll saddle us with the
Reserve Course duds

18
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,291
to teach us a lesson.

19
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,958
You're worried over nothing!

20
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,125
Those kids are all good eggs.
Not a bad one in the bunch!

21
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,875
Oh.

22
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,125
Hello! Yukizome here!

23
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,541
[TEACHER A]
Please, Miss Yukizome!

24
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,375
You've gotta save me!
They're monsters, all of 'em!

00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,416
[click]

26
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,875
[YUKIZOME]
Well, that was weird.

27
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,625
What do we do?

28
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,291
[YUKIZOME]
And he bailed.

29
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,583
What the heck is going... on?

30
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,958
Get up, weakling!

31
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,291
[OWARI]
Oh, I ain't done yet!

32
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,708
[YUKIZOME] Anyone care to tell
me what happened to the wall?

33
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,875
Amusing as this is,
guess we gotta stop 'em.

34
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,875
Our substitute
fainted dead away.

35
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,041
All the excitement
was too much for her.

36
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,875
That's enough!

37
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,000
Listen up, Nidai!

38
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,291
You can't destroy the classroom

39
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,291
just because you feel
like roughhousing!

40
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,416
[grunts]

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,750
What did you call it?!

42
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:13,958
I'll have you know
we're training

43
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,083
in real-life combat conditions!

44
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,958
Oh, in that case,
knock yourself out.

45
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,416
So much for that.

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,375
[TANAKA] And so the world
fell, room by room.

47
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,833
[OWARI]
Damn it all!

48
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,750
How'm I supposed to
drop that gorilla?

49
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,666
I might have something to fix
that conundrum of yours.

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,833
Thanks to some help from our

51
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,291
Super High School-Level
Pharmacist friend!

52
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,875
Behold!

53
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,750
Our special soup is guaranteed
to put some spring in your step!

54
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,833
Dude! Ya don't gotta
tell me twice! Thank you!

55
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,291
Uh, Owari?

56
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:58,166
[yelling]

57
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,750
Wait, what is this shit?

58
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,500
Her fighting power's
off the chart!

59
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,000
She's hit her final form!

60
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,291
So, my dear, how do you
fancy my Doping Corn Soup?

61
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,583
Unimaginable power is coursing
through every inch of me.

62
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,000
This is awesome!

63
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,666
Suck it, Nidai!

64
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,208
I'll put an end to it.

65
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,250
Hey! I told you we're not
going there, so cut it out!

66
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,333
[SAIONJI]
Huh?

67
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,833
[NIDAI laughing]

68
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,458
[NIDAI]
You've got moxie!

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,583
[MITARAI]
Did you run away, too?

70
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,833
The whole group is so aggro.
No multiplayer vibe at all.

71
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,916
[MITARAI sighs]

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,875
Well, not to be a downer,

73
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,458
but team spirit is
kinda wasted on us.

74
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,625
We're a bunch of prodigies,
cherry-picked from across Japan.

75
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,250
With talents like ours,
we're all on easy street.

76
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,458
Seriously, we're set for life
as soon as we graduate.

77
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,291
I'm just runnin' down the clock
till we hit that finish line.

78
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,000
Not a whole lotta point
in making friends, right?

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah. Maybe.

80
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,583
Doesn't matter, 'cause I can't
make friends with gaming anyway.

81
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,041
[YUKIZOME]
You bite your tongue!

82
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,083
Don't ever say you can't
make friends, got it?

83
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,416
But I can't.

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
You think no one'll like
you 'cause you're a gamer?

85
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,958
[NANAMI]
Huh?

86
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,666
What, so those titles you
love so much are worthless,

87
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,375
is that what you're saying?

88
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,083
No, they're great! I-- Oh.

89
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,583
[YUKIZOME chuckles]

90
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,958
If you have that much fun
playing them all by yourself,

91
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,875
imagine the fun people will
have playing them with you.

92
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,750
We could play them... together.

93
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,541
[MUNAKATA]
Sorry for the silence.

94
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,333
It wasn't by choice.

95
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,208
How are things on your end?

96
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:01,750
It's our alma mater, but it
sure isn't how we remember it.

97
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,708
It's changing.
Metamorphosing, really.

98
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,416
[MUNAKATA] And the funds are
from the Reserve Course?

99
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,583
[YUKIZOME]
That's right.

100
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,250
They don't meet the
talent requirement.

101
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,416
But they pay astronomical rates
to go here nonetheless.

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,916
[MUNAKATA] But how that
money is being spent,

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,583
that's the heart of the matter.

104
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,000
Wouldn't you say?

105
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,833
[YUKIZOME] Whatever's going on
behind the scenes here,

106
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,083
the board of trustees
is keeping it quiet.

107
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:30,000
For now, I'll ferret out all
I can about the Reserve Course.

108
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,083
I've got a hunch that money's
not the end-game.

109
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,250
I'm sorry to push such a
hazardous job off on you.

110
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,666
[YUKIZOME] Call me "Chisa" for
a change and all is forgiven.

111
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,000
Maybe next time.

112
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,833
[YUKIZOME]
You're a butt, y'know that?

113
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,750
[chuckles]

114
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,333
Assuming the overseas expansion
plans for the academy work out,

115
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,250
I'll finally have the clout
to do what must be done.

116
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,958
It's up to us to
save Hope's Peak.

117
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,041
[MUNAKATA]
I'm counting on you.

118
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,291
Good luck.

119
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,500
[gasps]

120
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,458
Miss Yukizome! Have you been
out this way all the while?

121
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,500
Oh! Koizumi, hey.

122
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,000
The whole class has
been sitting there,

123
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,333
waiting for you to show.

124
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,958
Seriously? That's awesome.
Thanks for the heads-up!

125
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,208
I'll finish what I'm doing
and be there ASAP!

126
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,666
[BOTH]
Huh?

127
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,083
[YUKIZOME]
You brought lunch?

128
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,666
Uh. That's right.

129
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,791
I made plans to eat it with a
friend of mine this afternoon.

130
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,125
Oh, yeah, duh.

131
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,166
One of the Reserve Course
kids is a pal of yours

132
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,250
from middle school.

133
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,416
How did you know that
about me, ma'am?

134
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,458
Teachers do their
homework too!

135
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,250
Go! I'm sure your friend is
waiting! I'll see ya later!

136
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,583
For a teacher, she's
kind of an odd duck.

137
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,625
[YUKIZOME]
Hinata!

138
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,500
[HINATA yelps]

139
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,000
Huh? What was that for?

140
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,333
That's what you get
for lazing your life away!

141
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,125
You should be forging
precious memories,

142
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,541
but you're slumped
on a bench all alone!

143
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,583
[HINATA]
Well, what about you, huh?

144
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,875
You're all by
yourself, so there.

145
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,333
Yeah.

146
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,000
'Cause I wanted to pick your
brain about school stuff.

147
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,500
Now level with me.

148
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,333
What about the Reserve
Course appealed to you?

149
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,083
[HINATA sighs]

150
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,583
Same thing as everyone
else, I guess.

151
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,166
I've had my sights
on Hope's Peak

152
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,875
ever since I was a little kid.

153
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,375
[YUKIZOME] And that's why you
enrolled in the Reserve Course?

154
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:02,541
[HINATA] That's right.
But now I can't find my resolve.

155
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,083
Resolve for what?

156
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,208
It'll give you the option to
transfer into the Main Course

157
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,666
if you do well enough, do they?

158
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,458

00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,875
I wish.

160
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,458
But I still don't get why
you're so interested

161
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,250
in a scrub like me anyhow.

162
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,041
Don't be like that!

163
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,458
Like what?

164
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,958
I better not hear you call
yourself that ever again,

165
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,958
young man!

166
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,541
But that's what I am.

167
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,041
Self-confidence is the key
to getting anywhere in life,

168
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,083
and don't you forget it!

169
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,583
Understood?

170
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,916
Uh. Loud and clear, ma'am.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,291
Much better.

172

[chuckles]

173
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,541
Oh, yeah, right. I guess I
should get back to my class.

174
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,833
We'll pick this conversation
up later, okay?

175
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,708
[YUKIZOME humming]

176
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:46,000
[TENGAN] She's a firecracker,
that girl. Always has been.

177
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,125
[HINATA]
Mr. Tengan.

178
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,625
Room on that bench
for an old man?

179
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,041
[TENGAN]
The deadline is coming up.

180
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,625
Have you settled on an answer?

181
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,666
[HINATA]
No. Not yet.

182
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,291
[TENGAN]
So I see.

183
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,708
As one of the school's advisors,
I'm sure I shouldn't say this,

184
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,041
but truth be known,

185
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,875
I'm not particularly
enthused about that project.

186
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,791
Really?

187
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,250
Hope comes from people
acting like people,

188
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,750
that's all there is to it.

189
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,750
You're free to decline,
if you don't want to.

190
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,333
[HINATA] It's just...
the fees are so high.

191
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,541
My family could never afford it.

192
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,416
You could return to your former
high school and forget all this.

193
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Too late for that. I'm here.

194
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,458
Changing the fabric
of who you are

195
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,291
is not to be done on a whim.

196
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,833
There's no shame in normalcy.

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,666

I'm gonna hit you so hard,
they'll never find your body!

201

[NIDAI] Show me what you
got, Owari! You're dead!

Nanami, the enemy forces
are nearly defeated!

203

what a video game looks like.

Sweet monitor, huh?

Just somethin' I threw
together for the occasion!

212
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,208
Nanami brought the
console and controllers.

213

She's a gem!

214

Oh yeah?

215
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,666
She's even provided the games

216
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,541
with which we've been whipping
up this joie de vivre!

Yeah!

224

You were right.

225
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,083
About gaming. It's a great
way to make friends.

Whaddya say, best of three?

It's great. I can't wipe
this grin off my face.

Me, neither! We got
so much in common!

What are the tears for, huh?

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,083
'Cause I found it.

320
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,375
After all these years of
searching, a fragment of hope.

[MITARAI]
'Kay, then.

322
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,875
I have cold soup,
if you prefer it!

323
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,166
Looks pretty sketchy.
You can count me out.

324
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,375
Again with the doping?
Give it a rest!

325
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,125
Come on! They're not
all filled with steroids!

326
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,333
How dull would that be?
Hold the phone!

327
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,791
There should be one
more soup in here.

328
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,083
Yeah, about that.

329
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,625
This the one you mean?

00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,333
Oh, no! That bottle was the--!

332

[OWARI]
I feel so strange.

333
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,500
What's wrong?

334
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:26,375
No, you can't...
touch me the way you do.

335
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,291
Huh? Oh! I'm sorry!

336
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,625
Whoa. My heart.

337
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,375
Why does it beat so fast
when I look at you?

338
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,666
Your grip is so strong.
Yet tender!

339
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,833
[NIDAI]
Swoon!

Swoon!

[MITARAI]
What? What's happening?

342
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,875
I feel like I'm on
fire, you guys.

343
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,041
But not barbeque.
More like sexy fire!

Sexy selfies? No, I can't!

345

Maybe I'll snap a few,
just to be artsy!

I don't feel right either.
What did you do to us all?

00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,375
Nothing, really.

348
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,458
I just poured this soup

into Hanamura's
fancy-pants beef stew.

You glorious madwoman!

That bottle you stole was
chock full of aphrodisiacs!

Is somebody having
a hard time of it?

for that apron, huh!

Hey, so, Pekoyama,

00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,916
I can play with your sword
for a little while, right?

371
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,875
What do you mean?

372
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,791
Just the tip. That's enough.

373
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,208
Any more than that's
just too much!

374
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,833
[PEKOYAMA]
No, that's just--! No!

Hope feels awesome.

00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,250
I think I could get
used to this.

You guys are hilarious!

out on that nasty stew!

If you don't want meat,

how about some veggies?

Where did you come from?

No!

You've awakened
a lust within me

the likes of which no mere
mortal has ever known, Saionji!

How about I let you lick
my shoes for a minutes,

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,833
and then, we call it a day?

I regret nothing!

If you wanna touch
my classmates,

393
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,958
you gotta get through me first.

[SONIA] You were magnificent
in there today, Nanami!

Like something out of
a Japanese manga!

The way you told him not
to touch your classmate!

[KOIZUMI]
He's in our class, too though,

400
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,083
so it sort of muddied the moral.

401
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,708
Yeah, but that punch
was one-of-a-kind!

402
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,250
In moments of darkest peril,

403
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,833

able to count on

Oh. So this has come up before?

406
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,375
[NANAMI] Years ago, there was a
biker gang boss known as Willy.

407
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,458
He had a machine gun, and he
wasn't afraid to put it to use.

408
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,041
[TSUMIKI]
He sounds dreadful!

409
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,375
[NANAMI] Two brothers saved
a woman he'd kidnapped,

410
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,416
so he shot her to
death in revenege.

411
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,750
[SONIA]
Shocking!

412
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,500
I had no idea Japan could
be such a violent place!

413

[KOIZUMI]
Me neither!

414
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,625
[NANAMI]
The punch I used today

415
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,166
is the same one I used
to finish off Willy.

416
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,708
[TSUMIKI]
That's incredible!

417
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,083
[YUKIZOME]
Nanami, your past is so violent!

418
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,625
Calling it my past is a
bit much. Didn't take long.

419
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,083
But I'll always be grateful
for my memories...

00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,916
You know it?

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,875
The game-play holds
up even now!

424
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,125
Think about it.

425
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,333
There's no denying the
first game is a classic.

426
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,875
But they ironed out a lot of the
kinks the second time around

427
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,916
without losing any of the soul.

428
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,458
You could say it
set the standard

429
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,791
for the whole
side-scroller genre!

[YUKIZOME]
Okay!

How the hell are you so perky
today after what happened?

I don't wanna spell
it out for you,

435
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,375
but this wasn't Miss
Yukizome's first rodeo.

436
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,791
[SONIA]
Interesting.

437
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,583
That must be why I feel
relatively awake today, as well.

438
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,291
Wait, so you've
been to the rodeo?

Listen up!

00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,291
Before we start today, I have a
little announcement to make!

441
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,750
I should probably ask for
volunteers or some junk,

442
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,125
but I think my way's gonna
be a lot more fun!

443
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,875
What are you goin' on about?

444
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,250
[YUKIZOME] Our class needs
an official representative.

445
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,333
And who better to rep this
homeroom than Chiaki Nanami?

446
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,000
Huh? I don't wanna.

447
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,083
You'll never know
if you don't try.

448
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,875
You'd be perfect for it, Nanami!

449
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,708
I second that.
'Cause she said it!

00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,958
Ditto for me, then.

Okay. Why not?

You're a hit! Pardon the pun!

Yeah. I think

Well, if this is to be
our fate, then let it come.

00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,791
I could think of a lot
worse people for the job.

462
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,083
[YUKIZOME]
So, Nanami, what's the verdict?

463
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,583
Sounds like your classmates
are all on board.

With Nanami as
our representative,

472
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,875
ours is a bond that
can never be shattered.

473
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,458
What does that mean?

474
00:20:55,541 --> 00:21:00,291
So long as Nanami represents us,
this homeroom and its light

475
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,291
will endure triumphant
for the rest of forever.

476
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,750
Uh? Hey, my bad.

477
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,666
Kinda turned it up to
11 there for a minute.

478
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,708
[OTHERS chuckle nervously]

479
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,833
Hey.

480
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,166
Hey, Hinata.

481
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,208
A brand-new fighting game
just hit the arcades.

482
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,375
Huh?

483
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,166
You wanna come with
me to check it out?

484
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,333
I would, but I really
suck at games like that.

485
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,750
[NANAMI]
That's okay!

486
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,416
What's the big idea?

487
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,333
It doesn't matter
if you're good...

488
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,166
...when you play with friends.

489
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,541
[TEACHER B]
Class, I'd like to introduce

490
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,666
a new transfer student.

491
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,375
[NATSUMI]
Hello. I am Natsumi Kuzuriyu.

492
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,583
I don't know why they tossed
me into this classroom

493
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,958
with the rest of you
dead-end trash-fires,

494
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,750
but nice to meet'cha.
