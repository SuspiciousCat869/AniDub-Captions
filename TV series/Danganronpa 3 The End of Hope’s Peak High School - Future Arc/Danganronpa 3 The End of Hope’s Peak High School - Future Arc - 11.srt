When that happens,

any knowledge of
a former encounter

Is Hope or Despair the

It's possible that

So are you gonna kill him?

318
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:12,333
[ENOSHIMA]
Mmm...

319
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,875
Yeah, no.

320
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,041
Even the thought of that loser
ruining my perfect plan,

321
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,666
now that's the kind
of Despair I live for!

322
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,916
[KOMAEDA]
So, uh. This is it.

323
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,750
I'm not really sure what you're
s'posed to say about all this.

324
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,875
I guess... Happy graduation.

325
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,625
See you 'round.
I'm sure you'll all do great.

326
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,250
Yukizome!

327
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,208
Kyosuke, you're here!

328
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,708
Are you injured?

329
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,583
[YUKIZOME]
My class.

330
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,666
[MUNAKATA]
We were too late. I'm sorry.

331
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,166
[YUKIZOME] Stop it, Kyosuke.
This wasn't your fault. I--

332
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,625
Oh God!

333
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,375
Come on.

334
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,125
[YUKIZOME gasps]

335
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,375
You don't need it?

336
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:38,125
No. Nothing I can't
get by without.

337
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,541
[YUKIZOME]
"How boring."

338
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,750
[YUKIZOME]
Oh, yes.

339
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,000
That's what the long-haired
boy would say, I'm sure.

340
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,250
[YUKIZOME]
Here we are,

341
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,250
living in the vision of Junko
Enoshima's twisted mind.

342
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,416
[YUKIZOME]
My students are out there,

343
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,583
happily sowing
confusion and disorder.

344
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,583
[YUKIZOME]
Hopelessness reigns.

345
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,916
Despair begets Despair.

346
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,833
With their gifts,
it's no surprise.

347
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,125
The whole world is stained.

348
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,625
[YUKIZOME]
And me, you ask?

349
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,416
Well, I'm keeping
house, naturally.

350
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,958
Oh, God!

351
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,125
It's worse than
I ever imagined.

352
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,916
[JUZO] If I'd just
manned-up and told him,

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,041
none of this would've happened!

354
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,458
[YUKIZOME] Kyosuke!
We can't let them do this!

355
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,458
All this destruction
has to stop!

356
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,000
[MUNAKATA]
I know.

357
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,750
[YUKIZOME]
Rid the world of Despair.

358
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,416
If anyone can do it, it's you!

359
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,666
[YUKIZOME]
I believe in you...

360
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,958
[YUKIZOME] In your bottomless
capacity for Despair.

361
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,791
[YUKIZOME] Yep. No happy
ending here, boys and girls.

362
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,791
I warned you.

363
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,291
You're wondering if it
has to be this way.

364
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,458
Hmm. Good question.

365
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,875
For Junko Enoshima
and the deranged souls

366
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,458
who worship at her feet,

367
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,375
this is a happy ending of sorts.

368
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,375
Maybe that's the secret.

369
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,666
However the story ends, it's
all a matter of perspective.

370
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,333
[ENOSHIMA] Potential.
That's what it's about, really.

371
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:52,375
Despair as an adventure
of the spirit!

372
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:57,583
If it wasn't already a thing,
we'd have to invent it!

373
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:01,625
[laughing]

374
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,708
[HINATA]
Excuse me.

375
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,166
[NANAMI]
Oh. Sorry.

376
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,291
I'm way too focused on this
thing for my own good.

377
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,041
It's easy for me
to get distracted.

378
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,333
Hey, there. My name's
Chiaki Nanami.

379
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,750
And if you couldn't tell,

380
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,875
I'm the Super High
School-Level Gamer.

381
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,666
To be honest, it's
pretty much all I do.

382
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,583
Oh, it's a pleasure to
meet you, by the way.

383
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,000
[HINATA]
Hello.

384
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:25,583
My name's Hajime Hinata.
Good to meet you.

385
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,583
What's your thing?

386
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,000
[HINATA]
I have to know.

387
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,541
Hope or Despair?

388
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,708
Which can I not predict?

389
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,500
Which one is freedom?
