[PACIFICA]
Hey, Raquel.

00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,958
If we hang around
here much longer,

3
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,541
I bet that Natalie's gonna try
to do something to us again.

4
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,125
I suppose.

5
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,291
[sighs]

6
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,750
I don't know what's
so interesting here.

7
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,875
Can you tell what
any of this stuff is?

8
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,250
[RAQUEL]
No, not at all.

9
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,333
But they said that long ago,
people fought the gods

10
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,166
using machinery like this.

11
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,875
It was supposed to
enhance the abilities

12
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,666
of people with psychic powers.

13
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,125
[PACIFICA]
Yeah...

14
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,125
And they also said something
about them being betrayed.

15
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,625
[RAQUEL]
From what Miss Eirote tells me,

16
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,875
all of this machinery works by

17
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,416
combining simple
calculation algorithms

18
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,875
in order to convey
complicated instructions.

19
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,791
Magic works exactly
the same way.

20
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,208
It's very interesting.

21
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,458
Really... I wouldn't know.

22
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,375
[intercom beeps]

23
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,583
[SENES]
Hey, you two, listen up.

24
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,750
We'll be reaching the
coast of Sauer soon.

25
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,833
I need you on the bridge.

26
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,583

Come on, Raquel, let's go!

30
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,208
If we're late, ol' tomboy Senes
will throw a fit and snarl.

[EIROTE giggles]

32
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,458
You know, I can still
hear you, you little brat.

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,041
What's wrong?

34
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,791
Feeling nostalgic about home?

35
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,375
Not really.

36
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,666
The village that you three grew
up in must've been a nice place.

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,750
[SHANNON]
You know our village?

38
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,500
No, it's just that
I get that feeling

39
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,416
when I look at you
and your sisters.

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,333
It must be nice to have a home,
a place you wanna go back to.

41
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,625
[PETERS-STAHL]
We are in a difficult situation.

42
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,375
The Giat Empire's
special weapon,

43
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,541
the Skid, is right
off our coast.

44
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,708
This is obviously an invasion.

45
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,916
We, the members of the
Leinwan Royal Forces,

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,125
must meet this imminent
threat with resolve

47
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,541
and smash it utterly.

48
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,125
[GENERAL A] That may be
the case, but this is the Skid.

49
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,500
It's a weapon built by the race
of evil during the Genesis Wars.

50
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,791
Wouldn't any attempt to take it
by force be extremely difficult?

51
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,291
That's true. We probably
can't destroy it

52
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,125
by simple cannon attack.

53
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,958
Which is why I
propose the use of

54
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,875
the strategic-grade
offensive spell, Ginnungagap.

55
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,166
[GENERAL B]
Preposterous!

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,416
[GENERAL C]
Why would we need to use that?!

57
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,625
[GENERAL D]
Ginnungagap?

58
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,166
The use of that spell
is banned by treaty!

59
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,500
[PETERS-STAHL]
Shall we uphold the treaty

60
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,083
and let our country fall?

61
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,625
This is an invasion.

62
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,833
Gentlemen, our first priority
is to destroy the Skid

63
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,875
and then, we should march
on the Giat Empire.

64
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,125
[BARONESS] A moment please,
General Peters-Stahl.

65
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,041
Something to add, Lady Bairach?

66
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,666
I have heard reports that the
Skid set out on its journey

67
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,916
after trading fire with its
own country's Second Fleet.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,750
It is possible the Skid's crew
was seen as a rebel force

69
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,541
by Giat and they sent out
the fleet to pursue them.

70
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,375
It may be too early to
say this is an invasion.

71
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,750
[PETERS-STAHL]
What if that was a ruse

72
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,625
designed to confuse
and mislead us?

73
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,250
If their main forces arrive

74
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,000
and begin a joint
assault with the Skid,

75
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,791
it will be too
late for us to act.

76
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,250
Which is why it is crucial

77
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,541
to ascertain the
truth of the situation.

78
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,958
If we break the treaty now,

79
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,541
then a plunge into
all-out war is inevitable.

80
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,125
In the end, we will exhaust our
military forces for nothing.

81
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,458
You believe our forces will be
defeated by the likes of Giat?

82
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,166
Fortune can smile on the enemy.

83
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,708
[PETERS-STAHL chuckles]

84
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,125
Well, well. Those are hardly
the words I would expect to hear

85
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,708
from the woman who controls the
legendary Special Forces unit.

86
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,916
Justice is on our side.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,125
Besides, that Skid is
harboring the poison

88
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,833
that will destroy the world,
the Scrapped Princess.

[GENERALS murmuring]

[PETERS-STAHL] For the sake of
peace, not only for our country,

91

but for the entire world,

Yes, of course, General.

You must destroy

[BARONESS]
What do you intend to do?

[LUKE] I will standby
and receive my orders.

we really can do.

It turned out just like

For a baronial family estate,

I think the design is
rather pedestrian, personally.

the barony of Takos.

160
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,666
I'm on a training tour
at the moment though.

161
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,291
Oh, I didn't know.

162
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,708
[LEO]
This is sorta awkward.

163
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,833
We can't simply
barge in unannounced.

164
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,833
I suppose I'll just have
to stand here and shout

165
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,125
until someone comes.

166
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,291
[WINIA]
Um... That's all right.

167
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,250
[LEO]
Huh?

168
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,500
Don't bother.

169
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,541
It's sort of rude for me
to come without asking.

170
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,625
Let's just go.

171
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,083
[LEO] Don't talk
like that, Miss Winia!

00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,458
[WINIA gasps]

00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,583
You came here to see someone
you really care about!

174
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,958
You can't just give up, not when
you're so close to seeing him!

175
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,333
Or at least, that's what I think

176
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,000
Miss Pacifica would
say if she were here.

177
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,708
[gasps]

178
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,833
It's Chris.

Miss Winia...

185
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,625
[WINIA]
It's okay.

186
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,791
[LEO]
Uh--

187
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,375
It's fine. I'm sure
he has his reasons.

188
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,708
Or am I just trying to be
too optimistic about it?

189
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,708
No, not at all, Miss Winia.

190
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,958
You're right.

191
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,333
Yeah...

192
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,333
[WIZARD A]
Ginnungagap?!

193
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,958
They can't be serious!

194
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,416
[WIZARD B]
The ship may be offshore,

195
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,958
but the people on the coast
will be hit by the blast!

196
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,250
All I know is that this
is an official order

197
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,125
from His Majesty, the King.

198
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,500
Please begin with your stage
one incantations immediately.

[TOWNSPEOPLE murmuring]

[SHANNON]
There's no sign of activity.

201
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,041
[SENES] We're here now,
so what are they waiting for?

202
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,541
[PACIFICA hissing]

203
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,916
[RAQUEL]
Pacifica! Are you all right?

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,541
Yeah, I'm a little scared,
that's all.

205
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,000
You said earlier
that the Peacemakers

206
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,541
can't attack Pacifica directly,
am I right?

207
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,958
[EIROTE]
Yes, they will most likely

208
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,250
try to use humans to
attack her instead.

209
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,500
[PACIFICA] Maybe they just
don't know that we're yet.

210
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,208
Maybe we should try
to signal them or--

211
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,625
What are you, an idiot?!

212
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,000
They're Peacemakers;

213
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,916
they can detect our movements
whenever they want.

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,833
Yeah, I guess I am.

215
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,083
[SENES] Well, as long as the
Skid's defensive functions

216
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,875
are online, they could
fire a million

217
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,375
large-bore cannonballs at us,

218
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,333
and it still
wouldn't even dent us.

219
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,958
[ZEFIRIS]
Do not let your guard down.

220
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,375
The Peacemakers are aware of the
capabilities of this fortress.

221
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,583
We can assume that they are

222
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,291
avoiding unnecessary
combat for a reason.

223
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,708
I'm surprised you can show
your face in front of me.

224
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,458
Or don't Dragons possess that
kind of human sensitivity?

225
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,958
--[PACIFICA grunts]
--[SHANNON] Ah!

226
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,416
That hurt, you little twerp!

227
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,958
How can you talk
to her like that?!

228
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,416
She helped me save you!

229
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,375
If it weren't for Zefiris,
you'd still be brainwashed!

230
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,708
And I wouldn't have been
brainwashed in the first place

231
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,083
if she hadn't been working
in league with Natalie!

232
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,208
And that's not all.

233
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,875
She never bothered
to tell us the truth

234
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,416
and decided to use us, instead.

235
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,208
All right, already!
That might be true,

236
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,583
but you don't understand!

237
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,166
Zefiris has problems of her own!

238
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,541
Ugh, whatever.

239
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,833
There's no point in fighting
with you about this now.

240
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,291
What are the Peacemakers
after anyway?

241
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,166
[ZEFIRIS] Probably a
strategic-grade offensive spell.

242
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,208
[RAQUEL gasps]

243
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,833
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

244
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,250
[PACIFICA]
Strategic-grade? What's that?

245
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,166
[RAQUEL]
It must be Ginnungagap.

246
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,833
[SHANNON] Is that the spell
Reynard was trying to cast

247
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,125
in the heretic village?

248
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,583
[RAQUEL]
The principle is the same.

249
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,750
However, if a group of
elite military wizards

250
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,000
were to cast such a spell,

251
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,041
then its power would be
immeasurable greater.

252
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,458
[SENES]
Hey, wait a minute.

253
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,041
Spells that powerful are
supposed to be banned by treaty.

254
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,708
Treaties mean nothing
in the face of

255
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,083
irresistible Peacemaker
mind control.

256
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,708
After all, that treaty
was originally designed

257
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,958
by the Peacemakers via
the Church of Mauser.

258
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,291
But still, incantations for
those kinds of spells

259
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,458
take a long time.

260
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,666
And you can't fire
them off very quickly.

261
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,750
I believe that the Skid's
defensive function

262
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,416
should be able to
withstand such an attack.

263
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,625
[ZEFIRIS]
They can.

264
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,750
However, the Peacemakers
are also very aware

265
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,250
of that same fact.

266
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,458
[STEYR]
This is taking forever.

267
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,041
We've got some time to kill,

268
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,125
so why don't we release a few
proxies inside the Capital?

269
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,166
[CZ]
Don't.

270
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,291
Tactics like that are pointless.

271
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,125
[STEYR]
Y'know, Cz, I think you may have

272
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,000
spent a little too
much time stuck in

273
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,291
that childish,
halfway uncompressed state.

274
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,833
[CZ]
What do you mean?

275
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,250
[STEYR] You'd like to avoid
human deaths if at all possible.

276
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,625
Isn't that what you're thinking?

277
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,541
[CZ]
We are Peacemakers.

278
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,750
We're programmed to
preserve the human race

279
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,916
in a stable state, so it's
natural to avoid bloodshed.

280
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,500
[STEYR]
Is it really?

281
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,916
I don't know; your thinking
seems awfully human to me.

282
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,083
Right, Socom?

283
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,416
[SOCOM]
Perhaps, so.

284
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,416
But nevertheless,
Cz's opinion does have merit.

285
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,625
The wizards have already begun
the spell's incantation.

286
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,208
There is no need for us
to resort to cheap tricks.

287
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,541
[STEYR]
Oh, come on.

288
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,125
You Artillery-types about
as subtle and nuanced

289
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,541
as a sledgehammer.

290
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,666
Brute force is
all well and good,

291
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,958
but doesn't a little cunning
give you more of a thrill?

292
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,541
[CZ] You're the one who
thinks too much like a human.

293
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,708
[SOCOM]
I would prefer to avoid

294
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,625
any direct intervention
on our part.

295
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,875
As we planned earlier,

296
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,000
suppressing the defense
and mobility functions

297
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,333
of the mobile fortress
should be sufficient.

298
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,541
[STEYR]
Here we are, three Peacemakers,

299
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,250
and we're resorting to parlor
tricks in order to win.

300
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,458
[SOCOM] I just want the job
done as efficiently as possible.

301
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,708
I'm not interested
in being flashy.

302
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,333
[STEYR]
Fine, fine.

[PILOT B]
Princess, Senes!

304
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,500
The defense system output
is dropping rapidly.

305
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,208
I can't maintain the shields.

306
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,000
What?! What's causing it?

307
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,500
[PILOT B]
I don't know.

308
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,958
But it doesn't seem to be
damaged from the outside.

309
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,708
Wait, is it Natalie?

310
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,166
[NATALIE]
I'm not the one doing it.

[ALL gasp]

312

[SENES]
You expect us to believe you?

313
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,583
As long as Pacifica Cassul
is aboard this ship,

314
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,666
I have no reason to want
to expose her to danger.

315
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,833
That's true.

316
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,291
The impression
I'm getting is that

317
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,625
the defense system is being
ripped apart at the seams

318
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,958
by some invisible force.

319
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,791
Invisible force? Are the
Peacemakers behind this?

320
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,166
Of course. It's being
controlled remotely.

321
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,750
You must get away from here.

322
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,416
Retreat, Senes Lur Giat.

323
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,958
I should what?!

324
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,291
If we were to take a direct hit
from a strategic-grade spell

325
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,375
with our defense systems
locked down like this,

326
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,625
none of us would survive.

327
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,625
[SENES]
Forget it!

328
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,958
Those Peacemakers
are here, right?

329
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,208
You want me to run away

330
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,541
when the ones who killed
my men are just outside?

331
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,125
[NATALIE] You would
be killed by the humans

332
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,583
that the Peacemakers control

333
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,625
long before you ever had
a chance to fight them.

334
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,833
Damn it.

335
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,125
Withdraw, full speed!

336
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,000
[PILOT A]
Roger.

337
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:38,708
[radar beeps]

338
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,750
[PILOT A]
Hm?

339
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,791
What's wrong?

340
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,208
What are you doing?

341
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,583
[PILOT A]
The helm's not responding.

342
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,625
What's that?

343
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,875
What do you mean
it's not responding?

344
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,041
Do something!

345
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,125
Big Sister...

346
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,916
We should abandon ship.

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,458
[SHANNON]
Why you little--!

348
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,208
You expect us to just let the
people in the Capital die?!

349
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,291
[ZEFIRIS] I believe I understand
how you feel about all of this.

350
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,041
But this fortress is now nothing
more than a large target

351
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,458
floating the water.

352
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,833
If you stay here,
Pacifica will die.

353
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,083
And the rest of you
will go along with her.

354
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,416
I expect that such an outcome
would be undesirable to you.

355
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,166
I'll go out and fight the
Peacemakers with the Dragoon.

356
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,625
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

357
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,916
If I can manage to loosen
their grip on the fortress,

358
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,750
then we should be able
to move again, right?

359
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,166
Perhaps, my Lord, but three
Peacemakers have assembled here.

360
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,791
In terms of power, we are
completely outmatched.

361
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,083
So what else is new?

362
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,333
[ZEFIRIS] The Peacemaker Cz
is also with them.

363
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,500
[ALL gasp]

364
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,958
If you are going to fight,
you will not win

365
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,041
unless you are prepared to
utterly destroy your enemy.

366
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,375
Are you able to fight
Cz without holding back?

367
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,416
[SHANNON]
Yeah.

368
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,250
[SENES]
Shannon Cassul.

369
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,333
Don't do anything stupid.

370
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,375
Right.

371
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,458
[SHANNON]
Let's go.

372
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,875
Zefiris, I want you to
give me all the power

373
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,500
that you have access
to right now.

374
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,916
It's too dangerous

375
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,208
and you still have deep
misgivings about me, my Lord.

376
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,791
If the fusion is incomplete,

377
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,541
it will put such a strain
on your body that--

378
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,291
Now is not the time
to be holding back!

379
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,916
As you wish.

380
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,375

00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:39,250

[ALL gasp]

383
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,666
[PACIFICA]
What is that thing?

384
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,791
That creature there is
a Dragoon's true form.

385
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,333
[STEYR]
Here they come.

386
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,208
[CZ] So, she's finally
taken physical form.

387
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,916
Can the two of you
maintain control

388
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,875
of the mobile fortress
by yourselves?

389
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,208
[SOCOM]
We can keep it from moving.

390
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,000
[CZ] In that case,
I'll handle the Dragoon.

391
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,041
[CZ] Second class

[ZEFIRIS]
It's Cz.

[SHANNON]
Cz...

396
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,083
[PILOT B] The defense systems
have recovered by 20%.

397
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,583
Divert all power to
engines and break away.

398
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,750
This is our chance.

399
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,583
Cz will be focused
on the battle.

400
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,500
All right, maximum output, now!

00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,458
[STEYR chuckles]
They're putting up a fight.

403
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,500

Futile.

[CZ]
Silence!

407
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,333
If you want to say
something to your enemy,

408
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,083
then make sure you do it after
you've crushed them underfoot

Our mission is complete for now.

418
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,958
[MESSENGER] The strategic-grade
offensive spell, Ginnungagap,

419
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,916
has manifested above the
Giant Empire's special fortress,

420
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,875
the Skid. Half of the
ship has been destroyed.

421
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,000
We are searching for
survivors using magic,

422
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,666
but no life signs have
been detected as of yet.

423
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,041
We believe the threat from the
target has been eliminated.

[MAN] They cast the spell
with no warning, huh?

427
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,041
They'll do anything for
the sake of a mission.

428
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,666
Even if the explosion
triggers a tsunami.

429
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,708
I'd say the military's
MO hasn't changed.

Uh... Excuse me,
but who are you?

When you meet someone new,

432
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,541
aren't you supposed to
give your own name first?

433
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,958
Yeah, you're probably right.

434
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,708
I just can't remember anything.

My name, my family, nothing.

You don't know who I am, do you?

Sorry, Kid, but I don't know ya.

Hey, why are you
following me like that?

441
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,125
Because I don't know
anyone else here.

442
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,291
And if I follow you, I might
run into someone who knows me.

Suit yourself.

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,125
So tell me, what is your name?

00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,500
The name's Furet.

search for Pacifica.

But Pacifica has no idea
that they're looking for her

457
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,041
and has been living a carefree
live with a boy named Furet.
