Major.

00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,250
So I heard that you tried
to take on her guardians.

3
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,750
News travels fast.

4
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,750
I'm just saving myself up
for the real fight later.

5
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,458
[MAJOR]
How will you report this?

6
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,416
[CHRIS]
As the Baroness ordered.

7
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,875
I am to report
everything to her

8
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,916
regardless of the success
or failure of the mission.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,250
And besides, it's not as if
they have any real chance

10
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,250
of escaping the
continent of Dustvin.

11
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,625
This goes without saying,

12
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,291
but don't let your personal
feelings get in the way.

13
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,958
What's the matter, Major?

14
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,541
Are you really that
concerned about me?

15
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,250
My assignment is
to kill the poison

16
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,625
which will destroy the world.

17
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,166
That's the only agenda
I have on my mind.

Fine, thanks for asking!

nice to share with us, would ya?

It'd be best

if you just leave your

to wear dry clothes!

while you're wearing it.

But those clothes'll
make it stink in here.

Oh, right. Where are my manners?

I understand now.

118

If I abandoned a young maiden

119
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,583
with whom I had
exchanged marriage vows

120
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,458
in this lawless area, it would
disgrace the House of Skorpus

121
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,208

Now, now, my good man,
I absolutely insist.

But why not?

129

He's a little bit strange, but
he seems like a nice guy to me.

Come, then! Let us be off!

131

Truly a name worthy
of your beauty.

Hear that?

134
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,083
People with a trained eye
know beauty when they see it.

00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,625
[SHANNON]
Mm...

136

Hear me, god Mauser! I give
thee thanks for this encounter.

The thing is, Leopold...

00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,291
Please, call me Leo, milady.

139
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,625
Okay, Leo.

140
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,250
But what're you supposed
to do when you're on tour

141
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,583
as a knight-errant?

142
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,791
[LEO]
Have you ever heard of a man

143
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,750
by the name of Doyle Barrett?

144
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,166
If I remember correctly,

145
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,958
he used to be second in
command of the Amber Knights.

146
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,041
Yes, that's right!

147
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,666
My errant quest
is to seek him out

148
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,250
so he can tell me
the Tales of Chivalry.

149
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,458
So you're networking to try
and get in the backdoor.

150
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,291
Do you have to look at
everything in the world

151
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,041
with such a cynical eye?

152
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,875
He seems to know you.

153
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,375
[LEO]
Sir Barrett retired from duty

154
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,708
quite suddenly 15 years ago.

155
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,541
No one really knows why,
but there is a theory.

156
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,750
They say he was involved

157
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,500
with the sealing of
the Scrapped Princess.

158
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,250
Something about his
health being ruined

159
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,666
from being cursed by
the Scrapped Princess.

160
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,708
What? A curse?

161
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,416
It's only a rumor, really.

162
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,291
Besides, I'm not
completely convinced

163
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,416
that this Scrapped Princess
ever existed in the first place.

164
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,083
Uh... Is something wrong?

165
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,875
Uh... Nothing!
It's nothing at all!

166
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,041
[ALL chuckle]

167
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,500
[LEO]
Wow...

168
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,041
Oh. How dazzling.

169
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:06,416
Your beauty is blinding...
Miss Pacifica...

170
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,250
Oh, I didn't notice you
standing there, Big Brother.

171
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,708
[SHANNON]
Uh. "Big Brother"?

172
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,625
Tell me something.

173
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,625
What do you like so much
about that stray cat of a girl?

174
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,833
Everything.

175
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,708
"Everything" isn't very
specific, you know?

176
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,458
But isn't that how love at
first sight is supposed to be?

177
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,375
Is that so?

178
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,083
Well, I suppose if I did
have to give a reason,

179
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,750
it would be her dignity.

180
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:31,791
Huh?

181
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,083
I would hardly call
her a stray cat.

182
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,416
On the contrary, don't you
think she has a sort of

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,541
cat-like resolute air about her?

184
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,458
I sense a fortitude
in your younger sister.

185
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:45,000
An ancient nobility that is not
to be found among commoners.

186
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,791
[PACIFICA] What're you two
doing sitting over there?

187
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,833
[LEO]
Hmm?

188
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,250
[PACIFICA]
Come on! Come swimming with me!

189
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,333
Uh, I really don't
think I should.

190
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,041
[PACIFICA]
Why?

191
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,708
Well, I'd rather not.

192
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,708
You can't swim.

193
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,333
No! Big Brother!
Help me, please!

194
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
Nobles and commoners, huh?

195
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,416
[RAQUEL] Why don't you get
cleaned up, too, Shannon?

196
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,041
[SHANNON]
Uh, sure.

197
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,416
Poor Leo went through all
that trouble to propose to her

198
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,125
and look at him now.

199
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,458
[SHANNON] She's already
turned the guy into a pet.

200
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,458
Shannon... I was thinking
maybe we should go with Leo

201
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,291
to see this Doyle man.

202
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,833
[SHANNON]
Hmm?

203
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,791
After all, the only information
we have about what happened

204
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,375
fifteen years ago comes from
what we read in Father's will.

205
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,625
This Doyle Barrett person
might be able to tell us

206
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,291
more about it.

207
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,333
[SHANNON]
Hm.

208
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,666
Oh, wait! Please!

209
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,000
You're fine! Don't worry!

210
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,000
The important thing is
to get used to the water.

211
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,708
[whimpering]

212
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,125
[PACIFICA]
Take this!

213
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,083
Miss Pacifica, look over there!

214
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,125
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

215
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,916
[PACIFICA]
What's she doing?

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,083
[incoherent yelling]

217
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,125
Hi, there! How are you?!

218
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,083
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

219
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:05,958
[LEO]
Huh?

220
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,791
Hey, Grandma!

221
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,750
Are you trying to say
there's something out here?!

222
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,166
[PACIFICA, LEO scream]

223
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,083
[LEO screams]

224
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,291
Curse you, amphibian! Ah!

225
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,833
[LEO groans]

226
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,000
What do you think you're doing?!
That's the guardian spirit!

227
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:51,708
[LEO]
Huh?

228
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,958
[PACIFICA yelps]

229
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,166
Pacifica!

230
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,458
[GIRL]
Would you like a hand?

231
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,500
[SHANNON]
Huh?

232
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,375
Are you from around this place?

233
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,125
Do you know what
the heck that thing is?

234
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,083
I do believe it is what
your kind calls a dragon.

235
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,625
You're kidding.
That thing's a dragon?

236
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,833
[GIRL] She must be using frog
DNA for her basic morphology.

237
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,500
Huh?

238
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:17,875
This identification signal
is serial seven. It's Gloria.

239
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,875
I'm amazed that you're
able to function at all

240
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,375
in a state like that.

241
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,541
[GLORIA]
I must protect...

242
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,291
I have to protect the
world that he loved.

243
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,458
Even if it takes thousands,
or tens of thousands of years.

244
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,791
[GIRL]
Pacifica Cassul.

245
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,541
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

246
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,958
[GIRL]
Please, let her go to sleep.

247
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,958
You just have to
tell her one thing.

248
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,083
Tell her, "That is enough."

249
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,708
Our kind are unable
to sleep on our own.

250
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,916
We must be ordered to rest.

251
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,541
I beg you.

252
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,625
Okay... I guess...

253
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,833
That is enough.

254
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,250
[PACIFICA] You can go ahead
and rest now if you like.

255
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,250
I thank you...

256
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,500
Pacifica!

257
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,500
Who are you? Tell me.

258
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,291
What just happened?

259
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,000
[GIRL] You wouldn't
understand even if I told you.

260
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,958
What in the world
was that thing?

261
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,375
[SHANNON] Yeah, that's
what I'd like to know.

262
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,500
[OLD WOMAN]
You people,

263
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,416
what did you do to
the guardian spirit?

264
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,458
I did what that girl said to do.
I told her she could rest.

265
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,000
[OLD WOMAN]
Hmm...

266
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,125
I see now. The guardian
spirit is at rest.

267
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,125
So, are you folks supposed to
be on a trip or something?

268
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,333
[RAQUEL]
Yes.

269
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,708
What on earth brings you
out to these parts?

270
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,750
We're looking for a man by
the name of Doyle Barrett.

271
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,000
Huh? Are you really sure?

272
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,500
We've decided that
we'd like to meet

273
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,375
this famous knight
for ourselves.

274
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,791
Doyle, huh? Never heard of him.

275
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,833
He's best known as
Sir Doyle Barret.

276
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,500
Formerly a Royal Cavalier.

277
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,500
A Royal Cavalier?

278
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,625
Oh, that guy!

279
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,750
[LEO] She says we'll
find a mansion there.

280
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,333
I say. Isn't this so exciting?

281
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,291
Not really...

282
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,875
Hmm?

283
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,833
Hey, what do we do if it turns
out he really is under a curse?

284
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,250
Tell me, do you have
any powers like that?

285
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,541
No, I don't.

286
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,041
I guess the rumors
could be true after all.

287
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,958
Maybe you turn people
all fat and bloated.

288
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,833
You jerk!

289
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,541
Shall we go?

290
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,625
Farewell, then!
We'll be on our way!

291
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,208
Have a good trip!

292
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,791
[PACIFICA] That's quite
a mansion, all right.

293
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,666
[LEO]
Uh...

294
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,333
So, are you gonna knock or what?

295
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,166
Uh, right.

296
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,416
Can I help you?

297
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,125
Uh?

298
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,041
I'm sorry, are you...
Sir Doyle Barrett?

299
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:23,958
[DOYLE]
That's right.

300
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,541
Ah!

301
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,291
My ultimate goal in
life is to be able

302
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,208
to join the Amber
Knights someday!

303
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,916
To that end, I have come as a
knight-errant to beseech you

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,791
to teach me the
meaning of chivalry!

305
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,041
Chivalry, huh?

306
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,750
Yes, sir!

307
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,583
Hmm... Then you've
wasted your time.

308
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,750
[LEO]
Huh?

309
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,125
[DOYLE]
I'm a simple town doctor now.

310
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,416
If you've got time to go
searching for chivalry

311
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,083
and all that nonsense,
go plow a field or something.

312
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,875
What's that supposed to mean?!

313
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,708
Leo's idolized you
his whole life, and--

314
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,625
That was his decision, not mine.

315
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,083
[PACIFICA gasps]

316
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,666
Now leave me alone.

317
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:06,500
[PACIFICA] Oh! Now I get it!
So that's the kinda man he is!

318
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,166
That's too bad, Leo!

319
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,791
Boy, worrying that he was fat
was such a royal waste of time!

320
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,458
Let's go!

321
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,541
Uh, Miss Pacifica?

322
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,583
What're you waiting for?
We're going back!

323
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,958
Well, it's just that
there's a...

324
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,083
A what?!

325
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,041
[LEO]
A cliff over there.

326
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,833
[DOYLE] Well then,
that should do the trick.

327
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,000
[PACIFICA]
Thanks...

328
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,958
Now, if you wouldn't
mind, just go away.

329
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,875
I know you.

330
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,333
My parents told me stories about
you when I was very young.

331
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,250
They said you were
a magnificent knight

332
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,750
who knew the true meaning of
justice and righteousness.

333
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,458
That you understood chivalry
more clearly than any other man.

334
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,208
Tell me, have you ever
killed anyone, boy?

335
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,541
[LEO]
Uh?

336
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,666
[DOYLE] A person who didn't
or couldn't resist?

337
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,041
Well... No, I haven't.

338
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,208
[DOYLE] If you kill someone,
then you'll understand.

339
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,875
Kill someone that you don't
hate or even dislike.

340
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,750
Kill someone who's powerless.

341
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,750
Do that and you'll
know what I mean.

342
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,541
The whole notion of
chivalry is a sham.

343
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,166
There's no absolute justice or
righteousness in this world.

344
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,416
But, sir!

345
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,791
Come, boy, tell me what
you think chivalry is.

346
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,416
Tell me about justice.

347
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't know them anymore.
Can you tell me about them?

348
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,541
[DOYLE]
Go home already.

349
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,833
I will come again, sir.

350
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,000
Welcome back.

351
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,333
We're back...

352
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,583
--[ALL gasp]
--[OLD WOMAN cackles]

353
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,625
Feeling hungry?

354
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,583
[PACIFICA] I think I'll
have some of these eggs.

355
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,125
[OLD WOMAN]
Go on, dig in.

356
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,208
It's the least I can do for
you for appeasing the spirit.

357
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,708
[SHANNON] Thanks, but I don't
think we had much to do with it.

358
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,000
[OLD WOMAN] There's an old
legend from around these parts

359
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,125
that says the guardian spirit
had been suffering under a curse

360
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,125
from the Dark Lord Browning.

361
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,458
For a long time,

362
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,166
I've wanted to try and
help that tortured spirit.

363
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,625
So maybe I really did
help her out after all.

364
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,666
[RAQUEL] Didn't you say
that she thanked you for it?

365
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,500
Then I'm sure that what
you did was a good deed.

366
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,333
You're right.

367
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,458
By the way, what about Doyle?
Were you folks able to find him?

368
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,708
Oh, yeah, we were able
to find him, all right.

369
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,708
It's just, I got
the impression

370
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,958
that he didn't wanna
talk about knights.

371
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,666
Is that a fact?

372
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,666
I bet it's 'cause he
gave up being a knight

373
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,916
after something bad happened.

374
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,541
What're you talking about?

375
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,250
[OLD WOMAN]
This was 15 years ago,

376
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,458
back at the time of the
Revelation of Saint Grendel.

377
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,541
Rumor has it that the princess
who had just been born

378
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,208
came into this world under
the star of an ill omen.

379
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,833
People say something
about a sickness or curse,

380
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,375
that she was the
Scrapped Princess.

381
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,416
That Doyle man was
charged with the duty

382
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,041
of disposing of the cursed baby
in order to save the world.

383
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,041
The problem for him
was that the child

384
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,500
didn't seem like an
abomination at all.

385
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,291
She was just a
sweet little baby.

386
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,666
[gasps]

387
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,333
[OLD WOMAN] Of course, there
are some rumors that say

388
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,250
she was secretly spared
from her deadly fate,

389
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,583
that the Scrapped Princess is
still alive somewhere today.

390
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,291
Old woman, that's enough.

391
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,000
Sorry. Did I ramble on
too long for you, sonny?

392
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,541
Well, there's always a reason
for everything that happens.

393
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,791
So now that you know,
just go easy on him.

394
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,583
[sighs]

395
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,666
[PACIFICA]
Guess who?

396
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,833
Hey, why the long face?

397
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,500
Well, because...

398
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,750
Since I was a boy, all I ever
wanted was to become a knight.

399
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,166
I wanted to become one of
the famous Amber Knights

400
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,083
and protect the people
of the kingdom.

401
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,000
That's all I ever dreamed of.

402
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,708
Miss Pacifica... What do you
suppose chivalry really is?

403
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,041
[RAQUEL]
The Cassuls get rooms at an inn

404
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,666
in a town named Taurus.

405
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,416
Pacifica tries to befriend
the girl who works at the inn,

406
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,541
but the girl doesn't
open up to her at all.

407
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,750
She must be the shy type, huh?

408
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,625
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

409
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,666
"Fanfare for the
Unforgiven Man."

410
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,000
See you next time.
