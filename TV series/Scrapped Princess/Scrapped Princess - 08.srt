require your assistance.

What's this for?

00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,500
[ZEFIRIS] That girl, the young
girl who is with you now.

5
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,958
[PACIFICA] You mean Cz? What
does this have to do with her?

6
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,916
I need you to kill that girl.

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,958

[SHANNON]
Hmm?

10
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,000
[RAQUEL]
Would you go check on Pacifica?

11
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,416
[SHANNON]
Pacifica?

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,250
Why? She'll be fine as
long as she stays in here.

[SHANNON]
Well, sure, but...

17
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,791
Fine, I understand
what you're saying.

18
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,000
Where Pacifica?
I go look for her.

19
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,166
[RAQUEL]
Hey, Shannon.

20
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,500
Don't you think it's
a little strange?

21
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,166
What's strange?

22
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,416
[RAQUEL] I know you
think the world of Cz,

23
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,791
but sometimes it's--

24
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,500
You're fond of her, too,
though, aren't you, Raquel?

25
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,000
[RAQUEL] I wonder if that girl
has some sort of power.

26
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,666
[SHANNON]
Hm?

27
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,291
Maybe that's what happened
when you found her.

28
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,916
If she used some
sort of power on you,

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,333
then maybe she's tricked
you into caring for her.

30
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:05,166
Oh, come on. You're reading
way too much into it.

31
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,791
Perhaps... I just
hope you're right...

32
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,916
[SHANNON]
Hm.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,500

I need you to kill her.

Thy brother and sister are
of no use to me right now.

That is why I am
asking for thy help.

37
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,541
[PACIFICA] Why do you want
me to kill a little girl?

38
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,125
Because she is dangerous.

39
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,000
But you're not making any sense!

I cannot intervene in this

Why in the world would I wanna
do something so terrible?!

[ZEFIRIS]
Please do it quickly.

Otherwise, thy brother

have to apologize to that girl!

Are you telling me Cz is more
important to you than me?!

66

Pacifica, do you have any idea

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,916
of how badly you could've
hurt Cz just now?

68

But you're not listening to me!

What's wrong with you?
Don't you trust me anymore?

70

You swore that you'd protect me,
but you don't care about me!

00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,791
All you care about
is your stupid promise

and making yourself feel good!

73

you can feel superior

by protecting them!

I don't matter to

I'm a little surprised.

You and Shannon don't
usually fight like this.

88
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,416
The two of you
should talk things out.

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,833
Especially at a time like this.

You think so, Raquel?

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,750
[RAQUEL]
Of course.

92
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,541
Because Shannon doesn't know
what to do about it either.

Raquel, can I talk to you?

Now wait just a second, Shannon!

How could you decide
without asking us first?!

100
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,583
We've already decided.

Well, yeah...
It happens sometimes.

00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,166
Is because of Cz?

111

No, Cz, it's not your fault.

we're all to blame

[SHANNON] I wanted to
ask you something, Cz.

Would you like to stay
with us for good?

The problem is,
if you stay with us,

00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,958
you might just get
yourself killed.

will come around.

163
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,541
What is this?

164
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,458
That's for Pacifica.

165
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,041
[PACIFICA]
Of all the stupid...

166
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,625
He wants to use these
to make up with me?

167
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,208
He didn't really put much
thought into it, did he?

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,791
[SHANNON]
Do you like them?

169
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,791
Cz spotted them first.

170
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,083
She was the one who
picked them out for you.

171
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,041
The lady said they have
prayers of bonds in them.

172
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,250
Prayers that we would
always be together.

173
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,291
That even if we were separated,
we would eventually be reunited.

174
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,166
[SHANNON] Pacifica...
I'm sorry about everything.

175
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,333
[PACIFICA]
Mm-mm.

176
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you, Shannon.

177
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,916
Where is Cz?

178
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,541
[RAQUEL]
You mean she isn't with you?

179
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,791
[RAQUEL] I'm not picking
up anybody nearby.

180
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,458
[RAQUEL]
Where're you going?

181
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,791
[PACIFICA]
Where do you think, Raquel?

182
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,458
I'm gonna go look for her!

183
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,125
[RAQUEL]
Are you sure you want to?

184
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,208
I wonder sometimes.

185
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,708
I wonder if I'll turn out to be
a big sister like you, Raquel.

186
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,541
[RAQUEL]
Cz! Where are you?!

187
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,208
Where are you, Cz?!
Answer me, please!

188
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,916
[ZEFIRIS] What a sorry
sight you are, my master.

189
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,625
[SHANNON]
Zefiris.

190
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,208
I've had difficulties
of my own as well.

191
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,083
I was able to manifest
myself on this side earlier,

192
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,083
but I encountered
some interference.

193
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,541
What interference?

194
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,291
[ZEFIRIS] I have been
unable to speak with you

195
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,291
unless you are a
certain distance away

196
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,916
from that little girl.

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,833
Wait a minute, are you telling
me you know about Cz?

198
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,166
[ZEFIRIS]
Of course I do.

199
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,375
That little girl's original
designation is C-Z.

200
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,958
She is an artillery-type
Peacemaker.

201
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,000
[gasps]

202
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,958
[sobbing]

203
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,083
[PACIFICA]
Cz!

204
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,458
[gasps]

205
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,083
[PACIFICA]
Cz, where are you?!

206
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,416
Answer me!

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
[PACIFICA]
Cz!

208
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,083
Wait a minute! Cz, come back!

209
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,750
[PACIFICA]
Gotcha...

210
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,583
I finally caught you...

211
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,500
[PACIFICA]
Well...

212
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,541
I'm not really sure
what to say now, uh...

213
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,666
I'm so sorry... I guess
I was being a big jerk.

214
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,708
You don't have to leave
if you don't want to.

215
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,708
When you think about it,
Shannon and Raquel and I

216
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,375
lead pretty complicated
lives already.

217
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,791
Having one more person along

218
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,791
won't make that big
of a difference.

219
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,375
But I...

220
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,583
From now on, Cz, I want you to
call me your big sister, okay?

221
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,625
My big sister?

222
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,208
[PACIFICA]
Let's stay together.

223
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,875
It's a promise, okay?

224
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,208
[PACIFICA]
Now, now, don't cry...

225
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,666
Come on, let's go home.

226
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:44,041
[STEYR] I'm sorry to interrupt
this touching scene...

227
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,041
...but I'll take that child
back, if you don't mind.

228
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,291
[PACIFICA]
Who're you?

229
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,750
Who am I, you ask?

230
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,000
I am known as Peacemaker
Steyr Civilian.

231
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,166
Peacemaker...?

232
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,375
[ZEFIRIS] Humans are unable to
defy the will of a Peacemaker.

233
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,791
Pacifica Cassul is the lone
exception to that rule.

234
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,166
However, at present, her
power only manifests itself

235
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,958
at times of extreme
fear or anger.

236
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,833
That is the reason
why you were unable

237
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,500
to defy the will
of that girl Cz.

238
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,958
What're you talking about?

239
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,291
[ZEFIRIS] If Cz had
awakened to her true form

240
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,500
while she was with you,

241
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,833
she would've killed
all of you immediately.

242
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,333
But as long as she retains
the human attributes

243
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,166
of her child-like avatar,

244
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,958
I am unable to
physically touch her.

245
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,375
I suggested to Pacifica Cassul
that she eliminate Cz,

246
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,666
but it would seem that
she has not done so.

247
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,416
[gasps]

248
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,291
I had no choice, master.

249
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,541
That little girl is
far too dangerous.

250
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,500
[SHANNON] That's crazy.
Cz isn't like that!

251
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,125
[ZEFIRIS] The emotion
that you're feeling now

252
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,875
was manipulated by Cz.

253
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,250
[gasps]

254
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,750
You're wrong...

255
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,583
You're wrong. I'm
not being controlled.

256
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,166
[ZEFIRIS] We can speak of
this later, my master.

257
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,291
It would seem that another
Peacemaker is here.

258
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,125
It is now with Cz and
your younger sister.

259
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,375
[gasps]

260
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,916
[STEYR] To be perfectly
honest, I'm surprised.

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,958
You people were the last ones
I excepted to take her in.

262
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,333
I mean, after all,

263
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,583
don't you know that
little girl is one of us?

264
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,875
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

265
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,916
[STEYR]
Shall I explain it to you?

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,958
Peacemakers were originally
designed to work in pairs.

267
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,166
The artillery-type Peacemakers
are typically too powerful

268
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,666
and difficult to use,

269
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,916
so they were kept stored
in a data-compressed state

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,791
in phase-shift space.

271
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,291
We had initiated the
decompression algorithms

272
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,750
in order to have them
to fight against Zefiris.

273
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,291
What? I don't understand
what you're talking about.

274
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,666
[STEYR]
Originally,

275
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,666
Galil had been chosen to
be that girl's counterpart,

276
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,000
but he got careless

277
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,166
and allowed himself to be
destroyed by you people.

278
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,708
So after she was decompressed,

279
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,250
she was tossed
out into the world

280
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,125
without knowing who she was
or what was happening.

281
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,083
I wasn't left with
much of a choice,

282
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,875
so I came looking
for her in his place.

283
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,333
Come to me now, Cz.

284
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,583
That girl's your enemy,
don't you remember?

285
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,333
What? Why don't you ask
her how she feels about it?

286
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,500
[STEYR] Because it doesn't
really matter, does it?

287
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,916
Cz, get out of here
now. Go, quickly!

288
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,708
[gasps]

289
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,291
[STEYR]
Come now.

290
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,500
It's time fo you to return to
your proper form, my darling Cz.

291
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,750
[gasps]

292
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,833
[PACIFICA]
Cz!

293
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,833
Big Sister, help!

294
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,750
Cz!

295
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,208
Big Sister! Help me!

296
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:43,916
[gasps]

297
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,791
[STEYR]
How are you feeling, Cz?

298
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,958
Steyr, it's you.

299
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,041
If you are meeting me
instead of Galil,

300
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,000
then someone
must've killed him.

301
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,666
[STEYR] Yes. In fact,
the one who did it was him.

302
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,750
[SHANNON]
Pacifica!

303
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,458
[PACIFICA gasps]

304
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,833
Big Brother! Big Sister!

305
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,500
[RAQUEL]
Pacifica!

306
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,333
[SHANNON]
Where's Cz?!

307
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,166
[PACIFICA]
I don't know!

308
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,125
Who are those two?

309
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know that either!

310
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,500
What did you do with Cz?!
Tell us: Where did she go?!

311
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,125
[ZEFIRIS]
As you can see now,

312
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,250
Cz has become one
of our enemies.

313
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,375
[PACIFICA]
No!

314
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,458
You're wrong! She
can't be our enemy!

315
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,875
Forgive me, my master.
I must borrow your body.

316
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,416
[RAQUEL]
Pacifica...

317
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,500
We must be careful.

318
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,750
It seems the fusion of
Zefiris and her D-Knight

319
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,291
has already been completed.

320
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,958
Still, the Dragoon's restoration
remains incomplete.

321
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,333
There are gaps in her mental
unification with the D-Knight.

322
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,791
[SHANNON, ZEFIRIS]
Same goes for you.

323
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,875
You just been
decompressed, after all.

324
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,666
I doubt your powers
have been fine-tuned.

325
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,208
If you overexert yourself,

326
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,458
you could trigger
an atomic collapse.

327
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,375
Then I won't need
to destroy you.

328
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,875
That's a possibility.

329
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,791
But if I was able to
start a chain reaction,

330
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,583
then maybe I could take you
along with me when I go.

331
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,708
Would you care to give it a try?

332
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,250
I'm very sorry, but
I have no intention

333
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,333
of getting into a fight
with you today.

334
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,166
Well, are you ready to go, Cz?

335
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,875
[SHANNON, ZEFIRIS]
You're not getting away!

336
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,000
[STEYR]
You have my word, Guardian.

337
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,583
The next time we meet,

338
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,791
I will make sure to destroy you
and put you out of your misery.

339
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,333
[SHANNON] According
to what Zefiris told me,

340
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,666
there's almost no chance

341
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,208
that any of Cz's original
child-like personality

342
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:32,333
could still exist inside
that Peacemaker.

343
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,750
She also said that
the next time we meet,

344
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,791
Cz will do her best
to try to kill us,

345
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,000
and we should defend ourselves.

346
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,625
[PACIFICA] Do you really
think that there's no way

347
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,958
to turn her back
to her old self?

348
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,291
I thought I finally
had a little sister.

349
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,666
I thought it might
be kinda nice

350
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,208
to get to act like a
big sister for once.

351
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,708
I was just getting
used to the idea.

352
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,208
And now you tell me
that Cz is gone.

353
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,000
[RAQUEL] Travelling a snowy
road in the mountains,

354
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,458
Pacifica and the others
stumble across a village

355
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,958
hidden by magic.

356
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,333
The villagers who come out

357
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,500
don't seem to be very happy
to see them, however.

358
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,791
Maybe they just
don't like people.

359
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,791
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

360
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,500
"Requiem for the Heretics."

361
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,833
See you next time!
