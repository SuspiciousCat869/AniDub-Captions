Pacifica... is the
Scrapped Princess...?

00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,750
[PACIFICA]
Say, Raquel?

3
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,791
[RAQUEL]
Hmm?

4
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,666
It's tough to have to
sit and wait, isn't it?

5
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,708
[PACIFICA]
I'm useless.

6
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,500
I can't do anything
right, not even cook.

7
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:18,041
Come forth, Mr. Soopie!
A multitude of you!

8
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,000
Raquel, what're you doing?

9
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,458
[RAQUEL]
Hmm...

10
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,583
I thought it might be fun
if Mr. Soopie came along

11
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,291
to help us out with--

12
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,458
I'll do it myself, just get
rid of these guys, okay?

13
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,500
[RAQUEL giggles]

14
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,416
[CHRIS] I can't have my valuable
hostage catching cold now.

15
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,125
I don't know if they'll
rescue me. They may not come.

16
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,958
They might decide that I'm not
worth it and abandon me here.

17
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:08,125
After all... that's
what always happens.

18
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,625
Even when my parents died,

19
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,583
none of my relatives could
be bothered to take me in.

20
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,416
The innkeeper felt sorry for me,
so he let me work there.

21
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,333
I've never had any
real family or friends.

22
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,541
[CHRIS] You want me
to feel sorry for you?

23
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,125
At least you're able to
remember your parent's faces.

24
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,125
Ever since I was a little kid,
I've been in Special Ops.

25
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,125
There was no one I could
count on or protect,

26
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,125
and I followed orders
and focused on training

27
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,458
and risking my life.

28
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,875
Of course, even if I did die,

29
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,916
I don't think anyone
would remember me.

30
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,416
Are you crying?

31
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,458
[CHRIS]
Crying? Who, me?

32
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,166
Not likely.

33
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,416
Then why...?

34
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,875
[WINIA gasps]

35
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,583
So soft... So warm...

36
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,458
You sure are persistent.

37
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,958
It irritates me just
to look at you people!

38
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,958
You say that you're
protecting the princess

39
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,041
that will destroy
this world, and yet,

40
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,875
you waste your time coming here
to save a girl you hardly know!

41
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,666
You don't even have
the guts or ruthlessness

42
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,291
to kill your assassins,

43
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,541
and you think you can protect
the Scrapped Princess?!

44
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,208
What's the point
of protecting her?

45
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,916
What do you hope to accomplish?!

46
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,041
[CHRIS] You're just reveling
in the self-satisfaction

47
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,208
of protecting your
poor little sister!

48
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,541
You could be right about that.

[WINIA]
No!

52
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,875
Don't do it!

53
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,541
You're just jealous
of them, aren't you?!

54
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,750
Of those who protect each other
and those who are protected!

55
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,250
That's just what I
expected; you're weak!

56
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,500
You'll be better off
killing me, ya know.

57
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,041
[SHANNON]
But I'm not going to.

58
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,041
[SHANNON] There's something
inside me that tells me

59
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,583
if I killed someone
to protect her,

60
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,458
then she really would become
the trigger of the apocalypse.

61
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,416
[SHANNON] At the very least,
my sister is the type of person

62
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,750
who would blame herself
if somebody ever got hurt

63
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,958
because of her.

64

[CHRIS]
Victory is yours.

65
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,250
If that's what you think, then
never show your face again.

You, too, Miss.
You're free to go.

Please, leave.

68
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,208
[WINIA] I was jealous
of them too, you know.

69
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,250
Because I've always been alone.

00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,083
[PEACEMAKER]
So he failed.

You are more formidable
than I thought, Guardian.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,541
It is we, the Purgers
of the Church of Mauser,

73
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,208
who will consign the
Scrapped Princess to oblivion.

74
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,750
We could leave these matters
to the Royal Forces,

75
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,958
but they do not comprehend
the state of affairs.

Prepare, for I shall now
bestow true power upon you.

of our god Mauser,

become ye now truly one.

I'm sorry that I
didn't tell you.

I thought it would

But you're the one who told us
to have a meal waiting for you.

This will let me work
hard again all day today!

Why are you here, sir?

125
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,791
Does this mean that Blackhawk
is also making its move

126
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,750
to eliminate the
Scrapped Princess?

127
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,791
[STURM]
Yeah.

128
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,208
They've already
infiltrated the city

129
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,666
in order to gather
more intelligence.

130
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,083
And if worst came to worst,

131
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,125
we were supposed to eliminate
any and all witnesses

132
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,000
to keep word of this spreading.

133
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,083
We were to attack once
the Scrapped Princess

134

had left the city.

That was the plan, anyway.

from the capital, however.

[CHRIS]
What is it?

138
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,541
The church has
unilaterally decided

139
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,416
to send Purgers into this city.

140
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,875
They sent Purgers?

141
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,916
[STURM] Plus, they're
carrying papal documents

telling them to
eliminate this town

143

along with the
Scrapped Princess.

144

Destroy the entire city?

145
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,500
They must be out of their minds.

146
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,541
Our mission has changed as well.

147
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,125
We are to abort

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,000
and simply observe
their activity.

I'll go and help relay
the change in orders.

00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,250
She didn't...
even say goodbye...

160
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,500
[LEO] Once we're married,
I wonder if every morning...

161
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,291
...she's gonna make me...

162
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,291
...a breakfast as big as that.

163
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,833
Stay focused!

164
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,291
Is something wrong, Shannon?

165
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,583
We've got company. Get inside.

166
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,625
Huh?

167
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,583
We'll make a break for it!

168
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,916
I bring a priority message
from Major Sturm.

169
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,416
Code Crimson, 0037.

170
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,083
[SHANNON]
Hey, didn't I tell you

171
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,291
never to show your
face again, Axe Boy?

172
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,500
[CHRIS] Actually, I prefer
to be called Chris.

173
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,666
I'll smack you, you little brat!

174
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,916
Hey, Shannon?

175
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,000
More importantly, the city
is in serious trouble now.

176
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:31,041
[VILLAGERS screaming]

177
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,625
[RAQUEL] God or demon,
be ye here destroyed!

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,166
That's quite impressive.

179
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,041
Is this any time
for compliments?

180
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,791
Well, my orders are
simply to stand by

181
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,125
and observe what happens here.

182
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,791
Wait! Shannon!

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,416
Could this be what Zefiris
was talking about?

184
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,500
[VOICE] Hear me, humans.
Listen and obey.

185
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:07,458
By all that is holy,
I order you, destroy it.

186
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:14,041
Destroy the seed of destruction.
Its name is Pacifica Cassul.

187
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,416

No... No way...

00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,083
Shannon! Raquel, wake up!

[VOICE]
Destroy.

196
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,375
Why are you doing this? Raquel?

197
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,500
Why are you listening
to what that voice says?

198
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,541
Why are you two obeying him?

No...

[PACIFICA]
No... This can't be happening...

206
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,500
No!

Big Brother..

Yeah.

[GALIL]
Pacifica Cassul...

215
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,375
So, thou art truly the one.

00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,416
Pacifica!

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,416
[GALIL] In that case, I shall
merely swallow up any and all

218
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,125
who know of thee.

I can't attack now!
Not like this!

Stop it... Make it stop!

Chris!

223
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,500
If you don't take out the
core, you'll never stop it.

224
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,791
But... what about the people
who've been swallowed?

225
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,333
[CHRIS]
I told you before, didn't I?

226
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,708
If you wanna protect one person,

227
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,375
you have to be prepared
to kill another!

228

Regardless of what
you might believe!

229
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,708
[PACIFICA] No... I can't stand
this... I can't watch anymore...

230
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:14,291
This is all my fault...
This is all because of me...

gonna destroy the world, right?!

00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,958
If that's the truth, then
you should just kill me!

The duty of Peacemakers

is to safeguard

[ZEFIRIS]
Well done.

That was most likely a proxy
sent by a Peacemaker.

I'm impressed you stood up to
that creature in human form.

00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,583
That is the reason
you are the poison

that will destroy the world.
