Go.

164
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,416
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, sir!

165
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,250
Pacifica!

166
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,083
[SOLDIER B]
Stand back!

167
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,083
Are you all right, Pacifica?

168
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,541
Furet...

169
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,500
What's that?

170
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,250
[PACIFICA]
Oh! I'm sorry, sir.

171
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,000
[SHANNON] Pacifica...
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,375
Huh? It's just--

173
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,083
Are you saying the two of us
have met somewhere before?

174
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,000
[gasps]

175
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,833
Please, General,
go ahead and continue

176
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,416
with what you were saying.

177
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,833
Where have I seen you before?

178
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,125
Never mind. Now, I see.

179
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,208
You must have used your

180
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,500
Peacemaker mind
control just now.

181
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,416
I've heard that I should
avoid looking in your eyes.

182
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,750
[PETERS-STAHL] Our forces are
already making preparations

183
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,500
to begin our invasion
of the Giat Empire.

184
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,541
We will start with
Giat and then bring

185
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,458
all the surrounding countries
under our rule, one by one.

186
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,958
We have the power to
make this a reality.

187
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,875
And should our D-Knight
friend choose to assist us,

188
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,666
it would only be a matter of
time before we rule the world.

189
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,416
In other words, we don't
really the Peacemakers to

190
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,541
take any action to assist
us in achieving our goal.

191
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,875
You need only grant
us your tacit approval

192
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,708
for our complete
domination of the world.

193
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,333
In return for your
neutrality in this matter,

194
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,125
we pledge that we will strictly
control the Scrapped Princess

195
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,416
and guarantee that she will
never become a threat to you.

196
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,125
It seems that your
stupidity knows no bounds.

197
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,416
Excuse me?

198
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
[CZ] What we want is
the destruction of the

199
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,333
Scrapped Princess,
not her captivity.

200
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,333
You humans have no
choice in the matter.

201
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,833
You'll control her? A mere
human thinks he has that power?

202
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,541
You forget your place.

203
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,750
[PETERS-STAHL]
Perhaps.

204
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,333
But your kind are
still afraid of a

205
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,458
"mere" human girl,
are they not?

206
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,125
She is a bad influence.

207
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,250
And as such,
we must eliminate her.

208
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,875
Whether or not we
fear her is irrelevant.

209
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,416
[PETERS-STAHL]
Hm...

210
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,375
But as long as the Scrapped
Princess is in our possession,

211
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,041
it should be difficult for
you to move against us.

212
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,083
Therefore, we suggest that
you acquiesce to our demands.

213
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,583
[STEYR giggles]

214
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,916
You find that amusing?

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,458
[STEYR]
Yes, I do.

216
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,833
I never imagined that you would
dance to my tune this well.

217
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,833
Very nicely done.
You deserve applause.

218
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,291
Huh?

219
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,166
Wait a minute, you planned this?

220
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,666
[STEYR] Of course, Cz.
Don't you understand?

221
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,541
These foolish humans
have managed to

222
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,583
flip the switch
all by themselves.

223
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,291
The reset switch, that is.

224
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,166
It's being deliberated in
the system as we speak,

225
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,458
but the outcome is certain.

226
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,958
You should've waged your
little war of conquest

227
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,000
within your designated limits.

228
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,958
In the event that a group of
fools like you get the notion

229
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,791
in your heads to try and use
the power of the Peacemakers

230
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,000
for your own worthless ends,

231
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,958
we are granted the
following authority:

232
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,125
We can return human
civilization to a blank slate.

233
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,083
[PETERS-STAHL]
Huh...?

234
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,458
[STEYR]
Please rest assured,

235
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,750
you aren't going to be
wiped out completely.

236
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,916
We're just going to cull
90% of the human race.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,125
You bastards!

238
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,750
It's a common practice.

239
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,208
You're supposed to prune a
garden to keep it healthy.

240
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,208
You humans do it all the time.

241
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:58,333
Honestly, humanity is such
a troublesome little species.

242
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,500
It looks like the system
has granted its approval.

How impudent!

This is divine punishment.

261
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,208
Punishment against
humanity which

262
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,541
allowed the Scrapped Princess
to live for 16 years.

I ordered her to be killed

while she was still a baby.

You mean you're still

The world is ending and
it's all because of her.

288
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,000
Are you implying that this
one girl is more worthy to live

than everyone else
in the entire world?

how will you be
saving this world?

Is a world that
kills little girls

really worth more than her?

How am I supposed to give
a damn about a world

that won't even tolerate the
existence of my little sister?

I can't protect the world.

I'm not a god, or a Peacemaker,
for that matter.

If you're telling
me to choose between

killing my sister
or protecting her...

Don't play dumb.

You gave the humans more
