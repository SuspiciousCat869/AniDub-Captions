[COLETTE]
How horrible.

2
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,333
The demon that destroyed
the capital has returned.

3
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,291
No, you are mistaken Colette.

4
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,541
That is one of god's
divine messengers.

5
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,958
What?

6
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,208
[HOGUE] Please, Colette.
Let me confess my sins to you.

[COLETTE]
Cardinal Hogue!

00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,625
[RAQUEL]
Pacifica.

00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,083
Pacifica!

10
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,250
[SENES] Looks like you're
having some trouble.

11
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,791
[SHANNON]
Senes! You're with me.

12
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,666
Pacifica's been stabbed.
We don't have a second to lose.

13
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,041
She's what?!

14
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,666
[SHANNON]
Dammit.

15
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,416
Hurry! Let's take
cover by those rocks.

There they are!

Huh?

00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,000
Uh?!

[EIROTE]
Who are you?

00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,708
The introductions can wait.

23
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,666
It looks like we should
get out of this place

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,000
while we still can.

[SOLDIER B groans]

Fafal!

Why won't the bleeding stop?!

Somebody!

Please forgive my little sister.

Please forgive Pacifica!

--[SHANNON] Pacifica. Pacifica!

Is that all you've got?

[RAQUEL]
Why... Why?!

I couldn't do anything
to save her...

54
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,791
I couldn't do anything
to save her.

What's this? What's going on?

65
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,458
[ZEFIRIS]
I don't know.

66
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,583
It looks like we've been thrown
clear of the atmosphere.

67
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,291
[CZ] The sealed world has gone
into autistic mode... But why?

68
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,125
[SOCOM]
This was not anticipated.

69
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,333
I am unable to
contact the system.

70
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,541
I will therefore release the
restrictions on our powers.

everything you've got!

00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,916

[PACIFICA]
Is this place... heaven?

90
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,708
[CELIA] This is a virtual
reality location

91
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,833
that's been created
within the free space

92
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,416
of the sealed world's
control system.

93
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,875
You've left the vessel of
your physical body behind you

94
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,583
and entered into the
heart of the system

95
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,208
that controls your world.

96
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,958
What the heck are
you doing here?!

97
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,666
Wait, does that mean
that you're dead, too?!

98
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,875
Who are you?

00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,500
You can call me Celia.

I am Celia Mauser.

You're Lord Mauser?

[ZEFIRIS]
Hey Shannon. Are you all right?

103
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,708
[SHANNON]
What about Pacifica?!

104
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,250
What's happened to our world?!

105
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,041
[ZEFIRIS] It's functions have
been completely locked down

106
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,833
for some reason.

107
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,291
My links to Natalie have
been cut off as well.

108
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,333
[grunts]

109
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,541
Does that mean... you're god?

110
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,625
Me a god? No.
I'm just a traitor.

111
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,791
I'm the one who locked up
humanity in this world.

112
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,833
It's just...

113
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,250
[CELIA]
I know.

114
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,708
You were born for the sole
purpose of destroying me.

115
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,000
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

116
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,708
Over the past 16 years,

117
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,833
your body has built up the
power needed to destroy me.

118
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,125
That immense power was
designed to be released

119
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,375
at the moment of your death.

120
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,583
Wait, so then I was supposed to
destroy you as soon as I died?

121
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,375
[CELIA] However, that seems to
have happened 10 hours short

122
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,041
of your power reaching its peak.

123
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,291
At this moment,
your powers and mine

124
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,458
are caught in
precise equilibrium,

125
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,875
and because of that,

126
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,833
the slightest nudge could
cause the balance to shift

127
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,125
in either direction.

128
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:11,916
That is why I want you to
make the final decision.

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
[PACIFICA]
Uh?

130
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,166
[CELIA]
Long before you were born,

131
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,875
back in the time
of the ancients,

132
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,666
humanity fought a terrible war.

133
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,375
The war dragged on
for years and years,

134
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,000
and many people died
because of it.

135
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,541
It was then, in the
midst of that slaughter,

136
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,500
that I received a
message from the enemy.

137
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,791
They wanted me to supply
them with information

138
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,583
on humanity's forces,

139
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,875
so they could end the war
and preserve the human race.

140
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,250
From the enemy's point of view,

141
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,083
human beings were a rare
and precious form of life.

142
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,708
[CELIA]
They were trying to find a way

143
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:55,208
to save a species that seemed
bent on self-destruction.

144
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,875
I did as they asked and
gave them the information.

145
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,000
I thought that if something
wasn't done soon,

146
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,416
I would eventually lose
my brother and sister.

147
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,083
After that, all of humanity

148
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,541
was locked away in
this sealed world,

149
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,000
and I was implanted
into the system's core

150
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,791
as their caretaker.

151
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,541
I have tended this
miniature garden

152
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,416
for more than 5,000 years now.

153
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,125
[PACIFICA gasps]

154
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,291
[CELIA]
My younger brother and sister.

155
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,583
All I wanted was to keep
the two of them alive.

156
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,208
I did all of this for them.

157
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:41,250
Even if humanity was
locked away forever,

158
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,958
it was enough for
me if they survived.

159
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,916
However, I was too late.

160
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:54,166
[BECKNAM] Zefy, please.
I want you to survive.

161
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,291
[ZEFIRIS]
Lord Becknam, no!

162
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,750
The enemy has discovered
our tactical patterns!

163
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,541
Zefiris! Gloria! Natalie!

164
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,083
All surviving units, retreat
into phase space immediately!

165
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,791
[gasps, yelps]

166
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,791
[CELIA] I just wanted my
brother and sister to survive.

167
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,083
Truly. That is all I wanted.

168
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,000
This is the body you possess
in the physical world.

169
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,083
[CELIA] The vessel that you have
inhabited for 140,150 hours.

170
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,375
I want you to make the decision.

171
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,958
Decision?

172
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,500
I'd like for you to decide

173
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,750
whether this world should
continue as it is.

174
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,916
I'm no longer certain
I made the right choice.

175
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,500
I don't know, either!

176
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,958
All this stuff about humanity
and the world is so...

177
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,958
[CELIA] Just tell me
what your heart says.

178
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,083
[gasps]

179
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,458
Do you honestly feel
what I did was wrong?

180
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,875
I'm not sure.

181
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,750
I think I understand
what you did.

182
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,250
I have a brother and sister
that I care about, too.

183
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,833
If there was something
I could do that would

184
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,250
keep the two of them
safe from harm,

185
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:22,541
I think I would have to do it,
no matter what it was.

186
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,208
I'd try to help them,

187
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:28,375
even if it took thousands or
tens of thousands of years.

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,625
[PACIFICA] And yet, even if
people could live safely

189
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,125
inside that closed-off
world like that,

190
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,083
I still think there would
be something wrong

191
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,083
about it somehow.

192
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,291
Even if someone
chooses the wrong path,

193
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,083
it was something
they chose themselves

194
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,166
and it's their responsibility.

195
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,500
That means you're free to make
your own decisions in life.

196
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,833
Having to live in a world

197
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,750
where you can't make
your own decisions,

198
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,958
that sort of a world is
just so wrong to me.

199
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,500
I suppose it is.

200
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,041
[laughs]
Does that answer your question?

201
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,333
[CELIA]
Thank you.

202
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,958
Now I can finally be set free.

203
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,625
Huh? Set free? But...

204
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,708
Hey, wait!

205
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,416
I'm sorry! I take it all back!

206
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,000
[CELIA]
It's all right.

207
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,708
I am finally free now to join
my little brother and sister.

208
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,083
But Celia...

209
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:25,583
Farewell to you,
Pacifica Cassul.

210
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,625

[gasps]

213
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,500
[CELIA] Hear me now,
humanity, and listen.

214
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,083
[CELIA]
I am Mauser.

215
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:23,375
Sheathe your restless swords
and withdraw your soldiers.

216
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,375
The seed of destruction
has passed you by.

217
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,208
The terrible poison you
have feared for so long

218
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:35,583
will never again wreak
its havoc upon your world.

219
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,416
The doors have now been opened.

220
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,875
Humanity...

221
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,166
I return to you
now your freedom.

222
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,791
I give you new lands.

223
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,250
And let you behold
the true sky above you.

224
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,000
[CELIA] There will be
no more revelations.

225
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,625
No more prophesies.

226
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,541
From now on, you will have to
walk hand-in-hand with others,

227
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,083
and choose your own destiny.

228
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,875
[CELIA] Mauser is not
in the heavens above you.

229
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,750
Divinity is within
your own hearts.

230
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:19,291
Now is the time for you
to weave your own future,

231
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,958
and decide your own fate.

00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,541
Hey, big brother.

You little twerp!

I used to bathe you
when were a kid,

241
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,125
so who cares if you're naked?!

242
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,541
[PACIFICA] Well, you should be
able to look right at me, then.

See?! You can't even look at me!

You closet perv!

[SHANNON] How about a little
embarrassment with your anger,

you shameless princess!

[PACIFICA] How dare you
call me that, you pedophile?!

Look! His wound.

I'm back, Sis.

But, I...

Come.

00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,291
Please stand up, Prince Forsyth.

General?

259
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,875
Are we stopping by the Cassuls'?

260
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,041
They said they're coming later.

00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,458
C'mon Miss Pacifica,

265
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,166
Prince Forsyth's coronation
ceremony is tomorrow.

266
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,125
Princess Senes and
her people are waiting,

267
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,916
and the Bairachs left
for Castle Sauer ages ago.

268
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,583
[PACIFICA grunts] Dragunov's
about to go into labor.

269
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,708
I can't just leave her
at a time like this!

270
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,291
Yeah, but--

271
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,208
Oh, tell Forsyth I'll make sure
to come to his next one, okay?

272
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,458
To the next one?

273
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,458
Pacifica, what's the
holdup over there?!

274
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,541
Please hurry up
with the firewood!

275
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,291
Sure! I'll be right there.

276
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,833
You better shake
a leg, Pacifica.

277
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,083
I know already! I heard.

278
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,041
Okay. Let's see here...

279
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,750
[LEO] Miss Pacifica.
Are you happy now?

280
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,083
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

281
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,541
[PACIFICA chuckles]
I guess so.

282
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,333
It's peaceful, and every
day is lots of fun.

283
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,791
It's not all wine
and roses, but still...

284
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,458
It's not like I have
to form an opinion

285
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,458
on my whole life
right now though.

286
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,000
Maybe that's what really
matters in the end.

287
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,791
Being able to look
back over your life

288
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,916
when you're on your deathbed,
and say to yourself,

289
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,500
"You know, it wasn't half bad."

290
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,708
You know what?

291
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,166
I'm sort of glad I was born
as the Scrapped Princess.

292
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,083
I had to go through lots
of painful stuff, but,

293
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,625
I went to all kinds of places
and met all sorts of people.

294
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,375
And if I weren't the
Scrapped Princess,

295
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,208
then the two of us probably
would never have met.

296
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,250
[PACIFICA]
Hm?

297

00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,041
Oh.

299
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,916
Whenever I wear this,
I feel protected somehow.

300
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,208
Miss Pacifica.

301
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,458
I'm going to ask
you one more time.

302
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,666
Huh?

303
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,750
[LEO] Please do the
honor of marrying me.

304
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,041
Uh... Ah!

305
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,000
Ow. That hurt.

306
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,625
You are so out of your league,
you big loser! Hmph!

307
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,666

Huh?

308
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,125
Uh! Wait! Please, come back!

309
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:17,541
I mean it! Honest! I really
do love you, Miss Pacifica!
