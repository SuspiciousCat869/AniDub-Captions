[SHANNON groans]

[ZEFIRIS] If that is
what you wished of me...

...then I will.

Huh...?

Oh, right. I forgot
where we were.

[door hisses]

[RAQUEL]
Good morning, Pacifica.

16
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,416
[PACIFICA]
Morning.

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,041
So, did you sleep well?

18
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,041
No... Not really.

19
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,458
[RAQUEL]
Oh...

20
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,333
[PACIFICA]
Say, Raquel?

21
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,250
[RAQUEL]
Hm?

22
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,833
Tell me something.

23
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,916
What's this war about?

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,541
Hey, maybe you'd like to
freshen up a little bit.

25
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,375
I could draw you a bath.

26
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,708
[PACIFICA]
Huh? I don't see a bath.

27
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,375
It looks to me
like this room here

28
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,666
has everything you'll
need to take a bath.

29
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,291
[PACIFICA]
Hm?

30
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,416
This is their idea of a bath?

31
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,583

[yelps]

33
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,416
What is this crazy thing?
What the heck's going on here?

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,833
Wait a minute!

35
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,416
What's supposed to be
happening now? I don't get it!

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
[yelps]

37
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,208
Quit it! Somebody help me!

38
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,000
[PACIFICA sighs]
Well, that was an ordeal.

39
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,333
Still... It's pretty amazing.

40
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,791
Yeah. It feels like a dream.

41
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,125
This whole place
is unbelievable.

42
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,000
It's almost like
everything on this ship

43
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,708
is beyond our imagination.

44
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,250
--[intercom beeps]
--[SENES] Are you awake?

45
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,916
Would you two mind coming
up here for a minute?

46
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,041
[BOTH]
Huh...?

47
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,500
[PACIFICA] Wow! Look at
the size of that crayfish!

48
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,750
You're wrong.

49
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,625
It's called a lobster.
They're very delicious.

50
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,208
What's the deal?

51
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,958
What do you hope to get out
of us by feeding us like this?

52
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,833
I should warn you right now that
we don't really know anything.

53
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,166
[SENES chuckles]

54
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,375
I didn't expect to get
any information from you.

55
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,958
I just wanted to make sure that

56
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,791
you're still committed
to going back home.

57
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,708
[SHANNON]
Hm?

58
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,625
[CZ]
Come to the capital of Leinwan.

59
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,750
You have a grace
period of 15 days,

60
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:20,333
and 1,000 people will die
every day you are late.

61
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,250
[SENES] Well, I'm headed to
Castle Sauer for my own reasons,

62
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,875
so I guess my asking you is a
bit of a moot point, isn't it?

63
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,541
Still... Are you
sure about all this?

64
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,708
It's not like we
really have a choice.

65
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,666
[SENES]
It's a trap; no doubt about it.

66
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,250
You must've known that this day
would come sooner or later

67
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,250
when you made the
whole world your enemy.

68
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,125
I guess we did.

69
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,750
[EIROTE] Besides Steyr,
two additional Artillery-types

70
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,958
will most likely be waiting
for you at the Capital.

71
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,916
There's also a chance
the people at the Capital

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,875
have been turned into proxies.

73
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,541
[SENES] You don't have
a prayer of winning.

74
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,458
Not when Steyr gave you so
much trouble by herself.

75
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,125
I don't intend to go down
without a fight, however.

76
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,583
I'm sure you don't.

77
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,291
But it seems foolish to go
riding in on this fortress.

78
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,083
You'll just escalate
the situation.

79
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,250
It's been escalating
for a very long time.

80
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,291
The fate of the world hinges
on what's going to happen next.

81
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,083
Although to you two,
it might seem like

82
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,458
you're just trying to
protect your little sister.

83
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,916
Are you sure you're one to talk?

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,250
It seems to me that
you're doing all of this

85
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,375
just because you're
out for revenge.

86
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,916
[SHANNON]
You're heading to Castle Sauer

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
after dropping off
most of your men.

88
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,750
That's not a very rational
decision in my book.

89
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,083
[SENES]
I won't deny that.

90
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going to avenge my men.

91
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,916
I can't think of any
better reason to go,

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
off the top of my head.

93
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,208
If you'd like, we could still
drop you off on land somewhere.

94
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,541
[SENES] Hey, Shannon Cassul,
tell me something.

95
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,583
What will you do if your
little sister is killed?

96
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,916
Raquel Cassul, what about you?

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,291
[RAQUEL chuckles]
It's very simple.

98
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,041
We'll never let that happen.

99
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,625
Huh. That's a good answer.

100
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,291
However, you should
face the facts.

101
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,750
You're about to walk straight
into the jaws of death

102
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,833
for the sake of a
thousand total strangers.

103
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,250
[chuckles]

104
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,250
[PACIFICA]
But we have to go.

105
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,541
We don't have any idea what
we're supposed to do anymore.

106
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,500
And I certainly can't
seem to figure out

107
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,875
what the right thing
to do is all the time.

108
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,291
But still...

109
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,625
Nothing will change
if we don't go.

110
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,375
If we do go, things might
work out for the best.

111
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,958
That's why, we have to go.

112
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,458
"Might" work out? I see.

113
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,041
You can't rally
the troops to fight

114
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,791
with something that
"might" work.

115
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,750
Well, I guess I don't
have much choice.

116
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,000
The Skid will continue with
its raid on Castle Sauer.

117
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,875
Is that all right with you?

118
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,291
Have the three of you
ever given any thought

119
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,708
to how this continent
actually got its name?

120
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,083
"Dustvin"...

121
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,708
I believe it meant "garbage can"
in the old language.

122
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,958
I dunno who came up with
that name originally,

123
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,500
but it's a pretty insulting
thing to be called, huh?

124
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,208
Humanity's been locked up in
this trash can of a world,

125
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,000
and now we're supposed
to rot like compost.

126
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,833
What do you mean
we're locked up?

127
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,500
[EIROTE] The creatures from
the Genesis myths that

128
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,416
the Church of Mauser likes
to refer to as "demons"

129
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,000
were actually the Dark Lord
Browning and his faction,

130
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,291
who created powerful weapons.

131
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,541
Wait a second. Let me
make sure I've got this.

132
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,375
The one's who fought the gods
were our distant ancestors?

133
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,500
[SENES]
That's right.

134
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,333
Long ago, ancient humans fought

135
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,333
what the Church of Mauser
calls "God" and lost.

136
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,875
[EIROTE]
Humanity was sealed away

137
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,875
and is now ruled by
the Church of Mauser.

138
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,208
We are under the constant
observation of the Peacemakers

139
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,375
who have reigned for
the last 5,000 years.

140
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,250
Back then, Browning and his
followers had access to power

141
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,958
that we can't even dream of.

142
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,625
In other words, this Skid
here as well as the Dragoons

143
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,291
are weapons created
by our ancestors.

144
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,791
All of humanity's original
knowledge and civilization

145
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,208
were stolen long ago.

146
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,916
And human beings
were restricted to

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
living only on this
continent of Dustvin.

148
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,500
In the intervening millennia,

149
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:59,500
humans forgot that they had
been sealed into this world.

150
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,541
Our current civilization
is modeled after

151
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,916
a period of history
called The Middle Ages

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,791
that existed about
6,000 years ago.

153
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,750
Humanity is forbidden from
developing its civilization

154
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,666
while under
Peacemaker observation.

155
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,208
The few remaining human
forces on the outside

156
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,416
have put together a plan
to liberate humanity.

157
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,583
In order for us to break
the seal on this world

158

and finally be set
free from our cage,

159
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,791
we must first defeat
those Peacemakers.

160

[SENES]
Five thousand years ago,

161
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,208
outside humans sent
the genetic code

162
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,166
from the three of
you into this world.

163
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,291
They also sent the Dragoons
who were meant to support you.

164
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,458
Using something called
"genetic engineering,"

165
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,625
your DNA was seeded
throughout this world

166
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,000
according to
precise calculations.

167
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,000
Five thousand years later,
it has borne fruit.

168
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,125
Their scientific efforts
have produced you,

169
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,291
the Providence Breaker
and her Guardians.

170
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,458
[EIROTE] Even the Grendel
Revelations are nothing more

171
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,958
than a regulatory mechanism
for controlling humanity

172
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,416
through the Church of Mauser.

173

[PACIFICA]
Huh?

174
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,833
[SENES]
Your powers allow you to resist

175
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,125
the Peacemakers'
administrative privileges.

176
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,375
Since Providence has
no effect on you,

177
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,500
your will can defeat them.

178
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,500
[EIROTE] In addition,
you can share your resistance

179
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,333
with other people, giving them
the desire to fight.

180
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,666
Also, the Peacemakers
are unable to kill you.

181

They have not been
given the authority

necessary to
terminate your life.

Pacifica Cassul...

It turns out that you're

I'm sorry...

But could you explain
that to me again?

190
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:33,916
From the beginning?

Why you little brat...!

Now, now, Princess Senes.

194
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,916
Fine, to put it in
very simple terms,

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,416
the people who fought and lost
against the gods 5,000 years ago

196
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,625
did not give up.

197
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,125
Through their continued efforts,

198
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,083
they produced the three of you
and the Dragoons, as well.

199
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,250
She explained it. But still...

00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,125
It doesn't make a
whole lot of sense.

201
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,125
Guess the two of them
don't get it either.

202
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,708
I guess it can't be helped.

203
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,791
We'll have to take a little more
time to explain things to them.

about it. It's my pleasure.

Besides, it was time for
me to head home anyway.

A problem shared is
a problem halved.

So anyway, why are you
headed to Sauer, Miss Winia?

223
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,208
To see the person who
just wrote me a letter.

Oh, I see. That's a good idea!

Maybe.

But I haven't told this
person that I'm coming,

00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,541
so I'm worried about
causing him trouble.

00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,000
[LEO] Of course. That's very
thoughtful of you.

Okay.

Yes, sir.

Go on.

Reports say that
after exchanging fire

00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,208
with the Giat Second Fleet,

238
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,083
the promontory which we believe
to be Scarlet's main fortress

239
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,458
began to maneuver.

240
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:10,125
Their base has now violated
our territorial waters.

241
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,000
So you're saying...
an island moved?

242
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,208
[LUKE]
Yes, sir.

243
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,916
The elite wizard
unit that I sent

to follow and observe
the Scrapped Princess

The entire Giat Second
Fleet was wiped out.

During the battle,
my unit also observed

248
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,958
some sort of enormous
tentacled creature.

249
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,541
[PETERS-STAHL]
Hm...

250
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,750
Well then, Luke, your thoughts?

251
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,041
It is my belief that
this is the same creature

252
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,250
that was spotted in
the town of Taurus.

253
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,750
Interesting.

254
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,875
The Scrapped Princess
has made contact

255
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,000
with Scarlet as well
as the Peacemakers.

256
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, that's food for thought.

257
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,833
The power output is dropping!

258
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,166
Speed has fallen below 20!

We'll be dead in the water soon!

What is it? What's going on?

00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,000

[NATALIE] I've shut down
the propulsion systems

[PACIFICA]
Why would you do that?

265
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,375
This is unacceptable.

266
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,416
Deliberately heading
into a situation

267
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,666
that you know is a
trap is not rational.

268
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,000
What did you say?

269
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,958
[NATALIE] You should
maintain your position here

270
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,791
and wait until the Providence
Breaker's innate abilities

271
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,333
manifest in their true form.

272
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,916
But we have to go!

273
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,958
If we don't, they're going to
kill a thousand people every day

274
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,291
until we reach the Capital!

275
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,291
And those bastards
would do it, too.

276
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,500
We can't wait for the brat's
birthday to move out.

277
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,250
A rough calculation would put
the number of causalities

278
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,250
at over 40,000 people.

279
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,791
[NATALIE] We consider
those acceptable losses.

280
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,458
Zefiris, does this mean
that you agree with her?

281
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,000
I do.

282
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,708
So you'll just stand by and
watch while people are killed.

283
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,750
Nothing can be done about that.

284
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,041
[SENES]
Hmph. If the ship is stopped,

285
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,750
we just need to
get it moving again.

286
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,083
[PACIFICA]
It'll still move?

287
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,125
[SENES] Will you give
me a hand? Shannon Cassul?

288
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,750
[PACIFICA]
But how will you do it?

289
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, just relax. I didn't ask
for your help with this.

290
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,583
Nice attitude you've got there!

291
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,250
What the heck's your problem?!

292
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,083
It's not as if
Natalie has actually

293
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,708
destroyed the Skid or anything.

294
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,458
She's just sabotaged the ship.

295
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,041
And if she severed
the power linkages,

296
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,750
all we have to do is
reconnect them by hand.

297
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,166
Reconnect the linkages?

298
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,250
What does that mean?

299
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,708
Beats me.

300
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:35,416
Anyway, I'm sure that our
two difficult Dragoons here

301
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,791
were conditioned so
that they would be

302
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,541
unable to harm human beings.

303
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,333
It would explain why
they did something

304
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,416
as indirect as
stopping the ship.

305
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,625
[ALL]
Mm... Uh.

306
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,458
I don't really
understand any of this,

307
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,958
but if we can get the ship
moving again, let's do it.

308
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,458
[SENES] The area up ahead
is a sealed sector.

309
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,166
For the time being,
we'll have Eirote guiding us.

310
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,000
But even I don't know
what's going to happen

311
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,250
once we get in there.

312
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,291
[RAQUEL] I thought you
said this would be safe.

313
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,500
[SENES]
There's no guarantee

314
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,333
that we won't trigger
the security system.

315
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,583
If anything happens,

316
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,208
I want the two of you
to back me up in there.

317
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,583
So we're basically
playing this one by ear.

318
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,541
I still don't get
what's going on, though.

319
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,000
Just make sure that you don't
get in the way of the grown-ups.

320
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,333
What the heck is it with you?!

321
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,333
Why do you keep trying
to pick a fight with me

322
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,541
every chance you get?!

323
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,375
Let's go. We're headed
for the ship's core.

324
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,875
Hey, look at me when
I'm talkin to--!

325
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,541
Eirote! Open up!

326
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,708
[PACIFICA sighs]
Geez...

327
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,500
[PACIFICA]
Wow!

328
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,000
So this is the sort of place
that demons lived in?

329
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,500
Demons, huh?

330
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,833
After all we told you,

331
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,416
you're still spouting that
superstitious nonsense.

332
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,666
Oh, come on.

333
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,541
Natalie was the one who
taught you everything,

334
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,333
so don't act
so special, you know?

335
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,541
Get over yourself.

336
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,791
Seems like all you
do is back talk.

337
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,583
Your whole personality
is so twisted, you know?

338
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,625
Nice try. But that's my line.

339
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,583
[PACIFICA, SENES arguing]

340
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,875
Look at that.

341
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,083
Those two seem to be
warming up to each other.

342
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,583
Oh, wow!

343
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,666
This place is amazing.

344
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,000
But why did the humans build
this thing so big anyway?

345
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,500
[SENES]
They used it to fight.

346
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,416
[PACIFICA]
Against who?

347
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,916
[SENES]
Ugh.

348
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,416
Hey, Eirote, put it
into words small enough

349
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,083
for Her Highness to understand.

350
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,208
[EIROTE]
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,250
According to Natalie,

352
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,166
ancient humanity
came under attack

353
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,750
by what she calls
an alien intelligence.

354
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,625
[RAQUEL]
Alien?

355
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,125
[PACIFICA]
Hm?

356
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,125
[EIROTE] Dragoons, such as
Zefiris and Natalie,

357
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,458
as well as bio-weapons,
such as the Bugs,

358
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,250
were developed
one after another.

359
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,000
But unfortunately,
they were not enough

360
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,791
to help turn the
tide of the war.

361
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,166
In the end, humanity's leader,
a man named George Browning,

362
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,916
proposed a radical solution.

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,833
[SHANNON]
Browning?

364
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,291
[SENES]
It's a person's name.

365
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,750
[RAQUEL]
He was human?

366
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,833
[EIROTE] Princess Senes,
take the next right.

367
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,250
He installed the mind
of a woman named Celia,

368
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,166
who was the greatest
psychic of her time,

369
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,208
into a mobile fortress
like this one

370
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,208
along with special machinery
to augment her powers.

371
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,041
He thereby created a system
that predicted the future,

372
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,250
so he could counter
the aliens' attack.

373
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,875
To intercept enemies which
could appear from nowhere

374
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,041
out of thin air,

375
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,333
humanity responded
by pairing up a psychic

376
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,375
with the power of an enormous
artificial intelligence.

377
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,166
The psychic, Celia,
predicted enemy movements

378
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,125
with a high degree of accuracy.

379
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,041
Relying on Celia's predictions,

380
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,291
humanity was now barely able
to fight them on equal footing.

381
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:33,291
But that woman, Celia,
decided to betray humanity.

382
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,875
How come?

383
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,583
[growls]

384
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,500
[PACIFICA yawns]

[SENES grunts]

386
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,666
[PACIFICA yelps]

387
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,291
[EIROTE] Princess Senes,
please be careful in there.

388
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,291
I'm starting to have trouble
seeing you on the monitors.

389
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:52,541
[NATALIE] They've just
entered the interference field.

390
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,666
I think the fastest
way to deal with this

391
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,291
is to hack into
the field's systems

392
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,083
and brainwash the Guardians.

393
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,583
[ZEFIRIS] I was under the
impression that Dragoons like us

394
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:05,208
are not permitted to interfere
with the humans' free will.

395
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,833
[NATALIE] Perhaps. But I'm
no longer a Dragoon.

396
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,458
I'm a virtual personality
who is borrowing space

397
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,791
in the Skid's core systems.

398
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,541
[NATALIE]
You seem upset.

399
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,000
[ZEFIRIS] Your methods
are rather forceful,

400
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,291
don't you think?

401
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,500
[NATALIE] The years have
made you soft, Zefiris.

402
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,416
Our objective is to carry
out the plan no matter what.

403
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,041
Remember?

404
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,791
[ZEFIRIS]
Carry out the plan...

405
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:32,541
Natalie, is what we're about
to do really part of the plan?

406
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,291
[NATALIE] Have you
gotten attached to them?

407
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,416
Very well. If that's
how you feel.

408
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,083
Just make sure to
stay out of my way.

409
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,166
What should I do?

410
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:59,625
[footsteps]

00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,708
Is your research
coming along well?

Prince Forsyth.

413
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,333
[FORSYTH]
It's not easy, is it?

414
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,416
All records dealing with
the Scrapped Princess

415
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,791
were destroyed years ago.

00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,458
Tell me, Chris.

418
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,291
Who are you, after all?

419
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,583
[CHRIS]
I'm a weapons specialist

420
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,291
from the Obstinate Arrows
Special Forces unit.

421
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,458
I see. That explains it.

422
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,833
Chris, I have a favor to ask.

423
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,333
[CHRIS]
A favor?

424
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,750
[FORSYTH] I don't know why
you're investigating my sister

425
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,000
and you probably
can't tell me anyway,

426
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,208
but would you let me help
you with your research?

427
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,416
Sorry, but I can't.

428
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,916
[FORSYTH]
If that's out of the question,

429
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,833
would you at least tell me
what you've found out so far?

430
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,166
[FORSYTH] It's possible
I could have been the one

431
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,291
who was abandoned
instead of my sister.

432
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,083
I have a duty to find out
if that's really the case.

433
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,000
Possibly. But Highness--
