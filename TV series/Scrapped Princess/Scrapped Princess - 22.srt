[SOCOM]
Greetings, my Master.

2
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:46,083
Now that we have lost the two
Peacemakers Galil and Steyr

3
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,291
to the enemy, the likelihood of
our being able to eliminate

4
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,708
the Providence Breaker is slim.

5
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:55,541
As such, I hereby request
authorization for the use of

6
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:59,125
class one divine
punishment configurations.

7
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,250
[CELIA] I cannot condone the
use of class one configurations

8
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,958
within the atmosphere.

9
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,375
You are authorized only
to continue using only

10
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,958
your class two configurations.

11
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,666
[SOCOM]
Understood.

12
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,166
[hammering]

13
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,375
Fafal, once you're finished,
go stand guard.

14
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,833
Sure thing.

15
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,666
[hammering continues]

16
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,875
Have any luck?

17
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,750
I'm still not sensing
anybody in the area

18
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,791
that could be the Royal Forces.

19
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,875
That's good.

20
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,041

[SUTTON grunts]

22
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,291
What's with this hippo?

23
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,333
He's actually a dragon.
His name is Mr. Soopie.

24
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,875
[SUTTON]
Don't you think he reeks?

25
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,250
[LEO]
No, not at all.

26
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,500
[PACIFICA giggles]

27
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,500
Come on, Pacifica.
You need to help out, too.

28
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,208
Go fetch some
water or something.

29
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,250
This is just like
we're camping out.

30
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,250
Except that we're fugitives.

31
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,750
Good work.

32
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,458
I feel better knowing
that you're here now.

33
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,041
Thanks, Eirote.

34
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, it looks like the damage
is a lot worse than I imagined.

35
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,333
[SENES] We'll be
fighting the Peacemakers

36
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,708
and the Royal Forces again soon.

37
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,041
Work up a damage report

38
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,000
and tell me how long
they'll take to regenerate.

39
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,291
[EIROTE]
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,416
Then you still
haven't found her?!

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,583
Send the whole army if you must!

42
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,833
[LUKE]
But General...

43
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,500
We're busy with reconstruction.

44
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,750
Our search and rescue
teams are overloaded.

45
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,000
[PETERS-STAHL]
We can worry about that later.

46
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,333
We have to hand the girl
over to the Peacemakers

47
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,291
as soon as possible.

48

[BERKENS]
Prince Forsyth?

50
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,916
I thought I'd bring
you some lunch.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,916
Berkens, that's kind of you.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,416
How are things in the Capital?

53
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,208
I've heard they started the
reconstruction work already.

54
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,625
And that they've even begun
repairing the castle itself.

55
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,416
However...

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,166
His Majesty is still missing.

57
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,125
I see.

58
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,250
And my sister?
The Scrapped Princess?

59
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,500
Apparently, they're still
searching for her.

60
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,875
[FORSYTH]
I see. So she's still alive.

61
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,458
Dinner is served!

[ALL gasp]

00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,041
[PACIFICA] Now don't be shy;
there's plenty for everybody.

64
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,666
Where's Senes and her crew?

65
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,750
They said they'd
eat at their camp.

66
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,958
[PACIFICA] Oh! Hey, Zefiris!
You wanna join us?

67
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,708
Weapon systems like me don't
need to eat, so I'll abstain.

68
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,208
Who cares if you're a weapon?

69
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,750
Stop lurking back there.

70

Come here and join us, Zefy.

Yes, sir.

00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,500
I never thought that someday
I'd be eating a meal

That's right. It was
seeded across the world

in order to protect
the Providence Breaker.

There's no other reason.

Plus, we've got nowhere
to go back to. Not anymore.

I guess it's all my fault.

No, not for that.

I'm sorry... that you're
mixed up in this.

That's okay.

145
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,541
I wanted to come along anyway.

146
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,958
To be honest,

147
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,666
you're not the only reason
I came out here, Pacifica.

148
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,875
Huh?

What is it?

There's another
reason you came here?

I said it's nothing, okay?

Wait a sec.

Why are you blushing
all of a sudden?

Come on, tell me!

you going to wear that?

Why don't you change?

[PACIFICA] But I don't have
anything to change into.

in Shannon's tent.

I get the feeling... you don't
want to share a tent.

164
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,291
[SHANNON]
Can't say I'm thrilled about it.

165
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,583
Besides, Leo, that thing
really stinks.

166
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,666
But I can't get to sleep
if I'm not wearing it.

167
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,041
Hey, Shannon, can I
get my clothes back?

168
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:23,875
[SHANNON]
Sure.

169
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,416
Thank you. Good night.

170
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,458
[SHANNON grunts]

171
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,083
[PACIFICA]
What's wrong?

172
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,625
Nothing.

173
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,416
I just thought it might be nice
to sleep beneath the stars.

174
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,333
Oh! That sounds
like a good idea!

175
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,333
All those lights...

176
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,916
What do you suppose
they actually are?

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,750
I have no idea.

178
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,166
[PACIFICA]
You know, Leo.

179
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,208
They say that long ago, humans
used to be able to go up there.

180
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,750
[LEO]
To the stars?! You're kidding!

181
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,958
[PACIFICA]
No, honest!

182
00:08:59,041 --> 00:08:59,875
[LEO]
Huh.

183
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,166
I wonder what they did up there.

184
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,541
[LEO]
Hm?

185
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,625
[PACIFICA]
What the heck is this?

[gasps]

187
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,166
What did you drop? What is it?

188
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,791
[gasps]
Miss Pacifica?

189
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,000
I sure wish I knew what
I was crying about.

190
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,916
It's kinda weird. I'm sorry.

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,541
[LEO]
What's the matter?

192
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,250
I don't know.

193
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,041
It's just-- I can't stop.

Um... I'm sorry, Miss Pacifica.

196
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,333
For what?

197
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,583
Why do you need to apologize?

00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,666
[LEO]
Well, you're--

199
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,708
There's no need to.

200
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,583
I'm not crying
because of you, Leo.

201

[sobbing continues]

202
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,458
[SOCOM]
What are you doing?

203
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,916
[CZ]
Socom.

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,958
[SOCOM]
I petitioned our master.

205
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,416
But she denied the use of
class one configurations.

206
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,708
[CZ] There is one thing
that bothers me.

207
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,916
It concerns the
Providence Breaker.

208
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,208
[SOCOM]
What's that?

209
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,041
[CZ] I understand
the reasoning behind

210
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,916
why we must eliminate her.

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,583
She's a disruptive
element that could

212
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,416
destabilize the fundamental
principles system.

213
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,666
But as weapons go, doesn't she
seem to be too passive

214
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,125
to be effective?

215
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,458
[SOCOM] She does seem to
lack offensive capability.

216
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,166
Is there something else?

217
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,416
[CZ]
I just don't understand.

218
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,708
Is Pacifica Cassul really
that much of a threat?

219
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,500
Is it necessary for
us to obliterate her?

220
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,333
[SOCOM]
Don't trouble yourself.

221
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,375
It isn't our place to
make those decisions.

222
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,333
Steyr told me of
the circumstances

223
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,250
surrounding your decompression.

224
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,208
If this is going to cause
you to hesitate in combat,

225
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,375
request a memory wipe treatment.

226
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,500
It will only take seconds.

227
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,416
[CZ]
I can look after myself.

228
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,291
[SOCOM] We have very
little chance of success

229
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,666
without the use of the
class one configurations.

230
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,625
Perhaps I should
follow Steyr's example

231
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,916
and use a more cunning approach.

232

way for me? Thank you!

And the Gigases?

three more days to repair them.

one finds us here before then.

Who are you?

I'm Christopher, former member

Princess Senes Lur Giat.

Huh. Special Forces, huh?

That's a plus for us,
right, Eirote?

Yes, ma'am!

I hate to bring it up,

but perhaps we should
work out a plan

Forgive me, but... could I
trouble you to wash this

[RAQUEL] Okay, you don't have
any more itchy spots, do you?

00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,083
we did our laundry like this
all the time, remember?

This stain won't come out.

Suck it up already.

Oh come on, I just wanna
clean myself off a little.

Why yes, it is.

A bird in a cage...

Hang those up properly, will ya?

Yeah, yeah...

Three days to go.

Three days until
Pacifica turns 16.

I wonder what's going to happen.

Even if we do manage to
protect Pacifica for that long,

296
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,875
what happens afterwards?

297
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,708
[RAQUEL] No one can know what
the future may hold, right?

298
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,958
[SHANNON] Yeah, I guess
you're right about that.

299
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,791
Who knows, our names
might go down in history

300
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,875
as the people who
betrayed humanity.

301
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,125
We'll be the traitors
who sacrificed the world

302
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,083
to protect their little sister.

303
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,375
[RAQUEL] You're overthinking
things, Shannon.

304
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,041
It's a beautiful day outside,

305
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,375
the breeze feels
wonderful on your face,

306
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,166
and our laundry
is nice and clean.

307
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,791
I just can't bring
myself to believe

308
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,958
that this world will
simply be destroyed.

309
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,791
Not today, anyway.

310
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,375
Your optimism is
nothing short of amazing.

311
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,291
It always cheers me up.

312
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,416
[RAQUEL chuckles]

313
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,750
I'm sorry... but what
are you talking about?

314
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,291
[CELIA] Would you be willing
to listen to my story?

315
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:52,958
It's a story of the far
distant past, an ancient story.

316
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,000
Humanity had created wings that

317
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,500
let them soar higher
than the birds.

318
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,833
They took flight and left
the Earth behind them,

319
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,500
aiming for the stars.

320
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,500
But God frowned upon humanity
striving for the heavens.

321
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,541
[CELIA]
If left to its own devices,

322
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,458
the human race might've devoured
the very stars themselves.

323
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,500
Humans are like vicious birds
that not only destroy others,

324
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,916
but kill their own kind.

325
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,291
God decided to capture those
birds in order to preserve them.

326
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,833
By placing them inside a cage.

327
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,375
[CELIA] But humanity fought
back against God's will.

328
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,958
Many of those who
resisted perished.

329
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,208
I was worried that if
the fighting continued,

330
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,958
all of humanity
might become extinct.

331
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:49,875
And so... I helped God put
humanity in its protective cage.

332
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,541
Although they were caged,

333
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,250
we took precautions
to ensure that

334
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,666
humans wouldn't notice
they were captives.

335
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,458
As long as you are unaware
that there is a sky outside,

336
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,541
then your cage is
your entire world.

337
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,916
Even so...

338
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,375
What do you think about this?

339
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,833
Do you want to leave your cage?

340
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:15,875
Huh?

341
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,916
[PACIFICA]
W-What do I think?

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I want you to tell me.

343
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,541
Please tell me.

344
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,208
What do you think,

[LEO]
Miss Pacifica!

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,250
[RAQUEL]
What happened?

351
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,166
[PACIFICA]
Just now, there was a woman.

352
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,333
[SHANNON]
What woman? Where?

353
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,000
[LEO]
But I don't see anybody here.

354
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,166
She was right there.
Didn't you see her?

355
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,083
There was a strange woman!

356
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,416
[SHANNON]
This one?

357
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
No, not me!
That's not funny, you jerk!

358
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,000
Can you describe her?

359
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,375
[PACIFICA]
She looked just like me.

360
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,000
She was really pretty.

361
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,083
Now I know for sure
you're hallucinating.

362
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,958
I believe Miss Pacifica!

363
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,500
She was telling me this story,

364
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,833
and then she called me
the Providence Breaker.

365
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:13,875
I believe you.

366
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,125
Wait a sec.

367
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,833
Hey, Zefiris.

368
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,083
Did you see her?

369
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:18,916
Negative.

370
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,708
I wasn't able to see her.

371
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,958
It was as if this whole area
was swallowed up by a fog.

372
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,125
[PACIFICA] So... I was
the only one who saw her?

373
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,666
A ghost?

374
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,916
I've never seen one of these
entities that you call a ghost.

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
Still, I'm glad you're safe.

376
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,208
What's the matter?

377
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing, really.

378
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,458
[CELIA]
It won't be long now before

379
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,041
everyone will come to kill you.

380
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,750
And then... what will
happen to this world?

381

[HOGUE gasps]

382
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,791
Prayer and supplication alone
will not solve anything.

383
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,666
There are three days
until the birthday

384
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,000
of the Scrapped Princess.

385
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,500
[HOGUE]
Yes, Lord.

386
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,333
[SOCOM] You still have
one more task to perform.

387
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,125
[HOGUE] Lord? How is it
that I may serve you?

388
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,333
[SOCOM]
Steyr had a favored saying.

389
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,458
"Fear and dread,"
she used to tell me,

390
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,000
"those are what drive humanity."

391
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:53,083
The Scrapped Princess used the
underground waterway to escape.

392
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,291
Which means the ones who
helped her flee were--

393
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,250
It's time for us to head out.

394
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,541
Ow!

395
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,125
Are you okay? You should
be more careful.

396
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,541
Yeah...

397
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,750
Maybe you should
learn how from Leo.

398
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,791
[PACIFICA] Wow, your training
is really paying off.

399
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,041
I sort of feel like I'm not
putting it to its proper use.

400
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,083
The Royal Forces have begun
marching in our direction.

[SUTTON]
It doesn't look like

402
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,041
they have a fix on
our position yet,

403
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,458

much time left.

That weird woman, was she trying

407
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,875
to tell me something
about this world?

408
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,333
[PACIFICA]
I mean, they did tell us once

409
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,958
that our world was
sealed off, right?

410

Right, right.

[RAQUEL]
On the day before her birthday,

415
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,750
Pacifica wakes up in her camp

416
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,750
surrounded by the Royal
Forces' giant tank squadron.

417

After breakfast,
she does her laundry

00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,625
at the nearby river with Winia.

Senes scolds her for
not being more careful.
