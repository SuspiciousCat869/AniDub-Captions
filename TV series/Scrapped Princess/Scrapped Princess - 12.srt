1
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,541
I have been waiting for you.

2
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:44,458
Really? So, does that mean
you're a Dragoon like Zefiris?

3
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,916
Almost, but unlike her,

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,541
I lost most of my abilities
from the damage I suffered

5
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,708
during the Genesis Wars.

6
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,875
At the moment, I'm an emulation
running on a virtual system

7
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,333
that I constructed within
the central control system

8
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,625
of this fortress.

9
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,250
I didn't understand
a word she just said.

10
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,708
When she lost her body,
she transferred her spirit

11
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,750
into the Skid in
order to survive.

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,583
It might be easier
to think of it like that.

13
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,666
Right...

14
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,208
In her current state,

15
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,083
Natalie can't control all of
the Skid's systems by herself.

16
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,333
So she's teaching us

17
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,958
how to operate the
ship's functions manually,

18
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,166
while, at the same time,
supervising our progress.

19
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,541
[SENES] Natalie was
the one who gave us

20
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,416
all the information about you.

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,041
About you and what
this world really is.

22
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,458
"Really is"?

23
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,375
[STEYR]
This signature is strange.

24
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,958
It's like a Dragoon,
but somehow different.

25
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,916
Even an ancient relic like that
could prove to be a nuisance

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,416
if it's under the
control of a Dragoon.

27
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,041
We'd better destroy it
then, shouldn't we?

28
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,458
Yes.

29
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,041
[NATALIE]
This world is a fabrication

30
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,625
that was created to restrict
and control the human race.

31
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,708
Your very existence
in this timeline

32
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,500
is the last hope left
to us by our master.

33
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,375
You are the final
mechanism designed

34
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,500
to smash the shell
of this world.

35
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,750
Mechanism?

36
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,375
Natalie, don't you think
it's too early for this?

37
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:30,083
But why? These others were
able to comprehend it.

38
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,875
And these three have actually
faced Peacemakers in combat.

39
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,666
They've been attacked by them
several times, haven't they?

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,000
I think they're capable
of understanding it.

41
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,583
I'm not so sure.

42
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,166
I don't think anything you'd say
to this carefree little princess

43
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,625
would actually get
through to her.

44
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,166
Who are you calling "carefree"?!

45
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,500
I haven't exactly had
an easy life, you know?!

46
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,375
What I'm saying is if
you don't understand

47
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,166
what the suffering was for,
then it was all for nothing.

48
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,791
Who do you think you are?!

49
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,541
[NATALIE]
Pacifica Cassul.

50
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,416
There is not much
time remaining now

51
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,750
before you will mature and
manifest your unique abilities.

52
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,083
I would like you to fully
understand your true purpose

53
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,125
in this plan while
there is still time.

54
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,625
What do you mean, "purpose"?

55
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,958
What're you talking about?

56
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,958
What does that mean we're
the "final mechanism"?

57
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,625
Who are you people?

58
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,916
[ANNOUNCER]
Princess Senes!

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,333
What is it?

60
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,041
[ANNOUNCER] Giat Second Fleet
is approaching rapidly,

61
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,000
deployed in a battle array.

62
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,291
There are 29 inbound ships
and all of them are armed.

63
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,416
They don't really mean
to attack us, do they?

64
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Could be. Maybe my royal
bretheren have finally come up

65
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,291
with an excuse that's good
enough to get rid of me.

66
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,333
But it's hard to believe that
they would attack us so openly.

67
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,791
[SENES] Eirote, I'll let
you handle things here.

68
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,208
[STEYR] We need to find out
what it really is, first.

69
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,875
Prepare the cannons.

70
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,500
Prepare the cannons.

71
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,166
What's our status?

72
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,916
[PILOT A] The Second Fleet is
still closing in. Range, 88 hex.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,750
Class two battle preparations.

74
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,625
[PILOT B]
Roger.

75
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,958
Once we're in position,

76
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,500
disengage the seal on
the Fomalhaut Flare.

77
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,916
Set it to force level
three and stand by.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,833
The Second Fleet
is opening fire.

79
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,500
Are you really going
to do this, my brother?

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,625
[NATALIE] Providence
Breaker Pacifica Cassul.

81
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,000
You are the key to smashing
the shell of this world

82
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,666
and thereby freeing humanity

83
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,208
from the control of
the Peacemakers.

84
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,458
The reason they are using
the Church of Mauser

85
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,291
in this desperate
attempt to stop us

86
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,125
is because they fear
our plan will succeed.

87
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,500
Wait a minute.

88
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,708
So what you're saying

89
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,666
is the reason she's
the poison of this world

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,500
and why we've had to
fight to keep her safe

91
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,666
is all because of some
plan for world destruction

92
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,375
that you set up
thousands of years ago?!

93
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,541
Not quite.

94
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,208
That's exactly right.

95
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,583
This plan regarding
the Providence Breaker,

96
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,375
the one who could
break divine law

97
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,416
and the Guardians,
her protectors,

98
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,791
was set in motion long
ago by us and our master.

99
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,666
Guardians? Is that what
you call me and Raquel?

100
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,791
[NATALIE] I'm not just
speaking of you two.

101
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,500
All of these people here carrry
the Guardian gene as well.

102
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,083
But that's...

103
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,708
Leo. Winia.

104
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,083
Berkens. Elfitine.

[PACIFICA]

107
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,458
[NATALIE] While these people
may carry the Guardian gene,

108
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,500
it is expressed most
strongly in the two of you.

109
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,125
These people carry the genes

110
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,166
that we scattered
across this wrold.

111
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,166
We did it to protect
the Providence Breaker

112
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,541
from the interference
of the Peacemakers.

113
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,875
That is what a
Guardian truly is.

[PILOT A]
Deck three has been hit!

Just keep your cool.

00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,583
Stand by to fire
the Formalhaut Flare!

117
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,833
We just need to make it clear
to my incompetent brother

118
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,125
exactly what he's up against.

119
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,208
Singe the flank of his flaghsip!

120
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,375
Roger that!

121

[SENES]

122
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,416
[STEYR giggles]

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,708
[STEYR]
It would seem that the humans

124
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,500
are trying to operate
a half-dead Dragoon.

125
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,625
It makes things
that much easier.

126
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,750
We just need to kill the
humans inside the ship.

127
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,375
All ships maintaining
combat speed!

The fleet is closing
using a fan formation!

129
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,708
What? You mean that
isn't my brother?

130
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,041
[SHANNON] I'm trying to
understand all of this.

131
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,666
Are you saying that Raquel and
I were planted by you people

132
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,250
because we'd be
destined to play the role

133
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,916
of Pacifica's protectors?

134
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,458
Is that the truth, Zefiris?

135
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,583
It means that the Guardian genes
we seeded throughout humanity

136
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,708
just happened to
converge very powerfully

137
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,833
within the two of you.

138
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,416
Isn't that what I just said?

139
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,083
But, Shannon...

140
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,750
So this was all part of
your plan, wasn't it?

141
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,791
Our fighting and
our suffering...

142
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,166
Even the people who
have died for this.

143
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,791
[PACIFICA] But what does this
mean? I still don't get it.

144
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,875
What plan are we a part of?

145
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,791
[ZEFIRIS] Natalie, I'm detecting
a Peacemaker signature

146
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,125
aboard one of the
approaching ships.

147
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,708
It's a Civilian-type,

148
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,000
but it looks like it's created
proxies and scattered them.

149
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,250
[EIROTE]
This way! Please hurry!

150
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,583
Hey, Raquel, did you understand
what they were talking about?

151
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,875
[RAQUEL] I couldn't follow
all of the details,

152
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,458
but it sounded like
they were saying

153
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,416
that our destinies have already
been decided for us long ago.

154
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,791
I won't let anyone
decide my fate!

155
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,833
What in the hell
are those monsters?

156
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:37,333
[PACIFICA] Wow! What is this
place? I can see outside!

157
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,208
Those aren't windows,
though, are they?

158
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,416
Eirote, why did you
bring them here?!

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,958
[EIROTE] They have experience
with fighting those creatures.

160
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,500
[PACIFICA]
Hey, aren't those...?

161
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,125
Yeah.

162
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,500
[RAQUEL] And it looks like
there's more than one this time.

163
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,000
I see.

164
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,875
So those must be the Peacemaker
proxies she told us about.

165
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,000
[PACIFICA]
Why aren't you running away?

166
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,166
What's wrong with you?

167
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,833
Why are you trying
to fight those things?

168
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,375
You know you can't win.

169
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,916
Just stay out of this, civilian.

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,875
Don't you get it? Those
things are really powerful.

171
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,375
Last time,

172
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,375
just one of them killed hundreds
and hundreds of villagers!

173
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,250
[SENES] Don't you dare
compare my elite troops

174
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,000
to your country
bumpkin soldiers!

175
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,750
[SHANNON]
It's useless.

176
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,958
Recall your troops now

177
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,750
and seal off all the
hatches on this ship.

178
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,000
That's all you can do.

179
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,708
What good will that do?!
Those things will just--

180
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,916
This is just a theory, but if we
defeat the Peacemaker itself,

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,375
perhaps the proxies
would also disappear.

182
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,041
Zefiris and I will go out, then.

183
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,041
But, Shannon...

184
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,583
Don't worry about us.

185
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,208
[ZEFIRIS]
My lord,

186
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,708
it is not wise to try and fuse
with me to fight right now.

187
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,875
[SHANNON] If I can't use your
power at a time like this,

188
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,041
when can I?

189
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,166
[ZEFIRIS]
You are still suspicious of me.

190
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,375
In your current state,

191
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,791
I will be unable to
exert my full strength.

192
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,375
In the worst case, there
will be permanent damage

193
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,750
to your personality
after we separate.

194
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,791
[SHANNON]
Cut the crap!

195
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,125
Don't try to gloss things over

196
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,250
with a bunch of "trust"
garbage. Not now.

197
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,875
We'll talk about this later.

198
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,208
Very well.

199
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,666
[SHANNON]
Let's go.

200
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,916
This is unexpected. It looks
like they've made contact

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,625
with the Providence
Breaker and her group.

202
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,083
Well, well. If isn't a Dragoon.

203
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,875
[STEYR]
Second-class divine retribution

204
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,666
enforcement configuration.

205
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,916
Engage.

206
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,958
[SENES] Avoid battle
as much as possible

207
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,291
and get inside the ship!

208
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,416
On the double!

209
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,291
The Peacemaker proxies
are coming ashore now,

210
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,041
right off our starboard flank!

211
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,291
Huh...?

212
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,333
Ah!

213
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,458
What is it?

214
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,166
[MAN screams]

215
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,458
Don't look! Shut
off the monitors!

216
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,791
[ZEFIRIS]
As I suspected, my lord,

217
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,125
our synchronization
is incomplete.

218
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,625
As long as you mistrust me,

219
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,916
I will be unable to provide
you with sufficient power--

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,083
[SHANNON]
Shut up!

221
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,041
[roars]

222
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,208
[SENES] So this is the
influence of the Peacemakers.

223
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,708
The power of Providence.

224
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,958
What is this Providence
you keep talking about?

225
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,500
[EIROTE] It's something
like a set of rules

226
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,416
that humanity is utterly
incapable of disobeying.

227
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,333
"Humans must obey Peacemakers,
no matter what."

228
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,416
It's a rule that's set in stone.

229
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,291
[RAQUEL]
A rule set in stone? But where?

230
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,208
[EIROTE]
It's been etched into our minds.

231
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,625
We've been imprinted with
it since we were born.

232
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,291
[PACIFICA]
Since we were born?

233
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,333
You mean everyone
in the world has it?

234
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,041
[EIROTE]
There is only one exception.

235
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,166
She is known as the
Scrapped Princess.

236
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,458
In other words, you.

237
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,083
That is the reason why the
Peacemakers are trying so hard

238
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,375
to eliminate you.

239
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,916
You're kidding.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,541
Just because I don't do what
those monsters tell me to do?

241
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,375
But even if I don't have
to do what they tell me,

242
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm only one person!

243
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,583
[EIROTE] Yes, but your ability
to cancel out Providence

244
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,250
is contagious.

245
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,333
Your power is
incomplete right now,

246
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,000
and only manifests itself
when your life is in danger

247
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,875
or when you're under
emotional stress.

248
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,083
Contagious? Am I some
sort of disease?

249
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,833
[EIROTE] Also, the Peacemakers
are incapable of attacking

250
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,750
the Providence Breaker directly.

251
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,416
Every time they've
tried to eliminate you,

252
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,875
they've never confronted you
themselves, have they?

253
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,083
No, I guess not...

254
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,375
[EIROTE] By rallying around
you and your abilities,

255
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,500
humanity can build the
first military force

256
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,875
that can defy the gods.

257
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,416
This is a revolution.

258
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,750
Princess Pacifica, if we're
going to have any chance at all

259
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,791
of defeating those monsters,

260
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,458
then we have to
have your help.

261
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,875
Hey, wait a minute...
Revolution?

262
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,291
You can talk about
that all you want,

263
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,208
but what am I supposed
to do about it?

264
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,250
[SENES]
We have no other hope but you.

265
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,458
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

266
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,166
[SENES] Believe me,
the last thing I want

267
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,958
is to have to rely on a
spoiled little girl like you.

268
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,166
But this is what
happens to us

269
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,333
after just one look
at those bastards.

270
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,916
They'll slaughter us.

271
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,791
We'll be cut to pieces without
even being able to fight back.

272
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,458
Okay, but what am I
supposed to do about it?

273
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,458
Even if I wanted to help you,
I have no idea what to--

274
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,625
[gasps]

275
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,208
[SENES] Will chopping of an ear
put you under emotional stress?!

276
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,583
[EIROTE]
Princess Senes!

277
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,750
[SENES]
You can't keep hiding

278
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,666
behind your brother
and sister forever!

279
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,125
This is something
that only you can do!

280
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,375
So, for once in your life,

281
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,250
why don't you try to do
something on your own,

282
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,958
Pacifica Cassul?!

283
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,333
[ZEFIRIS] Please have
faith in me, my lord.

284
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,000
We can't take much more of this.

285
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,083
[SHANNON]
You can't trust someone

286
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,833
just because they tell you to!

287
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:10,875
[gasps]

288
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,208
They fled into phase space,
did they? Well, no matter.

289
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,166
Let's clean house while
they're away, shall we?

290
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,458
[LEHENHOF LEADER]
Lehenhof squad, two men down!

291
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,458
[BARKS LEADER] Barks squad,
retreat to block three! Ah!

292
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,750
[SENES] All hands, fall
back to the central block!

293
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,000
Seal the corridor
bulkheads as you go!

294
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,583
Don't wait for
stragglers! Hurry!

295
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,750
[PACIFICA]
Wait!

296
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,333
Why won't you give
them time to come back?

297
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,416
[SENES] If we don't seal the
bulkheads quickly enough,

298
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,833
the people who made it in
time will be killed, too.

299
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,958
But still!

300
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,916
We're just no match
for those things.

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,416
All we can do now
is turn tail and run.

302
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,916
[SOLDIER A]
It's no use! Ah!

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,916
[SOLDIERS screaming]

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,416
[PACIFICA]
No... I can't stand this...

305
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,708
Please! Help them!

306
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:16,583
Pacifica!

307
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,208
Don't let any more of them die!

308
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,166
I can't take it anymore! I don't
want anyone else to die!

309
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,250
I don't need you to tell me--

310
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,333
[EIROTE]
Princess Senes!

311
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,375
[SENES]
Hm?

312
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,416
Now I get it.
That was it just now!

313
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,833
I was expecting something more

314
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,958
like a bright flash
or something.

315
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,208
Your power seems to be
contagious, all right.

316
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:46,958
Huh?

317
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,291
[RAQUEL]
Huh?

318
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,083
A proxy!

319
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,125
[SENES]
Damn it!

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,083
[STEYR]
Humans, hear me and obey...

321
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,958
Chained creature,
be now released,

322
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,333
for thou art the rod
of destruction!

323
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,750
Finish it off!

324
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,666
[SENES yells]

325
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,458
Princess Senes,

326
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,291
Pacifica is protecting us
from Providence now,

327
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,166
so I think this is our chance.

328
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,750
What?

329
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,541
[RAQUEL] Put together as many
teams of wizards and soldiers

330
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,708
as possible.

331
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,125
If they can lure a proxy
into each bulkhead

332
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,041
and hit them with annihilation
spells and physical attacks,

333
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,708
I believe they can defeat
about half of them.

334
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,291
I see where you're going,

335
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,500
but what do we do
about the other half?

336
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,166
[RAQUEL]
Those are for you and me.

337
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,041
[SENES]
Hmph. I like your style.

338
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,458
Big Sis...

339
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,458
[STEYR]
My proxies are being destroyed?

340
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,500
Her ability to break
divine law has manifested.

341
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,875
I guess I'll have to
see to this myself.

342
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,833
How foolish.

343
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,583
Do you really think
you can defeat me

344
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,666
without a Dragoon, silly human?

345
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,083
Now! Zefiris!

346
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,125
[STEYR yelps]

347
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,083
Second-class... divine
retribution... enforcement...

348
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,125
[STEYR screams]

349
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,666
[SHANNON]
Cz...

350
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,750
[CZ]
Don't call me that.

351
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,875
Just walk away, Dragoon.

352
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,166
[SHANNON]
Are you kidding?

353
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,458
[CZ]
Let's not kill each other now.

354
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:26,041
Once I've retrieved Steyr,
I promise to withdraw.

355
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,500
[ZEFIRIS] Withdrawing
would be wise, my lord.

356
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,208
An Artillery-type like Cz
is too great a challenge

357
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,833
for us right now.

358
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,791
[CZ]
Come to the capital of Leinwan.

359
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,125
[SHANNON]
What?

360
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,500
[CZ] We can no longer
exterminate you in secret,

361
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,375
so we will name the place
where this will be settled.

362
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,500
You have a grace
period of 15 days,

363
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,000
and 1,000 people will die
every day you are late.

364
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,041
[gasps]

365
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,875
[CZ]
As the caretakers of this world,

366
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,583
we must terminate both you
and your younger sister

367
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,750
by any means necessary.

368
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,083
The destruction of one
country is acceptable

369
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,458
in order to achieve that end.

370
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,416
[SHANNON]
It is, is it?

371
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,041
[CZ]
We will be waiting.

372
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,583
[SENES]
What is it?

373
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,875
Shannon...

374
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,875
[OFFICER A] The proxies
have all disappeared!

375
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,083
[OFFICER B]
We're saved!

376
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,875
[OFFICER A]
I'm not detecting them anywhere!

377
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,458
[OFFICER C]
Let's get verification.

378
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,958
[OFFICER D]
Looks like we made it.

379
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,958
[SENES]
We are gathered here

380
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,875
to send off the brave spirits
of our fallen heroes.

381
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,500
A moment of silence!

382
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,250
[PACIFICA]
Excuse me.

383
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,458
I'm sorry. This all happened
because of me, didn't it?

384
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,041
Don't be so conceited.

385
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,291
Those soldiers died fighting to
reclaim our world for all of us.

386
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,041
They didn't just do it for you.

387
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,416
What will you do?

388
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,333
[SENES]
I'm going to put an end to this.

389
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,166
I'm not the Scrapped Princess,

390
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,541
but I'm not going
to lose anyone else.

391
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,916
The sea is pretty, isn't it?

392
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,333
What is it about this world
that's so wrong to everyone?

393
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,166
I'm sorry, Shannon. Raquel.

394
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,333
[SHANNON]
Why do you need to apologize?

395
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,708
[PACIFICA] It's like...
after hearing all that stuff,

396
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,208
I understand things less now.

397
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,083
What exactly am I?
What am I supposed to do?

398
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,083
We're only human after
all, nothing more.

399
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,750
All we can really do
is try the best we can.

400
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,708
Let's go home. Back to Leinwan.

401
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,833
[RAQUEL] The three siblings
head for the Capital

402
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,291
in the mobile fortress.

403
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,708
The storm of an unimaginable
foreign culture

404
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,833
lashes at Pacfica
and the others.

405
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,583
Will they be able to
accomplish their goals

406
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,500
without being tossed about
by a cultural revolution?

407
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,416
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

408
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,916
"Distant Ricordanza."

409
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,250
See you next time!
