[gasps]

00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,666
[HOGUE]
Lord Galil.

4
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,458
[GALIL] Thou hast heard what has
transpired in Taurus, I assume.

5
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,791
[HOGUE]
Yes, Lord.

6
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,708
[GALIL] Then I shall leave
the resolution to you.

7
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,583
Under no circumstances
can we allow rumors

8
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,625
of people defying the law to
spread amongst the masses.

9
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:11,708
[HOGUE] May the will of our
great lord Mauser be done.

10
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,000
I am told that the kingdom
has placed a bounty

11
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,041
upon the head of the
Scrapped Princess as well.

12
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,625
[GALIL]
Nevertheless,

13
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:22,541
I expect that I shall have to be
involved personally next time.

14
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,541
Would you please slow down,
just for a second?

15
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,583
What's wrong?

16
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,666
Why won't you tell
me what happened

17
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,208
in the city back there?

18
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,541
I get it. You're going to
act like you don't know me

19
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,041
even though we're friends.

20
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,500
We're friends? Since when are
we friends with you, Leo?

21
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:46,208
What? But, Miss Raquel.
That was cruel...

22
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,916
I guess we'll have
to say goodbye to Leo

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,916
a little sooner than we thought.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,958
[music playing]

25
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,166
That's such a pretty song.

26
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,791
From his looks, I'd say
that he's a troubadour.

27
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,583
Greetings, lovely travelers.

28
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,208
Can I interest you
in a song or two

29
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,333
to comfort you
on your journey?

30
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,416
A song of joy to
pluck up your spirits?

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,625
Or maybe you'd prefer a sad
tune to call forth tears?

32
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,041
It all depends on what
you'd like to hear.

33
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,625
Wow...

34
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, beautiful blonde maiden, I
am completely at your service.

35
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,583
How I long to whisper songs
of love and devotion

36
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,333
in your delicate ears.

37
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,041
Huh?

38
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,166
[giggles] Since you
put it that way,

39
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,875
I think I'd like to
hear some of them.

40
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,500
[TROUBADOUR]
Of course, of course, milady!

41
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,833
You can pay me for
the song later.

42
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,416
But first, let's
start with the line

43
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,541
from an ancient
tune of sad lo--

44
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,541
We're not interested.

45
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,583
I think you'll have better
luck somewhere else.

46
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,875
Easy, now. You haven't
even heard me sing yet.

47
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,458
[SHANNON]
I said get lost.

48
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,666
What's wrong with you, Shannon?

49
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,583
He was just gonna sing to me.

50
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,625
Huh?

51
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,375
We're sorry, but we're in a
hurry, so if you'll excuse us.

52
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,541
Oh, I understand completely.
I guess it just isn't my day.

53
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,333
Well, I won't keep you
travelers waiting, then.

54
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,000
If we meet again somewhere
down the road,

55
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,666
I hope I can sing
my songs for you!

56
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,500
You think he was...?

57
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,000
[SHANNON]
Probably.

58
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,291
He was getting ready to
attack as he stepped closer.

59
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,083
[RAQUEL]
He didn't look like a wizard.

60
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,708
He wasn't carrying anything that
looked like a weapon, either.

61
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,166
That's exactly why the
guy was so suspicious.

62
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,125
[LEO]
What a roguish looking fellow.

63
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,791
If he ever comes near us again,

64
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,250
I'll make sure to get rid
of that troubadour.

65
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,333
[TROUBADOUR] A frontal attack
won't work then, huh?

66
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,875
Wow, these guys
are pretty tough.

67
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,041
Hmm...

68
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,250
[BARONESS]
Enter.

69
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,291
[CHRIS] I apologize for
being unable to attend

70
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,375
the commander's funeral.

71
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,458
[BARONESS] That's all right.
Still, this is most unusual.

72
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,500
Failure is not tolerated
in the Special Forces.

73
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,583
You understand that, I assume?

74
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,333
I'm willing to accept whatever
punishment you deem fit.

76
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,791
[BARONESS]
Instead of punishing you,

77
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,750
the new commander
of the Special Forces

78
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,625
is giving you another mission.

79
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,583
New Special Forces Commander?

80
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,875
You mean that you're...?

81
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,291
I want you to reopen a
certain investigation.

82
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,041
It concerns the
Scrapped Princess

83
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,791
and the Grendel Revelation
from 15 years ago.

84
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,666
[PACIFICA sighs]

85
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,791
[PACIFICA] This is so good!
Omelets are absolutely the best!

86
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,291
Don't eat too much,

87
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
or you'll make the cart
too heavy for the horses.

88
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,375
Oh, shut up! What would you
know? I'm a growing girl!

89
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,375
[SHANNON]
Appetite over appearance, huh?

90
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,208
[PACIFICA growls]

91
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,291
No, that's not true at all.

92
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,583
Miss Pacifica is
definitely attractive.

93
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,666
That's why you have to be
careful around roguish men

94
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,958
like that one we met earlier.

95
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,458
Oh, really, Leo?
Is that jealousy I hear?

96
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,958
[LEO]
What?! It's nothing of the sort!

97
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,958
A guy like that who acts
so familiar with you

98
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,625
when he's only just
met you is dangerous!

99
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,333
I seem to recall a certain
someone who proposed to me

100
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,958
when we first met.

101
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,208
I'm all done!

102
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,333
Time for me to wash the dishes!

103
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,916
[LEO] Wait a moment! Please
allow me to assist you.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,541
Miss Pacifica!

105
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,208
Who'd have thought those
two brats could be so noisy?

106
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,333
I'm going to make sure that no
one suspicious is in the area.

107
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,541
Is that...?

108
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,750
[SHANNON]
What is it?

109
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,958
[RAQUEL]
The signal...

110
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,541
It feels like the
troubadour from earlier.

111
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,791
Is that guy headed
towards Pacifica?

112
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,833
Actually, he's in the
completely opposite direction.

113
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,125
I thought I told you
to get lost already.

114
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,958
Oh, I heard you the first time.

115
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,291
But a musician has to
make a living, you know.

116
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,458
You certainly have a short fuse.

117
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,416
You're not a soldier of
the Royal Forces, are you?

118
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,625
I guess that makes that busted
instrument of yours your weapon.

119
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,375
Oh, it's not busted, not at all.

120
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,041
In fact, it's making
sounds just fine.

121
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,500
Human ears can't
hear it, that's all.

122
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,375
What do you mean?

123
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,416
[buzzing]

124
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,083
Bugs, huh?

125
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,375
[TROUBADOUR] You'll die if they
sting you, so please be careful.

126
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,125
[SHANNON] I've heard
about a clan of assassins

127
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,416
who have the power
to control bugs.

128
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,750
And here I thought
it was just a rumor.

129
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,833
It's funny; these bugs
are mysterious creatures.

130
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,416
You might not think it,

131
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,250
but it actually takes a great
deal of skill to control them.

132
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:03,333
My name's Keydarf Gylot. I'm
master of the silent melody.

133
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,458
I'm also known as the Silencer.

134
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,125
It's nice to meet you.

135
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,958
[KEYDARF] Are you sure you
should be wasting your time

136
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,916
messing around with me?

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,333
What's that?

138
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,583
A brother of one of these
fellows should be reaching

139
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,583
the Scrapped Princess right
about now if I'm not mistaken.

140
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,791
[gasps]

141
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,875
[PACIFICA] Come on, Leo.
Aren't you done yet?

142
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,583
[LEO]
Just a moment, Miss Pacifica.

143
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,750
This bit of dirt
is rather stubborn.

144
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,541
[gasps]

145
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,583
Huh?

146
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,250
Are you all right?!

147
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,250
Ow, that really hurt.

148
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,291
What the heck was
that... anyway...?

149
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,875
Pacifica, no!

150
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,750
I was there with her, and yet...

151
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,875
I'm not fit to be a knight!

152
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,666
I think her condition
is getting worse.

153
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,750
She must need an
antidote to the poison.

154
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,791
Let's go back to Taurus and
find a doctor who can treat her.

155
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,625
I'm not so sure... After what
happened back there,

156
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,791
I don't know if the townspeople

157
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,250
would be willing to
do us any favors.

158
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,625
[LEO]
Shannon! Miss Raquel!

159
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,208
I've decided. I'm going
back to see Doyle Barrett.

160
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,458
Doyle Barrett? Why?

161
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,458
You mean that
knight who's retired?

162
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:32,541
Yes, exactly. You see, Sir
Barrett also works as a doctor.

163
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,541
I want to ask him to
help Miss Pacifica.

164
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,916
You're right. That old man
might be able to help her.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,458
And if we take the highway,

166
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,791
we can make it to his place
and back again in half a day.

167
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,791
[LEO] In that case, I'll
make sure to hurry back.

168
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,375
[SHANNON] Wait a second,
I'm coming with you.

169
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,833
No, I'm going with him.

170
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,416
[SHANNON]
Raquel.

171
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,083
You're terrible at asking for
help. Please stay here with her.

172
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,958
[CHRIS] Baroness. Is this
uniform really necessary?

173
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,166
[BARONESS]
Of course it is.

174
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,333
And I must say, you look
very handsome in it.

175
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,250
I can't go to Sauer Castle
dressed like this.

176
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,333
I'll stick out like a sore
thumb when I get there.

177
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,500
I don't think that's
going to be a problem,

178
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,875
"Christopher Bairach."

179
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,458
I've pulled some strings
with the registrar.

180
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,750
Starting today, you
are my adopted child,

181
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,708
the heir of the
House of Bairach.

182
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,916
But, Baroness...

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,291
I think you meant
to say "Mother."

184
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,666
An official title will
prove very useful

185
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,125
during the investigation
I mentioned.

186
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,541
Then I understand completely.
Thank you, Mother.

187
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,750
[BARONESS] Good morning, Prince
Forsyth. A fine day to you.

188
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,458
Likewise. It's a pleasure
to see you, Baroness.

189
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,625
[BARONESS]
I'd like to introduce you

190
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,833
to my foster son Christopher.

191
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,208
He was originally raised
in the provinces,

192
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,375
but I would be delighted if
you would be gracious enough

193
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,500
to offer him your friendship.

194
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,833
[FORSYTH]
It would be my honor.

195
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,916
I'm very pleased to
meet you, Christopher.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,708
[CHRIS]
You honor me, Your Highness.

197
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,125
Please, Christopher,
just call me Forsyth.

198
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,583
[CHRIS]
As you wish, Prince Forsyth.

199
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,750
[FORSYTH] Do you know
what's been happening

200
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,750
in the provinces recently?

201
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,250
Why yes, a little.

202
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,666
[FORSYTH]
Tell me, Christopher:

203
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,833
Have you heard of
a certain rumor?

204
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,666
The rumor that says the Scrapped
Princess is still alive?

205
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,916
Come now! You can't possibly
be serious, Your Highness.

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,916
Don't tell me the prince
of the royal family

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,333
actually believes
in such nonsense?

208
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,625
[FORSYTH]
Not long ago,

209
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,750
when the royal wizard
attended my aunt's funeral,

210
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,208
he apparently spotted a
blonde girl with blue eyes

211
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,166
who looked very familiar.

212
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,250
It was in a village
called Manurhin Town.

213
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:40,416
My twin sister, who was scrapped
right after she was born.

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,458
It seems impossible,
but somewhere out there,

215
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,958
my sister could be
alive and well.

216
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,791
[RAQUEL]
Leo! We have to go faster!

217
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:00,833
[LEO]
Yes, ma'am!

218
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,416
[DOYLE]
Hmm?

219
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,666
I told you, I'm not
a knight anymore.

220
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,916
You misunderstand.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,416
We've come to ask for
your help as a doctor.

222
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,875
[DOYLE]
Bugs, huh? That's a tricky one.

223
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,875
[LEO] So then, is
that thing an insect?

224
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,666
Legend has it these things were
created by demons long ago.

225
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,958
But I don't know
much about them

226
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,458
other than they're
extremely dangerous.

227
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,541
If you're stung by them
directly, you die instantly.

228
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,375
Even if you're only
grazed by it though,

229
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,958
you won't live to
see the morning.

230
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,458
[LEO]
You can't be serious!

231
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,125
Please save my sister's life,
Sir Barrett. I beg of you.

232
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,583
Even if I wanted to,

233
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,625
normal antidotes don't have
any effect on bug poison.

234
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,208
You have to prepare a special
mixture of wild medicinal herbs.

235
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,583
Problem is, the herbs only
grow in special locations.

236
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,166
Where can we find them?

237
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,541
The only place they
grow around this area

238
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,375
is inside a strange cave
known as the Fortress.

239
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,291
The Fortress?

240
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,541
[LEO]
Let's go there at once!

241
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,666
There's a bug hive
inside the Fortress.

242
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,625
Without a military
wizard to help us,

243
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,166
we'd never get
outta there alive.

244
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,875
In that case, I will go.

245
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,166
[LEO] Huh? Wh...? Miss Raquel,
you mean you can use magic?

246
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,208
Why, yes. Just a little bit.

247
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,541
That's the Fortress?

248
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,583
[DOYLE]
Mm.

249
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,750
[LEO] I wonder... Was all
of this made by humans?

250
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,458
[DOYLE] They say it's a
relic of the Genesis Wars,

251
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,208
that it used to be
some kind of vehicle.

252
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,375
Nobody knows what it
is for sure, though.

253
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,583
Let's get going.

254
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,916
[LEO]
I'll protect you, Miss Raquel.

255
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,583
I have to admit it, you're
a very impressive woman.

256
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,083
[RAQUEL]
You think so?

257
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,583
[DOYLE]
This is a dangerous place,

258
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,500
even for a military wizard.

259
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,791
Yes, I'm aware of that.

260
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,083
But my sister's life
is on the line.

261
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,166
[PACIFICA]
Shannon...?

262
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,625
Huh?

263
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,125
You're finally awake.

264
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:12,333
What happened? I can't
remember a single thing.

265
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,666
[SHANNON] You must've picked
up something weird

266
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,291
off the ground and eaten it.

267
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,375
Leo and Raquel went out
to get some medicine,

268
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,541
so you'll be as good as
new after you take it.

269
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,208
[PACIFICA]
Shannon...

270
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,083
You still haven't
gotten over the habit

271
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,583
of covering your mouth
when you try to lie...

272
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,125
Oh, give me a break.

273
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,333
If I keep getting worse...

274
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,583
If I end up dying from
whatever this is...

275
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,833
...then you and Raquel will be
able to go back to Manhurin Town

276
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,416
and live your lives
like normal people.

277
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,083
[SHANNON]
Yeah, I guess.

278
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,708
Then... nobody else
will have to die...

279
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,625
[SHANNON]
Everybody dies... eventually.

280
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,666
[PACIFICA]
I can't help thinking sometimes

281
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,125
that I cause you
a lot of trouble.

282
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,791
Seems like everyone would be
better off without me, so--

283
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,500
[SHANNON] Will you shut up?!
Just be quiet and sleep!

284
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,333
What's with all this
"If I die" crap?!

285
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,708
Why don't you just
give this whole

286
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,208
"self-sacrificing and noble"
thing a rest already?!

287
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,916
That's the easy way out!

288
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,250
[SHANNON] Let someone
else spoil you for once.

289
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,833
Hey, Big Brother...?

290
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:14,958
[SHANNON]
What is it?

291
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,666
[PACIFICA]
Would you hold my hand, please?

292
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,666
[LEO] Why do you suppose
the walls glow like this?

293
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,541
It's strange.

294
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,083
Legend has it that this place
is still under the curse

295
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,000
of the Dark Lord Browning
after all these years.

296
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,833
Who taught you to swing
a sword like that, boy?

297
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,625
[LEO]
No one, sir. I taught myself.

298
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,958
Huh. Your swing is stiff,
but it's still very quick.

299
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,416
Thank you very much, sir!

300
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,791
It's truly an honor to be
complimented by you!

301
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,875
[DOYLE] I was just
making an observation.

302
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,375
[LEO]
Um, Sir Barrett?

303
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,125
I realize this probably
isn't the best time, but...

304
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,500
[DOYLE]
What is it?

305
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,625
[LEO] Well, I was wondering
if you made the decision

306
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,041
to leave the Amber Knights

307
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,416
because you threw the Scrapped
Princess into the gorge.

308
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,541
[DOYLE] That old woman should
learn to mind her own business.

309
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,583
But, Sir Barrett, wasn't
it your duty as a knight

310
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,500
to throw her into that gorge?

311
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,875
A knight wields his sword
in the name of justice,

312
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,416
and if need be, he takes lives.

313
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,291
And if many lives would
be saved by that act--

314
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,583
No matter how great you
think the cause may be,

315
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,041
there's no excuse
for taking away

316
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,000
the smile of an innocent child.

317
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,416
[LEO]
But, sir--

318
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,333
I've had enough of this!
It's time for you to drop it!

319
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,208
[LEO gasps]

320
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,833
Something just occurred to me.

321
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,875
We've been getting closer
and closer to the center,

322
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,416
but there haven't been
many bug attacks.

323
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,208
[LEO]
Hm.

324
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,583
Now that you mention it...

325
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,666
[KEYDARF]
Greetings, everyone!

326
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,083
Welcome to my charming palace.

327
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,708
You're the guy
from this morning!

328
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,458
One of my bugs didn't return,

329
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,958
so I had a feeling you
might show up here.

330
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,708
This means the little lady
is still alive, isn't she?

331
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,791
That's right. We came here
to get her medicinal herbs.

332
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,583
If it's herbs you're after,
there's plenty of them around.

333
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,875
But, will you be
able to pick them?

334
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,166
[LEO gasps]

335
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,958
People of the flames, dance!

336
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,708
That's amazing!

337
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,541
[KEYDARF]
I suspected as much.

338
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,333
Well, how about this, then?

339
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,875
[screeching]

340
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,125
[KEYDARF] I'm sorry, but it
looks like the reward

341
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,875
of five million cetme
is going to be mine.

342
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,083
[LEO] Reward? What're
you talking about?!

343
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,416
[KEYDARF] What? You mean
you don't know yet?

344
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,333
Oh, tis a strange and
terrible tale of woe,

345
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,541
of a suckling child spoken
of in god's revelation.

346
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,083
A poisonous young girl

347
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,500
who will usher in the
world's destruction.

348
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,833
In other words,

349
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,916
the Scrapped Princess who
escaped her deadly fate

350
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,291
is the young lady you're
now trying to save.

351
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,125
[gasps]

352
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,791
What did you say?

353
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,500
If you think I'm
making this all up,

354
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,666
why don't you go ahead
and ask the lady there?

355
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,875
It can't be!

356
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,000
[DOYLE]
Well? Is this true?

357
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,583
Yes, it's true.

358
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,375
[gasps]

359
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,625
No matter what it says
in the revelation,

360
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,708
she's still my precious sister.

361
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,125
Miss Pacifica is the
Scrapped Princess?

362
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,208
Then she's still alive?

363
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,791
[KEYDARF] So what this
means is if I kill Pacifica,

364
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,375
I'll be able to collect a huge
amount of money as a reward.

365
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,375
[RAQUEL]
Barrier, protect us!

366
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,500
That's a very nice
defense spell,

367
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,541
but how long can you keep it up?

368
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:52,208
Damn it. How could I have
fallen for such a stupid trap?

369
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,875
I swore an oath
that I'd protect her

370
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,375
no matter what happened.

371
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,541
[SHANNON]
Pacifica...

372
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,208
[KEYDARF] If you plan
on picking those herbs,

373
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,208
then you'll have to take
down that spell eventually.

374
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,458
Will you give it up and go home?
Or will you just die here?

375
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,500
Either way, the
Scrapped Princess will--

376
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,625
It pains me to take another
person's life unnecessarily,

377
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,250
but...

378
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,166
[KEYDARF]
Huh?

379
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,375
I have the power to
alter the size and shape

380
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,625
of the spell's barrier

381
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,916
to fit whatever situation
I find myself in.

382
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,958
You can what?!

383
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,000
[RAQUEL]
Now then, Silencer...

384
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,166
...will you die here like this?

385
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,625
Or are you going to call
off your little bugs..

386
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,416
...and hand over the herbs?

387
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,458
[chuckles] You must be kidding!

388
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,125
I don't believe you're really
capable of killing someone.

389
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,166
[grunts]

390
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,833
It seems that you
have chosen to die.

391
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:04,750
[KEYDARF] Wait! Wait a minute!
I give up! Stop! Stop!

392
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,000
[DOYLE]
The young plants are no good.

393
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,833
You have to make sure to
pick the thick, green ones.

394
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,125
Right.

395
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,708
We don't have much time!
Please, go faster, Sir Barrett!

396
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,333
I know, I know!

397
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,083
She's the Scrapped Princess...

398
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,875
Miss Pacifica...

399
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,833
She's the poison that will
destroy the world...

400
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,583
[RAQUEL] Doyle drives his
horse hard to save Pacifica,

401
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,041
and Leo, having found out that
she's the Scrapped Princess,

402
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,875
is completely at a loss.

403
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,250
But, just at that moment,

404
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,208
an unimaginable power
begins to stir around them.

405
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,250
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

406
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,166
"The Pied Piper's
Song of the Knights."

407
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,500
See you next time!
