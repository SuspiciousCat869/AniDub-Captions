1
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,500
[LEO] Excuse me, but I'm
in a great deal of pain.

2
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,333
Huh?

3
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,250
What's hurting you?

4
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,416
Well, I hate to say this
in front of ladies...

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,750
...but it's my butt.

6
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,833
Well, I guess that's part
of your training, then.

7
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,875
Miss Pacifica, you can
be so heartless...

8
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,041
Ugh.

9
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,750
Why are we taking
this backroad anyway?

10
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,833
[PACIFICA]
It's not like you had to take

11
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,708
the same road as us, you know?

12
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,041
[LEO] You truly are cruel,
Miss Pacifica.

13
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,458
But even so, I've
lost my goal in life,

14
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,166
the thing I was striving for.

15
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,625
[RAQUEL] I suppose it
wouldn't be training

16
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,000
if you didn't suffer.

17
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,500
[LEO]
That's so mean!

18
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,458
Uh, Shannon?

19
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,333
[LEO] We should've taken
this road in the first place.

20
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,666
But still, I wonder if
something's happened.

21
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,708
Look at all those
Royal Forces troops.

22
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,458
I'll go find out
what's going on.

23
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,791
But Shannon...

24
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,583
It'll be okay.

25
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,958
[SOLDIER A]
All right, move along.

26
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,500
Next!

27
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,333
They say the Scrapped
Princess lives.

28
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,000
[OLD WOMAN A]
Oh dear, how horrible!

29
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,125
Did she happen
to take this road?

30
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,666
[SOLDIER B]
You people!

31
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,791
Don't fall for a lot
of crazy rumors.

32
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,916
That's got nothin' to do
with this checkpoint.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,250
Hurry up and move your cart.

34
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,833
I found out!

35
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,166
When I asked them why the set
up this checkpoint, they said...

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,625
Uh...

37
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,333
Miss Pacifica?

38
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,333
Do all of you carry around
outfits like that, Big Brother?

39
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,833
Pretty much.

40
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,666
[LEO]
Oh, I get it!

41
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,541
The three of you are travelling
performers, am I right?!

42
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,166
Okay, time to ditch the knight.

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,250
[PACIFICA]
Sounds good.

44
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,750
[LEO]
Those guys sure are cold.

45
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,666
[SOLDIER C]
Is that her, Corporal?

46
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,916
Sources say she's travelling

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,750
with a black-haired
man and woman.

48
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,291
[LEO] Please don't leave
me behind like that!

49
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,666
Are you gonna put on a show
or something in the next town?

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,625
And who are you?

51
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,166
Oh, hello there. My name
is Leopold Skorpus.

52
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,333
I'd like to be of assistance

53
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,166
to this travelling
troupe of performers.

54
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,083
That's the family crest
of Baron Skorpus.

55
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,458
Please let me help you guys!

56
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,708
I'll play any part
that you want me to!

57
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,291
[SOLDIER B]
You're free to pass, sir.

58
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,458
Thank you!

59
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,333
Come now, let's be off!

60
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,250
Move along.

61
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,375
Thank you!

62
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,375
[sighs]

63
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,416
He certainly saved
us back there.

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,083
[SHANNON] I guess even
morons have their uses.

65
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,958
You're not totally
useless after all!

66
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,000
[LEO]
Huh?

67
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,791
[CHILDREN laughing]

68
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,791
[PACIFICA giggles]

69
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,250
[sighs]

70
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,333
It's so soft! It's been so
long since I've seen a bed.

71
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,958
They say they've got
a jungle-themed bath.

72
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,625
[PACIFICA]
That sounds neat!

73
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,875
[PACIFICA] There's even a
church on the edge of town.

74
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,541
[RAQUEL] We just slipped
through their checkpoint,

75
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,916
so I think we can relax
for a little while.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Hey, why don't we all go out

77
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,666
and get something delicious
for dinner tonight?

78
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,666
Forget it.

79
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,583
But why not?

80
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,791
We're out of money.

81
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,250
What?

82
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,541
[SHANNON] It's all we can do
just to pay for our rooms.

83
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,875
You're kidding...

84
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,000
[SHANNON]
Hey, you're the one who said

85
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,625
you wanted to sleep
in a bed tonight.

86
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,125
[PACIFICA] You're a hopeless
old scrooge, Shannon.

87
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,375
I, on the other hand,
am a delicate, young maiden.

88
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,666
[SHANNON] No maiden spouts
the garbage that you do.

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,458
[PACIFICA]
Oh yeah? You're lookin' at one!

90
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,041
[SHANNON]
Keep talkin' like that,

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,291
and I'll tie you up and hang you
from the rafters of this place.

92
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,250
Rats like you sleep really well

93
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,541
when they're strung
up for the night.

94
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,791
[PACIFICA]
What's that supposed to mean?

95
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,125
We're not curing
meats, you know?

96
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,500
[SHANNON]
Oh, shut up.

97
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,166
I wish you'd turn into some
dried food for a while.

98
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,291
[PACIFICA] Like a flounder?
Or a pufferfish?

99
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,750
[SHANNON]
Why, you little...

100
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,541
Oh yeah?!

101
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,708
[SHANNON]
Let go...

102
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,791
I'm sorry they're
making such a racket.

103
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,083
[GIRL]
That's fine with me.

104
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,666
As long as you don't
dirty up the rooms

105
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,958
or wreck the furniture, you
can beat each other to a pulp

106
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,458
or dance in a circle
for all I care.

107
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,166
Wow, that's great! I love
that kind of backtalk!

108
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,750
I think we're gonna be friends!

109
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,166
[GIRL]
Huh?

110
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,750
Hi, I'm Pacifica.

111
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,625
Uh...

112
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,458
[door opens]

113
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,291
[INNKEEPER]
Winia.

114
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,958
Have you finished cleaning up
all of the guestrooms yet?

115
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,500
Uh... yes.

116
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,916
Hey, Winia, come on!

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,750
Why don't you show us
around town for a little bit?

118
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,791
And then you can tell us where
we can find some work, okay?

119
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:34,375
[SHANNON]
Hey.

120
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,625
Ready?

121
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,666
I don't know...

122
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,833
Go ahead on out.

123
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,958
Okay... But I haven't
changed the sheets yet.

124
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,250
That's not a problem!

125
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,583
We can just leave all
that to the old geezer!

126
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,291
You expect me to do it?

127
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,500
[PACIFICA]
Come on!

128
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,333
Hurry up already! Let's go!

129
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,458
Find work?

130
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,875
Well, it actually
might be a good way

131
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,625
to fool people around
here and blend in.

132
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,666
That's true. In that case,
keep up the good work, Shannon.

133
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,000
[SHANNON]
Uh, uh?

134
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,875
[LEO]
I guess this is training, too.

135
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,166
[FEMALE OFFICER]
That town over there is Taurus.

136
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,375
[MALE OFFICER]
We apparently overlooked them

137
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,875
at the checkpoint,

138
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,625
but they almost certainly snuck
into that town to lay low.

139
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,291
The main body of
the Royal Forces

140
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,208
doesn't wanna have to get
involved in any unpleasantness.

141
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,291
They must think that it's
the Special Force's job

142
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,875
to go in and get
their hands dirty.

143
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,791
[CHRIS] At any rate, we can't
hold back against these people.

144
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,500
We'll go to reconnoiter
the location

145
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,000
of the Scrapped Princess.

146
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,375
Good. I'll be carrying out
the mission personally.

147
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,708
And... I'll succeed no
matter what it takes.

148
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,750
How cute!

149
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,583
Don't you think this would
look great in your room, Winia?

150
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,333
Why don't you buy it, then?

151
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,708
[PACIFICA]
Uh...

152
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,833
Well, we're in the middle
of a trip right now.

153
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,291
Oh, I see.

154
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,458
[WINIA] I guess I've
never really set foot

155
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,458
outside this town of Taurus.

156
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,916
I work in that inn
from dawn to dusk

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,708
trying to get all
my chores done.

158
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,750
All I do is take care of people
who are passing through.

159
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,958
Sounds nice.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,375
What could be so great
about a life like that?

161
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,958
It's simple, really.

162
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,916
I think I might be a little
bit jealous of you, Winia.

163
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,875
[LEO]
Miss Pacifica!

164
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,583
[PACIFICA]
Leo!

165
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,458
[RAQUEL] Did you manage
to find lodging somewhere?

166
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,208
No, I'm sleeping in the
barn of a local house.

167
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,083
[PACIFICA]
Oh, so you're broke, too?

168
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,958
Truth be told, I'd much rather
be able to buy my betrothed

169
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,250
a single rose than
pay for a room.

170
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,416
Wait a sec, since when are the
two of us engaged to be married?

171
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,791
[LEO] Sorry! Perhaps that was a
little forward of me. Oh dear.

172
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,958
[PACIFICA] "Oh dear"? Is that
all you have to say? Ugh.

173
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,625
[SHANNON]
Why am I stuck doing this?

174
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,875
Oops... This end's
a little wrinkled.

175
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,541
Sorry, I've got all the
help I need right now.

176
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,458
Oh, really? You do?

177
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,291
Come on, let's go
try somewhere else.

178
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:05,416
Too bad. The uniforms at
this café were so cute...

179
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,000
Hey, Raquel, is
something the matter?

180
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,166
It's so cute.

181
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,375
[LEO, PACIFICA]
Uh...

182
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,625
[RAQUEL] Announcing our
brand new Mr. Soopie buns!

183
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,666
Would you like to try a sample?
They're really quite delicious!

184
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,791
Would you like to try some?

185
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,125
Get your Mr. Soopie buns!

186
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,291
Would you like to try one?

187
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,375
Get your Mr. Soopie buns!

188
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,250
Would you like to
try a little sample?

189
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,291
Huh?

190
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,708
Geez, the customers run away

191
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,833
when they catch
sight of this thing.

192
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,541
But why? Just look
how cute he is!

193
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,583
Wow, you're really life savers!

194
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,083
I haven't been able to find
many part-time workers

195
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,916
who would be willing
to wear that suit.

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,291
I suppose not.

197
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,791
We're planning on expanding
our entire product line,

198
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,000
and it's going to be centered
around our mascot Mr. Soopie.

199
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,000
There'll be danishes,
cream buns, and jam buns.

200
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,166
Really? Are you sure? They
all look the same to me.

201
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,750

Promote them even more!

Well, let's give it our best!

[PACIFICA] Would you like to
try a taste of one of our buns?

205
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,750
Would you like to try
a Mr. Soopie bun?

206
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,291
Wouldn't you like a sample bun?!

207
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,916
We're not doing well.

208
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,000
Right!

Would you like to have a taste?

Hello, sir!

Would you like to
try one of my buns?

217
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,333
Maybe I should try one myself...

Mmm!

00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,000
[PACIFICA] All right. This is
officially getting on my nerves!

223
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,041
Would you like to try one?!

Would you like one?!

[PACIFICA] Wait, look!
Look! See, I'm eating it!

Come on, look! Look! Ah!

Sheesh!

You certainly hate to
lose, Miss Pacifica.

Hmm?

[giggles]

236
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,541
Did you like that, Winia?

237
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,125
[WINIA]
Huh?

238
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,000
I thought you look like a
fool out there, that's all.

[PACIFICA]
Let's go, Winia.

[LEO]
Yes?

00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,291
Have you seen a blonde-haired

with eyes like a cat's?

Who're you?

Wait, don't tell me you're
a rival for her affections?!

Hey, now!

You've gotta put your back
into it when you're scrubbing!

I don't wanna hear it!

bother me, get lost!

What're you talking about?!

I'm doing my job and
checking how hot the bath is!

Oh!

267
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,583
Do you actually have something
that's worth hiding?

[PACIFICA growls]

269
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,708
[RAQUEL] I'm so glad that
we found a place to work.

270
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,125
It just means that
you can stay for free.

271
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,958
I heard that you were
the one nice enough

272
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,833
to recommend us
to the innkeeper.

273
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,875
I didn't really do anything.

274
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:48,916
[RAQUEL]
Thank you.

275
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,541
I sure worked up a good sweat!

276
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,458
Are you done cleaning
the bath already?

277
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,333
[PACIFICA]
Hm?

278
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,708
My brother Shannon's doing it.

279
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,291
So you're just going
to have your brother

280
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,208
do all your chores
around the place for you?

281
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,541
Well, that may just
be his lot in life.

282
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,208
What's that supposed to mean?

283
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,208
I'm not really cut out
for manual labor,

284
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,458
if you know what I mean.

285
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,625
Never mind that. Let's have tea.

286
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,833
I still have a cake that I got
from that bakery. Let's eat it!

287
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,541
Go right ahead! Feel free to
have some tea with her, Winia.

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,708
[PACIFICA]
Thanks so much, Big Sister!

290
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,083
Ah! But I have to--

291
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,333
[PACIFICA] Don't worry about
it, Winia! C'mon, hurry!

292
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,791
I don't think I've
ever seen Winia

293
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,250
be so open with anyone before.

294
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,958
Ever since the day her
parents passed away,

295
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,458
I haven't seen that girl
be happy or even smile.

296
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,125
[PACIFICA]
Ta-dah!

297
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,083
That baker sure seems to
have some strange tastes.

298
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,250
Yeah, that's what I've always
thought about him, too.

299
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,125
Yeah, I bet!

304
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,458
[LEO] What in the world
am I doing here?

305
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,708
[BAKER clears throat]

306
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,250
[LEO] Would you like
some Mr. Soopie buns?!

307
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,833
[PACIFICA] So you're telling
me you and your uncle

308
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,250
take care of everything in
this inn? All by yourselves?

309
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,500
Yes.

310
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,916
You're so amazing, Winia.
And you can cook.

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,541
You've really got
your act together.

312
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,666
I wouldn't go that far.

313
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,375
I mean, if you
weren't working here,

314
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,833
then the Big Bear Inn couldn't
stay in business, right?

315
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:34,041
I guess... I'm just repaying the
man who took me in, that's all.

316
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,000
All I really know how
to do is work hard.

317
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,250
But still, that's
pretty amazing.

318
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,208
Wow, not only am
I completely useless,

319
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,708
but apparently, the world would
be a lot better off without me.

320
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,750
[WINIA]
Hm?

321
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,916
Uh. Sorry! I was just grumbling.

322
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,666
I never feel that
I can really do that

323
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,416
around Shannon and Raquel.

324
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,208
I understand. When I get
angry at myself like that,

325
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,708
I just start cleaning up
everything around me.

326
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know why I do it,
it's strange. Isn't it?

327
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:08,875
[PACIFICA]
Mm-mm.

328
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,666
Next time, I'll give that a try.

329
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,083
Sure, and you can
get your brother

330
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,583
to do the work for you again.

331
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,291
[BOTH giggle]

332
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,791
What?

333
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,125
[PACIFICA] Wow! You've got
really pretty eyes, Winia!

334
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,166
Oh, cool!

335
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,083
I can see my reflection!

336
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:26,958
[WINIA]
Ah?

337
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,375
Hey, you're right! There I am!

338
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,250
[BOTH laugh]

339
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,333
I hope... that maybe I can stay
in this town for a while.

340
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,416
Phew! Well, that should
just about do it.

341
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,833
[GIRL]
You'll make someone a fine wife.

342
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:57,208
That's pretty strange
advice coming from a kid.

343
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,333
Of course, I bet that
form isn't the real you.

344
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,500
[GIRL]
Oh? How can you tell?

345
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,583
[SHANNON] 'Cause I can't
feel your presence.

346
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,458
If it's an illusion, you can
project whatever form you want.

347
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:12,291
Well, in any case, I wasn't the
one who decided on this form.

348
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,416
I came here today to warn you.

349
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,625
[SHANNON]
Huh?

350
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,458
There are new assassins
out looking for you.

351
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,000
[SHANNON sighs]

352
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,875
And here I thought we'd be able
to take it easy for a while.

353
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,625
Well, thanks a lot for
the warning, anyway.

354
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,208
Even though I have
no idea who you are.

355
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,541
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Zefiris.

356
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,250
Zefiris?

357
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,375
That is the name that was given
to me. I ask you to remember it.

358
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,750
I'm sorry. Looks like we're
gonna have to leave in a hurry.

359
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,291
Is it always like this?

360
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,541
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

361
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,875
It seems like the three
of you are on the run

362
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,541
more than you're on
a trip somewhere.

363
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,500
I thought we'd be able to stay
here a little while longer,

364
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,458
but I guess I was naïve.

365
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,416
If you wanna stay,
then why don't you stay?

366
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,833
I do.

367
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,625
I mean, I might've finally been
able to make a friend here.

368
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,291
I might've, too.

369
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,333
Winia...

370
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,416
Good evening.

371
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,250
Can I help you?

372
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,291
Shannon Cassul.
You know him, don't you?

373
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,541
Uh... No, I don't know him.

374
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,791
Naughty girl. You shouldn't lie.

375
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,750
[WINIA]
Let go!

376
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,958
[INNKEEPER]
Hmm?

377
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,458
Winia! Hey, what do you
think you're doing?!

378
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,875
Uncle!

379
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,375
My apologies, but you're
going to be my bait.

380
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,625
Get a move on.

381
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,041
I don't want us to make
any trouble for this inn.

382
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,208
[thud]

383
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,458
Winia's been kidnapped...

384
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:24,958
[RAQUEL]
Are you all right?!

385
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,708
[PACIFICA]
What happened to Winia?!

386
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,708
[INNKEEPER]
She was taken away.

387
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,041
[SHANNON]
By who?

388
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,458
[INNKEEPER] A strange boy
in a military uniform.

389
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,958
So what is this
Arwen Gorge place?

390
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,833
It's the Valley of Glass
that's beyond the North Gate.

391
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,958
But, the gorge is a very
dangerous place that...

392
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,208
W-Wait a minute! Let me go try
to get some folks from town!

393
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,166
[SHANNON]
I'll go by myself.

394
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,000
Going after him in numbers
would put Winia in danger.

395
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,375
Rest assured,
I'll bring her back.

396
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,958
[PACIFICA]
Big Brother, wait!

397
00:18:59,041 --> 00:18:59,916
I'll go, too!

398
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
[SHANNON]
Forget it.

399
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,000
You just make sure to have
dinner waiting, okay?

400
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,333
Enough for two.

401
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,583
[CHRIS]
Are you awake?

402
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,625
[gasps]

403
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,833
[WINIA]
Who are you?

404
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,333
[CHRIS] You can call
me Chris if you like.

405
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,291
Don't worry, you just might
make it home safe and sound

406
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,708
if the guardian doesn't
do anything foolish.

407
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,041
[WINIA]
What? What're you talking about?

408
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,291
Oh, that's right.
You don't know about it.

409
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,708
[CHRIS] Once upon a time,
there was a kingdom.

410
00:19:55,791 --> 00:20:00,000
There, the queen gave birth to
fine twins: A boy and a girl.

411
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,958
However, the people of the
castle trembled with fear.

412
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,875
They were sorely afraid
because there had been

413
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,875
a divine revelation
regarding those twins.

414
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,750
"Of the twins delivered
from Her Majesty's womb,

415
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,000
you must slay the girl
child immediately.

416
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:20,041
She will give rise to mountains
of corpses and rivers of blood.

417
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,541
On the destined day,

418
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,416
she will become the poison
which will destroy this world."

419
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,666
The Revelation of Saint Grendel.

420
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,583
[CHRIS] Prophecies are delivered
once a year at Grendel,

421
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,666
the holy land of
the Church of Mauser.

422
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,708
Their accuracy
is nearly perfect.

423
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,333
Fifteen years have passed
since then, and one day,

424
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,875
the royal family happened to
discover that the princess

425
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,583
who was believed to have
been scrapped was, in fact,

426
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,833
still alive.

427
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,666
You mean...

428
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,333
...it's Pacifica?

429
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,958
Fascinating story, isn't it?

430
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:38,916
[RAQUEL]
Winia has learned

431
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,791
that Pacifica is the
Scrapped Princess.

432
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,708
Shannon heads to the Valley of
Glass in order to rescue her,

433
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,791
and Pacifica makes dinner
in the hopes that her brother

434
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,833
will come home safe and
bring her friend back as well.

435
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,708
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

436
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,750
"Concerto of Meetings
and Partings."

437
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,041
See you next time!
