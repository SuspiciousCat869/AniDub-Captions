1
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:41,458
[BARONESS] I must say I'm
shocked. A dragon appeared?

2
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,916
[STURM] A dragon-shaped light
was supposedly observed

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,750
by some witnesses in the area.

4
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,291
What concerns me more, however,

5
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,208
is this "humanoid something"
that seemed to be fighting it.

6
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,041
[BARONESS]
What do you believe it was?

7
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:58,125
A Peacemaker. That's
just my personal opinion.

8
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,500
[chuckles]

9
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,708
And here, I thought you
were a realist, Major Sturm,

10
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,583
and not give into
fairy tales and myth.

11
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,958
[STURM]
Whatever that thing was,

12
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,583
Shannon Cassul
was able to defeat it.

13
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,791
That fact cannot be overlooked.

14
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,291
If we don't act quickly,

15
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,166
people will come forward to
attempt to claim this power.

16
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,291
Someone like--

17
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,208
The third princess
of the Giat Empire,

18
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,041
Her Highness, Senes Lur Giat.

19
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,708
The crisis management
organization that she runs

20
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,916
is called "Scarlet," isn't it?

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,958
Yes. The Scarlet Organization
has been exhibiting

22
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,041
some odd behavior,

23
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,416
especially over these
past two years.

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,791
A rebellion?

25
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,375
[STURM]
That is a possibility.

26
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,416
And there's something
else to consider.

27
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,166
The Scrapped Princess and
her party may possess a force

28
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,750
that is capable of destroying
this world's balance of power.

29
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,166
[BARONESS]
Hmm...

30
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,083
That's true. I'm very
grateful to you, Major Sturm.

31
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,125
[PACIFICA]
Hey, I was wondering something.

32
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,375
Why do you suppose that guy

33
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,166
who turned into that
monster back there

34
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,458
didn't just attack me directly?

35
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,750
[RAQUEL]
What?

36
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,791
He did the exact same
thing back in Taurus.

37
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,166
If he was going to attack me,

38
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,208
then he should've just
come straight at me.

39
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,458
[RAQUEL]
Pacifica...

40
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,500
[bang]

41
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,750
--[PACIFICA yelps]
--[RAQUEL grunts]

42
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,875
--What happened?
--An attack?!

43
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,041
[SHANNON]
Not really.

44
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,125
[PACIFICA]
No way.

45
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,916
Why did it have to break
down here of all places?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,750
There's nothing
we could've done.

47
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,833
Guess that's it.

48
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,166
This wagon is probably
a bad idea now.

49
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,625
People are out looking for it.

50
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,166
We've almost used up
all of our money as well.

51
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,041
It might be time for us
to figure out another plan.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,958
[yelps]

53
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,208
[SHANNON]
Don't break it!

54
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,541
I guess nobody lives here.

55
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,750
We'll have a roof over our
heads to keep us dry, at least.

56
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,291
Looks like we'll be stopping
here for a little while.

57
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,500
In that case, we'll let
you get to it, Shannon.

58
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,583
[SHANNON]
Huh?

59
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,958
You're gonna go
shopping for us, right?

60
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,000
[SHANNON]
Eh?

61
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,375
[SHANNON]
Hmm... Let's see here...

62
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,583
Salted fish and long onions,

63
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,500
some potatoes, and
eggs, of course.

64
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,875
And two pairs of underwear.

65
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,041
I think I've got everything now.

66
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,208
But is this anyway for a sister
to treat her older brother?

67
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,791
[SHANNON]
See ya, kid.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,333
[footsteps]

69
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,666
Now, look here.

70
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,291
All of this is just making
me look stupid, you know?

71
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,041
My name... it's Cz.

72
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,541
Is that so? Your
name is Cz, huh?

73
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,708
Listen to me, Cz, I'm on a
very important trip right now,

74
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,666
so you can't really
come with me.

75
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,958
Do you understand?

76
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,583
See ya.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,375
[RAQUEL] Shannon is on his
way back from shopping,

78
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,458
but it looks like--

79
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,958
[PACIFICA]
Tell me something, Raquel.

80
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,583
[RAQUEL]
Hmm?

81
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,750
Why is it that you're able
to use magic like that?

82
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,791
[RAQUEL]
Hmm...

83
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,250
I wonder... I'm not
really sure why.

84
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,708
You mean, you use it
without knowing how?

85
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,375
Using magic is more
of an intuitive thing,

86
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,000
so it's sort of hard to explain
how it works with words.

87
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,500
But when I was first starting,

88
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,708
Mother told me that the strength
of someone's magical power

89
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,041
is determined by the capacity
of a person's awareness.

90
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,250
[PACIFICA]
Capacity?

91
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,000
But just because your
capacity is bigger,

92
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,041
it doesn't necessarily mean that
your magic will be stronger.

93
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,125
It doesn't?

94
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,708
[RAQUEL]
Of course not.

95
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,541
Manipulating natural forces
is what triggers spells.

96
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,875
Someone's mental capacity
is only part of it.

97
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,916
[PACIFICA]
Hmm...

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,750
[door opens]

99
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,333
It sounds like he's back.

100
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,291
[SHANNON]
Well, I'm back now.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,833
[CHRIS] You wished to speak
with me, Baroness?

102
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,333
You're always so formal.

103
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:25,541
Why don't you ever call me
Mother like you used to, Chris?

104
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,333
Well, I guess that's enough
kidding around for today,

105
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,416
so let me get
right to the point.

106
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,291
I want you to go to the Holy
City of Grendel for me.

107
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,958
This is regarding Grendel
Revelation number 5,111,

108
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,291
isn't it?

109
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,291
[BARONESS] I'm grateful
that you're a quick study.

110
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,375
I understand, ma'am. In that
case, I'll be off at once.

111
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,500
[BARONESS]
Oh, I forgot. This is for you.

112
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,250
[BARONESS] It seems that the
sender's name is Winia Chester.

113
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,458
From Winia?

114
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,083
Oh, her...

115
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,000
[BARONESS] It's moving
to see our Christopher

116
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,875
receiving letters from women; in
fact, it inspired me to action.

117
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,291
So I sent copies of
the letter as a memo

118
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,791
to the rest of the unit.

119
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,250
[CHRIS]
But, Baroness!

120
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,750
[BARONESS]
I'm shocked!

121
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,916
You're telling me my
innocent Christopher

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,375
has an older woman as a lover?

123
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,291
Well?!

124
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,708
Oh, I get it now...

125
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,583
[BARONESS] I will admit
that on its surface,

126
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,291
it was a purely platonic
thank you letter.

127
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,375
However, as I read
between the lines,

128
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,500
I could detect the heart-felt
yearnings of a young girl.

129
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,875
I'm impressed with your
ability to read into things.

130
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,333
[BARONESS]
For a lady like myself

131
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,333
with too much free
time on her hands,

132
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,625
the love affairs of the young
are the ultimate pastime.

133
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,500
Please don't say such
things, Baroness.

134
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,916
Are we clear?

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,750
You will head directly to
the Holy City of Grendel.

136
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,541
I don't want you to
go wandering off

137
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,666
and visiting little
Winia by mistake.

138
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,708
I won't.

139
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,166
[PACIFICA] What're we gonna
do with this girl anyway?

140
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,791
[SHANNON] That's a good
question. I don't know.

141
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,333
[RAQUEL] But, Shannon,
we don't know for certain

142
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,625
that this girl is
actually an orphan.

143
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,583
If we're not careful, this
could look like a kidnapping.

144
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,666
And considering the situation
that we're in right now--

145
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,458
[SHANNON]
Yeah, I know.

146
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,041
I know that already.

147
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,916
[SHANNON] But when she looks
at me with those eyes,

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
how can I say no?

149
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,333
Man! This is pathetic!

150
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,166
You're just gonna have to spell
things out for her, that's all.

151
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,875
We can't take her with us where
we're going, and you know it.

152
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,500
Wow, when did you become
so heartless, Pacifica?

153
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,958
Come on, Shannon.

154
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,333
You know she's just upset

155
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,416
because you brought
another girl home with you.

156
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,791
[PACIFICA grunts]

157
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,458
What're you talking about?!
I'm always heartless!

158
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,416
Oh, really?

159
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,833
Yeah, I. Am. Really.

160
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,958
[giggles]

161
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,916
Look, Cz, here's the deal:

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,958
I hate to say this to
you, but the thing is,

163
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,125
you can't really stay with us.

164
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,333
Understand?

165
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,625
In other words, you're going to
have to say goodbye eventually.

166
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,208
Yes, you will!

167
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,958
Oh, dear. I don't think
she likes you much.

168
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,458
Don't just sit there
laughing at me,

169
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,250
why don't you try
talking to her?

170
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,625
Yeah, you're right.

171
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,000
Excuse me, Cz.

172
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,666
What would you like to do, Cz?

173
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,625
Don't you have a
home to go to, Cz?

174
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,125
[CZ]
No.

175
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,625
[RAQUEL]
Oh, I see.

176
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,083
Then you don't have a daddy
or a mommy waiting for you?

177
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,625
I don't.

178
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,041
Are you lost then?

179
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,500
Have your parents passed away?

180
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,541
Well, could it be that you
just can't remember anything?

181
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,125
[SHANNON] I think we should
let her spend the night here

182
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,708
for the time being.

183
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,291
She needs our help,

184
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,750
and we can't just toss her out
into a rainy night like this.

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,958
[PACIFICA]
Hmph.

186
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,958
[yawns]

187
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,000
[gasps]

188
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,458
What's the matter?

189
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,000
[PACIFICA]
Nothing's the matter!

190
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,916
[PACIFICA]
So... what're we gonna do?

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,833
This is so awkward...

192
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,375
If we try to take Cz back to
her town, we might be spotted.

193
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,583
[PACIFICA]
Yeah, I know that, but still...

194
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,541
Well, I suppose that we
were planning to stay here

195
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,666
for at least four or five days,

196
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,958
so why don't we just let
her borrow Shannon from us

197
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,458
until we have to leave?

198
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,916
What is that supposed to mean?

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,333
Hey, what're you two
mumbling about over there?

200
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,833
Nothing, really.

201
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,625
Cz, you've been clinging to
him like a vine all morning.

202
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,666
What's so great about
Shannon anyway?

203
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,791
[CZ]
I waiting.

204
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:08,958
Huh?

205
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:13,166
I waiting. Shannon come
by. So I like him.

206
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,125
I don't get what you mean.

207
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:15,958
I like him.

208
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,833
Okay, okay, I get that.

209
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,583
It sounds like she was standing
out there waiting for someone,

210
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,541
and when I walked by her, she
mistook me for that person.

211
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,791
But if that's true, don't you
think that maybe she should be

212
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,375
waiting for that person to
come by and pick her up?

213
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,833
[CZ]
Huh...?

214
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,750
[RAQUEL] Still, I wonder
if no one even bothered

215
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,333
to pay any attention to her
until you did, Shannon.

216
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,375
It's pretty strange when
you think about it.

217
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,708
Anyway, once the
road dries out,

218
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,583
I'll head back into
town and ask around.

219
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,375
Well, I guess that's
all we can do for now.

220
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,958
[CHRIS]
Cardinal Garnest Hoag?

221
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,250
Excuse me. My name is
Christopher Bairach.

222
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:12,791
You're a Bairach. You must
be the Baroness' son.

223
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,583
Thank you for granting me an
audience. I'm very grateful.

224
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,708
As a man who is both

225
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,500
the Cardinal of the
Church of Mauser,

226
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,583
as well as the Commissioner
of the elimination squad

227
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,958
known as the Purgers,

228
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,791
there are some questions
I'd like to ask you.

229
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,375
Please forgive my rude
manner of speaking.

230
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,166
My original specialty was
smashing and destroying.

231
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,291
[HOGUE]
You're from the Special Forces.

232
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,958
[CHRIS] Yes, and I've taken
part in two operations

233
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:42,375
to assassinate the
Scrapped Princess as well.

234
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,375
I've come to ask you if you
would tell me the truth

235
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,416
behind the 5,111th
Revelation of Grendel.

236
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,875
Tell you the truth?

237
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,041
Young man, I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

238
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,750
[CHRIS] There isn't a
single document remaining

239
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,208
that deals with that revelation
or what it may have said,

240
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,416
and we know of two revelations
that turned out to be wrong.

241
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,041
Only two were wrong.

242
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,583
Twice too many.

243
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,291
How can a god that's omnipotent
make two mistakes like that?

244
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,000
[HOGUE]
God is mysterious.

245
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,000
It's possible that the priests
who interpreted the divine words

246
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,083
were mistaken.

247
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,708
The sacred speech
of the revelations

248
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,333
is not the same as the
words we use to speak.

249
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,333
I've been able to meet the
Scrapped Princess face-to-face.

250
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,333
I'm also familiar with
her brother and sister,

251
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,375
the ones whom you
call the Guardians.

252
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,750
However, no matter
how hard I tried,

253
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,458
I still couldn't bring
myself to believe

254
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,083
that she was an evil being.

255
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,958
[HOGUE]
What're you implying?

256
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,166
This god who tried to wipe
out the Scrapped Princess

257
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,125
along with the town of Taurus,

258
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,375
what exactly is he?

259
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,125
As I recall, that operation was
under the Purger's jurisdiction.

260
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,208
So then, are you telling me
that it was really your god

261
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,958
who did all that?

262
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,541
Well, as to that... Hmm...

263
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,666
[CHRIS] Let's leave it
there for today, shall we?

264
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,583
I may come to speak
with you again,

265
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,458
and I look forward to
your cooperation when I do.

266
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,833
[sighs]

267
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,791
[WOMAN] What's the matter,
Cardinal? You look exhausted.

268
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,000
[HOGUE]
Huh?

269
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,833
L-Lady Steyr! It's you!

270
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,041
What bring you to my humble
chambers, Lady Steyr?

271
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,750
[STEYR]
I'm going to go out for a while.

272
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,000
Huh?

273
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,291
Finding people was
originally Galil's job,

274
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,875
but he got himself killed.

275
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,625
He died before he could pass
his task on to another.

276
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,708
[HOGUE]
Huh?

277
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,041
Impossible...
Lord Galil is dead?

278
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,791
[STEYR] Which means I'll
be leaving you alone here

279
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,166
for a while.

280
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,458
So keep an eye on
things, all right?

281
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,375
[HOGUE]
It can't be...

282
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,750
How could Lord Galil, a dutiful
servant of god, perish?!

283
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,375
It's not possible!

284
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,791
[knocking]

285
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,416
You may enter.

286
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,125
[NUN]
Excuse me, Cardinal.

287
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,625
Tell me, Colette:

288
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:25,541
Do you believe that god must be
an all-powerful, absolute being?

289
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,000
I wonder...

290
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,000
If god is not an immortal
being, if that's true...

291
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,958
That's not possible.

292
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,291
God doesn't die
because he is god.

293
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,583
And he is god because
he can never die.

294
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,958
It is because he is just
that god cannot die.

295
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,041
And even our thoughts
about god and justice

296
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,875
only exist because
he wills it to be so.

297
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,666
And if you look at it
from the end goal,

298
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,166
god always makes sure to point
us in the right direction.

299
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,208
Therefore, god cannot die.

300
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,291
I suppose you're right.

301
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,500
I'll leave you to your
tea then, Cardinal.

302
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,500
Ugh... It's awful...

303
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,166
[PACIFICA sighs]

You can't work delicate maidens
like us all day, you know?

We're not built for it.

[SHANNON] Careful, now.
Don't spill the filling, okay?

315
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,000
Make sure to hold it like
this while you eat it.

316
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,791
[RAQUEL giggles]

317
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,041
Oh. Is something the matter?

318
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,000
[PACIFICA]
Not really.

319
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,666
Well, if you say so.

320
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,500
I guess it's sorta
strange, isn't it?

321
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,208
She looks like she's another
member of the family.

322
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,875
[SHANNON sighs]

323
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:08,875
[PACIFICA]
Hold it!

324
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,875
And where do you
think you're going?

325
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,166
I go. The bath.

326
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,291
[PACIFICA]
Well, you can't

327
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,125
because Shannon's
in there right now.

328
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,208
I go take bath with Shannon.

329
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,583
Look, Cz, we'll say you're a
girl for the sake of argument.

330
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,625
[CZ]
You take bath, too, Pacifica?

331
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,458
Now, why would I do that?

332
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,083
Cz like. Cz like Shannon.

333
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,333
Pacifica like Shannon, too?

334
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,083
Yeah, sure I do. Because
Shannon is my brother.

335
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,458
[CZ]
You like?

336
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,458
Well, it's not as if I hate him.

337
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,208
Hey, Shannon.

338
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,750
[SHANNON]
Hm?

339
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,041
You do have another one of those
cords somewhere, don't you?

340
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,208
[SHANNON]
Hmm?

341
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,875
Come on now, stop
fidgeting. Hold still.

342
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,541
Do you itch anywhere else?

343
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,416
No.

344
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,833
I'm gonna rinse you off then.

345
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:58,875
Okay.

346
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,375
Seven.

347
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,000
That's six.

348
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:10,875
That's seven.

349
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,000
I get out.

350
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,125
[PACIFICA]
Hmm? Mm.

351
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,291
You can go.

352
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,125
[PACIFICA]
Hey, no running!

353
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,416
[thunder rumbles]

354
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,041
I guess she's not really
such a bad kid...

355
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,041
Hey, Raquel, the bath
is all yours now. Hm?

356
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:40,250
Look at this! She's got the
same hairstyle as Shannon!

357
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,708
[giggles]

358
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,541
I'm going to make something
fancy for dinner tonight,

359
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,791
so I hope you're all
looking forward to it.

360
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,375
Cz wants to help!

361
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,625
[RAQUEL] Oh! So you're going
to help me, little one?

362
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,250
Wow!

363
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:55,041
She's a cut above another
certain tomboy I could mention.

364
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,166
What're you making?

365
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,833
[RAQUEL]
Now that is a secret.

366
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,375
[SHANNON]
Just don't use any magic.

367
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,333
[RAQUEL]
Why not?

368
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,666
[SHANNON, RAQUEL laugh]

369
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,750
[PACIFICA]
Geez! You scared me!

370
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,166
You're name's Zefiris, right?
What's the matter?

371
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,666
[ZEFIRIS] Are you saying
that you do not fear me?

372
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,958
Huh? Well, we're both on the
same side now, aren't we?

373
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,166
I'm not human.

374
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,166
I am what your kind
calls a dragon,

375
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,291
a being who commands vast
powers of destruction.

376
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,791
That may be true,

377
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,291
but you're not gonna use your
powers on us, now are ya?

378
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,791
So it seems to me
like there isn't

379
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,583
any reason to be frightened.

380
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,208
This is sudden, but I
require your assistance.

381
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,750
My assistance?

382
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,333
[PACIFICA]
What's this for?

383
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,458
[ZEFIRIS] That girl, the young
girl who is with you now.

384
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,958
[PACIFICA] You mean Cz? What
does this have to do with her?

385
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,875
I need you to kill that girl.

386
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:05,916
Huh?

387
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,916
[RAQUEL] Zefiris tells
Pacifica to help her kill Cz.

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
There's just no
telling when a person

389
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,708
will suddenly be the target
of another person's ill will.

390
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,708
All of this leads to Shannon and
Pacifica having a fight over Cz.

391
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,708
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

392
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,666
"Nocturne of Bonds and Prayers."

393
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,916
See you next time!
