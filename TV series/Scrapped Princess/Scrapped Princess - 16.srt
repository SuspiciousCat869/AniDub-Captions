[DRUNK gasps]

00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,250
You know, I let you take
a friendly swing at me

4
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,791
when I stopped ya from making
an ass of yourself before.

5
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,750
But you weren't really trying to
start a fight with me, were you?

6
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,416
No, sir...

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,375
Now, pay your bill
and run along home.

8
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,541
Nothin' to see.

9
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,333
Just a little horseplay.

10
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,000
Sorry about that.

11
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,291
You always take care of things.

12
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,250
[FURET]
It's nothin'.

13
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,958
Thanks so much.

14
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,208
Oh! Here's what I owe
you for last month.

15
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,750
I'm sorry that it's
a little late.

16
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,583
There's no need for
you to apologize,

17
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,250
but I'm charging interest.

18
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,250
[BARKEEP]
Huh?

19
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,875
[FURET]
Doesn't have to be fancy,

20
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,875
but could I get some
sandwiches as a late fee?

21
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,375
Enough for two.

22
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,500
[PETERS-STAHL]
It was self-defense.

23
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,208
The Giat Empire had been
hiding a mobile fortress

24
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,208
in preparation for
all-out war. On top of that,

25
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,500
they had the Scrapped
Princess in their possession

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,416
and were plotting to
destroy the entire world.

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
It is vital, therefore,
that we respond to

28
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,875
the Giat Empire's invasion
attempt with the utmost resolve.

29
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,750
But General Stahl, Giat and
Leinwan have maintained

30
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,000
a peaceful relationship
for many years now.

31
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,833
Giat was the one who
attacked us first.

32
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,375
[BARONESS] The Skid is
completely destroyed,

33
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,166
and there are no indications
that they will attack us again.

34
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,666
I do not see any reason
to continue fighting.

35
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,750
Are you saying then that I
should reverse my decision?

36
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,291
I cannot in good conscience

37
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,916
order my troops to
fight in such a war.

38
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,875
Baroness, I hereby
relieve you of your position

39
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,416
as the Special Forces commander.

[LUKE]
Sir?

43
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,708
[PETERS-STAHL]
As of today,

44
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,666
you will receive a
two-rank promotion.

45
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,708
The Special Forces will be
under your command from now on.

[LUKE gasps]

47
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,333
[PETERS-STAHL] The death
of the Scrapped Princess

48
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,958
has yet to be confirmed.

49
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,041
But depending on
how she is used,

50
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,875
the poison that will
destroy the world

51
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,416
could become our trump
card for world domination.

[GENERALS murmuring]

53
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,791
[PETERS-STAHL]
We will use all our forces

54
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,708
to capture the
Scrapped Princess.

55
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,875
Once we have her
in our possession,

56
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,208
this war is as good as won.

57
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,291
Uh... I...

00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,625

[FURET sighs]

Of all the strays
I coulda found,

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,875
I had to pick up that one.

67
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,416
[SHANNON]
They're not dead.

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,166
I refuse to believe that
either of them are dead.

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,041
Even the Peacemakers are
still out looking for them.

70
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,958
[ZEFIRIS]
Rest for a while, my Master.

71
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,041
If you keep this up,
you will collapse.

72
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,083
If you wish to find your sisters
before the Peacemakers do,

73
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,125
you should go about it in the
most efficient manner possible.

74
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,541
I've had it with you and
your blasted efficiency!

75
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,583
Is that your answer
to everything?!

76
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,625
If I collapse,
you'll just have to find

someone else with
my genes, right?

78
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,500
[ZEFIRIS]
No, I won't.

79
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,958
I never want to go
through that again.

80

If you still refuse
to trust me, so be it.

81
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,750
However, there is
something you must know.

00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,875
I stay at your side
because I choose to,

83
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,208
not because of any duty.

84
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,208
I will assist you
now regardless of

85
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,791
the intent of my
original mission...

Mr. Berkens?

95
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,875
Well, I'm glad to see
you're still alive.

96
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,000
So, are your brother and
sister still with you?

97
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,125
[RAQUEL gasps]

98
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,041
Well... Uh...

99
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,583
So, what are you doing here
in the Capital, Mr. Berkens?

100
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,500
I got called back under orders
from Church headquarters.

101
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,041
They said that they lost track
of the Scrapped Princess

102
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,625
a couple of weeks ago.

103
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,458
After they dropped Ginnungagap
on that mobile fortress,

104
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,416
they went searching for the
body of the Scrapped Princess.

105
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,041
But they couldn't find it.

106
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,875
Not long after that, information
started going around that

107
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,416
a blonde-haired, blue-eyed
girl had been spotted

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,916
on the coast near the city.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,583
I don't know why, but the Royal
Forces have switched plans

110
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,583
from killing the Scrapped
Princess to capturing her.

111
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,041
Anyway, the church official

112
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,583
shooed me out the
door and told me

113
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,291
I had to go out and find the
Scrapped Princess right away.

114
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,083
I know that you've
been able to figure out

115
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,500
who Pacifica really is,
Mr. Berkens.

116
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,500
No, it's not
like that, trust me.

117
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,125
I have absolutely
no intention of

118
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,208
trying to haul in
the little lady.

119
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,750
I just got fed up with
eatin' country cookin'.

120
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,875
[chuckles]

121
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,541
So, you here all
by your lonesome?

122
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,875
Yes... I've been looking for
the others for quite a while.

123
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,875
[BERKENS]
Your brother, too?

124
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,125
[RAQUEL]
Yes.

125
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,750
I'm sure that they're
still alive somewhere,

126
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,041
but there's so many people here

127
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,250
and I don't even know
where to begin looking.

128
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,333
It's enough to
make my head spin.

129
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,458
[BERKENS]
Wow.

130
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,500
Sounds like you're
in a bit of a bind.

131
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,458
But now that I've run
into you, Mr. Berkens,

132
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,083
I feel a little better somehow.

133
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,333
[BERKENS]
Huh?

134
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,625
[RAQUEL] It's like my
father is at my side.

135
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,958
Ah... Right.

136
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,833
Well, I'll tag along.
I got nothing else to do.

137
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,375
But if we're not
able to find her

138
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,791
before the Church or
the Royal Forces do...

139
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,791
Relax.

140
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,625
These things work
themselves out.

141
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,083
You really are
just like my father!

142
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,125
[PACIFICA] Wow, an egg sandwich!
It looks delicious!

143
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,375
You get so worked
up over nothing.

144
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,458
Well, all we've been eating
for the last few days

145
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,708
is bread and cheese.

146
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,041
Well, I'm sorry I don't
bring in enough money.

147
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,916
So where'd you get these?

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,458
[FURET]
They had some extras at work.

149
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,375
[PACIFICA] You want some tea?
I'll put some on!

150
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,250
Just don't burn yourself again.

151
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,791
[PACIFICA]
Don't worry, don't worry.

152
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,708
[PACIFICA yelps]

153
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,041
[FURET]
What did I just say?!

154
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,583
Hey...

155
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,750
[FURET]
Hm?

156
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,916
Pamela isn't the name
of the first girl

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,583
you fell in love with, is it?

158
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,333
Nah. It was the name of
a cat that I once had.

159
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,250
[PACIFICA]
A cat?!

160
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,875
Oh well...

161
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,166
So you wanna get going soon?

162
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,208
Sure.

163
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:20,583
[footsteps]

164
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,666
[PRIESTESS] Your troubles
seem to be very deep, my son.

165
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,291
If you'd like, I could
hear your confession.

166
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,708
Although I must admit
that I'm still in training.

167
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,291
Thanks for the offer.

168
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,291
But I'm not one of the Church
of Mauser's faithful members.

169
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,750
[PRIESTESS]
That doesn't really matter.

170
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,708
[SHANNON]
Hm?

171
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,208
You're clearly upset.

172
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,000
How could I call myself a
priestess if I ignore you?

173
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,708
No matter what your faith is.

174
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,000
[SHANNON] Huh. Well then,
my problem is that

175
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,750
both my sisters
have gone missing.

176
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,583
[PRIESTESS] Oh my! You must
be worried sick about them.

177
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,000
[SHANNON] I've scoured
the city looking for them.

178
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,041
I know they never
would have come here,

179
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,208
but I figured it
couldn't hurt to try.

180
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,500
[PRIESTESS]
I'll pray for you.

181
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,666
I'll pray that you
find them soon.

182
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,083
[SHANNON] I'll have to make
do with the sentiment.

183
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,208
My little sister and I
aren't really in a position

184
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,541
to count on God's good graces.

185
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,250
[CZ] How long are you
going to stay here?

186
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,541
Don't tell me you've
decided to convert?

187
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,125
Is this your younger sister?

188
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,666
[SHANNON]
No, she isn't.

189
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,708
She's a stranger who might've
been my kid sister... once.

190
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,041
[PRIESTESS]
Huh?

191
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,583
The Church might even
have a chance of changing

192
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,958
if it gets more
clerics like you.

193
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,500
Later.

194
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,375
Hey, don't stay in
there too long, okay?

195
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,500
[FURET] You're supposed to
relax when you're in the bath.

196
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,208
[PACIFICA] But you always
keep me waiting for you.

197
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,125
Go home without me then.

198
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,500
[PACIFICA]
Hm... That's what I'll do then.

199
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,916
[sighs]

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,125
Now this is heaven.

201
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,791
Furet!

202
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,125
I'm gonna get out now!

203
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,541
Hey, keep your
voice down in here!

204
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,208
[PACIFICA]
You took forever!

205
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,375
My hair is all cold now and
I just finished washing it!

206
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,041
[FURET]
Huh. Sorry.

207
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:03,958
[FURET]
Hm?

208
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:04,875
[PACIFICA]
Hm?

209
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,291
[FURET]
Oops.

210
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,833
Oh well. I'll drop it off
next time we go there. Hm?

211
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,833
Hey, don't try to foist
that thing off on me.

212
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,583
[gasps]

213
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,875
[FURET]
What's wrong, Pamela?

214
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,750
Sometimes, I'll have dreams
where someone's chasing me

215
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,125
and they're trying to kill me.

216
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,500
Nightmares, huh?

217
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,125
Everybody gets them.

218
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,583
You think so?

219
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,083
You mean that she's been
stripped of her command?

220
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,916
It seems the Baroness opposed
the General's plans... and lost.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,291
Luke is going to be in charge
of our unit from now on.

222
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,166
[LEO] I wonder what's
going on with this guy.

223
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,958
Every time we come
to the Bairach manor,

224
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,291
they say he isn't home.

225
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,291
Maybe it's that I
jumped to conclusions.

226
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,250
Chris sent me a letter once.

227
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,250
He wrote to tell me that the
moon was beautiful that night

228
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,916
in the valley of glass.

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,250
It made me think that maybe

230
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,291
Chris was looking up at
the moon, feeling lonely.

231
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,333
I'm sure he has a good reason
for the way he's acting.

232
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,750
You know, like the other day

233
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,333
when there was that
big ruckus, remember?

234
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,333
Things might be sorta rough for
this Chris person these days.

235
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,833
After all, there might
be a war soon.

236
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,375
Plus, rumors are
beginning to spread

237
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,541
that the Scrapped Princess
is in the Capital somewhere.

238
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,000
[PACIFICA]
Come on, let's buy this, too!

239
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,625
--[WINIA] Huh?
--[FURET] We don't need it.

240
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,708
[PACIFICA]
Aw... But we never have dessert!

241
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,208
[FURET]
I said we don't need it!

242
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,000
Jerk.

243
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,083
[LEO gasps]

244
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,791
Pacifica...

245
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,500
Want me to buy it?

246
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,416
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

247
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,625
You want it, right?

248
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,875
[PACIFICA]
Really?

249
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,625
[FURET]
I got a little money yesterday.

250
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,416
[PACIFICA]
Gosh! I don't know!

251
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,625
[gasps]

252
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,458
Well?

253
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,083
[FURET]
You don't look unattractive...

254
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,250
What's that mean?

255
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,750
[FURET] Aren't you gonna
be late for work?

256
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,291
[PACIFICA] Oh no!
I almost forgot about that!

257
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,291
[inaudible]

258
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,625
What's wrong?

259
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,083
What's on your mind?

260
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,791
It's nothing really.

261
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,291
[PACIFICA] If you wanna gaze
at my beauty, go right ahead.

262
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,583
I'm impressed that you've become
so self-deprecating recently.

263
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,208
Yeah, right.
Like you're not the one

264
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,000
who's always acting like
some old man all the time.

265
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,666
I'll see you later.
Take this, okay?

266
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,041
[FURET]
As you wish, Your Highness.

267
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,208
See ya!

268
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,333
[KEYDARF] Step right up.
There's laughter, there's tears,

269
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,708
and there's romance inside.

270
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,916
See the play and
pay as you leave.

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,833
[PACIFICA]
Keydarf!

272
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,500
Oh my, you almost look like

273
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,625
a respectable young
lady in that outfit.

274
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,250
[giggles]

275
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,666
You mean, I'm not always
a respectable young lady?

276
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,958
Come on, the play's about
to start. Go on and get ready.

277
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,208
[PACIFICA]
Okay!

278
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,250
[KEYDARF]
Hmm.

279
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,000
Huh?

280
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,875
Oh, my.

281
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,208
Would you cut it out
and just get lost already?

282
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,666
[CZ] You have no choice
in the matter, Guardian.

283
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,625
As long as the
Providence Breaker's death

284
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:29,541
remains unconfirmed, we will
assume that she is still alive.

285
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,083
Because your sister possesses
the ability to elude

286
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,083
our scans for her life signs,

287
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,750
all I can do is accompany
you and observe.

288
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,083
If my sister can't be
detected by you people,

289
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,541
maybe it's for the best that
I can't find her either.

290
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,708
I should warn you,

291
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,833
Steyr's pronouncement
remains in effect.

292
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,458
Unless you present hard evidence

293
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,750
that the Providence Breaker
is actually in the Capital,

294
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,541
we will kill 1,000 people
for each day that passes.

295
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,375
I'm looking for her
as hard as I can!

296
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,916
I've had just about
enough of your crap!

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,458
If you creatures are weapons,

298
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,416
then I wish you'd
look like weapons.

299
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,625
That goes for Zefiris
and Natalie, too.

300
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,958
You go around in human form and
act like you're real people.

301
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,250
But then you say these vicious,

302
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,500
inhuman things as
if we're nothing.

303
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,333
[CZ] I'll admit that
from your point of view,

304
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,166
we must seem like the enemy.

305
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,291
I'm sure we come off as
merciless, evil beings.

306
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,500
But we have always been
the stewards of this world

307
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,000
as well as the caretakers
of the human race.

308
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,083
You take care of the human race?

309
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,958
Even if it means killing people?

310
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,583
If it is for humanity's
greater good, then yes,

311
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,875
we will kill
without hesitation.

312
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,166
[SHANNON]
She really is dead, isn't she?

313
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,791
My Cz, I mean.

You monster.

00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,875
[LEO]
She's lost her memory?!

316
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,583
Yeah, that girl goes by
the name of Pamela now.

317
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,875
Furet's the one who gave
it to her, apparently.

318
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,708
[LEO] Who's this Furet? Is that
the man who was with her?

319
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,125
[KEYDARF]
He helped her out,

320
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,375
and she's been staying at
his place since they met.

321
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,166
But wait a minute!
What are you saying?!

322
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,416
You mean, Miss Pacifica
and him are-- are-- are--

323
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,125
Roommates?

324
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,666
Shacking up together?!

325
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,791
Well, I happen to bump into her
on the street just like you.

326
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,666
And I quit my old assassin gig,

327
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,958
and I'm workin' as a musician
now here at the theatre.

328

[WINIA]
An assassin?

329
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,541
Ssh!

330
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,958
You see, when we first met,

331
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,250
Mr. Keydarf was sorta
trying to kill Miss Pacifica.

332
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,500
[WINIA]
Wait a minute.

333
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,416
You mean, you know the
truth about Pacifica?

334
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
That she's really--

335
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,375
[LEO gasps]

336
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,041
You know about that, Miss Winia?

337
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,625
I had no idea...

338
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,541
Well, it's a bad idea for her to
be walking around the streets.

339
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,833
But still, I don't have the
heart to tell her that

340
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,583
she's really the Scrapped
Princess everyone's

341
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,166
been looking for.

342
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,208
So, I worked out this special
deal with the playhouse owners

343
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,541
so she could work here.

344
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,375
[LEO] Thank you for
going to all this trouble.

345
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,333
[KEYDARF] Anyway, I'm having
her play the part of the horse.

346
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,791
That way, no one will be able
to tell who she really is.

347
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,750
[LEO]
I understand.

348
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,083
Please, hire me as well.

360
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,333
[KEYDARF] A youngster who
wants to be a comedian.

361
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,125
He begged me to hire him.

362

Oh, and I hired a new
concessions girl as well.

I think it's best to
leave her alone for now,

wouldn't you agree?

What?

00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,916
Who knows, she really might
be better off like this.

Maybe the old her would actually

Are you really 18?

be so mean about it!

00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,250
--[PACIFICA gasps]
--[LEO groans]

473
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,708
We'll drop by from
time to time, okay?

474
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,958
Okay...

475
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,125
[BERKENS] Please make sure you
take good care of my daughter.

476
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,916
[LEO gasps]
What?!

477
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,500
[BERKENS]
Are you sure about this?

478
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,916
[RAQUEL]
Well, it seems like forever

479
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,833
since the last time I saw
her so relaxed like that.

480
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,166
We've been hounded ever since
the day we left our village.

481
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,666
[BERKENS]
Mm...

482
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,333
Besides, if things stay like
this and her birthday comes

483
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,583
without anyone knowing she's
the Scrapped Princess...

484
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,166
[PACIFICA]
Furet, are you asleep?

485
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,125
No.

486
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,250
[PACIFICA] Do you think I should
have gone with those people?

487
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,458
[FURET]
Doesn't matter.

488
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,500
You're still a stray
I found on the street.

489
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,041
[PACIFICA]
You're mean.

490
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,291
Pamela?

491
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,916
[PACIFICA]
It's just so nice.

492
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,708
[FURET]
Hm?

493
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,375
[PACIFICA]
The sound of the river.

494
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,041
Yeah...

495
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,500
[PACIFICA]
It sends me right to sleep.

496
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,083
Good night, Furet.

497
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,541
[FURET]
Good night... Pamela.

498
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,208
[RAQUEL]
The Cassul siblings

499
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,791
have been separated
in the Capital.

500
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,333
Shannon tries desperately
to find his sisters.

501
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,208
Raquel has found
their little sister first,

502
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,041
but Pacifica keeps avoiding her.

503
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,625
Pacifica has gotten the normal
life she's always wanted.

504
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,166
But will she be able to keep it?

505
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,958
Next time on
<i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

506
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,666
"A Chanson for
Fleeting Moments."

507
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,000
See you next time!
