1
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,291
It's cold.

2
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,166
Yeah, yeah...

3
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,916
[PACIFICA]
This is heavy.

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,833
It certainly is.

5
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,458
And I'm tired!

6
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,000
[SHANNON]
Will you quit it already?

7
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,541
[PACIFICA]
Come on, Raquel!

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,750
Can't you use your magic to
call up a house or something?

9
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,750
Maybe one with a fireplace
and a table full of egg dishes?

10
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,958
[RAQUEL]
Hmm...

11
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,416
Magic can't be
used to conjure up

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,750
every little thing that
you might want, you know.

13
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,250
All I can really do is interfere
with natural phenomena

14
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,875
and manipulate the
state of matter.

15
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,916
It can only cause minor changes.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,791
Well, then can't you do
something about how cold it is?

17
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,666
Well, it's not that I don't
think I can do something,

18
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,375
but if I made the
slightest mistake,

19
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,458
I might cause all the blood
in your veins to boil

20
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,333
and then I'd end up cooking
you from the inside out.

21
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,416
That doesn't sound
very appetizing.

22
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, excuse me, Shannon!

23
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:30,791
Take a look.

24
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,833
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,208
[PACIFICA] There's food! Yahoo!
Come on, Raquel! Let's hurry!

26
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,875
Oh, boy...

27
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:52,000
[PACIFICA] I'm so hungry, I'm
so hungry, I'm so hungry...

28
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,125
[SHANNON]
Can it.

29
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,208
It's so crowded.

30
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,416
Ah...

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,458
Let's ask that guy if
we can sit with him.

32
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,000
Forget it. Let's go.

33
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,250
[PACIFICA]
How come?

34
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,041
That guy's with the
Church of Mauser.

35
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,791
[MAUSER FOLLOWER]
Hey, you over there!

36
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,375
There's room here!

37
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,583
[SHANNON]
This is bad...

38
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,583
Oh, I don't know. He
seems all right to me.

39
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,833
Yeah, you're right. Let's go.

40
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,875
Wait!

41
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,375
Thank you for
letting us join you.

42
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,458
Anytime! It's my pleasure.

43
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,916
I've been on the road a lot,
and I'm tired of eatin' alone.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
[PACIFICA] Don't you think
you're overdoing it?

45
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,708
Hey, the church is footin'
the bill, so why not?

46
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,333
You said you've been on
the road. Doing what?

47
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,416
[MAUSER FOLLOWER] Oh, lookin'
around, you might say.

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,375
So you're a Heretic Inquisitor.

49
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,208
What is that?

50
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,541
[MAUSER FOLLOWER]
If I find people who worship

51
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,458
something other than
Lord Mauser, I haul 'em in.

52
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,125
But when you're on a trip, the
real fun is eating and bathing,

53
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:44,833
am I right?

54
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,166
[PACIFICA]
Mm-hm!

55
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,750
[SHANNON] You seem to
be pretty easy going.

56
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,541
It looks to me like you've
got a lot of worries

57
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,125
on your mind, buddy.

58
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,250
You see, agonizing over stuff is
kinda like a hobby for Shannon.

59
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,416
What're you saying?

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,750
Can I take your order?

61
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,000
[PACIFICA]
Rice and noodle omelets

62
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,333
and a chicken and egg rice bowl.

63
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,750
Don't be so greedy.

64
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,416
Go ahead, it's my treat.

65
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
The bill's on me. Just charge
everything to good ol' Berkens.

66
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,083
That's so generous of you!

67
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,750
Thank you very much, Daddy!

68
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,750
[BERKENS]
Eh?

69
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,083
[RAQUEL]
Oh, I'm sorry!

70
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,416
For a moment there,

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,333
you were the spitting
image of our late father.

72
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,416
He does look like Dad,
now that you mention it.

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,750
Are you serious?!

74
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,708
[PACIFICA] We'll take you
up on your offer, Daddy.

75
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,791
Fine, but could you at least
call me something younger

76
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,416
like "big brother?"

77
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,958
Have you two lost your minds?

78
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,916
He's a priest of Mauser.
We're leaving after we eat.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,416
He really does look
like Daddy, though...

80
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,625
That was delicious! I'm stuffed!

81
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,875
Well, I'm glad to
hear that, little lady.

82
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,500
So, tell me again why you're
coming with us exactly?

83
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,916
The hot springs are in the
opposite direction, aren't they?

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,750
[BERKENS] I've got some business
to see to in this direction.

85
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,041
You sure are dedicated,
aren't you, Inquisitor?

86
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,375
No need to be sarcastic, buddy.

87
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,916
Or haven't ya heard?

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,416
Central command
couldn't care less

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,083
about a lowly post
like an Inquisitor.

90
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,541
They don't care?

91
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,375
[BERKENS] There aren't many
people around anymore

92
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,750
who'd try to oppose
the Church of Mauser.

93
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,708
[PACIFICA]
Hmm...

94
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,125
[BERKENS]
Besides, these days,

95
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,291
I need to find something more
important than heretics.

96
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,750
I'm on the lookout for
the Scrapped Princess.

97
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,875
[BERKENS] Only problem is,
all I know about her for sure

98
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,791
is that she's blonde
and has blue eyes.

99
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,791
But there's girls everywhere
that fit that description!

100
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,541
Heck, we got one right here!

101
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,791
[PACIFICA yelps]

102
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,875
[BERKENS] Careful, now.
You okay, little lady?

103
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,958
I'm fine, thanks.

104
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,250
Hop on.

105
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,416
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,458
It's all right. There's
no need to be shy.

107
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,583
Yeah, but...

108
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,083
[BERKENS]
I'm used to roads like this,

109
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,750
but I'm sure it's hard
on the three of you.

110
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,000
C'mon, you just have to
think of me as your dad.

111
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,208
[PACIFICA giggles]

112
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,541
[BERKENS grunts]

113
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,875
He really is like our father.

114
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,083
[BERKENS]
They call this the North Wall.

115
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,708
It's the biggest of the
northern mountain ranges.

116
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,125
Getting past those monsters
will be no small feat.

117
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,666
'Course, the Giat Empire's
on the other side,

118
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,333
so there's no point in
even trying to cross 'em.

119
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,250
[gasps]

120
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,708
No way!

121
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,166
[BERKENS]
Hm.

122
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,541
[yells]

123
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,500
[PACIFICA]
Pops?

124
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:06,708
[BERKENS]
Hey!

125
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,125
[PACIFICA gasps]

126
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,958
[BERKENS] Little lady, try
stretching out 'cher arm!

127
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,750
Like this?

128
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,791
[screams]

129
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,833
I see. Now I get it.

130
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,583
[RAQUEL]
An illusion spell...

131
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,833
I can see fields and
stuff over there.

132
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,916
What is this place?

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,833
[BERKENS] They must've
been trying to hide that.

134
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:37,875
[whistle blowing]

135
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,416
[VILLAGER A] You're our first
visitors in a long time.

136
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,333
I wish I could say
you are welcome,

137
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,500
but unfortunately,
that's not true.

138
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,000
You're from the Church
of Mauser, aren't you?

139
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,625
Are you an Inquisitor?

140
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,458
Can't you tell by the uniform?

141
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,958
Well, who're you people, then?

142
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,708
[BERKENS] They've got
nothin' to do with me.

143
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,833
We just happened to bump
into each other on the road,

144
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,208
that's all.

145
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,541
[VILLAGER A] It doesn't
really matter in the end.

146
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,208
Now that you've found
out about this place,

147
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,666
we can't let you go free.

148
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,208
Got any ideas?

149
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,875
It's not just an
illusion spell,

150
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,250
it looks like
there's also a spell

151
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,625
to keep people from
leaving this place.

152
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,583
[SHANNON] So you can come
in here whenever you want,

153
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,458
but you can never leave.

154
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,791
Well, let's see how
things go for now.

155
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,166
Causing a ruckus here
probably isn't a good idea.

156
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,041
Not with that guy around.

157
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,125
What's wrong, Raquel?

158
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,416
[VILLAGER A]
Keep moving.

159
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,041
Wow...

160
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,083
I'll be a monkey's uncle...

161
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,708
[PACIFICA]
What is that?

162
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,166
[BERKENS] You've heard of the
Dark Lord Browning, right?

163
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,416
In the Church of Mauser,
he's feared as the devil.

164
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,125
That's one of the dragons
that Browning uses.

165
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,125
I had heard reports
of a group of heretics

166
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,541
hidin' out in this area.

167
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,458
Guess they were right.

168
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,083
Take him away.

169
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,083
Easy! See ya!

170
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,583
Leave him alone! What're
you gonna do to Berkens?

171
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,541
[VILLAGER A] What d'you expect?
He's an enemy of our people.

172
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,291
I will leave the rest
of this matter up to

173
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,541
Lady Elfitine and Lord Reynard.

174
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,625
But who are they?

175
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,708
[VILLAGER A]
Here they are now.

176
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:30,458
[VILLAGER chattering]

177
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,083
[ELFITINE] It's good to see you.
Are you feeling better, now?

178
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,291
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,541
I'm sure your little
one will be walking

180
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,333
by the time spring comes.

181
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,000
[GIRL]
Lady Elfitine!

182
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,458
[ELFITINE]
Oh, my! Thank you, Audrey!

183
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,375
That's very generous of you, but
you can go ahead and eat them.

184
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,708
But, my lady...

185
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,000
It's the thought that counts.
That's all I need.

186
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,000
What's wrong? Is there
something the matter?

187
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,375
[VILLAGER A]
Yes, ma'am.

188
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,833
We caught these
three interlopers

189
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,333
at the entrance to the village.

190
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,000
They were in the company
of a Mauser Inquisitor.

191
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,500
[MAN] Are they affiliated with
the Church of Mauser as well?

192
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,041
They claim that they have no
connection to them, but...

193
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,583
It's the truth.

194
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,916
I'd rather not be around someone
from the Church of Mauser.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,333
[MAN]
I see...

196
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:17,708
[PACIFICA gasps]

197
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,708
Please, stop it!

198
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,000
Lord Reynard!

199
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,958
[REYNARD] Please, leave
this to me, Lady Elfitine.

200
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,250
This is the holy symbol
of the Church of Mauser.

201
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,416
Go ahead. You're free to
do with it what you will.

202
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,208
[REYNARD]
As you can see, milady,

203
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,083
it would seem that the
beliefs of these people

204
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,041
are not so very
different from our own.

205
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,083
If that's the case, please
release them from their bonds.

206
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,041
So who are you people?

207
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,833
[REYNARD]
I am Lord Reynard.

208
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,291
This is Lady Elfitine,
our leader.

209
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,291
She is our light
and our inspiration.

210
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,000
Outsiders such as yourselves

211
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,500
might know her better
by a different name.

212
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,500
The woman before you is
the Scrapped Princess.

213
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,750
[ALL gasp]

214
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,375
Greetings to you all.
You are among friends.

215
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,125
Welcome to our village.

216
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,125
[PACIFICA] He said she's
the Scrapped Princess...

217
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,916
[SHANNON]
Who knows? He could be right.

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,750
Maybe she's the real thing.
She's got nobility for starters.

219
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,333
I wouldn't have a problem
with it if she was.

220
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,750
Then we wouldn't
be hunted anymore,

221
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,041
and we could finally
go back home.

222
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,458
[SHANNON]
It's strange...

223
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,041
This is a nest of
anti-Mauser heretics.

224
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,583
[PACIFICA] So you think that
old guy is gonna be okay?

225
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,250
[SHANNON]
He's an Inquisitor, remember.

226
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,458
He can probably take
care of himself.

227
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,583
The important thing now is for
us to find a way outta here.

228
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,583
[RAQUEL] Then we should
take Berkens with us.

229
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,916
What?

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,458
[PACIFICA] Raquel's right.
Let's go look for him.

231
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,708
I can't even tell where he
is by using a locator spell.

232
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,083
There's something strange
about this village.

233
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,708
[PACIFICA]
Do you have a minute?

234
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,125
[AUDREY]
Oh. You're that girl.

235
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,208
Can I help you?

236
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,333
The thing is, I was wondering

237
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,708
if that old guy that was taken
away before is all right?

238
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,208
[AUDREY]
Why're you worried about him?

239
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,583
I thought that you guys hated
the Church of Mauser, too.

240
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,458
I guess it would be
more accurate to say

241
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,458
that the Church hates us...

242
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,375
'Cause it really is the Church
of Mauser that's the devil.

243
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,916
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,958
[RAQUEL] Why don't we
look for him ourselves?

245
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,166
[explosion]

246
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,041
[PACIFICA]
What was that?!

247
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,750
That came from the lumberyard!

248
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,750
[VILLAGERS yelling]

249
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,291
[VILLAGER E]
They broke free!

250
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,750
[VILLAGER F]
It's gonna fall!

251
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,750
People who rule the
land below, awaken!

252
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,708
[VILLAGER G]
Amazing...

253
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,583
[VILLAGER H]
What is that?

254
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,625
[VILLAGER I]
Look at that!

255
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,625
[VILLAGER J]
Where'd it come from?

256
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,458
[VILLAGER L]
It's magic!

257
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,583
[VILLAGER M]
It's amazing!

258
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,208
[VILLAGER O]
He's disappeared!

259
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,541
Well, I hope that
everyone is all right.

260
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,708
Amazing!

261
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,291
There are other
people in the village

262
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,166
who know how to
use magic, right?

263
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,416
Yes, of course! But
only Lord Reynard can.

264
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,875
Really? Only him?

265
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,833
[AUDREY]
Yes.

266
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,166
That's strange.

267
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,791
So when did you come
to this village?

268
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,791
I came here right after
my mother and father died.

269
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,500
It's the same for everybody.
All of us lost our families.

270
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,833
Before we came here,

271
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,291
things were really bad and
our lives were terrible.

272
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,708
But that's because we
believed in an evil god.

273
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,666
Now we know that Lord Browning
is the only true god.

274
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,708
And I'm sure that Lady Elfitine
is the woman who told you that.

275
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,291
[AUDREY]
Mm-hm.

276
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes, it was Lady Elfitine
and Lord Reynard.

277
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,291
They took every one of us in

278
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,125
and extended the hand
of salvation to us.

279
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,041
The lord and the lady
have guided us.

280
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,750
Lady Elfitine is amazing!
She can see into the future!

281
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,791
The future?

282
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,958
There've been lots of times

283
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,125
when she has seen
our village's future,

284
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,833
and many people have been saved
from injuries or sickness

285
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,291
thanks to Lady
Elfitine's vision.

286
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,333
Excuse me, but Lord Reynard
would like to see you.

287
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,000
Man, what a pain in the butt.

288
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,875
God will punish you if
you say things like that.

289
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,125
[PACIFICA chuckles]

290
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,375
[REYNARD] Only one step remains
before we can finally give birth

291
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:55,166
to the new future
that we long for.

292
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,041
All you need to do now
is have faith in me.

293
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,541
[ELFITINE]
Of course. I have faith.

294
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,916
I believe in you, Lord Reynard.

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
[REYNARD]
Then what are you so afraid of?

296
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,291
[ELFITINE]
I'm not afraid.

297
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,250
I know that our world
full of light and hope

298
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,875
is almost at hand.

299
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,250
I have no doubt
that it's coming...

300
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,708
[STURM]
Well?

301
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,666
Have you learned anything
about the Scrapped Princess

302
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,666
after all that?

303
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,250
[CHRIS]
Unfortunately, no.

304
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,041
Ever since I failed
in my original mission

305
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,875
to assassinate her, I've been
removed from regular duties.

306
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,666
They keep me pretty busy.

307
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,958
I end up running little errands

308
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,916
between the Capital and
the Holy City every day.

309
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
[STURM] I don't think the
Baroness is the sort of person

310
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,750
who would toy with you
or try to waste your time.

311
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,916
Especially since you're
her most talented agent.

312
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,750
And certainly not now.

313
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,208
After all, the fateful day,

314
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,375
the 16th birthday of
the Scrapped Princess,

315
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,250
is rapidly approaching.

316
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,333
[CHRIS] So does that mean the
operation's concerning her

317
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,750
are still underway?

318
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,166
[STURM] Opinions on the
matter are currently split.

319
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,583
There are those who
think we should obey

320
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,708
the Church of Mauser and
terminate her immediately,

321
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,875
and there are others who
believe we should capture her

322
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,583
and see what happens.

323
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,791
Of course, if the Revelation
of Saint Grendel turns out

324
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,416
to be true, this world will
be completely destroyed

325
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,583
in a matter of months.

326
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,750
But if the oracle is mistaken
and the prophecy is wrong,

327
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,625
then we'll all have the blood of
an innocent girl on our hands.

328
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,166
[STURM] Either way, my duty is
that of a soldier, nothing more.

329
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,916
In the end, my only obligation

330
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,666
is to follow General
Peters-Stahl's orders.

331
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,375
[knocking]

332
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,291
Please excuse me, sir.

333
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,708
[STURM]
I'm in a meeting.

334
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,083
I'm sorry, sir,

335
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,333
but your wife insisted
that I deliver this to you.

336
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,666
It's a change of clothes
and a bowl of hot soup.

337
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,166
I didn't say the two of
us were done talking.

338
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,875
But, Major, you don't want
your soup to get cold.

339
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,541
[CHRIS] Do I have something
on my face, sir?

340
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,583
[STURM]
No.

341
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,250
[PACIFICA]
Wow...

342
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,125
[SHANNON]
What the heck is that?

343
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,416
[PACIFICA]
It's so amazing!

344
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,625
[RAQUEL] Those cuts in the
walls seem awfully regular

345
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,958
to be natural rock formations.

346
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,916
[PACIFICA]
Wow...

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,041
[VILLAGER A]
Hey!

348
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,500
[SHANNON]
Yeah, yeah...

349
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,541
[SHANNON]
Hm.

350
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,708
[REYNARD]
Welcome.

351
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,916
[REYNARD] I'm told that
you saved the lives

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
of some of the villagers.

353
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,416
I didn't know that
you could use magic.

354
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,291
[RAQUEL chuckles]

355
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,625
[RAQUEL]
Only a little.

356
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,333
[REYNARD]
Magnificent!

357
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,791
Magic is a force that occurs
all over this world.

358
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,416
But do you know what the true
nature of magic really is?

359
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,708
Magic is a curse.

360
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,791
It is a curse that was
placed upon this world

361
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,625
with Dark Lord Browning's
dying breath.

362
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,833
After Mauser the Creator,
defeated him in battle,

363
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,041
it is believed that his curse
is the true source of magic.

364
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,125
[REYNARD]
Exactly.

365
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,666
With his passing,

366
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,708
Lord Browning triggered large
fluctuations in this world.

367
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,458
Because of that, we are
able to use magic.

368
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,166
That was Lord Browning's
doing, huh?

369
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,500
[REYNARD] The masses call
Lord Browning the devil,

370
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,791
and know him as the
opponent of god.

371
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,875
But the following passage was
recorded in ancient scriptures

372
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,666
that were burned by the Church
of Mauser for being heretical.

373
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,250
It reads as follows:

374
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,250
"Mauser is the devil who
oppresses humanity,

375
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,041
and Lord Browning
is the one true god.

376
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:48,041
He lead his 26 dragons to
fight against the evil Mauser."

377
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,625
[SHANNON]
Hmph.

378
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,333
So the Dark Lord Browning led 26
dragons to fight against Mauser.

379
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,208
Huh.

380
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,708
[REYNARD]
Yes.

381
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,916
Now we, the faithful, will
become Lord Browning's dragons.

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,500
The three of you have come
at a most eventful time.

383
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,041
For on this very day,

384
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,666
we will finally overthrow
the entire world.

385
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,750
[bell clanging]

386
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,583
[REYNARD] Even now, the
entire village is gathering,

387
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,291
and the Scrapped Princess
will address her people.

388
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,875
And after that, the
world will change.

389
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,708
It will overflow
with hope and light.

390
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,166
Help us in our mission.

391
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,041
Join us now, and together,

392
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,875
we can finally set
the world right again.

393
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,416
Who the heck are you?

394
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,458
[REYNARD]
What?

395
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,375
Why do you need
to wear that mask?

396
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,041
Can you really fix what's
wrong with this world?

397
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,500
We won't stand in your way.

398
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,083
I have absolutely no problem

399
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,041
with you overthrowing
the Church of Mauser.

400
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,458
In fact, I'm all for it.
Go right ahead.

401
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:03,458
[VILLAGER A] Lord Reynard,
everyone has assembled.

402
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,875
[REYNARD]
I see...

403
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,875
Well, then. If you aren't
going to interfere with us,

404
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,291
then you may stay and bear
witness to the instant

405
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,791
this world is corrected.

406
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:19,833
[VILLAGERS chatting]

407
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,166
[PACIFICA]
He's going to correct the world?

408
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,333
What do you suppose a
correct world would be like?

409
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:41,416
[VILLAGERS cheering]

410
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,708
[REYNARD]
The time has come!

411
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,625
For years, we have obeyed
the Scrapped Princess,

412
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,708
endured patiently
in this village,

413
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,125
hidden ourselves from the world,
and gathered our strength!

414
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,458
But the world we long
for is now at hand!

415
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,083
Lady Elfitine!

416
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,583
Tell us now: Will our
future be a bright one?!

417
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,250
[RAQUEL]
A suspicious rite has begun

418
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,750
in the village of people who
hate the Church of Mauser.

419
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,333
Pacifica can't help
but feel worried

420
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:46,458
about her friend Berkens, the
old man who was taken away.

421
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,375
Maybe they're picking on
him because he's affiliated

422
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,875
with the Church of Mauser.

423
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,791
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

424
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,875
"Serenade of the
False Princess."

425
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,041
See you next time!
