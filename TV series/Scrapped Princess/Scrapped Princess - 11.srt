1
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,458
[RAQUEL]
Do you suppose that this tunnel

2
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,875
was really made by humans?

3
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:45,375
[SHANNON] It could've been
made by humans or by demons.

4
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,958
Either way,

5
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,833
this thing is probably a relic
from before the Genesis Wars.

6
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,666
Still, I wonder what they
could've used this tunnel for.

7
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,375
[PACIFICA] C'mon... How
much longer till the exit?

8
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,541
Beats me.

9
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,125
We've been walking
for two whole days now!

10
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,791
[SHANNON] There's nobody
attacking us at the moment,

11
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,125
so what's your hurry?

12
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,166
[PACIFICA] You've got mold
growing in your brains,

13
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,750
so I'm sure you
don't care, Shannon,

14
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,041
but I'm sick of looking at these
same walls over and over again.

15
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,833
[SHANNON] I could bury
you here if you want.

16
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,250
[PACIFICA]
That sounds nice.

17
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,166
[SHANNON]
There's the exit.

18
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,750
Huh?

19
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,625
[PACIFICA gasps]

20
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,750
[PACIFICA]
Yahoo!

21
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,875
[PACIFICA]
Here we go. I'm through.

22
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,916
[PACIFICA]
Wow...

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,583
What the heck is that?!

24
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,458
[SHANNON]
I guess that must be the ocean.

25
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,250
[PACIFICA] Amazing!
I can't see the other side!

26
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,458
Well, yeah, I think that's the
way oceans are supposed to be.

27
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,166
Like this isn't your
first time seeing it.

28
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,416
That's why it's so sad

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,791
when a person's brain
goes all moldy inside.

30
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,291
[RAQUEL] So this is
the Giat Empire, then.

31
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,500
[SHANNON]
Yeah.

32
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,833
At the very least, we
don't have to worry

33
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,458
about being hunted by
Leiwan's Royal Forces.

34
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,625
[PACIFICA]
Look at that!

35
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,958
The shape of that island
thing is so weird!

36
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,000
[giggles]

37
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,041
[PACIFICA]
Ah...

38
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,875
They're here, too...

39
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,333
Don't worry about it.

40
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,125
For now, let's just find a
place to stay tonight, and--

41
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:15,916
[SHANNON gasps]

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,458
Raquel, quick! A barrier!

43
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,458
[WOMAN]
It's useless!

44
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,541
The arrows will reach you
before you could cast the spell!

45
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,625
[WOMAN] Welcome to Giat,
Scrapped Princess!

46
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,208
Who are you?

47
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:35,416
[WOMAN] The third Princess of
the Giat Empire, Senes Lur Giat!

48
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
Like you, I'm one more princess
than this country needs!

49
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,250
Princess Senes...

50
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,875
The Beast Princess.

51
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,375
[PACIFICA]
"Beast Princess"?

52
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,541
The director of the crisis
management organization Scarlet.

53
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,750
She's known as
the Beast Princess.

54
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,291
I must say, I'm honored.

55
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,750
I had no idea they called me
by my nickname in Leinwan.

56
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,291
I guess my reputation
precedes me, then.

57
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,666
What will you do with us?

58
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,375
[SENES]
I'm taking you with me.

59
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,333
Relax, I won't kill you.

60
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,125
Providing that you don't
try to resist, that is.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,208
[PACIFICA]
Huh? Makarov.

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,708
[SENES]
Eirote!

63
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,458
Keep on moving.

64
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,708
[SHANNON]
So tell me, what is this place?

65
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,875
[SENES] This is Scarlet's
primary stronghold.

66
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,250
We call it Skid.

67
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,500
It looks just like
the Bug Fortress.

68
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,666
[SENES]
This is one of the ruins

69
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,166
that were originally
called fortresses.

70
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,958
This one, however, is
completely operational.

71
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,125
[SHANNON] But how do you
know how to use this thing?

72
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,666
And how were you able to figure
out that we were coming?

73
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,458
[SENES]
You'll find out soon enough.

74
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,416
[SENES] It's time for you to
come with me now, Your Highness.

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
We're just going to
have a little chat.

76
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,083
Please show the Guardians
down to the beach area.

77
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,083
You can allow them
to keep their weapons.

78
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,500
There's no point in trying to
disarm a D-Knight, now is there?

79
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,458
It's from Chris...

80
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,375
[LEO]
Miss Winia!

81
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,916
I'm so sorry I'm late!

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,916
I had to stay at my job at the
bakery later than expected!

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,250
Whoa!

84
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,875
Why're you wearing that, Leo?

85
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,500
[LEO] The owner of the
bakery gave it to me

86
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,541
instead of severance pay.

87
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go, then, shall we?

88
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,166
[WINIA]
Right...

89
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,708
Tell me, Leo. You sure
you wanna do this?

90
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,291
[LEO]
Of course, milady!

91
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,541
The long and dangerous journey
to the distant capital of Sauer

92
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,916
is fraught with peril for
a lone, delicate maiden.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,791
Providing a safe escort
is just another part

94
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,625
of my knight's training!

95
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,666
Thanks. I appreciate it.

96
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,833
Now, then! Let's be off!

97
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,458
[BARONESS] This young man's
name is Christopher.

98
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,416
He had been given orders to
terminate the Scrapped Princess,

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,708
but I removed him
from those duties.

100
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,458
For the time being, he's
guarding Prince Forsyth

101
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,875
as well as investigate
that other matter.

102
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,833
It is an honor to meet
you, Your Majesty.

103
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,500
I see. So I am responsible

104
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,333
for replacing this cruel
duty on you as well.

105
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,708
[BARONESS] Please, Your Majesty,
you mustn't blame yourself.

106
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,083
You risked your life in order
to save your daughter.

107
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,625
Because of your determination,

108
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,750
the Scrapped Princess has
grown up safe and healthy.

109
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,541
[ELMYR] But now, imprisoned
here like a criminal,

110
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,958
I am completely helpless

111
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,625
and I can do nothing to
help my fugitive daughter.

112
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,166
Would you please tell me
about her, young man?

113
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,166
Yes, Highness.

114
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,125
When I finally found her,
Princess Pacifica was travelling

115
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,958
under the protection of her
adoptive brother and sister.

116
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,916
She's with her
brother and sister?

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,875
What of her foster parents?
Where are they?

118
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,291
I'm told their mother fell sick
and passed away from her illness

119
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,166
several years ago.

120
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,041
As for their father,

121
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,750
he lost his life in a heroic
battle against assassins

122
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,000
who were attempting
to kill the princess.

123
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,083
[gasps]

124
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,875
[ELMYR]
Oh...

125
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,791
Surely, that child must
be cursing her fate.

126
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,041
She must be utterly miserable.

127
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,916
[CHRIS]
No, Highness.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,625
It was quite the opposite
when I first saw her.

129
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,125
She seemed very cheerful
and openhearted.

130
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,875
I see.

131
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,625
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

132
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,625
[SENES] Before we begin, let
me make this perfectly clear.

133
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,875
I can't stand you,
little miss princess.

134
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,208
[SHANNON] It looks like
this whole promontory

135
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,833
is made up of just one
enormous fortress.

136
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,375
[RAQUEL]
Yes.

137
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,208
First, we need to figure out
where they're holding Pacifica.

138
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,291
I'll start us off by
taking some hostages.

139
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,458
[ZEFIRIS]
Abide, my master.

140
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,250
Do not do anything rash.

141
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,958
Your opponent's motives
are not yet clear.

142
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,000
That's why we need to
do something quickly!

143
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,541
[ZEFIRIS]
She could've killed your sister

144
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,291
when you were first captured.

145
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,875
But that doesn't mean she
won't hurt her now, does it?

146
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,166
Shannon.

147
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,041
[SHANNON] Or maybe you've
come to help us out.

148
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,583
Is that why you're here?

149
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,375
[ZEFIRIS] I am unable to meddle
in squabbles between humans.

150
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,250
[SHANNON] That's just great.
Explain this one to me, then.

151
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,250
Those people called
me a D-Knight.

152
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,500
Other than you, the only
people who knew that word

153
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,333
were those Peacemakers
who attacked us.

154
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,875
[ZEFIRIS] If these people were
in contact with Peacemakers,

155
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,125
I would know.

156
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,625
Still, I am detecting a
number of odd signatures

157
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,583
from this place.

158
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,000
What?

159
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,291
[ZEFIRIS] I intend to look
into the matter right now.

160
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,375
Act with the utmost
caution. I implore you.

161
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,333
Wait a second!

162
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,291
[SOLDIER A]
Hmm?

163
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,625
What is it?

164
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,166
Please stay calm, Shannon.

165
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
If we do anything
rash right now,

166
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,041
we might accidentally put
Pacifica in grave danger.

167
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,625
[SENES]
Hmm.

168
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,333
I'm surprised.

169
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,125
I expected you to break into
tears and beg for your life.

170
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,125
What? You've gotta
be kidding me!

171
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,583
I haven't even done
anything wrong,

172
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,916
so why should I have to
beg you to spare my life?!

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,833
Then answer me this: If you
haven't done anything wrong,

174
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,791
then why are you on the run
from people who want you dead?

175
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,750
What do you mean?
It's just because...

176
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,458
[SENES] Your brother and
sister risked their lives

177
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,250
to try and protect you
from harm, don't they?

178
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,000
Is being protected all you're
good for, Your Highness?

179
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,416
Why don't you even try to fight?

180
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,666
But you're wrong!
I do wanna fight!

181
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,541
It's just that I don't
really know how to,

182
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,416
and I'm not very strong, either.

183
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,125
[SENES] Then tell me, what do
you want to do with this world?

184
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,708
What do you mean?

185
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,083
[SENES] Do you think that this
is the way the world should be?

186
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,208
Well, I dunno...
What's wrong with it?

187
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,666
[SENES]
You're the Scrapped Princess

188
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,666
who's meant to
destroy this world!

189
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,958
If you felt like it, you could
smash this whole planet to bits!

190
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,416
You do know that, don't you?!

191
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
No, I guess I don't.

192
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,750
[SENES] Don't you even have the
slightest idea of what you are?!

193
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,875
You don't even know why
the Grendel Revelations

194
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,333
said you should be put to death!

195
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,083
What's with you?! If I say
I don't know, I don't know!

196
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,625
Why do I have to destroy
this world anyway?

197
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,041
What did you say?

198
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,083
I don't want to.
I like this world.

199
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,583
It's full of people that
I care a lot about.

200
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,875
I'd rather die myself

201
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,166
then destroy this
world and my friends.

202
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,375
I think...

203
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,083
I've had it with you.

204
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,333
I'm upset with myself

205
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,375
for having even the
slightest hopes for you.

206
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,416
[PACIFICA]
What?

207
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,041
You're no princess,
that's for sure.

208
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,666
You're just the spoiled
daughter of a queen.

209
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,708
All you'll ever do
in life is run.

210
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,000
What?!

211
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,458
Why should I have
to put up with that

212
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,166
from a pushy girl like you?!

213
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,916
I don't know if you are
the Beast Princess,

214
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,583
but how 'bout you start
acting like royalty yourself?!

215
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,916
[PACIFICA gasps]

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,708
[SENES]
I should tell you one thing.

217
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,750
One way or another, I'll
make Shannon Cassul mine.

218
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,416
What the heck is that
supposed to mean?

219
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,375
Hey, wait a minute!
Come back here, you jerk!

220
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,375
[GIRL] Why did you say
those things to her?

221
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,208
That girl really pisses me off!

222
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,833
I hate dealing with
spoiled brats like her!

223
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,708
She just takes it for granted
that she'll be protected.

224
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,000
I know you're frustrated,

225
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,916
but each person has their
own way of fighting.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,625
When she said that she
would choose death

227
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,041
over destroying the world,

228
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,833
perhaps that was
her way of fighting?

229
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:38,833
[SENES scoffs]

230
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,583
[SENES]
What a useless way to die.

231
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,791
[GIRL]
But she doesn't know any better.

232
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,250
Surely you've realized that
by now, Princess Senes.

233
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,250
Her abilities are
indispensable to us.

234
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,291
All right, all right, already!

235
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,958
I'll go and meet
with the D-Knight.

236
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,583
I'll let you stay here
and deal with this one.

237
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,666
Yes, ma'am.

238
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,541
[ZEFIRIS] This stronghold...
is a Vanguard.

239
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,375
I'm so sorry to
keep you waiting.

240
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,833
So where is Pacifica?

241
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,083
[SENES]
She's fine.

242
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,583
She's amusing herself by
throwing pillows around.

243
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,750
Pillows?

244
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,125
What're you after?

245
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,625
I want you, Shannon, and
I fully intend to have you.

246
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,416
What?

247
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,833
[RAQUEL]
My! How forward!

248
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,666
[SENES]
Don't get the wrong idea.

249
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,750
Let me spell it out
for you, Cassul.

250
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,916
What I want is to have the power
of a fully-operational Dragoon.

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,708
You've certainly picked up
some strange bits of knowledge.

252
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,166
[SENES]
You might say that.

253
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,208
What do you need this power for?

254
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,416
[SENES]
World domination.

255
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,958
Your face says,
"Cut the crap, kid."

256
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,083
But if you ask me,
you people are the ones

257
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,041
who have no idea of the
extent of your powers.

258
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,750
And what if I refuse you?

259
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,208
[SENES]
Then the Scrapped Princess dies.

260
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,583
That's what I'd like
to say, anyway.

261
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:08,250
But to tell you the truth,
that's not really my style.

262
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,166
I've always wanted to
fight against someone

263
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,541
who was armed with
the same weapons as me.

264
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,666
I'm gonna have to give
you an obedience lesson.

265
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,708
[SHANNON]
Hmph.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,083
Shall we get to it, then?

267
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,000
You're welcome to
join in, you know.

268
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,833
[RAQUEL]
Mm...

269
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,458
I don't think that's
going to be necessary.

270
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,083
You're that confident?

271
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,666
That just means you'll
be worth my time.

272
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,250
[PACIFICA]
Come back here, Beast Princess!

273
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,791
I'm not finished with you!

274
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,875
If you don't come back here,
I'm gonna smash this door down!

275
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:37,916
[PACIFICA yelps]

276
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,333
Here you go.

277
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,625
[PACIFICA]
Thanks. Much obliged.

278
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,125
[GIRL] It's nice to meet
you, Pacifica Cassul.

279
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,500
And you are?

280
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,125
Scarlet's second-in-command.

281
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,541
My full name is Eirote Borchard.

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,250
[ZEFIRIS]
So one of these survived...

283
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,250
And it seems to be in
almost perfect condition.

284
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,250
[ZEFIRIS]
Hm?

285
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:08,041
[DRAGOON]
It's been a long time, Zefiris.

286
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,791
Do you recognize me?

287
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,958
[ZEFIRIS] Serial number 14.
You're Natalie.

288
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,666
[NATALIE] Yes, although I'm
no longer a Dragoon anymore.

289
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,041
I underestimated your
ability. Forgive me.

290
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,291
You'll never be able to beat
me. Even if you go all out.

291
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,750
We'll see about that.

292
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,125
Come forth, my shield!

293
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,166
[SHANNON] So you can use magic,
too. I wasn't expecting that.

294
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,291
Do you feel like
helping out now?

295
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,791
No, that's all right.

296
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,750
You're one irritating family.

297
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,625
Well, if that's the
way you're gonna be,

298
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,083
I'm gonna take my
time and enjoy this.

299
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,750
[EIROTE] You two are a lot
alike, you and Princess Senes.

300
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,958
You're comparing me to
that Beast Princess?

301
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,958
Oh, come on, you must be joking.

302
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,708
I'm nowhere near as
violent a girl as she is.

303
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,500
Although I do have to admit
that I'm not very genteel.

304
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,291
[EIROTE] You were born a
princess, but no one loved you.

305
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,916
In fact, quite the opposite.

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,291
Attempts were made on your
life from time to time.

307
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,833
It was the same
for Princess Senes.

308
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,125
But there is one difference
between you two.

309
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,500
Princess Senes never had
an older brother and sister

310
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,625
who were willing to protect her
while she was trying to survive.

311
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,958
[EIROTE] I'll never forget the
first time I met Her Highness.

312
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,708
I was working outside, and I
found her hiding in the bushes

313
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,750
of the gardens of
the royal palace.

314
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,416
She was bruised and battered.

315
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,416
Her brother had beaten her
hard enough to draw blood.

316
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,916
But why would he do that?

317
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,416
[EIROTE] Her mother, the second
queen, hailed from a people

318
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,291
who were considered by many to
be a brutal tribe of savages.

319
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,083
Princess Senes
surpassed her siblings

320
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,083
in both the literary
and military arts,

321
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,416
so they feared she would
steal the throne from them.

322
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,291
From the instant I saw
her hiding there

323
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,666
and clutching her wounds,

324
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,791
I thought to myself,
"I must protect this person."

325
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,041
[EIROTE]
It's odd, isn't it?

326
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,625
I feel this deep
need to protect her

327
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,833
even though she's far
stronger than I am.

328
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,625
No, that's not strange at all.

329
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,375
When the whole world
has turned against you,

330
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,291
having just a single
person on your side

331
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,000
can give you the
strength to go on.

332
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,041
Pacifica, we are not your enemy.

333
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,833
Actually, we're on
the same side as you.

334
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,083
In fact, the real enemy
that threatens us

335
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,708
isn't Leinwan or even
the Church of Mauser.

336
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,083
It's something else entirely.

337
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,958
What do you mean
our real enemy?

338
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,041
[NATALIE] It was after that
battle 5,000 years ago.

339
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,375
I had lost my master

340
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,458
and I had damage extending
down to my logic base.

341
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,375
I was forced to make a choice:

342
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,000
Do nothing and perish,

343
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,583
or transplant my personality
into the systems

344
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,833
of this Vanguard.

345
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,416
[ZEFIRIS]
That sounds insane.

346
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,833
[NATALIE] I suppose it was. And
it wasn't a complete success.

347
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,250
I've run self-reconstructions
over and over,

348
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,166
and I've slept
most of this time.

349
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,875
[ZEFIRIS] So you've locked
down your functions

350
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,000
in order to avoid detection
by the Peacemakers.

351
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,583
[NATALIE] Yes, that is how I
have survived these 5,000 years.

352
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,500
I was frightened of my
personality being extinguished.

353
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,916
Zefiris, doesn't that
terrify you, too?

354
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,875
From what I can see, you've been
expanding your capabilities

355
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,583
through self-upgrades.

356
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,541
But if you overexert yourself,
you'll trigger a self-destruct.

357
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,583
[ZEFIRIS]
We are weapons, Natalie.

358
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,083
If it will help me to
complete my objective,

359
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,875
then why would I hesitate?

360
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,833
My only concern is how
best to fulfill his wishes,

361
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,083
to carry out Lord
Becknam's orders.

362
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,291
[NATALIE] But now you've
found yourself a new master,

363
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,708
haven't you, Zefiris?

364
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,458
[ZEFIRIS] He is only a
substitute. Nothing more.

365
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,791
I have no intention of
ever forgiving myself

366
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,916
for failing to protect my
original master from harm.

367
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,416
[NATALIE]
That sounds like you.

368
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,541
I've been waiting, Zefiris.

369
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,708
For you... and the
Scrapped Princess...

370
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:19,708
[swords clanging]

371
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,291
You stay out of this!

372
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,166
I'm gonna make him surrender
if it's the last thing I do!

373
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,375
Well, you better hurry
up and do it, then.

374
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,125
[SENES yells]

375
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,666
[SENES]
Flames, burning bright!

376
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,083
[SOLDIERS gasping]

377
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,458
What're you people
trying to do?

378
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,916
Are you really going to try to
conquer the world like you said?

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,291
You mean your precious Dragoon

380
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,625
hasn't told you anything
about what's happening here?

381
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,041
What?

382
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,166
[EIROTE] There are things
that rule over our world.

383
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,750
They're immensely powerful,

384
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,333
and they make sure never
to show themselves to us.

385
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,541
But those creatures truly
control this world,

386
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,083
and they are not human.

387
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,291
[PACIFICA]
These things aren't human?

388
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,041
You know about them, don't you?

389
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,125
Those monsters that are always
after you. The Peacemakers.

390
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,625
[gasps]

391
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,958
[beep]

392
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,333
[ANNOUNCER]
Princess Senes, Lady Borchard.

393
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,166
Please come to the bridge at
once. She has finally awoken.

394
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,625
Damn... I guess
I'd better go, then.

395
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,500
If I let this chance
pass me by,

396
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,041
then there's no telling
when she'll wake up again.

397
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,791
Come on. I'll let you see
your sister if you want.

398
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,833
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

399
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,250
Oh, so you're okay.

400
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,166
[PACIFICA] Don't give me
that crap, you idiot!

401
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,583
You swore that you'd always
protect me no matter what,

402
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,625
so why didn't you
do it, you jerk?!

403
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,875
I guess we didn't really
need to worry about her.

404
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,083
It seems that way.

405
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,041
[EIROTE] This Skid's
official designation

406
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,125
is a Vanguard-Free
Trajectory Fortress.

407
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,666
It's a vehicle dating
from the Genesis Wars.

408
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,625
[PACIFICA]
This thing is a vehicle?

409
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,791
[EIROTE]
Fortunately,

410
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,500
we've learned how
to operate this fortress

411
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,000
from a being that has
been sleeping inside of it.

412
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,708
[SENES] Actually, it's more like
she showed us how to use it.

413
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,375
She was the one who
made first contact.

414
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,708
Who do you mean?

415
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,291
[EIROTE] Even though
she's lost the majority

416
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,791
of her original power,

417
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,250
we still like to call her
"the Beast of the Apocalypse."

418
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,708
[SHANNON]
Zefiris...

419
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,000
[SENES]
Now I get it.

420
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,250
So lemme guess, this
must be your Dragoon?

421
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,625
Well, yeah, but
who's the other one?

422
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,500
[NATALIE] My personal
identification name is Natalie.

423
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,833
And you must be the
famous Providence Breaker

424
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,291
accompanied by her
loyal Guardians.

425
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,833
[RAQUEL] The three
siblings learn the truth

426
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,375
about their world from Natalie,
ruler of the fortress.

427
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,541
It seems that they're being
told crucial information,

428
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,000
but to Pacifica,
it's complete gibberish.

429
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,291
It concerns her directly,
so that can't be a good thing,

430
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,208
can it?

431
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,125
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

432
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,000
"Battle Hymn of
the Two Princesses."

433
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,333
See you next time!
