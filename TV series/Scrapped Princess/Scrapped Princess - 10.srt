1
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,000
[REYNARD]
The time has come!

2
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,750
For years, we have obeyed
the Scrapped Princess,

3
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,750
endured patiently
in this village,

4
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:47,041
hidden ourselves from the world,
and gathered our strength!

5
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,625
But the world we
long for is at hand!

6
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:54,250
[VILLAGERS cheering]

7
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,583
[ELFITINE]
The future...

8
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,125
[ELFITINE] Our future shines
so brightly before us now,

9
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,208
that it is blinding!

10
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:08,250
[VILLAGERS cheering]

11
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,000
[BERKENS] Sounds like
they've started the party.

12
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,583
What's supposed to happen now?

13
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,250
Nothing very peaceful,
you can be sure of that.

14
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,458
I think it's about time we
found a way out of this place.

15
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,458
But they're still holding
Berkens somewhere!

16
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,875
[SHANNON] Who the heck
cares about that guy?

17
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,500
I'm gonna go find
out where he is.

18
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,125
[SHANNON]
Wait.

19
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,791
Pacifica!

20
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,250
The villagers are all here,
so I think she'll be safe.

21
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,625
Don't you agree, Shannon?

22
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,250
I guess, but that
man's our enemy.

23
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,666
[RAQUEL] You aren't feeling
jealous of Pops, now are you?

24
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,208
Oh, yeah right.

25
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,708
[WOMAN]
Lady Elfitine.

26
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,083
It is time for
your purification.

27
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,583
[ELFITINE]
I am coming.

28
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,291
[RAQUEL]
There's not even a guard posted.

29
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,750
[RAQUEL] This magical
wall is fairly powerful.

30
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,250
[SHANNON]
Well, I wasn't really expecting

31
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,166
to be able to just
waltz out of here.

32
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,000
Did that Lord Reynard
guy do all this himself?

33
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,666
I don't think that
his mental capacity

34
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,458
is great enough to do this.

35
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,375
Then are you saying there
must be other wizards here?

36
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,375
That, or maybe...

37
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,833
I sincerely hope that what I'm
thinking is completely wrong.

38
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,791
It might be nice to have a god
to pray to at times like this,

39
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,083
don't you think?

40
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,041
[REYNARD]
What's the matter, little one?

41
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,791
There's nothing to be afraid of.

42
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,208
[AUDREY]
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,291
[REYNARD]
Drink then.

44
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,041
By doing so, you will
help bring about

45
00:03:52,125 --> 00:04:01,833
a proper world ruled
by Lord Browning.

46
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,791
[glass shatters, thud]

47
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:23,708
[REYNARD] That completes the
power necessary for the core.

48
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,958
This will be enough
to activate it.

49
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,541
[RAQUEL] I checked the
flows of magical force,

50
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,375
but there's something strange...

51
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,833
I sensed a place with
multiple signatures,

52
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,500
but all of them were faint,
like candles about to go out.

53
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,625
Most likely, it's beneath that
meeting hall from earlier.

54
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,875
Where's Mr. Berkens? He's gotta
be down here somewhere.

55
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,000
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

56
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,875
[PACIFICA] What the heck
is this big, ugly thing for?

57
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,875
[PACIFICA] Why is there
suddenly steam everywhere?

58
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:09,958
[ELFITINE]
Who's there?!

59
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,208
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

60
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,916
Oh, I'm sorry. Is there
somebody in here?

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,958
Whoa!

62
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,666
[ELFITINE]
You're one of those people

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,375
who came from the outside.

64
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,791
Yeah. My name is Pacifica.

65
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,125
Wait a sec...

66
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,250
Didn't I just see you in
the meeting hall upstairs?

67
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,833
Yes. Once I am finished here,
I will return to the hall.

68
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,500
You'll catch a cold standing
in wet clothes like that.

69
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,833
You're welcome to join me
here until they dry out.

70
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,333
[PACIFICA]
Really? Are you sure?

71
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,083
[ELFITINE] People from the
village come to join me here

72
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,333
from time to time.

73
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,750
We don't tell Lord Reynard
about it, though.

74
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,750
[PACIFICA]
Oh...

75
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,333
[ELFITINE]
To tell you the truth,

76
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,833
I'm in the middle of a ceremony
that's meant to purify my body,

77
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,916
and I'm not supposed to talk
to anyone during the ritual.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,375
But I suppose I've already
spoken, haven't I?

79
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:57,000
All right! I haven't
had a bath in ages!

80
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,458
I'm sorry, could you help
me with these clasps?

81
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,666
They're sorta hard to reach.

82
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,291
[ELFITINE]
Yes, of course.

83
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,416
[PACIFICA] I always get
my sister Raquel to do it.

84
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,541
My brother Shannon does
it sometimes, though.

85
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,458
The three of you
must be very close.

86
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,083
[PACIFICA] Not really.
All we do is fight.

87
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,500
Thanks a lot!

88
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,291
[REYNARD] Today, the world
will finally be corrected!

89
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,541
The dark age of Mauser's
rule will come to an end,

90
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,500
and a new age will begin!

91
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,000
And we, the loyal followers of
Lord Browning, shall flourish!

92
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,083
How pompous and
boring can one guy be?

93
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,166
[REYNARD]
Now, behold!

94
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,208
[BERKENS]
Huh?

95
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:43,291
[REYNARD] Our glorious Lord
Browning has begun to stir!

96
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,916
The time has come!

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,625
The judgment of the true
god is about to rain down

98
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,458
upon the holy city of
Grendel and destroy it!

99
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,541
[sighs]

100
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,375
This is absolute heaven...

101
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,375
I guess it won't hurt anything
if I take a little break.

102
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,375
Life in the outside world
must be very harsh.

103
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,916
All of the people who
come to this village

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,291
seem to have met with very
difficult times out there.

105
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,541
But it's different here.

106
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,166
Here, everyone can
live together in peace.

107
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,541
Why don't you stay
here with us, Pacifica?

108
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,875
Say, I heard that you can see
into the future. Is that true?

109
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,708
[ELFITINE]
What? Yes...

110
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,416
Wow, that's so amazing!

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,666
So, tell me:

112
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,916
Can you see a boyfriend
somewhere in my future?

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,583
I'm sorry. I'm not able to
see everything and anything.

114
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,208
Oh, you can't? That's
kinda disappointing...

115
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,666
This is the first time I've ever
spoken with anyone like this.

116
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,250
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

117
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,250
[ELFITINE] Probably because I'm
the princess of this village.

118
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,250
Oh, yeah. That's right.

119
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,708
There's something different
about you, Pacifica.

120
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,583
Aren't you afraid of me?

121
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,041
[PACIFICA]
No, why?

122
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,000
People from the outside say
that the Scrapped Princess

123
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,750
is the poison that will
destroy the world,

124
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,500
and therefore,
she must be killed.

125
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,708
Between that and being
able to see the future,

126
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,541
it scares some people
away from me.

127
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,958
[PACIFICA] There's no shortage
of abnormal people in my family,

128
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,583
so I guess I can't talk.

129
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,000
In the Church of Mauser,

130
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,000
people with special abilities
like mine are shunned.

131
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,625
We're called the bastard
children of demons.

132
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,541
Having skills you didn't work
for is unnatural in their eyes.

133
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,958
My powers are considered evil.

134
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,750
That's why everyone picked on
me so much when I was younger;

135
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,625
I made them nervous.

136
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,250
It's the same thing with me.

137
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,416
What?

138
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,041
[PACIFICA]
I know where you're coming from.

139
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,333
I'm hated by the
god Mauser, too.

140
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,708
I don't have any special
powers or anything,

141
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,666
but everyone's
still afraid of me.

142
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,291
[SHANNON]
What the heck is this?

143
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a pretty strange room.

144
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,250
[RAQUEL]
I knew it...

145
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,125
[SHANNON]
Hm?

146
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,166
[SHANNON gasps]

147
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,833
[SHANNON]
Hey.

148
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,666
[RAQUEL]
It's no use.

149
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,000
In this state,

150
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,041
he probably doesn't even
know who he is right now.

151
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,708
[SHANNON] So there's a
person in each of these?

152
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,750
[RAQUEL] Someone is
combining the mental capacity

153
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,625
of these people to amplify
the power of their spell.

154
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,791
They've been put into a
coma by some sort of drug.

155
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,791
[BERKENS] So this must be
how that bastard Reynard

156
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,791
was able to cast a
spell powerful enough

157
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,625
to hide an entire village.

158
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,541
When the people in the hall
upstairs started praying,

159
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,166
this pattern appeared in the
chamber above their heads.

160
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,833
That's from a spell circle.

161
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,791
Wait, are you saying
you've studied magic?

162
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,750
Yes, a little.

163
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,416
[BERKENS] I don't know how
they're planning to do it,

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,375
but they're trying to launch an
attack on the city of Grendel.

165
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,958
Is that even possible?

166
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,375
[RAQUEL] Yes, if they're using a
strategic-grade offensive spell.

167
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,916
[BERKENS]
"Strategic-grade spell"?

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,291
I don't like the sound of that.

169
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,791
[RAQUEL]
There are records of such spells

170
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,750
being used twice in the past.

171
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,166
In both cases,

172
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
the fatalities numbered in
the hundreds of thousands.

173
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,208
[BERKENS]
Are you serious? But still,

174
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,291
they couldn't possibly reach
Grendel from here, could they?

175
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,458
[RAQUEL]
If they used a long-range

176
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,333
strategic-grade offensive spell,

177
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,708
and enough powerful wizards
chanted it together,

178
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,625
it would be possible for
them to send this spell

179
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,875
from the edge of Leinwan all
the way to the Giat Empire.

180
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,000
But still, I don't
see how this village

181
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,791
could possibly cast a
spell of such magnitude.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,083
[BERKENS]
What is it?

183
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,166
I'm afraid there might
be more of these.

184
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,166
Well, they aren't quite
dry, but what the heck.

185
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,166
Hey, I was wondering...

186
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,916
Everybody was gathered
in the meeting hall,

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,583
so is something
about to happen?

188
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,625
[gasps]

189
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,166
[PACIFICA]
Uh?

190
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,916
What's the matter?

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
[ELFITINE]
I'm scared...

192
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,375
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

193
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,041
[ELFITINE] I couldn't bring
myself to tell anyone

194
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,583
about this before,

195
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,375
but I had a vision of the
future for this village.

196
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,041
Everything was dark...

197
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,958
It was as if there wasn't
a single soul left alive...

198
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,291
How could that be the
result of all our efforts

199
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,750
to correct the world?

200
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,166
What're you going to do, then?

201
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,958
[ELFITINE] Lord Reynard
says that he's going to use

202
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,958
a powerful spell to destroy
the Holy City of Grendel.

203
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,500
What? Why would he do that?

204
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,125
[ELFITINE]
Because Lord Reynard says

205
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,416
that destroying the city
is a righteous act.

206
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,916
Sorry, but that doesn't
sound right to me.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,750
You don't understand.

208
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,500
If it hadn't been
for Lord Reynard,

209
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,500
I never would've
been able to survive.

210
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:18,541
Lord Reynard is different.
He's not like other people.

211
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,000
My childhood was miserable.
Everyone hated me.

212
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,208
I began to wish I had
never been born.

213
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,458
It was then that Lord Reynard
found me and gave me hope.

214
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,541
He saved my life then,
and I trust him now.

215
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,375
That is why I have
always believed

216
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,708
what Lord Reynard has told me.

217
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,541
I've always believed him.

218
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,041
All this time, I've believed...

219
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,291
You know something?

220
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,583
I was abandoned right
after I was born.

221
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,416
What?

222
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,541
[PACIFICA]
But I was lucky.

223
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,250
Shannon and Raquel's
parents took me in

224
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,458
and raised me as
one of their own.

225
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,791
I'm the person I am now

226
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,416
because Shannon and
Raquel were in that house.

227
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,333
They helped shape my character.

228
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,541
But if someone
else had found me,

229
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,166
I think I would've
had to believe in them

230
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,916
and rely on that
person's opinion of me.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,166
I believe in them.

232
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,250
My brother and sister
are always there for me.

233
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,875
In fact, in this whole world,
my brother and sister

234
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,916
are the only two people
who truly believe in me.

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,458
So you see,

236
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,833
if it turns out that I never
should've been born after all,

237
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:25,416
I want the two of them to
be the ones who kill me.

238
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,166
Are you really the Scrapped
Princess, Elfitine?

239
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,208
[gasps]

240
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,333
[ELFITINE]
I... I'm...

241
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:38,666
It's just... Lord Reynard says
that I am, so I must be.

242
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,666
I'm sorry, but I'm
going to go tell them.

243
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,750
[SHANNON]
Hold it!

244
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,083
Where have you been?

245
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,416
You can't just go running
off at a time like this!

246
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,791
Wait, did you just take a bath?

247
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,083
Yeah, so?

248
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,041
[BERKENS]
Hey, there, little lady.

249
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,750
[PACIFICA]
Are you okay, Pops?

250
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,291
Don't worry, I'm doin' fine.

251
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,916
[PACIFICA]
I just heard something terrible!

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,291
Elfitine and I were talking,

253
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,625
and she told me
that her people--

254
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,583
Destroy the city of Grendel.

255
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,291
[PACIFICA]
How did you know that?

256
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,791
[SHANNON]
There's no time to explain.

257
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,375
We're getting out of here.

258
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,208
[BERKENS] You mean, you're not
gonna try and stop the spell?

259
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,375
Sorry, but that's got
nothing to do with us.

260
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,416
[RAQUEL]
Shannon!

261
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,791
[SHANNON]
Escaping comes first.

262
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,541
Oh, Shannon! Come on!

263
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,958
[BERKENS]
Are you serious?

264
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,750
Fine. I'll go take care
of this by myself.

265
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,250
[SHANNON] You must really
love your job, Inquisitor.

266
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,958
Are you trying to
move up the ranks?

267
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,375
[BERKENS]
It isn't about that.

268
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,583
[SHANNON]
Really?

269
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,791
[BERKENS]
The truth is,

270
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,291
it doesn't have to be
Mauser or Browning

271
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,791
or any god for that matter.

272
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,791
But I think it's only
natural for people to wanna

273
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,625
believe in something in order
to get through their lives.

274
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,791
Otherwise, life can be too
hard a thing to live through.

275
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,583
That said, don't you think
it's crazy to try and crush

276
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,708
an entire group of people
just because they believe

277
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,500
in something different from you?

278
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,666
Funny. That's exactly what
you people have done.

279
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,416
[BERKENS]
That's why I wanna stop them.

280
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,958
Don't ya get it?

281
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,541
I don't want them to make the
same mistakes my church did.

282
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,125
Man, what a royal
pain in the butt.

283
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,375
Just so you know,

284
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,208
there's no way I'm gonna
buy this screwy argument

285
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,916
that you're trying to feed me.

286
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,833
[RAQUEL]
Well, then. Shall we get going?

287
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,250
The flows of magical energy

288
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,625
are all converging
right below this area.

289
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,166
[REYNARD]
Elfitine, it's time to go.

290
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,625
We're leaving this village.

291
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,666
[gasps]

292
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,625
[ELFITINE]
What?

293
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,000
[PACIFICA]
What is this place?

294
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,541
[SHANNON] You mean to say there
are people in all of those?

295
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,291
This is how they're
collecting their power.

296
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,791
Hold on. There's
something wrong.

297
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,291
[SHANNON]
Hm?

298
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,708
The spell... It can't reach
Grendel, not by using this.

299
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,250
[BERKENS]
Hm?

300
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,666
[RAQUEL]
The way this room is set up,

301
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,166
their attack spell could
detonate right here.

302
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,458
If we don't stop the people in
the meeting hall from praying,

303
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,125
it'll be too late!

304
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,500
I don't think we're gonna
be able to do that.

305
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,000
We should go track down
that Reynard guy.

306
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,666
Chances are he's
run away already.

307
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,208
Give me a hand here for a sec.

308
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,791
[SHANNON]
Huh?

309
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,666
I want you to push down on each
of these figures one at a time.

310
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,458
Oh! I'll do it!

311
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,458
It's funny. These places always
seem to have stuff like this.

312
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,125
[ELFITINE] But why are we
leaving the village now,

313
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,541
Lord Reynard?

314
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,125
[REYNARD] I'm merely
following the strategy

315
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,166
I had in mind from
the beginning.

316
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,291
They're all going to die,
just as I planned.

317
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,166
[ELFITINE]
Who is going to die?

318
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,375
[REYNARD] I'm speaking of
those fools in the village.

319
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,500
What?

320
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,958
[REYNARD]
The deaths of the villagers

321
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,375
who worship Lord Browning
is what will fix this world.

322
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,166
They are the ones who are
in need of correction!

323
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,208
You don't need to think
about this anymore, Elfitine.

324
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:23,208
All you need to do is come
with me now to the Holy City.

325
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,333
[BERKENS]
Gotta give ya credit.

326
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,750
You're pretty good
at being two-faced.

327
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,750
[REYNARD]
The Heretic Inquisitor, eh?

328
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,291
Excellent timing.

329
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,041
You can come with us to the
Holy City and make your report.

330
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,291
You can tell them how I sent

331
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,958
a whole village of
heretics straight to hell.

332
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,083
I neglected to
mention this before,

333
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,041
but like you, I am also
a Heretic Inquisitor.

334
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,208
[ELFITINE gasps]

335
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,541
What could you possibly
hope to accomplish

336
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,166
by killing all of those people?

337
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,375
[REYNARD]
There's a foolish question.

338
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,125
Once they learn that I've
destroyed an entire village

339
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,500
of Browning worshippers,

340
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,041
my value in the Holy
City will skyrocket!

341
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,791
I'm going to become
the head of the church!

342
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,250
What is he talking about?

343
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,083
Central command will
never reward you

344
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,250
for the killing of
innocent people.

345
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,583
[REYNARD]
They won't, huh?

346
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,166
How unfortunate.

347
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,208
[REYNARD] Stand back!
I've nothing to say to you!

348
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,500
I can't talk to those

349
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,166
who are unable to understand
my righteous acts!

350
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,458
Hey! Whatever you're thinkin'
of doing, just forget it.

351
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,625
[ELFITINE]
I believe in you.

352
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,666
[REYNARD gasps]

353
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,125
I believe in you, Reynard.

354
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,166
[REYNARD]
Huh?

355
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,291
[REYNARD gasps]

356
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,250
[ELFITINE]
I have faith in you, Reynard.

357
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,041
Let's go back to
the village, now.

358
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,458
[REYNARD]
But you don't need to think!

359
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,916
You just have to come with me!

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,250
I can't do that. My place
is here with the villagers.

361
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,208
Those people believed
in me and followed me,

362
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:44,208
and I will not walk away now and
abandon them when they need me.

363
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,875
So I have made up my mind.

364
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,083
I will go back and
join the villagers.

365
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,250
[REYNARD] But you can't!
Just come with me!

366
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,250
You don't need to
think about anything!

367
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:55,625
[gasps]

368
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,083
[REYNARD gasping]

369
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:01,625
[REYNARD] Don't look! Don't
look! Don't look at me!

370
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,791
[REYNARD screams]

371
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,833
[thud]

372
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,916
[PACIFICA]
Elfitine!

373
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,000
[REYNARD]
Damn it all!

374
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,875
[BERKENS]
That guy's completely nuts.

375
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,416
So tell me something.

376
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,166
Are there anymore idiots like
him in the Church of Mauser?

377
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,958
How the hell would I know?

378
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,166
[ELFITINE] Everyone, please!
You have to stop praying!

379
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,541
Listen to me!

380
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,916
Your prayers will only lead
to your own destruction!

381
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But, Lady Elfitine...

382
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,583
[ELFITINE]
Reynard has abandoned you.

383
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,125
And also,

384
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,625
there is something else that
I must confess to all of you.

385
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:53,500
I am... I am not really
the Scrapped Princess.

386
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,541
I have been deceiving
you all this time.

387
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,208
I'm so sorry...
Please, forgive me.

388
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:05,250
[VILLAGERS gasping, murmuring]

389
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,916
[VILLAGER A] Lady Elfitine.
Please, lift up your head.

390
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,625
[AUDREY]
Lady... Elfitine...

391
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,416
[VILLAGER A] If you go
straight down this tunnel,

392
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
you'll reach the Giat Empire.

393
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,833
[ELFITINE]
Thank you. Take care.

394
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,000
[PACIFICA]
You, too.

395
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,625
What's wrong, Elfitine?

396
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,875
[ELFITINE]
I don't know if I can do it.

397
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,041
Can an inexperienced girl
like me lead a village?

398
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,916
[PACIFICA] But you don't see
that dark future anymore, right?

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,166
Huh?

400
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,458
Besides, you're pretty
regal, Elfitine.

401
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sure you'll be fine.

402
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,041
[giggles]

403
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,750
[RAQUEL]
What about you, Berkens?

404
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,916
[BERKENS]
Hmm?

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,500
I'll hang out here and
see how things go

406
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,291
before I head back to Grendel.

407
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,750
I don't feel like
reporting back to base.

408
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,625
Oh, one more thing.

409
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:26,041
The real Scrapped Princess must
have it pretty rough, too.

410
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,041
There are Inquisitors in
the Giat Empire as well.

411
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,375
Make sure you keep
her safe, you hear?

412
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,500
I was expecting someone
more like a witch, but...

413
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,250
...she's really sweet.

414
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,583
--You can eat this on the way.

415
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,208
--[SHANNON] Thanks.
--You can eat this on the way.

416
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,333
Thank you, Audrey.

417
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,833
[ELFITINE, AUDREY]
Safe trip! Goodbye!

418
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,250
[VILLAGERS shouting]

419
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,291
Goodbye, everybody!

420
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,333
[PACIFICA giggles]

421
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,208
We're close enough
to see it now.

422
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,416
[BARONESS]
There it is.

423
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,291
The castle where Queen Elmyr,

424
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,916
mother of the Scrapped
Princess, lives.

425
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,958
[RAQUEL] At a beach beyond
the underground tunnel,

426
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,416
Pacifica meets a
foreign princess

427
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,125
who commands a
group of soldiers.

428
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,583
Apparently, she's known
as the "Beast Princess."

429
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,000
What sort of princess is
a Beast Princess, I wonder?

430
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,375
Does she attack people
with tooth and claw?

431
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,333
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

432
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,125
"Rhapsody of the
Beast Princess."

433
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,416
See you next time!
