1
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,041
Let's go.
We're getting out of here.

2
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,375
[LEO]
What?

3
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,208
It looks like
they're onto us now.

4
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,333
He probably got a
look at your face, too.

5
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,125
Why did you even open
the door for him?!

6
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,208
[FURET] If I hadn't,
he would've broken it down.

7
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:52,083
He's probably out there calling
for reinforcements as we speak.

8
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,708
Once they show up,
they'll storm the place.

9
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,875
We can't stay here any longer.

10
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,541
You're kidding.

11
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,166
But why?

12
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,083
[FURET]
What are you doing? Hurry up!

13
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,458
[gasps]
Right.

14
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,833
[knocking]

15
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,791
[SOLDIER A]
It's the Royal Forces, open up!

16
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,500
Open the door!

17
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,916
[SOLDIERS]
One... two...

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,416
[grunting]

19
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,208
[WINIA]
What is this place?

20
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,500
[FURET]
Beats me.

21
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,333
Looks like it's been
here a long time, though.

22
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,833
You mean, you knew
about this place before?

23
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:36,875
Yeah.

24
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,750
What's the matter?

25
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,375
This is a theatre.

26
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,000
A place where humans
escape into fantasy.

27
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,416
[SHANNON]
True enough.

28
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,041
The Cz I know
would've enjoyed it.

29
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,541
What, again?

30
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,958
[SHANNON]
Hm?

31
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,583
Somebody was in here yesterday
asking the same thing.

32
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,416
He wanted to know if
there was a blonde girl

33
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,625
with blue eyes around.

34
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,916
What'd she do, break the
law or something?

35
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,250
[SHANNON]
Shut your mouth.

36
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,916
[MAN A]
Huh?

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,041
[BERKENS]
Now don't you worry.

38
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,916
The patrols are still
out lookin' for her.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,458
That means the Royal Forces
haven't caught her yet.

40
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,583
[RAQUEL] But where in
the world did she go?

41
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,375
She'll be okay.

42
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,208
Come on, that boy
she was staying with

43
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,791
looked like he had a good head
on his shoulders, didn't he?

44
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,166
I guess you're right.

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,416
[BERKENS] Anyway, they might
end up coming back here.

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,333
So let's wait for 'em
a little while longer.

47
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,166
[horse neighs]

48
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,458
[gasps]
Parabellum?

49
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,250
Parabellum!

50
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,541
What in the world
are you doing here?

51
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,083
I asked the innkeeper
to take care of you.

52
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,416
[SOLDIER B]
Who the hell are you?

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,666
Huh?

54
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,666
This area's off limits
to the general public.

55
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,125
If you've got no business here,
then clear out.

56
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,875
No, you misunderstand, sir.

57
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,166
This horse is my-- Uh...

58
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,583
[SOLDIER B]
Your what?

59
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:19,291
[LEO] Uh... Well-- Actually...
I-It's nothing. Really.

60
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,958
[LEO laughs nervously]

61
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,416
[SOLDIER B]
Hm?

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,250
What do you mean
you can't find them?!

63
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,958
We've confiscated
every stray horse

64
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,833
in the Capital
to slow them down!

65
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,791
We've also doubled our patrols.

66
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,291
They have to be hiding
in the city somewhere.

67
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,583
Find them. No matter what
it takes! Is that clear?

68
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,750
The future of the
Kingdom depends on it!

69
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,041
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

70
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,958
[LEO]
This complicates things.

71
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,750
I can't believe that Miss Winia
and I are wanted fugitives, too.

72
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,250
Plus, that guy upstairs told
me that someone was just here

73
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,375
asking if anyone had seen

74
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,958
a blonde-haired
girl with blue eyes.

75
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,541
[WINIA] There's a good
chance they'll find us

76
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,375
even if we stay down here.

77
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,958
At any rate, we have to get
out of the Capital quickly.

78
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,333
Look, guys...

79
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,333
There's still one thing that
I just don't understand.

80
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,250
Why do I have to
run away just because

81
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,083
I'm the Scrapped Princess
or whatever?

82
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,416
Uh, what do you mean?

83
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,708
It doesn't make sense.

84
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,583
I'm supposed to be
a Princess, right?

85
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,041
So why would they wanna
try and take me prisoner?

86
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,333
Your mere existence represents a
serious threat to the Kingdom.

87
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,416
[PACIFICA]
But why is that?

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,416
What's so threatening
about me anyway?

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,916
[FURET]
Beats me.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,291
But the Church of Mauser says
that the Scrapped Princess

91
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,708
will bring destruction and
devastation to the world.

92
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,333
[gasps]

93
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,250
If I had stayed in the military,

94
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,833
then I'd probably be
hunting you down, too.

95
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,083
[WINIA]
You used to be a soldier?

96
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:42,791
[PACIFICA screams]

97
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,708
[ALL gasp]

98
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,416
[FURET]
What's wrong with you?

99
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,958
You just took the egg!

100
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,166
[FURET] Yeah, but there are
plenty more eggs left in there.

101
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,250
But that one was cooked
just the way I like it,

102
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,000
and I was about to pull it out!

103
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,208
Give me a break;
just grab another one.

104
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,875
[PACIFICA] You haven't bitten
into it yet, so hand it over.

105
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,041
No way! Forget it!

106
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:58,958
[LEO]
Um, Miss Pacifica?

107
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,875
It's Pamela.

108
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,375
Miss Pamela... If you like,
you can have mine.

109
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,458
[PACIFICA]
You've gotta be kidding.

110
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,791
That one's almost raw.

111
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,000
The outside of the egg
needs to be much browner.

112
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,791
That's why I want
the one that he took!

113
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,000
[FURET]
Give it a rest!

114
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,291
[KEYDARF]
The corn's done, everybody.

115
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,625
[WINIA]
Please forgive us, Keydarf.

116
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,083
Not only are you hiding us,

117
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,458
but we're imposing on
you for dinner, too.

118
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,333
No, please, it's fine.
Don't you worry about it.

119
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,000
If you make too
much noise though,

120
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,416
the owner's gonna get mad at me.

121
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,875
[PACIFICA]
I said, hand it over!

122
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,166
[FURET]
And I said, no way!

123
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,166
[PACIFICA]
Give it!

124
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,875
[WINIA]
Both of you, just shut up!

125
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,666
[JILL]
What's this all about, Chris?

126
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,000
[DENNIS] We know where the
Scrapped Princess is hiding now,

127
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,333
so why aren't we
moving in on the place?

128
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,250
[FAFAL gasps]
Now, now, be patient.

129
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,875
I'm sure that our
little Chris here

130
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,000
has something
special up his sleeve.

131
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,708
So is that true, Chris?

132
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,041
[CHRIS]
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,833
But to tell you the truth,
I don't know what to do.

134
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,500
We're supposed to hand
the Scrapped Princess

135
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,958
over to the Kingdom,

136
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,041
but I'm not sure that's the
right thing to do anymore.

137
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,791
That's all well and good,
but at this rate,

138
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,916
if we don't do something,

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,708
the Obstinate Arrows
will be disbanded.

140
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,958
Then what's gonna happen to us
if we have to break up the team?

141
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,791
[SUTTON sniffles]

142
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,416
Hey... Come on,
Sutton, don't cry.

143
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,375
[SUTTON]
I'm not crying!

144
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,833
[PACIFICA]
The thing is,

145
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,250
if everybody in the
Kingdom is actually

146
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,208
trying to hunt me
down and kill me,

147
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,166
then how far are we
going to have to run

148
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,625
before we can really be safe?

149
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,291
Is there any place
left that's safe?

150
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,750
Well, what if we went
over to the Giat Empire?

151
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,916
Then we wouldn't have to worry

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,250
about the Royal Forces
chasing us, right?

153
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,166
That might've been true earlier.

154
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,583
But not after the
Ginnungagap incident.

155
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,250
Relations with the Giat
Empire are strained now.

156
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,416
Trying to leave the country
would be far too dangerous.

157
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,291
[KEYDARF]
Well in that case...

158
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,333
How about going to
the city of Grendel?

159
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,000
[FURET]
Hm?

160
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,125
The city of Grendel?

161
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,541
You mean the Grendel that's also

162
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,458
the main temple of
the Church of Mauser?!

163
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,541
[KEYDARF] It's still
inside Leinwan territory,

164
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,333
but that's the one
region of the country

165
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,500
that's totally autonomous.

166
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,416
Even the troops of the Royal
Forces are strictly limited

167
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,250
in the type of weapons that they
can carry inside the holy city.

168
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,250
And I bet that you
running away to Grendel

169
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,916
would be the absolute last thing
they would expect you to do.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,666
I've heard that a special
combat unit, the Purgers,

171
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,625
is stationed in the Holy City.

172
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,625
Still, I think it's better
than trying to go up against

173
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,500
the entire Royal Forces,
don't you agree?

174
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:26,500
Guys, I'm sorry.
Really, about everything.

175
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,666
I don't understand everything
that's going on here.

176
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,625
But you're risking
so much for me.

177
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,208
What're you talking about?!

178
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,166
[WINIA] Now that it's
turned out like this,

179
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,791
what else could we
do but help you?

180
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,583
[PACIFICA sighs]
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,750
[LEO] Miss Raquel must be
worried sick about us.

182
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,125
If we all suddenly disappear,

183
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,208
she'd think the
worst had happened.

184
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,083
[KEYDARF] That scary woman's
in the Capital, too?

185
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,291
[LEO]
Yes, she is.

186
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,583
If only I had asked them what
inn they were staying at

187
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,208
when I ran into them
at the food stand.

188
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,708
Can we afford to wait a
little before we leave?

189
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,250
[PACIFICA]
No. Let's go.

190
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,291
If we wait around any longer,
they're going to catch us.

191
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,666
If I run into your sister,
I'll be sure to tell her.

192
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,958
[FURET] Either way,
we're going to need horses.

193
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,791
Walking is out of the question.

194
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,083
[WINIA]
But from what Leo says,

195
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,375
the security out there
is awfully tight.

196
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,833
Every defense has
its vulnerable points.

197
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,666
I agree that we're going to have
to go and steal some horses,

198
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,458
but what if we're spotted
trying to and get caught?

199
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,666
That's true...

200
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,291
Why not wear disguises?

201
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,625
This one is perfect!

202
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,333
Winia, I think
you'd look amazing

203
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,875
in something daring like this.

204
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,291
[WINIA]
I don't know...

205
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,666
What is it?

206
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,875
Excuse me?

207
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,125
You have something
you wanna say?

208
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,541
I need to know something.

209
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,958
Is Miss Pamela
important to you, too?

210
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,250
Are you willing to risk
your life to protect her?

211
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,791
What's gotten into you?

212
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,958
[LEO]
Everybody in the Kingdom

213
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,000
wants the Scrapped
Princess dead, right?

214
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,458
And yet, here you are
putting your life on the line

215
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,000
in order to protect her.

216
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,791
Well yeah, I guess I am.

217
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,083
Maybe it's just
a force of habit.

218
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,500
Huh?

219
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,208
[FURET] When I was a bouncer,
I would let people go

220
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,500
who were on the
run or in trouble.

221
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,666
Is that the only reason?

222
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,833
What's yours?

223
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,583
What's my reason?

224
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,833
[FURET]
Well, it sounds to me

225
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,500
like she's pretty
important to you.

226
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,166
Important enough
that you're willing to

227
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,083
throw away everything
to protect her.

228
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,750
[gasps]

229
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,000
[FURET sighs]

230
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,541
I don't know if you're
an apprentice knight,

231
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,333
but there's no chance you'll
ever become a real knight now.

232
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,291
[LEO]
But why not?

233
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,458
Why do you think?

234
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,416
Properly speaking,
your duty is to cut off

235
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,541
the head of the Scrapped
Princess and bring it in,

236
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,250
isn't it?

237
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,291
[gasps]

238
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,000
You believe a knight's
duty is to kill people?

239
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,875
I don't believe that's
truly a knight's purpose.

240
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,625
I can't believe it.

241
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,791
[FURET]
Hmph.

242
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,500
[PACIFICA]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

243
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,500
So tell me, how do I look?

244
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,583
Huh?

245
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,416
Is something wrong?

246
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,750
Not really.

247
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,708
[PACIFICA]
Well?

248
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,583
[FURET]
Hm? Oh...

249
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,291
You could at least try to
say something nice about it.

250
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,833
[FURET]
Golly, it's so wonderful.

251
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,791
[PACIFICA grunts]
Just forget it!

252
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,666
There's no point in
showing off to you.

253
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,875
What are you doing?

254
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,958
Oh! Well, we're both
looking for disguises.

255
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:22,833
No need for that.

256
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,166
We've picked yours out already.

257
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:24,708
[LEO]
Huh?

258
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,375
Ta-da!

259
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,208
[PACIFICA giggles]

260
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,500
Resistance is useless.

261
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,625
[PACIFICA]
Maybe he needs more make up.

262
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,458
You can forget it!

263
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,791
[KEYDARF sighs]

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,583
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

265
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,000
You're so cute!

266
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,791
It's not just flattery;
that outfit really suits you.

267
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,041
I don't care what you think;
I don't like it!

268
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,833
Hey! Nice young girls
aren't supposed to

269
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,500
speak to people so rudely.

270
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,166
And what would you know about
being a nice young girl?

271
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,416
Oh, just shut up.

272
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,583
When a lady tells you to
do something, you do it!

273
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,041
[FURET]
Which one of us is the lady?

274
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,291
[PACIFICA]
Hush, you!

275
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,416
[SOLDIER C]
Hm?

276
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,958
Hey, wait a minute!

277
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,000
Hey!

278
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,500
This way!

279
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,958
[giggles]

280
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,250
[BOTH laugh]

281
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,625
[LEO] We'll go out and see
if we can steal some horses.

282
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,375
You two be patient
and wait here.

283
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,333
[PACIFICA] You're not gonna
do it in your disguises?

284
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,666
You're no fun!

285
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,583
[FURET] How're we supposed
to move in those things?

286
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,166
You better come back here
without hurting yourself.

287
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,125
Sure. Don't you worry about me.

288
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,916
Who said I was
worried about you?

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,125
If you get hurt out there,

290
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,125
it'll make lots of work
for the rest of us.

291
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,500
Bandaging you and stuff.

292
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,291
Silly me.

293
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,833
Anyway, I don't want to see
so much as a scratch on you,

294
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:58,625
you hear me?

295
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, yeah, Your Highness.

296
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,875
That hurt, you little twerp!

297
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,583
You be careful too, Leo.

298
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,375
Thanks, I'll make sure to.

299
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,875
[PACIFICA]
Hm?

300
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,625
[LEO]
Um, Miss Pamela?

301
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,958
Yeah?

302
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,625
I promise that I'll keep
you safe no matter what.

303
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,625
I realize I may still seem
unreliable to you right now,

304
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,208
but no one wants to
protect you more than I do.

305
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,541
No one.

306
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,625
[LEO]
Well, we're off!

307
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,916
See you both soon.

00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,750
[SOLDIER D groaning]

310
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,458
Wow! Leo sounded like a man.

311
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,583
[laughs]

312
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,875
It's really surprising,

313
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,125
hearing him say all
that stuff outta the blue.

314
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,000
So what do you think then?

315
00:13:59,083 --> 00:13:59,875
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

316
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,458
[WINIA]
About Leo.

317
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,333
I'm flattered he feels that way,

318
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,750
but doesn't he just seem like a
spoiled little rich kid to you?

319
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,625
[WINIA] Oh... Well, he is
a noble, after all.

320
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,958
[PACIFICA]
Really?

321
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,166
Anyway, I think he's nice
and all, but still...

322
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,708
[WINIA] You like Furet
better than him, right?

323
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,375
And what makes you think that?!

324
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,916
[WINIA]
But you do, don't you?

325
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,583
No, I don't...

326
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,041
I think it's just that...

327
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,250
I don't like him or dislike him.

328
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't care which
one of 'em you pick,

329
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,875
but make sure
it's a fast runner.

330
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,708
[LEO] I've already
got mine picked out.

331
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,208

[LEO]
Parabellum!

334
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,458
So is this one your horse?

335
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,791
[FURET] Looks like they're not
gonna let us leave so easily,

336
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,333
after all.

337
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,500
So it would seem.

338
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,250
Let's go.

339
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,291
Right!

340
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,166
Now, look here.

341
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,333
All this is just making
me look stupid, you know?

342
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,208
Come here.

343
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,416
Why should I?

344
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Rain cannot harm the
body of a Peacemaker,

345
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,458
so why does it
matter if I stay dry?

346
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,833
[SHANNON]
Do it anyway.

347
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,291
You're getting wet.

348
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,416
If you continue like this,
your body temperature will drop.

349
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,875
[SHANNON]
Just shut up.

350
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,083
[FURET]
This isn't working.

351
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,000
Take the reins.

352
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,041
Huh?!

353
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,208
They're a lot
faster than we are.

354
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,291
They're gonna catch up.

355
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,791
You go on ahead without me.

356
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:05,875
[LEO gasps]

357
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:06,791
[FURET]
If we let them follow us back,

358
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,041
this will all be for nothing.

359
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,083
Take this! I'll catch
up with you all later.

360
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,958
Make sure you tell Pamela that.

361
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,708
I'm gonna hold them off here.

362
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,750
But I can help you fight!

363
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,833
[FURET]
You idiot!

364
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,166
A knight must
protect his princess.

365
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,958
It's his duty no matter what!

366
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:20,916
Yes, but--

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,041
[FURET]
Go on, then.

368
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,416
Tell me who's going
to protect Pamela.

369
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,541
Say it!

370
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,375
I will.

371
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,333
[FURET]
I can't hear you!

372
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,583
Say it like you mean it!

373
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,625
I will!

374
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,583
Then protect her.

375
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,833
Yes, sir!

to try to defy the Kingdom...

to go somewhere very important.

Go where?

there's obviously no point
in him going there now.
