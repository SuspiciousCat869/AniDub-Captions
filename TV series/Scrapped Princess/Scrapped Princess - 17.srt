1
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,375
There sure seem to be a lot
of soldiers around here.

2
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,666
They're almost done
cleaning up the damage.

3
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,875
Since they're nearly finished

4
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,875
dealing with the fallout
from Ginnungagap,

5
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:57,500
more of them can look for
the Scrapped Princess.

6
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,583
[SHANNON]
Hmph.

7
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,625
Sorry, but we're not open yet.

8
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,125
[SLEY]
I'm looking for someone.

9
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,375
A blonde-haired
girl with blue eyes.

10
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,208
Her name is Pacifica.

11
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,250
She's called Pacifica Cassul.

12
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:27,375
[pencil scratching]

13
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:32,875
Done yet?

14
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:40,958
I'm finished.

15
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,875
[PACIFICA sighs]

16
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,375
So, how do I look?

17
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,125
Lemme see, lemme see!

18
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:52,833
[PACIFICA grunting]

19
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,500
[FURET]
Stop it.

20
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,291
Stop it already!

21
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,166
I said, stop it!

22
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,833
If I can't draw, I can't draw!

23
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,958
[PACIFICA]
Then you should've told me

24
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,541
you couldn't draw
in the first place!

25
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,500
But I told you that already!

26
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,583
Oh, my.

27
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,625
[PACIFICA]
Hm?

28
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,250
Let's go.

29
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,333
[FURET]
Hey...

30
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,083
What's the matter
with the little lady?

31
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,708
Maybe she doesn't like me now.

32
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,708
I bet that she's
trying to avoid me.

33
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,458
Subconsciously, anyway.

34
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,666
You mean, she can't
remember being chased.

35
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,875
And now, she doesn't want
to remember any of that.

36
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,666
Yeah, that's the
feeling I'm getting.

37
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,875
That's complicated.

38
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,875
[RAQUEL]
It sure is.

39
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,166
But still, I believe she's
better off this way.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,041
[knocking]

41
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:52,875
[door creaks]

42
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,875
[BARONESS]
Huh?

43
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,125
Christopher, have you
come to see me off?

44
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,958
Um, Baroness? I wanted to...

45
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,333
Christopher, I have
to be honest.

46
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,291
I like noble sentiments.

47
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,291
I know it may seem rather
silly or naive of me,

48
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,000
but I'm still fond
of them nonetheless.

49
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,041
I'm also quite partial to
people who can speak sincerely

50
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,083
about freedom and equality.

51
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:25,000
Mostly because I haven't
experienced those things.

52
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,625
I didn't want any of this;

53
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,333
I was trying to avoid
needless bloodshed.

54
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,708
But by doing so,

55
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,666
I have made you and the
others shoulder the burden.

56
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,583
[CHRIS]
Baroness...

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,500
I won't make any excuses.

58
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,791
And I would understand
if you hated me now.

59
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,375
But even so, if you should ever
want to keep someone safe,

60
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,000
then you must act as a
shield for that person,

61
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,541
and protect them no matter what.

62
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,791
Christopher, I know
you'll be fine.

63
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,208
Have faith in yourself

64
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:02,250
and keep a firm grip
on your own free will.

65
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,500
[gasps]

66
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,833
[BARONESS] I leave the
rest of this up to you.

67
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,958
[door opens]

68
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,500
What's wrong? Do I have
something on my face?

69
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,125
[CHRIS]
No, sir.

70
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,416
I see.

71
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,250
I have new orders for the team.

72
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,541
The Obstinate Arrows are hereby
ordered to give top priority

73
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,666
to their earlier mission of
capturing the Scrapped Princess.

74
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,125
Renew your search at once

75
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,250
and capture her as
soon as possible.

76
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,625
That's pretty unreasonable.

77
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,208
You want us to drop
everything we're doing

78
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,625
and go looking for some girl.

79
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,458
And we don't even know
if she's still alive.

80
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,833
[LUKE]
Don't worry.

81
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,291
These orders are only valid
for the next three days.

82
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,291
General Peters-Stahl
has a very high opinion

83
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,250
of the Obstinate Arrows unit.

84
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,541
Considering the group's
level of ability,

85
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,916
he's given the mission
a deadline of three days.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,291
Oh? And what's that
supposed to mean?

87
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,708
[LUKE] If you are unable to
capture the Scrapped Princess

88
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,291
in that time, the unit
will be disbanded.

89
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,333
[gasps]

90
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,458
[groans]

91
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,416
I guess searching
the city is useless.

92
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,583
[ZEFIRIS]
My Master.

93
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,625
[SHANNON]
Hm?

94
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,708
[SHANNON]
If you've shown up,

95
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,666
I guess that means she isn't
around here right now.

96
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,625
[ZEFIRIS] I beg of you, please,
at least get some sleep.

97
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,708
[SHANNON]
You're ordering me to sleep?!

98
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,500
You've got some nerve.

99
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,666
If you were suffering
from a physical wound,

100
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,000
I could heal you.

101
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,416
But I can do nothing to
alleviate mental fatigue.

102
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,125
Just do what you can.

103
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,208
[SHANNON]
Huh?

104
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,583
So how long are you
planning on following me?

105
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,250
[CZ] I told you that I would
stay and observe, didn't I?

106
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,541
You seem irritated.

107
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,708
[SHANNON]
Well, it's only natural

108
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,041
when you've got a
monster at your side.

109
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,958
How much of the truth has
Zefiris actually told you?

110
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,333
[SHANNON]
The truth?

111
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,541
You mean how you things
betrayed humanity?

112
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,458
Became the invaders' pawns?

113
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,458
And finally, took a
position as our guards

114
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,833
to make sure we'd stay
locked up in our prison?

115
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,333
Huh. That's one
way to look at it.

116
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,875
Then let me ask you this:

117
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,750
What terrible wrong have those
invaders done to you humans?

118
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,416
Have they pillaged you?
Wiped you out?

119
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,875
No. They haven't done either
of those things to you.

120
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,916
If that's the case,
they why do you think

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,916
they took the step of
sealing away humanity?

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,458
Be honest.

123
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,375
Have you people ever felt like
you were locked up somehow?

124
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,041
You haven't, have you?

125
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,083
If you aren't aware
that you're imprisoned,

126
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,000
it's no different
from being free.

127
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,125
You and your kind have brutally
killed thousands of people.

128
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,833
Because of one simple reason.

129
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,250
Your sister, the
Providence Breaker, exists.

130
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,458
[CZ] The system that locks
you away in this world exists

131
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,458
to protect humanity
from extinction.

132
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,250
The human life form is
an irregular species.

133
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,791
It has many inconsistencies
in its behavioral norms.

134
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,750
If humanity were to make contact

135
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,666
with another
intelligent species,

136
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,500
there is a risk that
these instabilities

137
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,791
would damage both parties.

138
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,208
Humanity must be protected
from its own ferocity.

139
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,416
You are kept in this world

140
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,375
to prevent your
own self-destruction.

141
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,083
We also lowered your
level of civilization

142
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,583
in order to avoid any
stress you might experience

143
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,375
from realizing the
size of your world.

144
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,291
Doesn't having a
stable environment

145
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,041
make for excellent
living conditions?

146
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,833
I suppose.

147
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,083
My kind cannot overlook the
existence of your little sister,

148
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,708
a creature who might
cause this world to crash.

149
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,291
We have been given
the solemn duty

150
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,833
of protecting humanity as
it exists in this world.

151
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,416
We are plotting to kill
the Providence Breaker.

152
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,541
But not because of
any malice towards her.

153
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,375
She is a curse left
behind by Browning,

154
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,416
a weapon meant to counteract
our ability to govern.

155
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,625
We are completely incompatible.

156
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,083
But I was not the one who
wished for it to be that way

157
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,083
and neither did your sister.

158
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,916
Shannon Cassul...

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,416
Clearly you'd like to consider
my kind as being simply evil.

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,625
But you have to ask
yourself this question:

161
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,458
Who was it that set
all of this in motion?

162
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,291
If you must hate, then hate your
ancestors for starting this.

163
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,833
Awfully chatty today, aren't we?

164
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,375
I guess I am.

165
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,958
I know you think we're evil,

166
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,625
but it still hurts
us to be criticized.

167
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,791
Especially when we believe
that we've done nothing wrong.

168
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,541
So, any questions?

169
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,041
After verifying your
individual search areas,

170
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,666
commence your
assignment immediately.

171
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,500
You're all dismissed.

172
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,625
[ARTIST]
All done!

173
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,833
[sighs]

174
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,250
Well, that's a pro for you.
You're so fast!

175
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,208
How do I look? Let me see.

176
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,750
[FURET]
Hey.

177
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,291
Wait a second!

178
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,666
[FURET]
See you later. Break a leg.

179
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,458
Have fun playing a horse's ass.

180
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,750
Oh shut up, you big jerk!

181
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,125
Quit you babbling and
go get lost already.

182
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,500
[FURET]
As you wish.

183
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,541
You can head to work now
without a care in the world.

184
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,541
Rest assured, I'll look after
things while you're away.

185
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,208
In fact, you really
don't have to bother

186
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,208
coming back here at all.

187
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,208
Hm?

188
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,125
What's so funny all of a sudden?

189
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,416
Aw, nothin'.

190
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,041
I suppose I'll avail
myself of your kind offer.

191
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,041
[LEO] That's right, you can
leave everything to me now,

192
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,541
Sir Leo!

193
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,416
I promise to guard Miss Pacifica
with my life if neccess--

194
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,833
[PACIFICA]
Wait a minute, Mr. Skorpus!

195
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,458
Oh, come on, haven't I
said to just call me Leo?

196
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,291
Then you should call
me by my right name.

197
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,583
It's Pamela, remember?

198
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,500
Of course I do,
Miss Pacifi-- I mean, Pamela.

199
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,041
[PACIFICA] That's better.
Just so we're clear on that.

200
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,166
Look after her.

201
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,333
[WINIA]
Sure.

202
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,833
Ah, to be young again.

203
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,125
[FORSYTH] An all-out search
for the Scrapped Princess?

204
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,000
So you're saying that she's
here in Sauer somewhere?

205
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,458
[CHRIS] No, sire. Just that
there is a strong possibility.

206
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,791
However, it seems that
the military's top brass

207
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,333
have been leaning
toward going to war

208
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,625
ever since Ginnungagap was used.

209
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,208
I've heard that they
want to capture her

210
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,375
in order to use
her as a trump card.

211
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,041
I just feel so pathetic.

212
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,750
If only I had the
power to do something.

213
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,041
Please, sire, there's no
need to blame yourself.

214
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,250
It's not a foregone conclusion
that we're going to war.

215
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,000
[EIROTE]
It's proceeding smoothly.

216
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,583
Barring any problems,

217
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,458
we should be able to begin the
fine tuning work in a few days.

218
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,916
[SENES] But it's the fine tuning
that'll be the problem, right?

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,416
We can't even test run them.

220
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,666
If these don't work,

221
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,541
they're gonna be nothing
more than steel coffins.

222
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,416
If we activate their systems
before they're fully outfitted,

223
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,833
they'll be sitting ducks
for the Peacemakers.

224
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,625
We have to accept that risk.

225
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,666
[SENES]
I know, I know.

226
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,708
That's precisely
why I'm grumbling.

227
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,375
I understand your
desire to hurry,

228
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,541
but we barely survived
that last attack.

229
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,583
Let's make sure
everything is done right.

230
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,250
All right, I hear
what you're saying.

231
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,000
We wouldn't be standing
here alive in Giat

232
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,333
and talking right now

233
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,541
if Natalie hadn't shown us
all the way to get back.

234
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,708
Word has it those
three are still alive.

235
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,208
Plus, it's time for us
to go get some revenge

236
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,583
for the sinking of the Skid.

237
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,083
Right. Let's see if we can

238
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,708
get these all combat-ready
as soon as possible.

239
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,750
[SENES] We have no place to
call home... not anymore.

240
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,541
I won't be able
to die peacefully

241
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,833
until we defeat
those Peacemakers.

242
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,083
Welcome back, Leo.

243
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,958
[LEO]
Yeah, it's nice to be back.

244
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,291
[WINIA]
Is something wrong?

245
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,458
Not really.

246
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,208
I guess it might just
be my imagination,

247
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,416
but it seemed to me like
there were even more soldiers

248
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,333
out in the streets than normal.

249
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,416
Wait a minute...

250
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,041
What are you saying?

251
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,500
I hope that I'm reading
too much into it.

252
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,500
But it's possible
that they're out there

253
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,750
searching for Miss Pacifica.

254
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,500
[LEO gasps]

255
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,041
[WINIA]
Hm?

256
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,416
H-Hello. Can I help
you with something?

257
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,875
[SOLDIER A] We've heard
that there's a girl with

258
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,666
blonde hair and blue eyes who
works at this playhouse.

259
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,291
Uh... There is, there is!

260
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,250
But I'd say that she's more
of an old lady than a girl.

261
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,291
Wouldn't you agree?

262
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,833
[LEO]
Oh, yes.

263
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,458
It would be a bit of a stretch
to call her a girl, really.

264
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,041
Oh, that nice lady next door
offered to share this with me.

265
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,958
She said she made too much.

266
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,083
[FURET]
Hm.

267
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,291
She must have it rough,

268
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,000
what with that deadbeat
husband of hers

269
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,291
drinking like that every day.

270
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,666
[FURET]
Pass me that.

271
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,000
[PACIFICA] She says that her
son used to be an inquisitor

272
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,500
for the Church of Mauser.

273
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,583
He swore he'd become
head of the Church,

274
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,583
but then he disappeared
into the mountains.

275
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,916
[FURET]
Hm...

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,958
So how is it?

277
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:42,958
[FURET]
Huh?

[PACIFICA]
Is it good or is it bad?

What do you think of it?

280
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,625
S'okay.

281
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,875
You know, I think we've got a
fly buzzing around in here.

00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,375
So would you like some tea?

283
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,583
[FURET]
What's with these?

284
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,041
They were really cheap.

285
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,791
That's not why I was asking you.

286
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,125

The Scrapped Princess?

[WINIA] Put simply, the world
regards her as a threat

in order to kill her.

She's the one who's supposed to
destroy the world, is that it?

Yes, that's right.

We had hoped that Pacifi--

317
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,875
Pamela's memories
would come rushing back

318
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,875
if she heard the word
"Scrapped Princess."

319
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,333
It doesn't look like it worked.

320
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,958
Wait a minute, are you
saying I did something bad?

321
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,916
[FURET] I can't just
take your word for this.

322
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,041
Even so, it's still the truth.

323
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,333
[LEO]
I had hoped that I wouldn't

324
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,875
have to bring all of this up,

325
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,041
but it looks like I'm going
to have to tell you after all.

326
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,291
Have to tell me what?

327
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,875
Some soldiers came by
the playhouse earlier

328
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,416
asking questions.

329
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,708
[FURET]
Questions?

330
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,875
Yes, I believe that
we're running out of time.

331
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,083
And that's why we've come here.

332
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,333
So we can take Miss
Pamela away with us.

333
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,000
Wait a sec! Don't I have a say

334
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,416
or are you gonna keep talking
about me like I'm not here?!

335
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
Look, I'm sorry,

336
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,750
but we don't have the time to
sit here and argue about this!

337
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,083
Those soldiers from earlier
might be on their way here

338
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,375
at this very moment.

339
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,958
What? Gimme a break.

340
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,166
You show up outta the
blue and just expect me to--

341
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,000
Where will you go?

342
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,291
[BOTH]
Huh?

343
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,666
[FURET] You say you're
gonna take her with you,

344
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,250
but where do you plan on going?

345
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,125
Um-- Well, actually, we hadn't
really decided where to go yet.

346
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,125
[chuckles]
Unbelievable.

347
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,083
You're so wrapped up
in trying to run away

348
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,416
that you've no idea
where you're running to.

349
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,875
[FURET] I can't just hand over
Pamela to a couple of kids

350
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,541
that don't even know where
they're trying to escape to.

351
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,208
What's that supposed to mean?

352
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,000
Tell me, do you seriously think
you can make it out of this city

353
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,333
with just that one sword?

354
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,666
[LEO]
On my honor as a knight,

355
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,708
I swear to see
Miss Pamela out safely.

356
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,250
[FURET]
Talk about naive.

357
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,583
Those soldiers aren't so soft

358
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,208
that you can defeat
them with passion.

359
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,583
Are you saying
that you're the one

360
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,750
who should be
protecting her then?

361
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,916
At the very least,

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,875
I'd be a lot more
useful to her than you.

363
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,916
[LEO growls]

364
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,958
Wanna put that to the test?

365
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,958
[PACIFICA]
Hey! Wait a minute, you two!

366
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,750
[WINIA]
Cut it out already!

367
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,416
[knocking]

368
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,458
[FURET]
Don't!

369
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,125
[FURET]
Who is it?

370
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,083
[SLEY]
It's me, Sley.

371
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,166
[FURET]
He's an old friend of mine.

372
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,250
I sure have a lot
of visitors today.

373
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,708
What do you want?

374
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,375
Can you spare a minute?

375
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,000
I have company over.

376
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,541
Let's talk outside.

377
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,625
Sure.

378
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,291
[SLEY]
It's been a long time, Wraith.

379
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,333
[FURET] Don't call me by
my old codename, not now.

380
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,208
I'm not a Blackhawk anymore.

381
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,458
Your discharge request
was never processed.

382
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,416
Officially, you're still
considered a military reservist.

383
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,458
Like I care.

384
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,958
So what do you
want from me anyway?

385
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,416
Slow, aren't you?

386
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,208
I've come to take
you back, Reservist.

387
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,208
As you know, we're going to
be marching on Giat soon.

388
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,000
We'll need plenty of
assassinations and sabotage.

389
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,375
We've got our work
cut out for us.

390
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,791
So?

391
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,000
[SLEY] We can't afford to
let you waste your talent

392
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,625
living like a civilian.

393
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,000
It's only natural
to reinstate you.

394
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,875
[FURET]
Like I said, I have no intention

395
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,458
of going back to the military,
so leave me alone.

396
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,750
I have to admit,
I think that's a shame.

397
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,458
[FURET]
Well, I don't. Now go home.

398
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,666
It seems that nothing I can
say will change your mind.

399
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,083
[FURET groans]

400
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,416
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Soldier?

401
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,375
You know you can't
live a normal life,

402
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,541
not with all that
blood on your hands.

403
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,541
Is that so?

404
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,625
You can't just
keep living a lie!

405
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,166
Is that so?

406
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,291
[SLEY grunts]

407
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,458
In that case...
Have a nice life.

408
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,458
Unexpected situation, Class 7.

409
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,083
Scrapped Princess located
at Wraith's hideout.

410
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,375
Requesting troops
to initiate capture.

411
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,666
Message ends.

412
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,000
[RAQUEL] The Royal Forces
descend on Furet's home

413
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,500
in order to finally capture
the Scrapped Princess.

414
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,625
Pacifica and the others
manage to escape the raid,

415
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,291
but what will happen to her now?

416
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,416
Does this mean her happy
carefree days as Pamela

417
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,583
will come to an end?

418
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,458
Next time on
<i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

419
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,875
"Back Alley Elegy."

420
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,458
See you next time!
