00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,916
No way...

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,833
[PRIEST]
Well done. You may leave us now.

162
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,000
[PACIFICA]
But... Wait!

163
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,708
Why, Auntie?

164
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,958
[DIANA] I had no idea that you
were the Scrapped Princess.

165
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,583
What I'm doing is for
the good of the kingdom,

166
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,000
for the good of our
lord god Mauser!

167
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,125
You've only yourself to blame!

168
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,250
[PRIEST]
How foolish of her.

169
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:40,500
There's no need to feel shame
for performing a good deed.

170
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,375
There's not a single
place in this world

171
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,625
that will take you in, for you
are the Scrapped Princess,

172
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,541
the one Saint Grendel
spoke of in his revelation.

173
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,791
You are the great evil
that will destroy the world.

174
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,666
In the name of the god Mauser,

175
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,041
I shall purge the
Scrapped Princess.

176
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,791
[PRIEST]
Thunder, rumble in the heavens,

177
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,791
brandish your whip of light,

178
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,083
and show us now the
power of your wrath!

179
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,208
[PRIEST]
The man you call "Father"

180
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,708
gave his life in
order to protect you.

181
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:38,041
As long as you continue to live,
there will be more and more

182
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,375
people who will flock to
the aid of our god Mauser.

183
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,833
[PRIEST] Your very existence
on this Earth is a sin.

184
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,666
You should never've been
born in the first place,

185
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,375
for you were destined to
be cast away immediately.

186
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,541
[PRIEST gasps]

187
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,166
You have my sincerest
apologies, sir,

188
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,750
but I'm afraid I'm going
to have to put you

189
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,875
out of commission.

190
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,166
[PRIEST]
What's that?!

191
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,166
Uh... Big Sister, I...

192
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,291
[PRIEST] Thunder,
rumble in the heavens...

193
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,125
[RAQUEL]
People of the flames, dance.

194
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,166
[PRIEST yelps]

195
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,625
[PRIEST] Thunder...
rumble in the heavens...

196
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,125
People of the flames, dance.

197
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,708
[PRIEST]
...grant us your whip of-- Ah!

198
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,291
[PRIEST groans]

199
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,833
[RAQUEL]
People of the flames, dance.

200
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,875
[PRIEST screams]

201
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,958
That's impossible!

202
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,458
There's no way you could
cast a spell of that power

203
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,375
with so short a chant!

204
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,416
Do you mean to defy the god
Mauser with your blasphemy?!

205
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,458
Such insolence!

206
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,291
[RAQUEL]
My deepest apologies.

207
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,500
I will fight you to
the best of my abilities.

208
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,500
Class one, tactical grade
military offensive spell.

209
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,291
Come forth, Thor!

210
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:22,625
[PACIFICA coughing]

211
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,625
Don't you think
that was a bit much?

212
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,083
[RAQUEL]
Well, you heard him.

213
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,750
Oh, look, here comes Shannon.

214
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,166
[SHANNON]
"Oh" yourself, Missy!

215
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, Sis, nicely done.

216
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,916
You've done a bang-up
job of showing the people

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,166
who are hunting us
exactly where we are.

218
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,958
[RAQUEL chuckles]

219
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:38,958
Oopsie!

220
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,666
Oh brother... Hey, Pacifica!

221
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,083
No more going out all
by yourself, got it?

222
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,958
You can't go wandering
off with strangers!

223
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,625
Auntie Diana wasn't a stranger.

224
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,750
[groaning]

225
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,625
[PRIEST]
Please... Help me...

226
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,625
[BOY] For one of the
church's elite Attenuators,

227
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,041
you're less than impressive.

228
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,166
I come all this way,
and this is what I find.

229
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll have to kill the
Scrapped Princess myself.

230
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,458
[SHANNON] Don't be using
any magic, you got that?

231
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,583
[RAQUEL]
But why not? It's so convenient.

232
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,833
[SHANNON]
Because every third time

233
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,041
it's a total failure,
that's why!

234
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,291
Char-burnt barbecue, exploding
chicken... Do I need to go on?

235
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,250
[PACIFICA] She's right! I'm
sick and tired of lousy food.

236
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,833
You're in no position
to talk, little Missy.

237
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,416
Ah, I'm so hungry...

238
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,291
Don't eat it!

239
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,208
Ugh, it's still raw...

240
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,083
When you want something done
fast, magic is the way to go!

241
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,083
[SHANNON]
Hey, hold it!

242
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,875
[RAQUEL]
Ah, but why not?

243
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,958
[SHANNON] Aw, come on!
Just leave it alone already!

244
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,541
[SHANNON]
What do you want?

245
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,083
What's wrong with you?

246
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,500
You look like an old
man all hunched over.

247
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,375
Did you get out of bed just
to come pick a fight with me?

248
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,666
[PACIFICA]
Wow.

249
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,375
These nights are getting
colder and colder.

250
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,083
[SHANNON] Now you sound
like an old lady, Pacifica.

251
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,958
Shannon, my name... Pacifica,

252
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,541
who gave it to me?

253
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,958
[SHANNON]
What do you mean?

254
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,083
Mom and Dad gave you
your name. Who else?

255
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,375
[PACIFICA] So my real mom and
dad never gave me a name...

256
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,125
I guess they thought I wouldn't
be around long enough

257
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,458
for it to really matter.

258
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,166
[PACIFICA] I wish I could've
lived in that village forever.

259
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,166
With Dad, and Mom,
and you, and Raquel.

260
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,625
I could've gone to school,

261
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,583
and Mom and Dad would've
chewed me out for my bad grades.

262
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,041
And then I could've gotten mad

263
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,750
and asked them for a raise
in my allowance. And then...

264
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,291
Pacifica...

265
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,750
[PACIFICA] Didn't you
want that too, Shannon?

266
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,541
You know, you could've
taken over from Dad

267
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,416
and run the weapon
store yourself.

268
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,583
And then you could
live a normal li--

269
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,291
Someday, that's just
what I'm gonna do.

270
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,708
But you can't.

271
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,583
At least, not while I live.

272
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,291
I guess I really
am trash, aren't I?

273
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,208
If I were to die, I wonder if
all of this would be over.

274
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,333
Right?

275
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,000
It's time for Raquel
to keep watch.

276
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,166
Answer my question!

277
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,041
[SHANNON sighs]

278
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,166
That's a difficult question...

279
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:07,833
[SHANNON]
If...

280
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,250
...someday...

281
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,291
[SHANNON grunts]

282
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,041
You're that guy from
this morning, right?

283
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,625
Please die now.

284
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,416
Get inside!

285
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,375
[SHANNON]
Who are you?

286
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,625
Royal Forces Fifth Special Ops
Unit, the Obstinate Arrows.

287
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,666
Christopher Armalite,
combat weapons specialist.

288
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,208
But call me Chris.

289
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,791
I understand now.

290
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,041
This explains why you were able

291
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,000
to protect the Scrapped
Princess all this time.

292
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,875
[RAQUEL]
Oh my!

293
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,333
Did you ever get a chance to
try their soy sauce dumplings?

294
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,375
[giggles]

295
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,666
Well I guess it might
be a bit too difficult

296
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,708
to try and beat the
both of you myself.

297
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,250
I know it's rude
to attack and run,

298
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,583
but let's finish this
up another time.

299
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,833
[CHRIS] Oh, that reminds
me: One more thing.

300
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,750
Why have the two of you
decided to protect that girl?

301
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,750
You must know
about the revelation.

302
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,500
That girl is an abomination
who will bring down disaster

303
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,250
on the world when she turns 16.

304
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,875
No one will care if she dies.

305
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,250
On the contrary,
they'll celebrate.

306
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,416
What's the point in
protecting a girl like--?

307
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,708
[CHRIS]
Did I upset you?

308
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,541
Surely you've heard it before?

309
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,375
When she became
a part of our family,

310
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,666
my father and mother
gave that girl her name.

311
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,041
They named her with the hope
that everyone who met her

312
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,500
would grow to love her.

313
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:02,750
So you see, I'm always gonna
protect my little sister.

314
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,750
I'll protect her until
the moment I discover

315
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:10,000
that she really is the poison
that will destroy the world.

316
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,041
--[thud]
--[gasps]

317
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,458
That guy's tough. He's
different from the others.

318
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:27,458
You're right. An exceptional
adversary has appeared.

319
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,250
Hey, Big Brother?

320
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,291
[SHANNON]
Hmm?

321
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,708
If I...

322
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,291
If the Revelation is true,

323
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,541
and I really am the one who's
going to destroy the world...

324
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,250
...if that happens...

325
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,375
...then I want you to be
the one who kills me, okay?

326
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,000
[PACIFICA]
Aw, c'mon!

327
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,375
How much farther is it
to the next village?

328
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,250
[SHANNON]
Uh... I don't know.

329
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,875
[PACIFICA]
Yeah, right! Of course you do!

330
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,416
Your problem is you're always so
vague and wishy-washy like that!

331
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,625
And that's exactly the reason

332
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,833
why girls never go
for you, you know?

333
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,083
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.

334
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,458
[PACIFICA sighs]

335
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,791
Hey, Big Brother?

336
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,500
What is it?

337
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,875
The thing is...

338
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,458
[PACIFICA]
...I love you.

339
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,500
[gasps]

340
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,750
I knew that already.

341
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,375
Hey! Stop!

342
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,541
[PACIFICA]
How about blushing about it?!

343
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,250
Or maybe acting happy about it?!

344
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,666
I swear you can be
such a jerk sometimes!

345
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,000
What's the matter
with you, anyway?!

346
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,541
It's like you're an
old man or something!

347
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,875
--[SHANNON] Well, excuse me!
--[PACIFICA] You're so annoying!

348
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,083
[RAQUEL] The Cassul siblings
are attacked by bandits.

349
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,416
A boy who's passing by
decides to intervene

350
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,750
in order to rescue them.

351
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,250
What's more,

352
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,291
he decides to tag along even
though they tell him not to.

353
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,875
This could cause problems.

354
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,708
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

355
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,458
"March of the
Half-Baked Knight."

356
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:53,750
See you next time.
