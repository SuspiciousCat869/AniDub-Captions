00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,375
[LEO]
Let us out! Let us out of here!

2
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,958
[SUTTON] This guy is
getting on my nerves.

3
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,416
Hey! Shut up!

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,291
[LEO]
Do what you want with me...

5
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,208
But let Miss Pacifica go!

6
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,416
[DENNIS] If you don't stop
making all that racket,

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,875
I'm gonna kill you.

8
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:53,916
[BOTH gasp]

00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,166
Excuse me...

10
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,958
I-I'm just wondering...

11
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,916
What's gonna happen to me?

12
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,250
Look, I don't really know
what's going on here,

13
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,166
but did this Scrapped
Princess person

14
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,208
really do such terrible things?

15
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,541
[SOLDIER A]
Get in!

16
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,500
[PACIFICA]
Huh...? H-Hey! Wait!

17
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,666

[groans]

19
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,333
Why'd you do that?!

20
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,750
What's that thing for?

21
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,625
They don't expect me to do
my business in that, do they?!

22
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,375
That's so mean!

23
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,958
It's like this is a
dungeon or something!

24
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,791
Oh... I guess this is a dungeon.

25
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,458
I can't even take
a bath in here.

26
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,875
Winia... Leo...

27
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,375

--[WOMAN groaning]
--[PACIFICA gasps]

35
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,041
Um, excuse me, but are
you all right in there?

36
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,500
[WOMAN]
Y-Yes... Thank you.

37
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,791
Then you've captured
the Scrapped Princess.

38
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,541
[LUKE]
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,708
Very good.

40
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,583
[LUKE] However, she has
yet to admit that

41
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,875
she actually is the
Scrapped Princess.

42
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,125
That doesn't matter.

43
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,458
But, sir--

44
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,625
[PETERS-STAHL] An imposter
will do just as well.

45
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,708
Just the fact that
we captured her.

46
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,791
In the end, that's all
that's really important.

47
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,708
[SOCOM] They've captured
the Scrapped Princess,

48
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,000
so why aren't we doing
something about it?

49
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,666
[STEYR] We've got a
little more than a week

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,750
before the Princess turns 16.

51
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,916
Let's wait and see
how things develop.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,041
These foolish creatures
will probably

53
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,166
put on an amusing show for us.

54
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,333
[SOCOM] Toying with the humans
like this is a waste of time.

55
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,708
It is a meaningless
act on our part.

56
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,500
[STEYR]
You find it disagreeable? Ha...

57
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,125
That's interesting since our
personalities were modeled

58
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,666
after those cruel,
foul-tempered humans.

59
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,208
Don't forget that.

60
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,083
[LEO groans]

61
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,458
[DENNIS]
You two are free to go home now.

62
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:49,125
We don't need anything
else from you, so scram!

63
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,875
What have you done
with Miss Pacifica?!

64
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,291
Just get outta here already.

65
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,416
[LEO]
Wait! Hey, hold it!

66
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,708
Open up! Open up this door!

67
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,208
[LEO]
Open this door...

68
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,666
Please... I beg you...

69
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,416
[LEO]
Open the door...

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,208
[WINIA]
Leo...

71
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,208
[LEO sobs]
I promised him...

72
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,458
I gave him my word.

73
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,666
I swore I would keep Miss
Pacifica safe no matter what.

74
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,791
I promised that to him!

75
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,958
[JILL]
You still think this is right?

76
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,708
[CHRIS]
Now we won't be disbanded.

77
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,500
That's all that matters, right?

78
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,208
Christopher... Jillian...

79
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,250
[JILL]
Huh?

80
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,458
Word's come down
that Prince Forsyth

81
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,791
is being sent away
to the Holy City.

82
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,916
What?!

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,750
[FAFAL]
He apparently scolded the King,

84
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,458
telling him that he should treat
the Scrapped Princess better.

85
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,208
Sounds like the Prince
has been trying to

86
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,666
convince his father
not to go to war.

87
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,375
And now, the King wants to get
rid of his trouble-making son.

88
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,208
What do you think, Christopher?

89
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,875
You know that all
of us will follow you

90
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,000
no matter what happens,

91
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,291
even if it means
losing the unit.

92
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:06,000
So tell us, what is it that
you really want to do now?

93
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,583
[SOLDIER B] Hey, did you guys
get that notice from the brass?

94
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,916
[SOLDIER C]
Yeah, just now.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,333
[SOLDIER B]
I guess this means that

96
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,375
they finally caught
the Scrapped Princess.

97
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,708
[SOLDIER C] Yep, looks like
we can take it easy for a while.

98
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,583
[SHANNON]
Is that true?

99
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,041
[SOLDIERS]
Huh?

100
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,125
It must be or the guys
on top wouldn't have

101
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,458
rescinded our orders to
keep searching for her.

102
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,500
So where are they
keeping her now?

103
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,875
[SOLDIER C]
She's probably been executed.

104
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,666
After all, that little
girl's the poison

105
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,291
that's gonna destroy the world.

106
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,083
The guys who caught her said
she was ugly and evil lookin'.

107
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,833
[SOLDIERS laugh]

108

Hey, you bastard!

00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,208

You better watch where

112
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,458
you're puttin' that
right hand, Buddy.

113
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,000
[SOLDIER F] You ready
to deal with all of us?

114
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,375
This situation is dangerous.

115
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,875
You're so irritated that you're
acting completely haphazardly.

116
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,375
And you're one of the reasons
I've so damn irritated!

117
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,416
[SLEY]
What's going on here?!

118
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,791
Stand aside!

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,708
[LUKE]
Shannon Cassul, I presume?

120
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,583
And you are?

121
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,541
[LUKE] We are the Royal Forces
Special Intelligence Bureau.

122
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,750
So you're the Blackhawks then.

123
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,541
I am the squad leader,
Colonel Luke Sturm.

124
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,916
[SHANNON]
What do you want with me?

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,166
I'd like you to come with us.

126
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,416
We'd also like your companion,
the Peacemaker,

127
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,041
to accompany us as well.

128

[gasps]

129
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,666
[LUKE]
Let me make this clear.

130
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,541
At this point in time,
we have absolutely no intention

131
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,750
of antagonizing either you or
the forces of the Peacemakers.

132
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,875
Please think of this as
a request on our part,

133
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,416
not as a command.

134
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,458
[SHANNON grunts]

135
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,041
Your request is
pretty inconvenient.

136
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,458
All right, Colonel. Let's go.

137
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,291
They have Pacifica?!

138
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,708
[LEO]
I'm so sorry.

139
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,500
I knew that it was
going to be difficult

140
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,250
for her to escape the Capital.

141
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,416
But to be caught so soon...

142
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,875
And I still don't
know where Shannon is.

143
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,750
[LEO]
I'll do all I can to rescue her!

144
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,291
And how are you
going to do that?

145
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,791
I'll arrange a jailbreak
or set off a mass escape;

146
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,958
there are lots of ways!

147
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,666
[KEYDARF]
Those don't sound very feasible.

148
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,166
Then-- We'll use
Miss Raquel's magic.

149
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,500
[RAQUEL]
We can't do anything rash

150
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,875
until we know if
Pacifica's all right.

151
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,833
What about that inquisitor
friend of yours?

152
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,083
Might he know something?

153
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,208
It's possible.

154
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,333
He was just summoned
to the castle.

155
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,708
If I could find some way
to meet up with Mr. Berkens,

156
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,125
then maybe I could
learn something

157
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,125
about what's
happened to Pacifica.

158
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:44,916
[HOGUE]
Highness...

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,541
By order of His Majesty,

160
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,458
I have been charged

Your Highness' best interest.

I've heard the Scrapped
Princess has been captured.

166
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,833
Would it be possible for me to

167
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,416
at least see my sister
before I have to leave?

168

As to that...

169
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,041
I guess it's too much to ask.

170

[PACIFICA] Hey, are you sure
you're okay over there?

You don't sound too good.

Are you all right?

[WOMAN]
Oh, I see. You poor dear.

I don't even know why
they took me prisoner.

They keep going on about how
I'm the Scrapped Princess,

Uh, ma'am? Are you all right?

Y-Yes... I'm fine...

[gasps]

192
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,458
I secretly helped
a person get away

that everyone was trying
to hunt down and kill.

00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,583
They tortured me, wanting to
know where this person was.

195
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,416
But that person's
been captured now,

196
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,583
so I suppose they don't need me.

197
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,625
Then that person must've
meant a great deal to you.

Oh, yes.

[LUKE] I have a message
from General Peters-Stahl.

00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,208
It reads as follows:

"I consider it an honor that you
have agreed to meet with me."

You truly are a Peacemaker.

You may have taken

You've got gall
calling us impolite.

Seems to me, inviting us to
come here and be insulted

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,166

Let me get right to the point.

I have a proposition;
let's join our forces.

What do you mean by that?

these beings known

manipulating and shaping
our history for millennia.

[SHANNON]
And?

Despite that fact, we intend
to march on the empire of Giat

with or without the permission
of the Peacemakers.

We will control our own destiny,

to threaten the Peacemakers.

you have combat capabilities

You think you can negotiate
with the Peacemakers?

You're going to demand that
they let you rule the world?

It's time for me to
do something about this.

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,583
[WINIA] I hope that Pacifica
is doing all right in there.

320
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,000
You think she's
okay though, right?

321
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,041
[cries]
What am I doing here?

322
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,083
What was I thinking?

323
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,541
I never should've
come to this city.

324
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,625
What's the point if
all we do is suffer?

325
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,916
I had such high hopes
when I left Taurus.

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,916
What am I doing here?

327
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,041
[crying continues]

328
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,875
[CZ]
What did you two speak about?

329
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,791
[SHANNON] Maybe what you
said earlier was right.

330
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,333
Humans are foolish.

331
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,750
And they're thoughtless.

332
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,333
And they're greedy, to boot.

333
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:40,125
I'm like that, too, so I
guess that makes me human.

334
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:44,166
If it were left alone, humanity
would eventually go extinct.

335
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,708
That is why we are here--

336
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,791
To see to it that humanity
continues to exist.

337
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,333
So, if Pacifica does turn 16,

338
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,166
what do you think is
actually going to happen?

339
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,625
Will this world
flicker and disappear?

340
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,958
Or will humanity be
all that's wiped out?

341
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,375
We still do not know for certain

342
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,166
what that system
is intended to do.

343
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,291
We are just carrying out the
mission that was assigned to us.

344
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,083
[PACIFICA]
And then after that,

345
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,041
I landed an acting
job at a theatre.

346
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,041
Guess who I got cast as?

347
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,791
I played a horse's
legs of all things!

348
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,250
I guess I can't expect
to play a princess.

349
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,875
But a horse's legs?
I mean, come on!

350
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,583
[ELMYR] Really? I wish
I could have seen that.

351
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,000
What? You'd like to
see horses' legs?

352
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,833
Not that. I would have liked to
have seen you performing a play

353
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,458
and living a happy life
surrounded by your friends.

354
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,958
[PACIFICA]
Oh, right.

355
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,333
You said you have a daughter,
didn't you, ma'am?

356
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,125
So you haven't seen
her for a while?

357
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,541
I haven't.

358
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,041
I gave up my daughter when
she was just a little baby

359
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,916
so that others could raise her.

360
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,750
[PACIFICA]
Oh...

361
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,625
[ELMYR] I didn't even
give the child a name.

362
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,291
I thought that if I did,

363
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,583
I'd never be able
to give her up.

364
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,250
But it was impossible for me
to keep my daughter with me,

365
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:01,041
so... I gave her away.

366
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,875
[PACIFICA]
What ended up happening to her?

367
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:03,958
[gasps]

368
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,625
[ELMYR] I heard
from those around her

369
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,916
that she grew up to be a
cheerful and carefree girl.

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,250
Really? Well, I'm glad
to hear that.

371
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,875
[ELMYR] Ever since then,
I've prayed that one day

372
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,458
I would be able to
see my daughter again.

373
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,291
Yeah! I'm sure that you will.

374
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,833
So am I.

375
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,083
[PACIFICA] I have someone
that I want to see again, too.

376
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,250
[ELMYR]
Oh?

377
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,833
[PACIFICA]
Well, he's... He's really gruff.

378
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,041
And when we go to the baths,
he always makes me wait forever.

379
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,708
And he's really bad at
drawing portraits, too.

380
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:40,000
But... I guess he is kind of a
nice guy every once in a while.

381
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,708
[ELMYR] Well, I suppose
you are at an age

382
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,291
where you're going to fall
in love with someone.

383
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,083
[PACIFICA]
What are you talking about?

384
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,583
Who said I was in love with him?

385
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,000
Say, ma'am.

386
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,833
I was wondering...

387
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,541
[PACIFICA]
Ma'am?

388
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,708
[groans]

389
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,500
[PACIFICA]
Hey, ma'am?

390
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,083
Are you really okay?

391
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,083
What's wrong?

392
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,125
[gasps]

393
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,125
[PACIFICA]
Hey! Somebody get over here!

394
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,375
Come quick! We need help!

395
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,416
Somebody get over here now!

396
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,041
[SOLDIER G]
What do you want?! Quiet down!

397
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,166
The lady next to me
is in a lot of pain!

398
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,000
Please, you have
to call a doctor!

399
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,208
[SOLDIER G]
Shut up already!

400
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,375
[gasps, grunts]

401
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,250
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?

402
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,583
[ELMYR]
Please... Could you...

403
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,083
[PACIFICA gasps]

404
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,041
[ELMYR] Would you please tell
me your name, young lady?

405
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,291
What's my name?

406
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,791
My name is Pamela.

407
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,291
[ELMYR]
Pamela...

408
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,666
I'm sure you'll get
out of this place.

409
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,833
That's the spirit! Once you
give up, you've already lost.

410
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,625
So let's both hang
in there, okay?

411
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,125
[ELMYR]
Of course...

412
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,833
Hey, ma'am?

413
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,791
Are you okay?!

414
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,958
[ELMYR] Pamela... Would you...
do something for me?

415
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:13,875
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

416
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,875
[ELMYR]
If you could, Pamela...

417
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,875
I'd like you to call me
"mother" before I die...

418
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,666
Before you die?

419
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,791
Come on, that's not funny.
Don't talk like that.

420
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,416
[ELMYR] Pretend that you're
my daughter, please?

421
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,083
[gasps]

422
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,875
I can't do that. I just can't.

423
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,958
Because once I do, I'm afraid
that you'll-- Don't die!

424
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,916
I'll come up with something!

425
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,833
Don't. You can't. Don't give up!

426
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:47,125
I'm so sorry... Pamela.

427
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,541
Don't die. You can't!

428
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:53,958
Say something! Talk to me.
Please, you have to hang on!

429
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,250
Please, Mother!

430
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,750
Mother?! Mother, no!

431
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,250
[PACIFICA]
Mother!

432
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,916
[RAQUEL] Pacifica is
taken out of her cell

433
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,083
and brought before the King.

434
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,833
He seems to be
afraid of her, though.

435
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,916
But General Peters-Stahl,
who knows no fear,

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,708
seems to be trying to make a
deal with the Peacemaker Cz.

437
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,333
It sure is audacious
to try to bargain

438
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,083
with beings who are
like gods, isn't it?

439
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,833
Next time on
<i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

440
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,750
"Prelude to the
Divinely-Ordered Collapse."

441
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,166
See you next time!
