00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,208
[roars]

165
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,375
[PACIFICA]
Um...

166
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,416
'Scuse me. Just where are
you planning on taking me?

167
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,375
[CHRIS]
Don't worry. You can trust us.

168
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,750
See, people who tell me,
"You can trust us,"

169
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,250
those turn out to be the same
people that I shouldn't trust

170
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,750
in the first place.

171
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,291
Most people don't go out of
their way to be nice to me.

172
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,500
[CHRIS] I'm taking you to
your brother and sister.

173
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,166
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

174
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,000
[CHRIS] So could you please
be quiet for a little while?

175
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,208
I don't get it.

176
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,833
Why are you doing this?

177
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,875
[CHRIS]
I'm not really sure.

178
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,916
I don't know.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,916
I guess I did it because
I just wanted to.

180
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,166
[CHRIS]
This is probably the first time

181
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,291
since being raised as a
Special Forces soldier

182
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,541
that I've ever done something
because it's what I wanted.

183
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,416
You see, for me, the thought
of being someone's friend--

184
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,541
of wanting to help them without
actually being ordered to help,

185
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,041
but simply because I'd
like to help them out...

186
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:50,250
It makes me feel--
How can I put it?

187
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,416
It makes me really happy.

188
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,250
Does that answer your question?

189
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,208
Thank you, Chris.

190
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,041
[gasps]

191
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,208
[SHANNON]
Senes!

192
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,041
[STEYR giggles]

193
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,500
They were awfully gung-ho,

194
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,208
but they sure didn't
put up much of a fight.

195
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,916
It's not too late. We're still
willing to spare you.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,416
Surrender now and forget about
everything that's happened.

197
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,875
If you can turn a blind eye
to your sister's destruction,

198
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,791
we'll even leave you
and your friends alive

199
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,083
after we carry out
the reset process.

200
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,375
[SHANNON]
Just shut up!

201
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,666
You call yourselves
messengers of God?

202
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,541
You're just overblown puppets.

203
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,541
You bastards aren't divine.
Or even righteous.

204
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,916
You seriously expect
me to believe

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,208
a word you say after
all you've done?!

206
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,000
[SOCOM]
What foolishness.

207
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,041
Huh?

208
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,958
[SOCOM] Why do you
humans struggle so hard

209
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,125
to try and avoid your destiny?

210
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,250
Is it out of some mindless
obsession with heroism?

211
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,500
Truthfully, is your
sister's life

212
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,708
worth risking the future
of the entire world?

213
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,500
You say you believe that,
but haven't you just been

214
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,416
genetically engineered
to think that way?

215
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,875
[SHANNON]
I agonized over it.

216
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,333
I had my doubts.

217
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,958
There were lots of times
when I wanted to give up.

218
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,583
But then I realized
I was overlooking

219
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,041
one very important thing.

220
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,291
[SOCOM]
Oh? And what's that?

221
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,875
[SHANNON] Who said that
I had to choose between

222
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,166
protecting either
Pacifica or the world?

223
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,875
There's no way I can
choose one over the other.

224
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,916
Call it what you will,
idealism or heroics,

225
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,041
but I'm going to do whatever
it takes to save both of them.

226
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,375
[SOCOM]
So be it.

227
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,416
[STEYR] Then take your ideals
to the grave with you.

228
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,166
[CZ]
Forgive me.

It's no good, Shannon.

232
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,916
I can't take any more.

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,083
[STEYR]
Shall I finish him off?

234
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,791
[SOCOM]
Suit yourself.

Are you okay?

00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,916

Thanks...

Drake, Ruth, you're with me!

Yes, ma'am!

240

We're withdrawing.

241
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,958
Steyr is dead.

242
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,958
Abort the reset operation.
We need to regroup.

243
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,041
[CZ]
Understood.

244
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,791
[SENES]
The bastards ran away.

245
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,458
What happened to the red one?

246
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,583
[ZEFIRIS]
She was completely destroyed.

247
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,541

We've done enough.

248
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,791
Let's go back.

[MAN]
Oh, look at that!

252
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,416
They're dissolving.

253
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,750
Quick, Miss Raquel! We have
to head to the castle!

254
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,333
Yes, of course. Let's go.

It's Dragunov!

268

Thank goodness she's all right!

[SHANNON]
It must've been tough.

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,916
[PACIFICA]
Mm....

274
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,291
[SHANNON]
Was it hard for you?

275
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,708
[PACIFICA]
Yeah...

276
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,666
It was painful.

277
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,541
I'm still upset by it now.

278
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,500
So then... many people died,
didn't they?

279
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,291
That's what I've been told.

280
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:11,041
If not for me... If I didn't--

281
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,625
If I weren't around,
then they'd still be alive!

282
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,916
Pacifica...

283
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,333
[PACIFICA]
I know.

284
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,666
I know what you'd say.

285
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,666
But I keep thinking
that it's true.

286
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,875
I can't help but think
that's really the case.

287
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,625
If I died right here,
everyone would be better off.

288
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,291
[gasps]

289
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,333
Shannon.

290
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,125
Do you want to die?

291
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,333
Would you like to die now
and get this over with?

292
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,625
My sword exists to protect your
life or to take it from you,

293
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,208
whichever you want.

294
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,208
If you truly want to die now,

295
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,416
then I'll kill you
here where you stand.

296
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,791
But remember that no matter
which path you choose,

297
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,250
it won't change the fact that
someone somewhere will die.

298
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,333
I don't care what names
people may call you.

299
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,333
Whatever they might say
about you is irrelevant.

300
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,833
Why should I care
about them anyway?

301
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,416
They pass judgement
on total strangers.

302
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,833
They just repeat
their favorite rumors

303
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,041
without ever knowing
the truth about anything.

304
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,750
That's why I don't give
a damn what those

305
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,333
ignorant bastards
might say about you.

306
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,875
Not anymore.

307
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:43,166
But still... if you do accept
what they think of you,

308
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,833
if you believe that
you're the poison

309
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,083
that will destroy the world,

310
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,750
if you wish that you
could disappear forever,

311
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,625
or if you want to
die and end it all--

312
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:57,625
If that's true...
then I can't stop you.

313
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,875
Because the only person
who has the right to decide

314
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,333
who or what you're
going to be... is you.

Tell me, what is it
you want to do?

317
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,083
Yeah, but-- but so many people
have been hurt or killed

318
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,250
because of me--

319
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,916
[SHANNON] I'm not asking
about anyone else!

320
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,916
For the last time,
I'm asking you what you want!

321
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,416
If you want to die,

322
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,666
I'll strike you down now
in the blink of an eye.

323
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,166
But if you want to live,

324
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,625
I'll do whatever it
takes to protect you.

325
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,708
You have to make the decision.

326
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,250
Then I...

327
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,041
I want to live!

328
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,000
[PACIFICA]
I want to stay alive.

329
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,041
I don't wanna die.

330
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,125
I want to be with my
brother and sister

331
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,291
and everyone I care about.

332
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,666
Then let's live...
with everything we've got.

333
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,750
[RAQUEL] Pacifica and the others
arrive outside the Holy City.

334
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,750
Who knows when the
Royal Forces will attack.

335
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,583
If you don't wash your clothes,
they'll start to smell.

336
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,666
And it's bad for your health
if you don't eat right.

337
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,458
Pacifica decides to
cook for the group,

338
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,250
but is it a good
idea to eat her food

339
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,541
before fighting
the Royal Forces?

340
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,958
Next time on
<i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

341
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,791
"A Rondo that Transcends Time."

342
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,291
See you next time!
