[gasps]

2
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:07,500
Looks like the royal forces
finally found this place.

3
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,750
[DENNIS]
Yeah.

4
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,708
[LUKE] We've received a
communique from our recon unit.

5
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,500
They've found the
Scrapped Princess' party

6
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,458
near the mountains.

7
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,375
[PETERS-STAHL] Two more days
until the day of prophecy.

8
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,500
We'll do whatever it takes to
eliminate the Scrapped Princess

9
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,250
in order to appease
the wrath of god.

10
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,750
Have all of the Colossus units
converge on the mountains.

11
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,291
[SOCOM]
Call for a crusade if you like,

12
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,708
but we would prefer to
use a more reliable means

13
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:55,125
of eliminating the
Providence Breaker.

14
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,958
This is your final opportunity.

15
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,833
We will send an emissary.

16
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,166
[HOGUE]
Sir.

17
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,375
[FORSYTH]
Huh?

18
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,333
Chris.

19
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,750
Please forgive me for startling
you like this, Your Highness.

20
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,375
That's all right.

21
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,250
[FORSYTH]
How is my sister doing?

22
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,291
[gasps]

23
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,958
It was your team, wasn't it?

24
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,125
They say that you smuggled
the Scrapped Princess

25
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,958
out of the castle.

26
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,541
Your Highness.

27
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,625
I can't bring myself to believe
that she will destroy the world.

28
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,500
[FORSYTH]
I see...

29
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,375
So, you've come all this way

30
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,666
just so you could
say goodbye to me.

31
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,208
[CHRIS] Take care
of yourself, Your Highness.

32
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:56,666
[birds chirping]

33
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,000
[grunts]

34
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,250
[PACIFICA] You old folks
sure wake up early.

35
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,083
Shut up already.

36
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,916
It's beautiful.

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,333
I suppose so.

38
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:42,583
Tomorrow, when I
finally do turn 16,

39
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,625
do you think the sun will
come up just like always?

40
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,583
[PACIFICA]
Tomorrow morning,

41
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,625
when the sun rises again,

42
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,750
I wonder what's going
to happen to me.

43
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,958
[SHANNON]
Beats me.

44
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,708
You'll probably make
another lousy breakfast.

45
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,041
[PACIFICA]
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

46
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,166
I might cause trouble for
everyone in the world

47
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,750
just because I'll
turn 16 tomorrow.

48
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,916
[PACIFICA]
But, even so...

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,708
I still don't want to die.

50
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,500
Is that really selfish of me?

51
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,208
So wanting to live
is being selfish now?

52
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,375
I think that's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

53
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,750
[PACIFICA] Even if that
person was a criminal?

54
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,000
Even if it meant that
lots of people would die

55
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,000
if they stayed alive?

56
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,791
[SHANNON]
I'd still forgive them.

57
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,333
Hey there you two!

58
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,416
Pacifica, Shannon!
Breakfast is ready!

59
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,083
Okay!

60
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,791
C'mon! Let's go, Shannon!
Time to eat.

61
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,041

Uh.

00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,750
[PACIFICA laughing]

63
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,416
[SHANNON]
Hey!

64
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,625
Good morning, Your Highness.

65
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,166
I hope you were able to
sleep well last night.

66
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,291
[FORSYTH]
Huh? Yes.

67
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,000
[HOGUE]
I'm glad to hear that.

68
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,875
I was deeply concerned that the
cries of the injured people

69
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,833
might've kept Your
Highness awake.

70
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,333
[FORSYTH]
Injured people?

71
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,666
[HOGUE] There has been a steady
stream of people arriving

72
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,208
who were injured in the
calamity at the capital.

73
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,125
So we have been using
part of the temple

74
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,625
as a makeshift hospital.

75
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,833
If you'd be willing,

76
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,000
perhaps Your Highness
could take some time

77
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,791
and go and visit them.

78
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,833
[gasps]

[TOWNSPEOPLE groan]

81
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,625
[HOGUE] They come here
because they have no money

82
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,250
to pay for medical treatment.

83
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:48,541
Those who have survived this
long will heal eventually.

84
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,208
However...

85
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,041
[FORSYTH] There are
still a great many more

86
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,750
who have lost their lives.

87
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,791
As long as the Scrapped
Princess still exists,

88
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,875
God's wrath will
rain from the heavens

89
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,833
and even more people will
be injured and killed.

90
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,916
Your Highness,
please act as an emissary.

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,416
Become god's messenger...

in order to save your people.

93
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,041
So, what are you so happy about?

94
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,083
Oh, this and that.

95
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,583
[PACIFICA]
Like what and what?

96
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,041
It's Chris.

97
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,458
He said, "Thank you," when I
brought him his breakfast.

98
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,333
I see! Heh, heh.

What are you grinning
about now, huh?

[SENES]
Hey.

00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,250
The Royal Forces are
beginning to close in on us.

00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,625
Get your butts back to camp now.

103
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,416
So, who cares about that?

104
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,708
Now look here, kid...

105
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,166
What am I supposed to do?

106
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,833
Washing the laundry's
all I'm really good for.

107
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,625
[SENES]
Maybe she was right after all.

I guess that's your
way of fighting.

109
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,208
What's that mean?

110
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,458
It's something Eirote said.

111
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,833
She once told me that everybody
has their own way of fighting.

112
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,791
Really?

113

My whole life,

00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,708
all I've ever wanted to
do is change the world.

115
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,291
I swore I'd smash this
rotten world to pieces.

116
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:13,458
And yet... It's still pretty
far from being perfect.

117
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,541
But, maybe this world
isn't so bad after all.

118
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,291
When this ends, would you take
me to your village one day?

119
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,875
Sure! Of course, any time.

Sure, sure! Come on over!

[WINIA] That's okay.
I'll do the cooking.

Hey, watch what you're doing.

126

Those are supposed to be
finely sliced. Cut 'em thinner.

[LEO]
Oh. Right.

You're so nitpicky, Shannon.

Mr. Berkens?!

00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,625
Huh?!

00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,875
It's Pops!

It's good to see you, Pops!

[BERKENS] Good to see
you too, little lady.

134
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,625
He says that he's got a message
for you. What do you think?

135
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,958
He's all right.

136
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,208
What's the message?

137
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,833
[BERKENS] Price Forsyth
says he wants to meet

138
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,666
with the little lady.

139
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,250
So... Who's this Price Forsyth?

140
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,791
Prince Forsyth is
your twin brother.

141
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,500
[RAQUEL gasps]

142
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,208
[CHRIS] But why does he want
to see her all of a sudden?

143
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,833
Well, his sister's
birthday's comin' up soon,

144
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:23,166
and he'd like to meet her
just once before she turns 16.

145
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,208
[gasps]

146
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,166
Your answer?

147
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,125
[PACIFICA]
My answer...?

148
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:33,041
How am I supposed to react
to that at a time like this?

149
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,958
I am the
Scrapped Princess, remember?

150
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,583
And he's the prince of a country

151
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:41,208
that's been doing everything
it can to try and kill me.

152
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,000
I guess you can
call him my brother,

153
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,625
but it's not like
we've ever met.

154
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,375
I wonder why he picked
now to want to see me.

155
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,375
What kind of guy is he?

156
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,500
If Prince Forsyth
became our king,

157
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,375
I doubt that he would go to
war without a good reason.

158
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,458
The prince has been concerned
about you for as long

159
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,125
as I've known him.

160
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,916
Perhaps he just wants to meet
you and see for himself.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,416
See if you really are the poison
that will destroy this world.

162
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,208
[BERKENS] I'm supposed to
return to the holy city

163
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,000
with your answer.

164
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,666
We'll need to make
arrangements if you accept.

165
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,000
Otherwise, I'll just
head back to Grendel.

166
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,333
Think it over till this evening,
then give me your answer.

167
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,166
[PACIFICA]
What is it?

168
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,708
[LEO]
Oh, nothing. I was just...

169
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:47,958
[sighs]

170
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,000
thinking about how life
is so full of troubles.

171
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,458
Oh, right.

172
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:55,166
You were agonizing over what
chivalry is one last time.

173
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,541
[LEO]
Yes.

174
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,333
Did you figure it out?

175
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,333
[LEO]
No. Not yet.

176
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,458
[PACIFICA]
Oh.

177
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,166
[LEO] I always thought
that there had to be

178
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,375
a sense of justice that
everyone could believe in.

179
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,750
But, recently,

180
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,375
I've been thinking that
maybe there's no such thing

181
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,416
as one idea of justice
that works for everybody.

182
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,083
If I believed in
what the kingdom

183
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,333
and the Church of Mauser
told me is right,

184
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,083
then that certainly
wouldn't be what's right

185
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,541
from your point
of view, Pacifica.

186
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,958
Because of all that,

187
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,750
I no longer knew what was
right and what was wrong.

188
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,416
But, I realized something.

189
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,833
I realized that all
I really wanted to do

190
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,291
was protect you, Pacifica.

191
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,333
[PACIFICA]
Huh...

192
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,791
Oh, sorry.

193
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,458
That's enough talk about me.

194
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,000
I originally came down here
to try and help you out

195
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,250
with your problems.

196
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,666
[PACIFICA]
You wanted to give me advice?

197
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,583
Well, I'm not sure if
I'd be of much help.

198
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,125
[PACIFICA]
Of course you would.

199
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,333
You really mean that?!

200
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,958
When we talk together, Leo,

201
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,875
worrying about things seems
so stupid all of a sudden.

202
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,083
[LEO] Really?! They do?!
I'm so glad to hear that!

203
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,083
[chuckles]

204
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,416
And then there's the prince.

205
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,875
I hope he's a good person, too.

206
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,208
[LEO]
I'm sure he is!

207
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,041
Don't worry. Once he meets you,

208
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,125
I'm certain that he'll
like you immediately.

209
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,625
[PACIFICA]
You think so?

210
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,875
[LEO] All right, then.
I'll decide for you.

211
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:18,916
Let's meet him.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Huh?!

213
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,750
[LEO]
You only live once, after all.

214
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,125
Even if you fail spectacularly,

215
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,791
isn't it better to try and fail
than regret not trying at all?

216
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,750
Wow, Leo!
You never change, do you?

217
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,916
Sorry about that.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,083
[PACIFICA]
That headband.

219
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,541
Uh, yes?

220
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,375
[PACIFICA] That isn't the
one I tied around your head

221
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,500
back when we first met, is it?

222
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,208
Um...

223
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,541
Yes.

224
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,916
You should wash it.

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,083
[LEO]
I will. I'm sorry.

226
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,875
[PACIFICA]
Leo?

227
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,250
What is it?

228
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,333
Thanks a lot.

229
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,458
[chuckles]

230
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,458
[FAFAL] They're just barely
inside firing range.

231
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,208
I wonder if they're
planning on launching

232
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,833
a full-out offensive at dawn.

233
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,708
Once the sun goes down,
we should make our move.

234
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,291
[WINIA]
Uh.

235
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,166
[CHRIS]
Here.

236
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,916
Oh. Thank you so much.

237
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,708
Chris!

238
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,000
What is it?

239
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,083
Pacifica.

240
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,208
It's just that she didn't...

241
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,041
She couldn't remember the
man she was staying with,

242
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,041
back when she had amnesia.

243
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,333
Pacifica didn't actually come
out and say it or anything, but,

244
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,541
I think that she
really cared for him.

245
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,791
She cared for him,
but she doesn't remember him.

246
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,958
Not at all.

247
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,458
[CHRIS]
And yet,

248
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,833
you're able to remember that
person clearly, aren't you?

249
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,375
[gasps]

250
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,500
[CHRIS]
Someone once told me

251
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,875
that people are the
sort of creatures

252
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,458
who can forget painful
things that happen to them.

253
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:02,000
That they can go on living
precisely because they forget.

254
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,125
I apologize for how I acted.

255
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,625
Ignoring you, I mean.

256
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,625
I didn't want to
get you involved.

257
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,250
This Scrapped Princess
business is dangerous.

258
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,041
I know.

259
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,208
It's okay.

260
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,875
It's all okay now.

261
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,333
What's the matter?

262
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,791
[SHANNON]
Leo said something to me once.

263
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,250
That she's got
a nobility to her

264
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,541
that you can't
find in commoners.

265
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,750
Guess it's no surprise.

266
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,583
I mean after all, she does
just happen to be a princess.

267
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,458
[RAQUEL] Did you want her to say
that she wouldn't go meet him?

268
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,666
If she does decide that
she wants to go there

269
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,291
and see her real brother,

270
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,000
I've got no right to
stop her now, do I?

271
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,125
Hey, tell me something?

272
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,958
What makes someone a
real brother anyway?

273
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:04,083
Who's always going to
be your little sister?

274
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,125
Is anything really
going to change?

275
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,333
Guess not.

276
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,791
[PACIFICA]
Hey Shannon!

277
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,375
Raquel!

278
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,666
[panting]

279
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,791
Um. Listen.

280
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,041
I've decided.
I wanna meet this guy.

281
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,125
I'd like to see this
twin brother of mine.

282
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,833
Of course. You should see him.

283
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:27,875
Mm.

284
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,291
So, shall we go, Your Highness?

285
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,750
Prince Forsyth.
Is something the matter?

286
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,291
Not at all.

287
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,750
[footsteps]

288
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,000
[PETERS-STAHL]
Don't mind me.

289
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,791
I just came out here to
get a little fresh air.

290
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,625
Yes, sir.

291
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,208
So, what's that?

292
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,500
[LUKE] Something my wife
gave to me when I left.

293
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,875
She told me to sow these
seeds as soon as I came back.

294
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,333
They're yellow violets.
My wife's favorite flower.

295
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,875
You found yourself a fine wife.

296
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,375
[LUKE]
And you, General?

297
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,708
Unfortunately for me, I haven't
been able to find someone

298
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,583
to spend my days with.

299
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,833
It looks like I'll end
up married to this.

300
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,000
[footsteps]

301
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,291
[SLEY]
Excuse me, Sir.

302
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,375
There's a message from Grendel.

303
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,166
As expected, the target's
been changed.

304
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,250
[PETERS-STAHL]
Excellent.

305
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,541
We will commence
our attack at sunset.

306
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,791
Hi, Zefiris.

307
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,208
[ZEFIRIS]
So you're going, then?

308
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,416
Huh?

309
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,291
[ZEFIRIS] It will be
midnight in a few hours.

310
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,333
You need to be on your guard.

311
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:55,833
I pray nothing bad happens.
Please be careful.

312
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,375
Thanks, Zefiris.

313
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,125
[PACIFICA]
Um... I guess...

314
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,291
[FORSYTH]
Well then, you must be Pacifica.

315
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,000
[PACIFICA]
Uh, yes. Nice to meet you.

316
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,250
So, um...

317
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,166
Uh...

318
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,333
Um.

319
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,416
So, what kind of food
do you like to eat?!

320
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,583
Uh?

321
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,750
[PACIFICA]
I like eggs. Well, egg dishes.

322
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,083
And I really love omelets!

323
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,291
Wow, that's funny.
I like 'em, too.

324
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,166
Oh! I knew it! Maybe it's
because we're both twins.

325
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,750
[PACIFICA]
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,708
I'm so sorry for all the
hardships I've put you through.

327
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,583
Forgive me.

328
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,375
No! I don't blame you at all.

329
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,916
All this time, they've been
hunting you like some animal.

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I've tried, but there was
nothing I could do to help you.

331
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,750
My brother...

332
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,416
[PACIFICA]
Please don't worry about it.

333
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,125
Some parts of my life have
been rough, it's true,

334
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,916
but not everything.

335
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,875
[PACIFICA] That's my big
brother and sister over there.

336
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,958
And those are some
of my friends.

337
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,000
They seem like they're
very nice people.

338
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,458
They are.

339
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
[gasps]

340
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,500
[FORSYTH]
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,541
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

342
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,583
[FORSYTH]
I truly am so sorry.

343
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,375
At last, I've met you, but...

344
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,333
[PACIFICA gasping]

345
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,666
[PACIFICA]
Why...?

346
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,208
[grunts]

347
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,583
[CHRIS]
Prince Forsyth!

348
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,291
[WINIA]
No!

349
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,250
Hey, wait a minute!
They're aiming at the church.

350
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,916
They wouldn't!

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,541
[FAFAL] I don't get it.
The prince is in there!

352
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,666
Pacifica...

353
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,916
Pacifica, no!

354
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,333
[SHANNON]
Pacifica!

355
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,958
[gasps]

356
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,208
Uh?

357
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,500
Pacifica.

358
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,250
[ZEFIRIS] Shannon. I may
be able to help her

359
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,666
through the use of my phase
interference capabilities.

360
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,416
It will take time though.

361
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
[gasps]

362
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,000
[SOCOM?]
I won't allow you to interfere.

363
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,041
[gasps]

364
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,125
Barrier.

365
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,000
Barrier, protect us!

366
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,416
[SOCOM] This was unexpected,
but very convenient for us.

367
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,958
Shannon Cassul.

368
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,250
[gasps]

369
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,416
[SOCOM] You and the
Dragoon will come with me.

370
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,666
If you refuse,

371
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,333
I will burn the capital
to the ground instantly.

372
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,750
Shannon...

373
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,791
[SHANNON whimpering]

374
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:23,333
[SHANNON]
Raquel. Take care of Pacifica.

375
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,791
Now, Zefiris.

376
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:41,250
[roaring]

377
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,375
[PETERS-STAHL]
God's messenger has appeared.

378
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,375
Step up the bombardment!

379
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,250
Prepare to launch at once!

380
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,041
But how...?

381
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,500
How could this have happened?

382
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,375
[WINIA crying]

383
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,500
Prince Forsyth. Why?

384
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,500
[FORSYTH]
Please forgive me...

385
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:12,416
As their prince, I had a
duty to protect my people.

386
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,083
But at least... I wanted
to die... with her.

387
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,958
[sobs]

388
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,666
[RAQUEL]
Pacifica...

389
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,208
[RAQUEL] Pacifica has been
stabbed by her brother.

390
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,083
Although her sister lies
bleeding before her,

391
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,666
Raquel can do
nothing to save her.

392
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,333
And Shannon, who must
save the capital,

393
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,708
is forced to fuse with Zefiris

394
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,500
in order to fight
the Peacemakers.

395
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,000
There are only 15 words
left in this final preview.

396
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,125
Next time, the finale
of <i>Scrapped Princess.</i>

397
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,458
"Symphony of the Protectors."

398
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,041
See you next time!
