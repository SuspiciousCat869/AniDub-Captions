[ZEFIRIS]
What should I--

2
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,083
What should I do now, Pacifica?

3
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,500
Why? Is there something
bothering you?

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,708
Uh, well that's
kind of a surprise.

5
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,041
From our point of view,

6
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,541
we've always thought of
you as a god or something;

7
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,541
you seem to know everything.

8
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,500
[ZEFIRIS] I want to hear
your honest opinion.

9
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,916
There is something
I wish you to see.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,958
The truth of our existence.

11
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,625
Huh?!

12
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,875
[NATALIE]
Where are you going, Guardian?

13
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,083
I have to do something
to help Princess Senes

14
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,041
get this strange
ship moving again.

15
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,458
They said they'd
kill 1,000 per day?

16
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,708
I'm troubled that such a
small matter upsets you.

17
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,333
Don't you understand?

18
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,875
[SHANNON] She could
never live with herself

19
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,625
if all those people in the
Capital died because of her.

20
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,041
But you'll die as well.

21
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,750
Emotions are quite
a nuisance, aren't they?

22
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,000
However, you don't
need to worry anymore.

23
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,833

Huh?

[SENES]
Who are you?!

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,458
It's my father.

00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,333
Your father?

00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,083
Mjollnir, strike!

30
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,041
Pretty decisive, aren't you?

31
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,000
He appears and you
just take him out.

32
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,000
[RAQUEL] My father is no
longer among the living.

00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,458
[gasps]

34
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,666
I was the one who washed his
cold corpse after he died.

35
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,541
And I was the one who
lit his funeral pyre.

36
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,958
My memories aren't so vague

37
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,500
that I can be taken in by
such an obvious illusion.

38
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,833
We have to hurry now.

39
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,375
If they've left the
two of us behind,

40
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,041
that means that Natalie
and Zefiris might be

41
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,416
planning to do something
to Shannon and Pacifica.

42
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,083
[SENES] While they save us
ordinary folks for later?

43
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,750
Anyway, let's head for the core.

44
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,208
Getting the Skid moving
again comes first.

45
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,458
Right, we ordinary
types will have to

46
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,375
assert ourselves
the best we can.

47
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,458
That's right.

48
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,083
We're headed for
Sauer no matter what.

Why that's Mr. Soopie.

57
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,875
[KING BALTERIC] I can't
believe the Scrapped Princess

58
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,041
made it to Giat.

00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,750
Neither can I, sire.

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,916
[KING BALTERIC]
I obeyed the Grendel Revelation.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,500
I ordered that the newborn
princess be killed immediately.

62
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,500
[HOGUE]
The god Mauser knows full well

63
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,541
all that you have done, my King.

64
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,166
However, the day of
destiny draws nearer

65
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,125
with every passing moment.

66
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,791
The day the Scrapped
Princess will turn 16

67
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:14,708
and utterly destroy--

[KING BALTERIC]
Yes! I know!

69
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,750
We must hurry and find her.
Isn't that right?

70
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,416
And finally destroy her.

71
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,666
Yes, sire.

72
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,791
No matter the cost.

73
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,041
I assume all of you are aware
that the Giat Empire ship has

74
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,958
violated our territorial waters.

75
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:29,708
Of course.

76
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,083
We've also heard about

77
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,458
the Scrapped Princess
making contact with Scarlet.

78
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,208
There are persistent
rumors going around

79
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,083
that she might be conspiring
with Scarlet to attack us.

80
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,708
Pretty suspicious,
don't you think?

81
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,125
It sure sounds like
something's about to happen.

82
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,708
And our King has apparently
issued a direct order

83
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,958
to the Royal Forces
concerning this matter.

84
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,375
They're mustering troops to
kill the Scrapped Princess.

85
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,833
[DENNIS]
If she's killed by our forces

86
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,541
while under Giat's protection,
it'll start a war.

87
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,333
Right. And Jill has been seeing

some disturbing
things in her visions.

If the situation gets any worse,

the use of that spell.

their military technology.

It's tantalizing, isn't it?

I'd want their territories, too.

But of course.

You have to take what you
want when it's in reach.

Yes, that's true.

It's nothing.

[PACIFICA]
What is this?

113
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,583
[ZEFIRIS] This is an
illusion I have created

114
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,958
in order to explain
things to you.

115
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,916
This is the realm of the stars.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,916
It is also called outer space.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,208
At one time,
human beings possessed

118
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,583
enough power to
reach this realm.

119
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,750
[PACIFICA]
Oh.

120
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,750
[ZEFIRIS]
But one day, an enemy appeared

121
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,708
and threatened humanity.

122
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,250
They suddenly appeared
out of the depths of space

123
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,875
and began to attack the
Earth for reasons unknown.

124
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,125
[PACIFICA]
Oh, right!

125
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,791
Miss Eirote said something
about this before.

126
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,166
I always thought it
was a myth, though.

127
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,583
[ZEFIRIS] The enemy was
an intelligent life form,

128
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,083
but they were not human.

129
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,333
In our language,
they are called the HI.

130
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:31,166
The battle between humanity
and the HI dragged on.

131
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,000
And so, we Dragoons
were created by humanity

132
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,875
in order to fight the HI.

133
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,875
We are weapons of immense power

134
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,500
created to rival the
strength of the gods.

135
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,458
That is the reason
our kind were called

136
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,666
the Beasts of the Apocalypse.

137
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,458
[ZEFIRIS] Unfortunately,
there was a design flaw

138
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,291
in the artificial
intelligence that was

139
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,708
meant to control the
Dragoon's functions.

140
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,291
The AI was unable to
withstand complex programs.

141
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,291
This malfunction led to a series
of deadly mishaps in the field.

142
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,291
Out of 200 mass
production models,

143
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,875
174 became inoperative.

144
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,125
Heavy protection protocols
were implemented

145
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,416
in the 26 units that somehow
continued to function.

146
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,416
This protection included
a human pilot, a D-Knight,

147
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,083
who would oversee
our actions in combat.

148
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,666
Barring self-defense, we cannot
access 90% of our power

149
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,000
without D-Knight authorization.

150
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:29,625

[ZEFIRIS]
Wake up.

00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,541
[PACIFICA]
I'm listening, I'm listening.

153
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,791
In short, since we could no
longer function independently,

154
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,458
we were assigned to
fight in smaller battles.

155
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,333
It was then that the fully
autonomous Valkyrie-types,

156
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,250
an upgraded version
of a Dragoon,

157
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,166
were sent into combat.

158
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,541
But the Valkyries were
brainwashed by the enemy

159
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,000
and turned against us.

160
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,458

It was their betrayal that
led directly to our defeat.

166

Afterwards, the Peacemakers

humanity's administrators.

[PACIFICA]

170
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,416

171

But you can't!

178

The only reason that
I continued to function

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,583
was because you accepted me!

180
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,916
You aren't afraid of me.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,125
You trusted me and that's why

184

[BECKNAM]

you but I want you go on.

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You have to survive, Zefy.

188
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,708

your power to help

the distant future.

190
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,708
Lord Becknam! No! Don't go!

191
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,833
No! You can't die!

No... No...!

193
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,833
And so, I waited.

194
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,333
I have obeyed the orders
of my fallen master

195
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,708
and awaited the coming of the
ones I was meant to help.

196
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,458
But only because my
master wished it.

197
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,000
The being you encountered
at that lake earlier

198
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,583
was the pale shadow of a
Dragoon who had lost her master.

199
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,583
[ZEFIRIS]
I am unsure how to proceed.

200
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,750
I had thought of
you people as pawns.

201
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,708
You were merely tools
that I could use

202
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,541
to help me carry out my mission.

203
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,625
Even my brother Shannon?

204
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,250
However, for some reason, I
feel I am unable to ignore

205
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,916
the wishes of you
and your siblings.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,083
I have no explanation for it.

207
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,208
But it feels as if that would
mean betraying my master.

208
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,458
I am a weapon.
My power is immense.

209
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,416
I am capable of annihilating
many lives in an instant.

210
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,583
But I cannot act solely
on my own initiative.

211
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,750
That is why I have never made
a single decision by myself.

212
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,083
I lacked the authority to do so.

213
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,333
My master always decided
everything for me.

214
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,583
But now... he no longer exists.

215
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,708
[PACIFICA]
But wait,

216
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,500
isn't Shannon your
master now, Zefiris?

217
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,333
I do not believe that Shannon

218
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,208
will ever be able
to trust me again.

219
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,458
Pacifica Cassul, even when
you learned what I was,

220
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,791
you did not fear me.

221
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,708
You treated me the same
way my former master did.

222
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,250
You trusted me.

223
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,416
That is why I need you
to answer this question.

What should I do now, Pacifica?

who would do whatever
it takes to protect you,

230

sacrificing the lives of

[PACIFICA gasps]

320
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,625
We will return Shannon
to his old self.

321
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,833
[SENES] We need to
get out of here first!

322
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,666
[ZEFIRIS]
It would be too late by then.

323
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,500
Once he leaves this
interference field,

324
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,458
the brainwashing
can never be broken.

325
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,791
You can forget about him.

326
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,791
Your brother is of
no use to us now.

327
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,875
You just shut your mouth!

328
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,125
[PACIFICA]
Zefiris, what do I need to do?

329
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,708
The only thing you can
do is dive into his mind

330
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,458
and persuade him to come back.

331
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,333
But if you fail,
your consciousness

332
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,041
will be unable to return.

333
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,875
I'll be the one to go.

334
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,791
[ZEFIRIS] The brainwashing
centers around Pacifica Cassul.

335
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,416
Only she can do this.

336
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,833
What about you?

337
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,333
[ZEFIRIS]
Even though we can dive into

338
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,583
the consciousness of a human,
we cannot tamper with it.

339
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,083
Don't do this, Zefiris.

340
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,666
Make one mistake, and we'll
lost not only the Guardian,

341
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,333
but the Providence
Breaker as well.

342
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,791
Zefiris...

343
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,666
I'll do it.

344
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,750
But Pacifica...

345
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,583
All I want is for
Shannon to go back

346
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,416
to the way he was before this.

347
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,166
I may be the Providence Breaker
and he may be the D-Knight,

348
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,083
but none of that
makes any sense to me.

349
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,250
And I wish I didn't
know anything about it.

350
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,708
I didn't ask to be born
as the Scrapped Princess,

351
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,250
but I had no choice.

352
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,416
Helping out around the house,
marrying someone,

353
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
having children...
That's all I've ever wanted.

354
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,958
To grow old and be surrounded
by my grandchildren.

355
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,958
I wish it could've
been like that.

356
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,208
I wish no one had ever
told me all the secrets

357
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,666
about this world.

358
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,416
That way, nobody would
have ever had to suffer.

359
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,541
You may say that we're
sealed in this world,

360
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,250
but I can't wrap my
head around that.

361
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,791
And when you bring up
stuff from 5,000 years ago,

362
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,791
it doesn't make any sense to me.

363
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,666
But you two wanting to carry
out your dead masters' wishes,

364
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,625
that I can understand.

365
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,958
I understand that just fine.

366
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,458
But even if I do understand,

367
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,791
what does any of
that mean to us now?

368
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,208
I'm going.

369
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,583
[SHANNON] I swear, only you
could pull a stunt like this.

370

Getting into a fight to
the death with the chickens

371
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,166
over an omelet.

372
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,625
It seems like you've
been losing a lot lately.

Tell me the truth, Shannon.

I'm not really you and
Raquel's little sister, am I?

388
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,666
I mean, I'm the only
blonde one in the family.

389
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,083
And I heard some people in the
village talking about it, too.

390
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,750
What difference does that make?

You're still my sister
no matter what they say.

If those people in the village
wanna talk, then let them.
