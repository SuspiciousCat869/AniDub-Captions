00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,125
[LEO]
Miss Pacifica is...

2
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,791
...the Scrapped Princess...

3
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,625
[SHANNON]
You're awake.

4
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,083
It looks like you're
doing much better now.

5
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,083
You seem to be passed
the worst of it,

6
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,750
but it take it easy for a while.

7
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,041
Shouldn't the two of
you get some sleep?

8
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,083
A sick person doesn't need
to worry about others.

9
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,041
[RAQUEL] I'll bring you
something good to eat.

10
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,791
You have to build
up your strength.

11
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,125
[DOYLE] Looks like most of the
poison is out of your system.

12
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,583
You're healthy enough
to get out of bed now.

13
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,875
Just to be safe, take those
medicinal herbs one more time.

14
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,083
Sir Doyle...

15
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,208
You know, don't you? Who I am.

16
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,250
Yeah.

17
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,500
You left the Amber
Knights a long time ago

18
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,166
because of the
Scrapped Princess.

19
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,916
[DOYLE]
Yeah, that's right.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,333
I'm the man who threw you
into a ravine 15 years ago

21
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,416
when you were just a baby.

22
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,166
And I don't expect to be
forgiven after all this time

23
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,875
just because I healed you.

24
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,250
Go on, you don't
have to hold back.

25
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,041
I'm sure there's plenty
you'd like to say to me.

26
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,250
I'm very sorry...

27
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,416
[PACIFICA I guess I turned your
life upside down, didn't I?

28
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,375
Sorry about that...

29
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,916
So you're apologizing?

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,541
But why? I'm the man
who tried to kill you.

31
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,958
How is it that a girl like you,
after all you've been through,

32
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,791
can be so strong?

33
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,833
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

34
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,541
[DOYLE]
Deep down, I was terrified.

35
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,083
I thought that fighting
for my ideal of justice

36
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,416
meant that I had to
crush any other justice

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,958
that seemed to threaten it.

38
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,458
I was afraid that one day,

39
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,125
I would make a
mistake so horrible

40
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,000
that it could never be undone.

41
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,958
I was so frightened, I ran away.

42
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,125
But you...

43
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,708
I appreciate your concern,

44
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,166
but your words of apology
are enough for me.

45
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,708
You already carry the
burden of a cruel destiny,

46
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,958
and if you were to shoulder
the sins of my past,

47
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,916
then I couldn't go on
living as a human being.

48
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,708
Sir Doyle...

49
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,166
[RAQUEL] Are you sure we can't
give you a ride home, Sir Doyle?

50
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,458
[DOYLE] Thank you, but I'll
take my time and walk back.

51
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,041
[SHANNON]
Thank you for your help.

52
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,291
[DOYLE]
Just make sure to survive this.

53
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,000
That's all I can
really say to you.

54
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,333
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,750
No matter what.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,750
--[snap]
--[LEO] Huh?

57
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:47,958
[PACIFICA yells]

58
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,916
Be careful! That's dangerous!

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,750
Sure it was, but your guard
was completely down, Leo.

60
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,875
You'll never make it as a knight
if you can't sense an attack.

61
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,875
[PACIFICA] Here, take a look!
I'm feeling perfectly fine now!

62
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,458
Although, don't you think
it was a little cold of you

63
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,416
not to visit me even once?

64
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,791
[LEO]
Well...

65
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,208
I see now!

66
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,375
Your words of love and
devotion to me were all lies!

67
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,375
You were toying with
my heart, weren't you?!

68
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,666
But I wasn't!
It's just... that I...

69
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,416
Don't worry, I know.

70
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,458
[LEO]
Huh?

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,166
Thank you, Leo. And I don't
just mean for getting me herbs.

72
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,041
Travelling all this way with
you has been a lotta fun.

73
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,625
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about me.

74
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,208
I wasn't trying to deceive you,

75
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,708
it's just hard to tell
people who I am.

76
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,208
So I'm sorry.

77
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,833
Where's Leo?

78
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't know. But his
horse is gone, too.

79
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,625
I see...

80
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,166
[SHANNON]
The next time we run into him,

81
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,625
we're gonna have
to be on our guard.

82
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,750
He might take a swing
at you outta the blue.

83
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,291
[PACIFICA]
But, Shannon!

84
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,333
Now that he's found out that
you're the Scrapped Princess,

85
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,708
anything is possible.

86
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,458
What're you saying?! Leo
would never do such a thing!

87
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,916
Anybody we meet can turn on
us, no matter who they are!

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,875
I don't want a repeat of what
happened yesterday, understand?!

89
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,083
Ah, it's you.

90
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,208
Sir Barrett, wait!

91
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:36,291
I... I don't know what
I'm supposed to do now...

92
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,666
If Miss Pacifica
truly is the poison

93
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,500
that will destroy the world,
then as a knight, I should...

94
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,791
And yet--

95
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,291
[DOYLE] I'm not a knight
anymore. I'm a doctor.

96
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,833
I'm not here to sort out
your doubts for you.

97
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,708
A doctor swears an oath to
help people no matter what,

98
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,958
even if his patient
is vicious or evil.

99
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,958
Of course, you might be killed
the instant you save them.

100
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,791
You talked of chivalry.

101
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,666
You described it as
wielding your sword

102
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,500
in the name of justice.

103
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:09,291
If that's true, then your
duty is to cut off her head.

104
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,916
That should earn you a
medal, at the very least.

105
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,083
That's the nature of
the path you've chosen.

106
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,791
[PACIFICA]
What d'you suppose

107
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,833
the Scrapped Princess
really is anyway?

108
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:23,875
[SHANNON]
Hmm?

109
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,333
I wonder how many people
will end up being hurt

110
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,958
because I'm alive.

111
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,875
[FORSYTH]
Say, Christopher,

112
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,708
if my little sister
is really still alive,

113
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,708
do you suppose that
she would look like me?

114
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,625
Yes, she would.

115
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,375
The poison that will
destroy the world...

116
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,833
What do you suppose that
revelation meant, exactly?

117
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,291
[CHRIS]
I'm not sure.

118
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,500
If it got out that
she was still alive,

119
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,833
I suppose there would be another
royal edict for her death.

120
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,875
I'm sure that our mother is
worried about her as well.

121
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,750
Are you referring to the queen?

122
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,750
Of course, I haven't seen my
mother in quite some time.

123
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,833
[door opens]

124
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,375
[FORSYTH]
Father!

125
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,375
I'm speaking with a
friend at the moment.

126
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,833
[KING]
Who is that with you?

127
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,166
Lift your face.

128
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,416
[CHRIS]
Yes, Sire.

129
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,625
My name is Christopher
Bairach, Your Majesty.

130
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,750
I am at your service.

131
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,166
Bairach's adopted son. Hmm...

132
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,125
Surprising, isn't it?

133
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,541
It's always been that way
between my father and me.

134
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,916
It's sad, but my
father hates me.

135
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,791
I was thinking, that assassin
with the instrument...

136
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,541
You mean the Silencer?

137
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,375
[PACIFICA] Do you think
he'll try to attack us again?

138
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,875
I don't think so.

139
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,291
He finally played nice and
agreed to withdraw back there.

140
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,000
Please don't tell me how you
got that guy to play nice.

141
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,791
It'll turn my stomach.

142
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,083
Who the heck is that?

143
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,333
Shannon.

144
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,208
[PACIFICA]
Hmm?

145
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,291
[GALIL]
Step forward, zguardians.

146
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,666
[SHANNON]
What the...?

147
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,208
What am I doing?
What's happening?

148
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:35,291
[SHANNON] This guy... This
guy's no ordinary human!

149
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,125
[GALIL]
It's futile.

150
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,958
I, Galil the Peacemaker,

151
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,458
have decided to get
personally involved.

152
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,458
It will not be like
the last time.

153
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,833
[SHANNON]
Like last time?

154
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,041
[SHANNON] He was the one
responsible for that?!

155
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,125
[PACIFICA]
Hey, Shannon?

156
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,875
[GALIL]
Scrapped Princess, do not move.

157
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,333
I will force these two to
kill each other if I must.

158
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:13,250
Humans have no choice but
to obey me. This is the law.

159
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,625
This is how it was and
how it always shall be.

160

[PACIFICA]
Big Brother?! Big Sister?!

[LEO screams]

162
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,250
[LEO] Damn it! Damn it!
What good is justice?!

163
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,375
What's the point of chivalry?!

164
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,333
[PACIFICA]
Shannon?! Raquel?!

165
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,500
Miss Pacifica...

166
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,583
Leo, I need you to help me fi--

167
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,083
[KEYDARF]
Silence.

168
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,375
That was the language of their
love for each other, huh?

169
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,791
How dull.

170
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,083
The Silencer!

171
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,291
[KEYDARF]
Well, well.

172
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,291
What were you doing with
that sword just now?

173
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,791
That young lady
next to you there

174
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,125
is the poison that
will destroy the world.

175
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,500
You weren't about to kill her
by chopping her in half,

176
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,708
now were you, boy?

177
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,916
Be quiet! I was just--

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,666
Your name's Silencer,
that right?

179
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,250
[KEYDARF]
Hmm?

180
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,250
[PACIFICA] Can bugs also be able
to be used to look for people?

181
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,541
[KEYDARF]
Uh... Well, yeah. I suppose.

182
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,000
[PACIFICA]
Will you make a deal?

183
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,916
[KEYDARF]
Hmm? What deal?

184
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,833
[PACIFICA]
I'll give you one of my hands.

185
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,500
Then you'll be able to collect
the bounty on me, am I right?

186
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,125
Miss Pacifica.

187
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,666
So you're saying that
you'll give me one of hands

188
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,291
if I agree to let you go
and say that I killed you?

189
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,458
[PACIFICA]
No, I'm not.

190
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,500
[KEYDARF]
Hm?

191
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,375
I said that I wanted to deal.

192
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll agree to give you one
of my hands, however...

193
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,333
...in return for that,

194
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,875
you have to promise me
that you'll use your bugs

195
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,500
to find out where my brother
and sister have been taken.

196
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,958
You want me to what?

197
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:23,333
Leo. Can I ask a favor?
One last thing?

198
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:25,708
[PACIFICA]
Cut it off.

199
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,166
[gasps]

200
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,666
Please, Leo! Quickly!

201
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,000
I just watched Raquel and
Shannon get kidnapped.

202
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,291
This is all I can really do
to try and help them now.

203
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,250
I'm in a hurry.

00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,041
[PACIFICA]
Please, Leo.

205
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,791
[LEO]
I won't.

206
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,208
I don't carry a sword in
order to do things like that.

207
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,541
A sword-- My sword...

208
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:30,208
...isn't used for cutting
down innocent people!

209
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,125
[KEYDARF sighs]

210

[KEYDARF]
Um...

211
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,250
Hey, look, I think there's been
a little misunderstanding here.

212
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,541
I know when to cut my
losses and call it quits.

213
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,458
Well, to be perfectly frank,
I sort of enjoy living.

214
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,416
And I don't relish the idea of
your siblings coming after me

215
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,250
for revenge because I hurt you.

216
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,541
But I have to find out
where he took them!

217
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,541
I'll help, but I'll do
it without the deal.

218
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,041
[PACIFICA]
Huh?

219
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,833
The maiden offers her hand,
the knight his life,

220
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,625
and the poet will offer his
soul in return, like this.

Fly, my eyes and ears!

[GALIL]
Lord Browning.

225
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,666
Here, in one of the fortresses
your kind was so proud of,

226
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,625
your last hope will
be extinguished.

227
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,375
Without her guardians,

228
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,208
I expect that the humans will
exterminate the lawbreaker.

229
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:37,208
[GALIL] Hmph. A relic from
the ancient world, huh?

230
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,250
What can a mere
bug do against me?

231
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,708
[ZEFIRIS]
Your disdain and contempt

232
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,583
for absolutely
everything but yourself

233
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,500
is what makes you a fool.

234
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,125
[KEYDARF]
Looks like they found them.

235
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,791
This one will show you the
way, so follow him close.

236
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:03,125
Thank you so much,
old man Silencer!

237
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,750
[KEYDARF]
Huh?

238
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,291
Old Man?

239
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,916
[GALIL]
I see now...

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,291
You tapped into the bug's
communications net,

241
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,833
didn't you, Zefiris?

242
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,083
[ZEFIRIS] The only one who
may call me by that name

243
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,166
is my D-Knight master.

244
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,958
A second-rate product like you

245
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,250
has no right to call
me by that name.

246
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,041
[GALIL]
A second-rate product you say?

247
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,541
Don't push me.

He's over there! Hurry!

Leo?

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,625
What're you doing, Leo?
What's wrong with you?

253
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,750

Second class divine retribution

[LEO]
It's no use... I can't.

257
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:12,250
I can't do it. I can't disobey
my master's wishes.

258
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,875
What's wrong with you? That's
nothing but a stupid monster!

259
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,958
It's hopeless! I can't fight
against something like that!

[LEO]
Miss Pacifica...

263
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,958
[GALIL] I realize that
you had been planning

264
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,166
to turn one of these guardians
into your new master,

265
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,208
but unfortunately for you, they
are under the rule of my law.

266
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,666
You have no hope of winning.

267
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,416
[PACIFICA]
Big Brother!

268

Big Sister!

269

[SHANNON] Does this mean...
that I can't protect her...?

270
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,416
[SHANNON]
He's just too powerful...

271
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,916
There's nothing I can
do to stop him...

272
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,708
[ZEFIRIS] Did you not
swear to protect her?

273
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:17,625
[SHANNON] You're right.
I swore I would protect her.

274
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,333
I promised that I would
protect her against anything

275
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,166
that tried to take
her away from us.

276
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,291
I want power...
The power to save her...

277
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,791
Enough power to change destiny.

278
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,333
Power to fight,

279
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:35,041
even if it makes the whole world
and god himself my enemy.

280
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,458
[ZEFIRIS]
If that is truly your will,

281
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,291
then I shall obey my chosen one.

Though it be temporary,

00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:46,500
I recognize thee as fit to be
my controller, the D-Knight.

Protect our little sister.

[ZEFIRIS] I'm a weapon sent
to you from a time long past

00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,333
to help you in your struggle
to protect your sister.

The last dragon,

hidden in a fold of the
fabric of space and time,

304
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,500
I have survived all these
years in order to aid you

305
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,208
once you possessed
the will to fight god.

306
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,708
The will to fight god?

307
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,708
But I don't understand.
All we did was...

308
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,000
[ZEFIRIS]
For now, that does not matter.

309
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,083
But know this: I am not
completely restored.

310
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,541
I have yet to regain
my full power.

311
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,583
The time I can spend
in this world is limited.

312
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:15,500
Also, I cannot interfere
in quarrels between humans.

313
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,250
I am not omnipotent
by any means.

314
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,541
However, when the
time comes for you

315
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,958
to fight the three
remaining Peacemakers,

316
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,375
and when you are finally ready
to fight the lord god Mauser,

317
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,958
you may call upon me.

318
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,500
Call my true name,

319
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,458
the one only my master
is allowed to speak.

320
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,291
Call Zefiris.

321
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,833
Zefiris.

322
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,416
[ZEFIRIS]
When that time comes,

323
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,250
I will become the blade
of D-Knight Shannon Cassul

324
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,458
and slay thine enemies.

325
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,291
A D-Knight?

326
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,708
[ZEFIRIS]
I have been waiting patiently

327
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,458
for more than 5,000 years

328
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,000
to assist you in your
struggle with god.

329
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,458
But I...

330
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:56,125
[ZEFIRIS] Until we meet again...
my temporary master.

331
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,083
[PACIFICA]
Big Brother?

332
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,875
What is she?

333
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,333
What is she... the
Scrapped Princess?

334
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,208
[LEO]
I was thinking...

335
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,875
I might go back to Taurus
and stay there for a while.

336
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,125
[SHANNON] Thanks for everything
you've done for her.

337
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,791
[RAQUEL]
We'll miss you a lot, Leo.

338
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:28,166
Miss Pacifica. My heart
is still very troubled.

339
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,083
I just don't know
whether chivalry is real

340
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,541
or if it's only some
sort of illusion.

341
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,583
However, I still want to
believe there is a justice

342
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,041
that everyone can have faith in.

343
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,958
But once I find the
answer to that question,

344
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,083
then that justice might force
me to become your enemy.

345
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,708
That's okay. I don't mind.

346
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,541
Until we meet again.

347
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,583
Till then.

348
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,166
[LEO]
Hyah!

349
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,083
[KEYDARF]
Those who are pursued,

350
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,583
and those who go off
in pursuit of something,

351
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,708
they both part ways.

352
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,833
And yet... And yet...

353
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,041
Hmm...

354
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,750
That was sort of lame.
So much for poetry.

355
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,916
[RAQUEL] Shannon comes
across a little girl

356
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,458
just standing in the rain.

357
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,708
The poor thing has no memories
of where she came from

358
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,541
except that her name is Cz.

359
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,500
This looks like it will be a
melancholy, rain-soaked story.

360
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,333
Next time on <i>Scrapped Princess,</i>

361
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,500
"Waltz of the Abandoned
Dog of a Girl."

362
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,750
See you next time!
