00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.442
[MINATO]
Welcome to Deca‐dence.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:26.318
As you surely know,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.738
we Gears have spent centuries
locked in brutal warfare,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.448
to protect what little we have

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.160
from the beasts
known as the Gadoll.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.372
But the fight is a tough one.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.541
Resources are always scarce.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:43.460
Soldiers are hard to find
and harder to keep.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:46.505
You have my personal thanks
for joining up.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.131
And on behalf of The Power.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:49.925
Glad to have you aboard.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.844
Now stand fast and
lend me your strength.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:53.845
And the day will come

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.975
when the sun rises over
a world free of the Gadoll.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.459
There's a battle?

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.713
[KABURAGI]
Jill! What's going on here?

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:28.964
[JILL]
More specifically?

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:30.841
[KABURAGI] I thought there
wasn't any fighting right now.

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.217
[JILL]
All the emergency maintenance

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.177
isn't exactly good for business.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.221
Obviously the company's
gonna be trying to get back

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.849
to normal gameplay ASAP.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.395
[KABURAGI]
Incursion?

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.963
[RANDOM TANKER A]
They're here!

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:33.964
What, again?

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.216
Hold the line and
don't let them get through!

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.393
What in the hell have they done?

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.440
Easy.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.482
[RANDOM TANKER E]
Incoming!

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.776
[KURENAI] So you brought
the whole crew, huh?

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.695
You're still gonna die!

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:02.951
Oh shit!

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.330
[KURENAI]
Five of 'em broke through!

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.790
Get 'em!

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.878
They got through. Not good!

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.307
[TANKER]
Let me through!

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.146
Hey! Calm down, morons!

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.815
[RANDOM TANKER F]
It's coming!

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.192
[RANDOM TANKER G]
Run!

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.863
Come at me!

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.119
Damn garbage newb body!

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.877
The hell?

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.046
Oh no.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.519
Yeah. Good job, me.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.897
Wait. Natsume?

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.316
Are you okay?

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.110
Mm. Thanks, nice lady!

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.196
Always happy to help!

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.697
[TANKER B]
We can't thank you enough.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.241
[TANKER GIRL]
Bye‐bye, miss!

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.535
[NATSUME]
Bye‐bye.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.211
‐‐When you were‐‐
‐‐[MINDY] Natsume!

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:37.712
There you are. You okay?

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:38.672
[NATSUME]
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.423
We've cleared out
the tank's interior.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.842
They need us at the hole.

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:42.676
And hurry!

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.261
We can't let any
more of 'em through!

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.846
Got it!

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.769
[GEAR C]
Oh yeah!

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.188
[GEAR A] Yeesh. Got a
little dicey there for a minute.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.274
It's more fun when
the stakes are higher.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.692
[RANDOM TANKER I]
Over here quick!

00:05:58.733 --> 00:05:59.526
[RANDOM TANKER J]
We need a doctor.

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:01.987
I can't stop the bleeding!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.947
[INJURED SOLDIER A]
It hurts!

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:05.532
[INJURED SOLDIER B]
Please just end it.

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:08.577
[RANDOM TANKER L]
That thing that shot the spines.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.876
I can't reach him
from this account.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.840
[MINATO]
Sitrep?

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.675
Tank and breach clear.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:26.094
Tanker casualties still TBD.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.220
[MINATO] If you can spare
me a few minutes,

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.264
I could use a smoke.

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:30.515
Yes, sir.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.610
[KABURAGI] I see your favorite
vape spot hasn't changed.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:42.569
[MINATO]
Who's there?

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:46.781
And more importantly, how did
you get access to this area?

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.117
[KABURAGI] Somebody
talked 'em outta scrapping me.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.786
Figure it musta been you.
Thanks for that.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.247
Huh? Kaburagi?

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.041
How did you get an account?

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.375
Fell off a truck?

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.752
[MINATO]
Yeah, I get ya.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.463
So how's life in corrections?

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.342
What's that hole
in the tank about?

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.636
It's set dressing.
What else would it be?

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:14.225
Plus, it was the cheapest way
to implement a new quest line.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.769
Not a very good trade.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.105
The "endangered species"
feature for a single quest line.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.357
There are almost
more Tankers now

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.150
than the tank can hold.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.235
You've been there
enough to know.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.863
Their population can't keep
growing like it is forever.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.365
If we just let it go,

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.575
they're going to hit
a saturation point.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.786
Exposing them to the
Gadoll is the cleanest way

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:37.666
to keep their numbers
under control.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.543
I'm not sure why you've
gotten so attached to them.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.462
They're just humans, right?

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:46.967
After all the time
we've known each other,

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:51.680
I should've known better than
to think I had you figured out.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:55.600
But honestly, you're a
lot more fun because of that.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:56.726
Look, Minato.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:57.894
Listen to me.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:01.147
Every pit you step in,
you start digging deeper.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.942
Sooner or later, I'm not gonna
be able to pull you out.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:09.864
I understand.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.660
I'll try not to make things
any harder for you.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.294
[MINATO] Only promise I can
make is: I'll do what I can.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:34.180
[JILL] So, Kaburagi, could you
not waltz into restricted zones

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.057
and announce yourself to staff?

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.976
If the game cops
catch wind of you there,

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.020
it's gonna be an issue.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:40.937
[KABURAGI]
Understood.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.939
[JILL] And if you
could log out by sundown?

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.607
So they don't notice
your spoofed account

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.943
and trace it back to our
unauthorized terminals?

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:49.446
That'd be great, thanks.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:55.368
Dammit.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.786
I have to do something!

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:13.428
I have to do something to help.

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:21.686
[NATSUME]
Hey, Boss.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.146
Don't worry about Pipe.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.940
He's fine, and I promise
I'll take great care of him

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.192
while you're away!

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:32.072
So come find me as
soon as you get back, okay?

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.416
[KURENAI] They really
got us good this time.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.502
Is there any way
we can close that up?

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.587
[REPAIRER A] It's no
big trick technical‐wise.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:50.006
But we're shorthanded
and it's a lotta hole to patch,

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.176
so it's safe to say it'd have
to be a long‐term job.

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.052
And until it's done,

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.930
any Gadoll small enough
to fit can stroll right in.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.641
Which means,
working on it is a deathtrap.

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.309
[REPAIRER A] We should be
able to divert enough plating

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.645
from the recycling line
to fill the gap.

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:07.107
But we're gonna need more outer
wall repair kits to patch it.

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.900
So we're short on everything.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.652
People, resources, and time.

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:11.778
Well that's it then.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.238
See ya when we're dead, guys.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.864
Shut it, Mendy.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.700
[REPAIRER A] Believe me,
I know how bad this deal is.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.744
I'm here lookin'
at it same as you are.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.164
This is a way bigger repair
than we're equipped for.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.835
Uh, hey.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.753
Huh?

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.589
Oh! Uh. Don't the
Tanker house repair kits

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.467
have smaller amounts of
the same basic materials?

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:35.510
Yeah, that's true,

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:38.012
it's the same stuff
at the end of the day,

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.807
but we'd need an awful lot
of 'em for a job that size.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.768
But every house has one, so if
we could collect them all‐‐

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.853
All of them?

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.606
You're right; that would be
enough materials to get it done,

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.234
but getting 'em all together
is a whole 'nother issue.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:54.487
And there's still
the manpower problem.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:57.991
We've got even more people
than repair kits, right?

00:10:58.032 --> 00:10:59.325
She's not wrong.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.371
True enough, there's
a lot of bodies in here.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.582
Except, will they all go along?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:06.708
Of course, they won't.

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.251
Think for a sec, Nats.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.752
Everyone is scared to death.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.462
Nobody's gonna wanna leave home.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.715
Yeah, true, and there's
no way they're willing

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.674
to start taking orders

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:17.177
from a bunch of suicidal
adrenaline junkies.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.469
Hey, screw you, buddy!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.221
I mean that's how they see us!

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.600
Ugh... Please tell me
somebody brought booze.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.562
Where're you going?

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.981
Even if everyone won't help,
some people will.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.983
I'm gonna go try
and track 'em down!

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:44.704
[BUTCHER BOSS]
Hey! That's not where that goes!

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:45.914
Take it around back!

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.290
[BUTCHER A]
Sorry, sir!

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.374
'Scuse me.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.210
[BUTCHER BOSS]
There, shore up that wall!

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.961
It needs another plate!

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.671
C'mon, get with it, people!

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.465
Just a moment please, sir?

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.591
[BUTCHER BOSS]
What are you doing,

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.927
reinforce that pillar already!

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.387
Hey, sir! Got a sec?

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:02.222
[BUTCHER D]
Who was that?

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.640
[BUTCHER E]
She sees we're working, right?

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.141
Natsume?

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.684
[BUTCHER BOSS]
No. Who are you?

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.437
[NATSUME]
Uh. My name is Natsume.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.439
You seem like the one
in charge here.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.149
And what if I am?

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:17.028
I'm looking for a way to seal up
that giant hole in the Tank.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.988
It's not gonna
be easy to pull off.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.865
I hope the butchers
can lend a hand.

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.284
Please help me out!

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.536
[BUTCHER BOSS]
Huh?

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:29.415
Not sure how you missed it, but
we got our own work to do here.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.668
You being around doesn't help.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.044
As long as that hole stays open,

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.463
the Gadoll attacks are only
gonna get worse!

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:39.509
We have to fix this,
and I know‐‐

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.679
Everybody's trying to do their
part right now, young miss.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.596
But I'm sorry.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.890
That's all we can manage.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.106
[FEI]
Hey! What are you doing here?

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:54.607
[NATSUME]
Fei?

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.484
I need a favor from you.

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.403
We're trying to
get that big hole

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.862
in the outer armor sealed up.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.614
And if the butchery
workers will help us out,

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.158
I really think
we can make it work!

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.034
You're crazy.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:08.496
Anyone who goes up there is
an easy target for the Gadoll.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:12.750
It's too much, sorry.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.712
It might not work.

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:18.840
And you're right,
it'll be a dangerous.

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:21.718
But I can't give up
without at least trying.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.012
I know we'll lose more people.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.014
Any of us could be next.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.974
It could be me,
or one of my squadmates,

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.143
or someone I grew up with.

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:35.648
I want to protect all these
people, but I can't do it alone.

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:38.735
I'm begging you, Fei.

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:40.862
Help me!

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.905
[FEI]
Hmm...

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.240
Please just stop.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.868
You're always like this.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.411
I'm not like you.

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:51.122
I can't put on
a brave face right now.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.291
I saw so many people die.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.626
Just being out here scares me.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.046
How can I go up there
where they are?

00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.547
I trust the Gears.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.507
They'll protect us.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.051
All right?

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:05.345
Sorry, but I can't help.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:09.182
[NATSUME]
Listen.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.850
People change.

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.686
I finally figured out
that what I wanted

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:15.688
was to change myself.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.691
I was so tired of feeling
weak and helpless.

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:22.070
That's why I became a soldier.

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.364
I wouldn't call myself strong.

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.741
But I'm stronger than before.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.409
[FEI]
Hmph...

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.828
That's the part I can't stand.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.082
I was happy.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:35.708
Going to the market with you.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.127
Sharing our lunches.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.962
It didn't seem that bad,

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.507
just living my life
peacefully in here.

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.636
Having my friends and a place
to stay was everything I needed.

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:48.805
Fei.

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:50.890
[FEI]
But you wanted more.

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:52.225
And every time
you talked about it,

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:56.145
I felt like I was wrong
for being happy.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.439
And I couldn't handle it.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:06.072
Fei. I'm sorry.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.284
If you can spare a repair kit,
then please,

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.662
bring it to the cafeteria.

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:13.996
Goodbye.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.044
Ugh. Nerd.

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:48.156
You're back!

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.575
Where'd you run off to?

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.368
I tried talking to everyone
I could think of,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.078
and here's what I got.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:57.540
Where did all this‐‐?

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:58.374
Oh come on,

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.918
you didn't think we were gonna
let you do all the work, right?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.629
So we got together and
managed to scrounge these up.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.466
Though I'm betting
we've still got a ways to go.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:09.510
[BUTCHER BOSS]
This the place?

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:10.678
Seems that way.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.096
[BUTCHER F]
Hey there.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.806
[NATSUME]
You guys.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.600
Uh. Hi, sir.

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:16.767
[BUTCHER BOSS clears throat]

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:17.977
Like I said.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.645
Everybody has their
own part to play

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.230
in keeping this town alive.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:23.649
But we've got choices too.

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:26.360
There's more to doing
your part than doing your job.

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.571
You can count us in.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.364
Thank you, that's a huge help.

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:33.201
Where'd all that passion
go from before?

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.494
Well, anyway.

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.120
We rounded up a few extra.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.747
‐‐Sure did.
‐‐All for you.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.165
Thanks!

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.458
[SHOPKEEPER]
Hey, kid.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.252
I try to avoid doing enough
work to break a sweat,

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.254
so I want you to know that
sending all these pretty girls

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.673
to ask me for help
was a dirty trick.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.432
Fei!

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.309
Hey. Easy, Natsume!

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:00.895
[FENNEL]
Guys. We can do this thing!

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.313
[BUTCHER BOSS]
Didn't you transfer inside

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.023
to get out of armor repair?

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.066
[FENNEL]
Low blow, dude!

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:09.195
[laughter]

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.553
[OPERATOR A]
Commander.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:36.389
The breach in the oxyone tank
appears to be under repair.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.641
Already? Did they
push up the schedule?

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:41.352
No, sir, same schedule,
but it looks like the Tankers

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.020
have begun fixing it
on their own.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.397
[MINATO]
No way.

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:45.565
What should we do, sir?

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:47.692
[MINATO]
Nothing. Leave them to it.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.611
I can't picture them affecting
something on this scale.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.113
[OPERATOR A]
Yes, sir.

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.906
Why are they bothering?

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:00.580
I'm so tired.

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.707
But you look like
you're lovin' that, Pipe.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:03.791
Are you lovin' it?

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.418
Is it tasty?

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.714
A Gear? Why are you here?

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.010
'Scuze me. Uh...

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.304
[gasps] I can scream real loud!

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:19.932
Uh! Sorry!
I was just... Hold on.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.559
Start over.

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.352
Got some milk!

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:24.562
Want some?

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.439
I'm good. Thank you.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.608
You love milk. You sure?

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.321
Uh. No. I heard you love milk.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:34.405
Kabu said it.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:35.865
You talked to him?

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.867
Then do you know
where he is right now?

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.243
Um. Uh‐huh.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.328
[NATSUME]
Omygosh.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:43.331
Can you please tell me
how to reach him?

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:46.083
Things are kinda
complicated for him, so...

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.668
I need to know!

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.545
Can you at least
tell me if he's okay?

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.756
Well, uh, he isn't hurt.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.260
Pipe, stop!

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:01.599
Come on. Don't... pounce.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:05.936
Ahh....
Settle down there, buddy. Yeesh.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.191
Hey. I said settle down,
all right?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.903
Here.

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.321
[NATSUME]
Uh... Listen.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:16.572
His name is Pipe and he's not‐‐

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:17.448
It's okay.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.576
I promise, I'm not gonna
tell anyone you've got him.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:29.960
Ahh! Man, that is good!

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:30.795
Here.

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.713
Oh, thanks, but I...

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:39.804
[KABURAGI]
That's nice.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:41.430
[NATSUME]
You hadn't had it before?

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:42.640
[KABURAGI]
No.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:43.849
[NATSUME] Well, when
you see the boss again,

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.769
maybe you can
talk him into trying it.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:47.728
I always tried,

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.231
but he's way too stubborn
to listen to me.

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:52.817
No alcohol, no cigarettes,
not even milk.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.068
He never cracked a smile

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.445
'cause he's allergic
to fun or something.

00:19:56.487 --> 00:19:58.823
So what?
Does having fun really matter?

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.574
[NATSUME]
Yeah, it matters a ton!

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.077
Everybody needs stuff
that makes them happy,

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.371
like having a drink
of milk with a friend!

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:06.872
I don't think you
can even call it living

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.999
if you don't have
any fun in your life.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.585
I mean you'd just be
circulating air.

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:14.046
What's that face?

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:14.964
[NATSUME]
Hold on.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.841
What did I say that was funny?

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.384
[KABURAGI]
Nothing.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.970
You know, it's kind
of a weird feeling.

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:24.807
I just met you, but somehow
it's making me nostalgic,

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:28.352
sitting out here and
talking with you like this.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:29.353
Hey, look.

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.021
About Kaburagi.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.274
[NATSUME]
It's fine.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.609
Like you said,
things are complicated.

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:38.028
For him, it must be worse.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.405
There have to be a lot of people

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.782
who could use someone
like him right now.

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.701
I would think most of us could.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.288
Lemme ask you.

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:49.749
Are you just like that?

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.792
You're hell‐bent on
sealing up that hole.

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.502
I mean, if it'd been me
dealing with it,

00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:55.004
you'd be screwed.

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:57.548
I would've given up just
like everyone else did.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.593
You're the only one
who kept up the fight.

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:02.678
Come on, they all came around.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.763
Because of you.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:07.224
The same way
Kaburagi came around.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.310
Things aren't
gonna be easy for you,

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.896
but I think
you can tough it out.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.106
What I came to say is tha‐‐

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:20.571
I'm trying to be as
strong a person as him.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:24.450
And I realize that
I'm nowhere close right now.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.702
But if my spirit broke...

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:29.121
If I couldn't hold
onto hope anymore,

00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:31.081
I don't think
I could keep going.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.793
I can't live for nothing.

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:35.377
Even when the boss went away,

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:38.422
I kept telling myself he would
come back any day now,

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:39.673
and there's a part
of me still thinking

00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:44.303
he's just gonna show up
and fix everything.

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:47.431
But I know he's
probably not coming back.

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:51.560
You don't need to try
and make it easier.

00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:53.729
He tried to tell me
the night before.

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.439
That the war would never end,

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:59.068
and we'd never
escape the Gadoll.

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:00.653
And that's why.

00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:02.363
I have to keep on pushing.

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:05.366
I gotta be strong.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:08.077
I have to!

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:11.914
I can't just give up and
let everyone die, right?

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:14.625
I have to fight!

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:24.844
All of this will fall
before I'm through.

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:38.482
[BUG A]
Woo yeah!

00:22:38.524 --> 00:22:40.568
[BUG B]
Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:41.652
[SARKOZY]
Kabu's here!

00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:43.696
You're a few drinks late,
brother! Bottoms up!

00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:46.073
Came back pretty quick
for your first session.

00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:49.201
You really oughta take your time
and savor the sensation.

00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:51.203
How many times have I told you?

00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:52.663
You're logging in with
hacked accounts, guys.

00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:55.416
We gotta be discrete,
or we're gonna get caught.

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:58.669
Did you manage to accomplish
whatever you were going for?

00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:00.546
Stimulating conversation
with your pet‐‐

00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:01.672
[KABURAGI]
Donatello.

00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.549
You're all about parties,
am I right?

00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:04.592
Yeah?

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.385
Where's this goin'?

00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:08.762
[KABURAGI]
I'm about to throw a real rager.

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:10.139
You wanna come?

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.684
Huh... You know I would
be down anytime, pal,

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:16.020
but I'm gonna kick
your ass if it's lame.

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:18.981
Aw, you didn't tell me ya had
a birthday coming up, Kabu!

00:23:19.023 --> 00:23:20.190
Hey, jackass!

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:24.320
Just tell us what kinda party,
so we can tell you why it sucks.

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:27.948
Destroying every last Gadoll
and finishing the game.

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.118
Wow!

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.202
You hear that?

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.663
We're gonna wipe out
the Gadoll, guys!

00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:37.666
They oughta toss this
loony in the bug house!

[BUG D]
His mind's gone!

00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:45.591
How do we do that?

00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:50.804
[DONATELLO]
Hmm?

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:56.143
[KABURAGI]
We take out the Gadoll factory.
