WEBVTT

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:16.016
[NATSUME]
Pipe!

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.935
Hey, Pipe!

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.979
Where'd you go? Come on!

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.898
[KABURAGI]
Hey!

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.066
[NATSUME]
You're here!

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.359
Sorry, Boss.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.444
Pipe's in danger 'cause of me.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:30.030
The fight is about to get bad
and spill into this cave.

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:32.115
You need to get
back to Deca‐dence.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.952
But it's my fault Pipe's
trapped down here.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.828
[KABURAGI] You're not
ready for this battle.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.832
Yeah? Then what have I been
training for all of this time?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.103
Come on, Pipe.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.064
We gotta get you outta here!

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.940
[shrieks]

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.446
Huh?

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.740
Get dead! Bring it!

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:37.949
Yeah.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.911
[GEAR B]
Damn, bro, that was a nice shot!

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.704
[GEAR A]
Don't slow down, we gotta‐‐

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.457
[GEAR B]
Oh damn, bro!

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:10.357
[pants]

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.608
[KABURAGI]
Calm down.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.943
Take deep breaths.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.361
First thing to do
when you're panicked

00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:16.780
is get control
of your breathing.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:20.117
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:31.628
Yeah, got it.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.422
Thanks, Boss.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.534
[NATSUME]
I can see it. I can see it!

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.703
Dammit. We've
barely made a dent!

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.872
As soon as you kill one
another takes its place!

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.832
[RYOKU]
Hold up. Look there.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.504
[SOU]
That's a Tanker, isn't it?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.718
Huuuh...

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.018
[KABURAGI]
Move!

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.711
[NATSUME]
Pipe!

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.130
Aw, Pipe.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.424
Thank goodness you're okay.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.969
[NATSUME]
You seem pretty happy about it.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:04.471
[rumbling]

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:06.097
[GEAR K]
That noise.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.312
What is that?

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.439
‐‐You stay put.
‐‐Oh shit!

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.066
‐‐There's no way.
‐‐[GEAR E] Watch out!

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.652
[TANKER D] It's heading
for Deca‐dence. Follow it!

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.697
Eat this!

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.617
Yeah, you show 'em, Mindy!

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.118
Did we mop everything up?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.121
Huh? Hey, what's that?

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:32.833
Commander, look!

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.209
Incoming!

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.796
Huh?! Get out of its way!

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.548
Don't get smashed!

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:44.636
What the hell is that thing?

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.391
This is it. Fire!

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.106
‐‐Nothing.
‐‐[GEAR H] It's armored.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.441
‐‐[GEAR I] Close in!
‐‐Wait!

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.867
Damn you!

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.798
Let's go!

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.509
[SOU]
Twiggy little legs on you!

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.637
[RYOKU]
Let's fix that nasty‐ass face!

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.685
You bastard! Kill him!

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.570
[cheering]

00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:45.780
[GEAR M]
Hot damn, Kurenai is a beast!

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.741
She's here.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:51.161
It's really her,
the strongest Tanker!

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.962
[KURENAI] You really put on
a clinic back there, soldier.

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.131
Huh? What?

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:07.177
Oh. Wait, what?
Uh, I just did what I could!

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:07.677
Oh gosh.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.556
It's an honor to fight at your
side, Miss Kurenai. And also!

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.475
My name is Natsume!

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.019
So you just joined?
What's your unit?

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.229
Oh. No, ma'am.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.441
There's no way I could cut it
in The Power with my skills.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.526
[surprised sounds]

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:24.986
Who said that?

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.988
They told me I was a bug.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.406
[KURENAI]
Meaning?

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.534
That I'm a tiny,
weak, annoying creature.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.745
Hey. Cut it out.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.121
There's nothing weak about you.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.706
If you think you're an insect,

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.375
that makes these two
something like boogers.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.292
[gasps]

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.586
[laughs nervously]

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.380
[KURENAI]
Natsume.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.006
We want you to join The Power.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.132
You in?

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.968
[NATSUME]
Wh‐What? But I just‐‐

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.178
[KURENAI] You have the will
to fight and the skill to win.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.429
That's what we need.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.472
Natsume.

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.932
Come join the team.

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:54.849
[TANKER B]
Glad to have ya!

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:55.976
[TANKER A]
Cheers, kid!

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.143
[TANKER C]
Welcome aboard!

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.019
You made it.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.729
Great!

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.358
Hey, Boss!

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.693
All your training worked.

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.444
I'm gonna be a soldier!

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.697
And I owe everything to you!

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.658
Don't die on me, okay?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.325
He's right.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.411
Don't go getting
yourself killed out there.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:15.412
After all...

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.539
Ah! Mister Kabu?

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:21.626
What an unexpected
honor to see you, sir!

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.004
Uh... "Mister Kabu"?

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.422
Guess that hasn't changed.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:26.881
[KURENAI] I couldn't stop
myself dreaming of the day

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.342
we'd meet again
on the battlefield!

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.814
Update our course.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.608
Now, Deca‐dence,
full speed ahead!

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.278
We're charging straight
into the Gadoll nest!

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.678
[CYBORG C] Y'all, this
next event is gonna be epic!

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.265
I hear that in the old days, the
map was called "Mount Everest."

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:18.725
I've never felt cold before!

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.977
I'm getting goosebumps already!

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.732
[KURENAI] Three days ago,
the Gears found something big.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.651
We know where the
Gadoll spawning ground is.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.737
This operation
has one objective.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.697
We are to neutralize
this structure.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.033
Burn their nest.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.786
The nest is located near
the summit of this mountain.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:41.998
The area is blanketed in a heavy
fog and visibility is limited.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.209
Accordingly, this operation
will be carried out

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.878
entirely using ground troops.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.588
Per the Gears' scouting reports,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.048
the source of
the fog has been traced

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.133
to an unknown
Gadoll in the area,

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:53.593
meaning in order
to complete the mission,

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:54.969
we have to take it out.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:55.929
To that end,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.598
squad 6 will be coordinating
with our Gear comrades in order

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.519
to eliminate this target,
designated "Gadoll alpha."

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.937
It's been sighted here.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.064
About 5500 meters up.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.857
There's a large
split in the rock.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.485
This fight will take place
at high elevation.

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.904
Your stamina will
be compromised.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:13.863
So above all,

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.323
‐‐act efficiently and always‐‐

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.574
‐‐[NATSUME] Right!
‐‐act efficiently and always‐‐

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.869
Do you have a question?

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:23.748
Uh, no, sorry!

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.958
Please, continue.

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.167
[laughter]

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.671
Okay, settle down everyone,
let's continue the briefing.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:30.505
Right, then.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.006
Moving on to the main force.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.467
Squads 1 through 5.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.553
[KABURAGI]
What? The warrior department?

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.805
Yep, it seems like you really
turned some heads

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.765
in your battle the other day.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.976
For real, look at all this.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:44.477
[KABURAGI]
No way.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.980
[MINATO] Like you're rolling
with the ranker crew again.

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.022
Yeah, you think?

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.983
I mean, really.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:50.817
[MINATO]
You've spent enough time

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.527
crawling around in the dirt.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.947
Whatever debt you owed is paid.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.491
We talked to maintenance
and everything's been set up.

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.160
You can come home!

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.537
They don't have a
ranker program anymore.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.373
I'm not sure what I'd do.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:08.042
What I'm about to say
stays in this room.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:10.837
But this Gadoll Nest
event is unwinnable.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.422
[KABURAGI]
What?

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.924
[MINATO] Even a fully optimized
squad of S‐ranked gears

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.719
won't stand a chance
in a fight against alpha.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.306
And of course, that means
the fog's not gonna clear.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:25.143
The vast majority of the Gear
population will be killed off.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:28.104
Deca‐dence will teeter
on the brink of annihilation.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.149
Until the heroes of legend
return in our hour of need.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.776
This is a major story event.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.904
You're gonna be
part of the canon.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.781
Crazy, right?

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:42.285
I mean, for you it'll be
about like being a ranker.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:43.077
[KABURAGI]
I get it.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.872
So everyone who
participates in the new event.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:46.706
They're gone.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.250
Anyone A‐class
or below, goes poof.

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.879
Extreme shakeups like that
test better with the users.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.672
Hey, Kabu?

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.257
You're still with me, right?

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.051
[KABURAGI]
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

00:11:58.092 --> 00:11:59.302
Seriously.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.888
I'm stoked to get a chance
to work with you again.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.723
Glad to have
your help with all this.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.183
Just make sure you
keep your head down

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.060
until the event's over.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.229
[KABURAGI]
Sure thing.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.273
[KURENAI] This will be
the largest military operation

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:13.149
in history.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:14.150
The final battle.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.360
We cannot fail.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.402
[GEARS]
Yes, ma'am!

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.655
H‐hour is four a. m. tomorrow.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:19.447
That's all.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.032
Dismissed!

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.995
These are your squadmates.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.873
Meet Mindy, Mundy, and Mendy.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:29.874
They're triplets.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.752
They were the babies of
the team till you showed up.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.588
Natsume's in squad 6 with you
three, so take good care of her.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.464
Yes, ma'am!

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.383
I'll leave it to you, then.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.218
So you're all caught up, huh?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.262
Everyone's seen
what you can do, rook,

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.514
but don't forget you're
part of a team now.

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:46.975
No running off on
your own to play hero.

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:47.934
Okay.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.644
Thank you for the advice.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.604
Sure. Good to meetcha.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.523
[NATSUME]
The pleasure is mi‐‐

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.234
Quit that!

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.278
Sorry, it's still new.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.113
What the hell is
that s'posed to mean?

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:02.740
Are you gonna fight with a
weapon you don't know?

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.909
Whoa, damn, chill, Mindy.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.369
Yeah, don't scare her off!

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.537
Get it together!

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:10.290
You could die out there,
ya friggin' noob!

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.040
[MUNDY]
Hey!

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.667
[MENDY] Why are you
freakin' out like that?

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.836
It's not even a big deal!

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.095
[NATSUME]
Fei!

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.389
Natsume.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.266
Don't take too long.

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.978
Long time no see, Fei.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.229
Hope you're doing good.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.939
Crazy, I was actually
just thinking you and I

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.774
should catch up sometime!

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:40.528
Right now, maybe?

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.072
[FEI]
Sorry. I've still got work.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.742
[NATSUME]
Wait a sec!

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:47.493
Something wrong?

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.912
Is there?

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:53.833
You're gonna do what you want
no matter what I say, right?

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:57.587
And I can't be okay
with it, so that's it.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:01.424
‐‐[NATSUME] Fei‐‐
‐‐[LINMEI] Fei!

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.301
How long are you
gonna keep talking?

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.094
Coming, sorry!

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.980
[knock, knock]

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.611
You're visiting me this time?

00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:24.447
I guess I must have done
something right, huh!

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:27.825
By all means, shove something
out of the way and have a seat!

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.202
Great timing, too,

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:31.788
I was actually just about to
come bring you something.

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.414
I got some milk!

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.708
I thought we could share
a little bit with Pipe.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.003
After all we gotta cut loose
on the eve of the final battle!

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.840
So you plan to take part too.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:43.508
Hold on.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:44.425
When you say "too,"

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.928
does that mean you're gonna be
rolling out into battle with us?

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:47.929
Awesome!

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.141
That's like having an extra
million guys on our side!

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:55.686
[KABURAGI] Natsume,
you've been a great student.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:15:00.191
Even a Gear could hardly
learn to fight so well, so fast.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.692
And I mean that.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.653
[NATSUME]
Thank you, that means a lot.

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:07.490
But, look, this operation
is on another level.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:08.825
You need to back out.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:10.118
It's all good, Boss!

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.162
After all, I learned
from the best there is!

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:16.457
I said stay home.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.709
What about all the
support you've given me?

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.545
The end of the war is in sight!

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.797
We can finally
defeat the Gadoll!

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:26.884
You won't succeed, and the
Gadoll aren't going anywhere.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.011
C'mon, Boss,
you don't really mean that.

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:30.888
This isn't like you.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.640
[KABURAGI]
It won't end.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:34.058
Tomorrow or ever.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.435
[NATSUME]
We found the nest.

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:37.645
We can take out all
of them in one shot!

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.230
[KABURAGI]
You don't know.

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:42.358
You're not making history,
you're repeating it.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.194
There is no nest
in the first place.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.946
[NATSUME]
Why are you saying this?

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.573
Why are you lying to me?

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:49.991
I'm not lying.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.576
Then why would they say
they found the nest‐‐

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.829
How long do you think this
damn war has been going on?

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.080
It's been centuries!

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.791
I know! That's why I've been
working my ass off to finish i‐‐

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.042
You don't!

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.003
The game wasn't meant‐‐

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:08.634
I told you.

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.887
Some things don't change.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:15.433
Maybe not,
but I refuse to give up.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.435
You won't make it through this.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:18.769
Natsume, I'm begging you.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:19.437
Stay home.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.397
Get off me!

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:22.857
[KABURAGI]
Why don't you get it?

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.650
I'm trying to save your life!

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.611
Let go! It's my life!

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:29.280
I decide what to
do with it, not you!

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.910
[crashing]

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:44.170
[KABURAGI]
Stay home, Natsume.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:51.010
[NATSUME cries]

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:58.893
There was no other way.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.105
[MARCHEN]
To world peace.

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:04.941
[TANKERS]
Cheers!

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.817
[MARCHEN laughs]
I don't think

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.653
I'll ever get sick
of that toast.

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.446
[GOMEZ] That's gotta be the
30th time tonight, right?

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.532
[MARCHEN]
We can do better than that!

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:15.076
'Nother drink for
world peace, everyone!

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.578
[TANKERS]
Cheers!

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:19.080
[NATSUME]
Kurenai, ma'am.

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.540
[KURENAI]
Hmm?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.960
Hey there.

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:25.461
Ya having fun yet?

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:26.504
Oh, yeah.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.589
That's more than
I've ever eaten.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.841
[KURENAI] Is that what
the tears are about?

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:35.096
Did you come here to
pull out of the mission?

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:39.225
Is that what you
believe is best for you?

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.726
It is.

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:44.772
Well, then that's what's best.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.817
But for now,
go wash your face, okay?

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.612
Kurenai!

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:55.783
Um, you're basically a legend,
and I probably shouldn't ask,

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.244
but did you ever
think about giving up?

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:00.746
Oh yeah, way more
times than I could count.

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:03.457
[gasps]
So, then...

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:05.251
But a woman deserving
of Kabu's greatness

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.295
would never do that, of course.

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:10.047
[chuckles]

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.341
Well, thank you.
I'm heading out.

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:15.511
I'd be interested to hear
why you wanted to fight.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.264
Armor repair is
an important job,

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.391
and it's less likely
to get you killed,

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.351
but you wanted to be a soldier.

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:25.313
Why would you risk your life?

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:28.107
[NATSUME]
I guess I...

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.275
See, for me.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:32.612
Sometimes I look up and
see the inside of this tank,

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:35.364
and suddenly it's like
I'm not even really alive.

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.325
[NATSUME] So going out
to fight on the surface

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.659
helps you with that.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.995
Sitting here inside
our filthy little cage,

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.372
breathing this
stale air till I die.

00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:45.291
That's what scares me.

00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:55.301
[NATSUME]
Whatcha lookin' at?

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:56.927
Come here, Natsume.

00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:02.767
A long, long time ago,
thousands of humans lived there.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.810
[NATSUME]
That's so amazing!

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:08.064
[MURO] And this dome used
to be part of a mobile fortress.

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.857
[NATSUME]
You mean like an old Deca‐dence?

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:10.941
[MURO]
That's right.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:11.692
[NATSUME]
What's this?

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:12.985
A waterfall.

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:15.363
That's rain that flowed
down from the mountain.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.782
Wow.

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:23.579
Pretty!

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:26.457
[MURO chuckles] I guess
it's a daily routine now.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:27.333
[NATSUME]
Uh‐huh!

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:30.169
Someday, once
we've finished this war,

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.963
we'll be able to live out
there on the surface.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.256
We will?

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.132
Of course!

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.593
And we'll be able to
pick out any place we like.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:38.928
Back in the old times,

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.347
all humans could seek
a place for themselves.

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.849
Okay, then I'm gonna
become a soldier!

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.060
And I'll help everyone
win the war!

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.603
Right, Dad?

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:02.827
Whoa. You okay?

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.161
Her claw's acting up.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:07.289
Ugh, you are such
a drag in every way.

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:09.917
And really,
with that arm of yours,

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.170
you'd be even more of
a chore to drag off the field.

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.590
You can't be a soldier.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.968
Get over it
and find another job.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.762
Tankers like us need
to stay inside Deca‐dence

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.723
where it's safe.

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:26.225
Was losing that arm not enough?

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.310
I told you.

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:30.479
Some things don't change.

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.655
Enough is enough.

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.372
Man, how much of that
mess are you gonna eat?

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.874
Gimme a break, would ya?

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.126
I'm trying to enjoy
my last supper.

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:57.757
I wasn't trying
to change the world.

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:01.552
The only thing I really wanted
to change was myself!

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:04.513
I'm sick of being weak
and feeling useless.

00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:07.308
I want confidence.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:08.851
So now you know.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:11.479
That's my reason
for becoming a soldier!

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.023
[KURENAI]
Hmph!

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:17.943
Hahh?! That's my last skewer!

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.653
Almost time to deploy.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.739
You're in, right?

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:30.039
Okay, so before I forget.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.541
Could you spot me
a little cash maybe?

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:33.876
Huh?

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:43.344
[ANNOUNCER] The event
will begin in 15 minutes.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:47.097
All staff please report to your
designated stations immediately.

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.516
You're kidding.

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:50.976
She's going out there with them?

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.062
That little idiot!

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:57.983
[MARCHEN]
Listen up! This is it.

00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:59.527
The final battle!

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.904
We'll complete this mission,
whatever it takes!

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:02.780
Got that?

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.365
[GEARS]
Sir!

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:08.994
Move out!
