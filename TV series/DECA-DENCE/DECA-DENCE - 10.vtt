On me. Three. Two. One.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:27.903
[NATSUME]
This is wrong.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.489
How could the Gadoll
have come from here?

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.784
Why is their "nest" built out
of glass and concrete?

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.536
Who was that man you fought?

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.579
Forgive me.

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.499
Everything about
the world you know...

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:41.833
The Gadoll...

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.212
This body you see me in...

00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:47.214
It's all manufactured.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.149
[KABURAGI]
That's the truth.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.609
The life you've lived till now,

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.361
and the world
you've lived it in.

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:10.362
Everything you've gone through

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.740
is all thanks to
cyborgs like me.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:16.451
We grow all the Gadoll here.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:19.580
We program them to attack
Deca‐dence relentlessly.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.959
And then we
fight them for sport.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.671
To the Gears, the Gadoll are
just the enemies in a game.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.923
[KABURAGI]
Natsume?

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.134
Hey. Do you hear me?

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.844
Natsume! Stay with me, kid!

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:36.680
Hey! Please.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.194
[RANDOM CYBORG A]
What just happened?

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:15.237
[RANDOM CYBORG B]
How would I know?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.280
[RANDOM CYBORG C]
Whatever it was, it's bad!

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.240
[RANDOM CYBORG D]
Oh crap!

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.449
So what are we
supposed to do now?

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.451
[CYBORG B]
We've got a huge problem here!

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:22.285
Dammit all!

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.038
Somehow, somebody
activated the G. G. S!

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.666
Oh crappity crap crap,
we're on track to lose

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.335
literally every friggin'
Gadoll in Deca‐dence!

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.670
What do we do? What do we do?

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:34.381
Shut up! Panicking's
not gonna help us!

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:36.508
[SULLY]
I know that!

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.094
No way. They hit
the Gadoll factory?

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.762
[SULLY]
What the crap do we do?

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:44.015
Dammit. Those bugs
have screwed us all.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.434
Can we leave?

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.144
Data transfer completed, sir!

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.730
Great. Time to log out.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.190
But sir, what about him?

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.317

What about him? Just go.

[FACTORY MANAGER]
Hurry!

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.175
The little runt left
a mark on me.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.593
Who was that?

[MUNDY]
What's happening to them?

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:34.691
They're dissolving!

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.985
Yeah, but what's causing it?

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.613
Natsume, you really did it.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.782
All of 'em just
started dying off.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:42.657
The hell?

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.493
[KATOU]
That's not normal.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.952
[ESSAM]
It's gotta be a bug, right?

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.246
Come on!
You kiddin' me right now?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.123
They actually
went live with this?

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.961
[ANNOUNCER] A fatal error

Thank you for your patience.

They broke the game.

Well done, team.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:05.889
Well, this sucks, dude.

course of action, Commander?

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:11.520
[OPERATOR B] Do we put
the fortress on standby?

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:15.607
Beats me.
That's the system's problem.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:26.535
It's done. So what will
you do now, Kabu?

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.297
No. No!

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.806
[KABURAGI]
You're wounded.

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.976
Which means,
it wasn't a bad dream.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.063
I don't know how
to respond to that.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:58.149
My kind don't have dreams.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.027

They deserve to know this.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.654
[KABURAGI]
They can't.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.322
If you humans knew the truth,

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.659
the world we designed
couldn't function anymore.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.578
And those who do learn.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.080
The world can't
let them keep living.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.623
Then I'm...

[KABURAGI] You're alive
because it can't see you.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.459
But how?

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.211
[KABURAGI]
Do you think I'm still lying?

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:21.756

Remember when your father died.

So then it's exactly
as you said.

Yes, there's something
strange about our world.

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:33.476
But it's hidden from us.

Stay strong, okay?

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.646
They're taking you back
to Deca‐Dence.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.106
So please, hang on.

Dad's gonna be home real soon.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.568
Wait for me.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.116

He got too close

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.827
to learning the truth
about the world.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.954
He was a bug.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.749
Too dangerous
to the system to live.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.796
[NATSUME]
And you knew.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:05.425
You knew all of
that the whole time.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:12.807
About the Gadoll, and
Deca‐dence, and how Dad died.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:17.103
As long as I've known you,
and you never told me any of it.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:24.653
Natsume. I was‐‐

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:29.491
You know, it was never
about changing the world.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.243
I was trying to change myself.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.080
I worked hard
to become stronger,

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.416
so that I could finally
feel confident in myself.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:42.337
And that was a waste.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:43.755
Now I know the truth.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.508
It doesn't matter
how I've changed.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.635
I was better off
how things were.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.306
They tried to tell me.

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.642
But instead, I listened to you.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.563

I'm sorry.

right in front of our eyes.

How can we be sure
that they're really gone?

Guys, can't we relax for a sec?

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:30.612
Gear scouts haven't even spotted
any farther out on the surface.

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.197
We might be able
to live out there!

We're free now!
The world belongs to mankind!

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:35.992

What are you doing over
here all by yourself?

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.636
Glad you made it back.

Welcome home.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.556
Now come on,
let's join the party.

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:02.352
Hey, you okay?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.774
Natsume?

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.371
Stupid. What was I even doing?

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:23.081
And what for?

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:27.043
I've changed,
but I haven't made a difference.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.433
[JILL]
Mission accomplished, Kaburagi,

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.561
but you don't have
time for a victory lap.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.396
We need you back here now!

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:47.689
[KABURAGI]
The game police?

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.066
[JILL] Yeah, and they're
earlier than I'd planned on.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.151
We held off the first wave,

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.945
but the system's still going
for total annihilation.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.030
Whatever you're doing, hurry!

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:13.590
Yes. The Tanker girl is a bug.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:16.050
An ID search
produces no results,

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.554
and I can't look for her through
a Gear's eyes right now.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.847
What next?

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.016
[squawks]

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:26.936
Well said. Let us
proceed accordingly.

Natsume.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:08.144
[NATSUME]
Hey, Kurenai.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.646
This isn't you.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.650
Do you wanna talk about it?

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.197
I guess.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:22.450
I'm not sure what
to believe anymore.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:25.536
I thought I'd see
the world, and grow up,

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:29.916
and live freely,
and that'd be that.

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.169
But nothing in the world
seems worth seeing now.

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:36.673
Everything I've
done feels useless.

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:39.133
Suddenly things
don't make sense.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.052
And I don't know
what I should do.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.269
I'm really glad to see
you back here unhurt,

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.063
and I'm proud
to call you my comrade.

[NATSUME]
What if Fei was right?

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:58.528
What if there wasn't
any need to change?

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.115
Everything you've
seen and heard.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:03.533
All of your feelings.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.118
These are yours alone.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:07.578
Other people can't
decide what you need.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.332
Because it's your life.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.167
Nobody else's.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.586
Is that how you see it?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.588
[stomach growls]

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.760
[laughs]
Still gotta eat, though. Here.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:26.514
Thank you, I forgot.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.474
This looks good.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:39.902
[JILL]
Took you long enough!

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.904
Sorry. What's up?

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.948
[JILL] We need to leave
or we're all gonna die.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.033
Any questions?

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:46.659
No, ma'am.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:47.869
All right, party's over.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.288
Get a move on
or we're all screwed!

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.665
No time for napping!

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.710
Get moving or
we're leaving you here!

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.003
[BUG B]
Please!

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:04.052
[DONATELLO] Come on,
the hard part is over with!

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.345
Just move!

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.017
[GAME POLICE A]
What the hell?

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:12.310
[GAME POLICE B]
They greased up the floor!

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.603
[GAME POLICE C]
Oh c'mon!

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:20.568
[DONATELLO]
Hurry up, boys.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.612
You're not gonna
wanna be in here in a sec.

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:24.113
Let's go!

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.325
[GAME POLICE D]
What the‐‐

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.295
Hah! Sayonara, turd factory!

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:39.921
See ya soon!

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.672
Don't worry, we'll still visit!

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:42.340
Like hell!

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.258
Why would anyone come back here?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.594
[JILL] Three cheers for our
ol outhouse. Hooray!

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:50.598
[BUGS]
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:56.854
I've seen what I've seen,

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.608
and I've felt the
things I've felt, right?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.277
I'll be starting with the
Kaburagi team today.

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.571
It's very good to meet you.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.828
This is the battlefield.

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.705
You sure you still
wanna become a soldier?

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:17.542
[NATSUME] I'm begging you,
teach me how to fight like that!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.419
You won't convince me, either.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.629
Take this! It's as
much as I can give!

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.841
[laughs]

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:26.008
What exactly changed your mind

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.052
about helping me
become a soldier?

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.470
[KABURAGI]
Good question.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:32.765
Guess I was curious about how a
bug could get by in this world,

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.600
if someone gave it a chance.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.228
[screams]

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.859
[NATSUME]
This... This is amazing, Boss!

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.403
Your arm doesn't have
to hold you back anymore.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.196
Now it can be your weapon.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.031
But that can't be...

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.163
[KABURAGI]
Didn't I tell you?

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.165
You bit off more than
you can chew this time.

00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.082
[gasps]

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:00.168
Boss, you came?

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.628
I swore an oath to myself.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.799
That I'd push my limits and
smash every wall in my way!

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:13.764
[DONATELLO] How could you
forget to fill up on oxyone?

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:16.726
[BUG K] Hey, there was
kind of a lot going on!

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:17.727
[BUG B]
We'll do it quick!

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:20.021
Ugh! Yeah, you better.

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:23.774
Hey. We're drinkin' these.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.485
Thanks, but I'll pass.

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:30.198
No way. You don't get to
pass on Sark's final batch.

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:39.707
[KABURAGI]
Tastes like slow death.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.125
[DONATELLO] Nah,
just an occasional case

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.126
of sudden blindness!

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.420
[laughs]

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:04.732
[JILL] So where do you
plan to go from here?

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:05.900
[KABURAGI]
It should take them a few years

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.818
to rebuild the Gadoll factory.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.655
I need to end Deca‐dence
completely before then.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:11.614
[sighs]

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.407
Then you really are doing
your absolute damnedest

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.910
to make the system
see you as a threat.

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:19.121
Seems like you're in a
big hurry to get scrapped.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.582
You have fun with that,
but I'm out.

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:24.418
Hell, I'm gonna end up just
as dead either way, right?

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.546
Might as well have
some fun until then.

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:28.130
What do you consider fun?

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:30.132
[JILL]
And there it is. The system

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:35.763
has officially designated us
all as full‐blown bugs.

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.682
Jill! I need to
log in immediately!

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.725
[JILL] Huh? There's
no way to do it from here;

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.477
we have to get
to the hideout first!

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.688
Ugh! Damn!

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.569
[RANDOM SOLDIER D]
Yeesh, I'm done.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.403
[RANDOM SOLDIER E]
Well I'm not!

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.071
[RANDOM SOLDIER F]
This is the best!

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.960
[NATSUME]
What is this?

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:10.381
It's from him!

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.009
"I haven't been able
to be honest with you

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.303
in all the time
we've known each other.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:17.638
You have every
reason to be mad."

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.932
[KABURAGI] "And when you
finally learned the truth,

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:22.143
it only hurt you more.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.478
I'm sorry for what
I put you through.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.897
I spent my life
disguised as a human.

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.733
The rules said
they had to stay caged,

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.611
and that I had to be
the one to keep them there.

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:34.030
Sometimes it meant
making them suffer.

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:36.866
And back then, it was easy
to shut out their pain

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:40.286
because I already knew
the rules made people suffer.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.330
So I lived in that cage
with the humans,

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.832
going through the motions
and waiting to die.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:47.168
That's where I was
when we first met.

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.295
I had given up on myself.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:52.965
I guess because it felt like the
closest thing I had to a choice.

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:54.634
But then I met you,

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.886
and I saw the way you fought
with everything you had

00:18:56.927 --> 00:19:00.139
for even a chance at
finding something better.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.267
That's why I decided
to push myself to my limits.

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:06.979
If the rules of this world
demand that we suffer,

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:10.775
I'll make it my purpose
to abolish those rules.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:13.069
I can't pay back
what you've given me,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.405
but if I can manage
to break that cage

00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:20.951
and give you the chance
to face the world on your terms,

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.453
you'll be all right."

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:29.377
[NATSUME]
Boss, you... you jackass!

the shell of an old Deca‐dence?

Hey, it's not half bad.

[RANDOM BUG D]
Yeah, this is nice!

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.135
[RANDOM BUG E] Should
be a great place to hide out.

[DONATELLO]
Hmm?

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.806
Hey, what're you two doing?

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:42.765
What's the point of logging in

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:44.600
when there aren't
any more Gadoll?

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.602
Hurry it up,
Jill, there's no time!

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.189
Great! Yell at me about it,
that'll help!

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.816
Please be okay.

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.699
[NATSUME] Boss!
You're in there, aren't you?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.034
Hold on. I'm coming in!

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:08.249
What did I do?

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.251
Whoa, Boss, are you okay?

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:14.588
[NATSUME]
Sorry.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.507
Anyway, what the hell
is wrong with you?

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.426
I read your note.

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:21.679
And I knew I needed
to come find you.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.432
Figures you'd be
getting ready to run off.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:25.349
Oh, yeah.

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:26.350
There's something I needed to‐‐

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:27.935
What kind of jerk are you?

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:28.769
Sorry?

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:31.522
Was that really what
you think an apology is?

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:32.773
Seriously?

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.025
"Hey, you'll be all right."
Screw you!

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.987
I'm nowhere
friggin' near all right!

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:40.281
How could I be? Idiot.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.035
I'm sorry.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:50.124
It was a shock, and it did hurt,
learning that you lied to me.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:53.919
But still, all the
things you taught me.

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:56.046
The battles we fought together.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:59.925
I know all of that was real.

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:03.053
I believe you meant what
you said, about the world,

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:06.432
and wanting me to
face it on my terms.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.350
And I've already made my choice.

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:11.395
I'm choosing to trust you.

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:12.521
Natsume.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:14.148
[NATSUME] So if you're
telling me these "rules"

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.400
or whatever are the real enemy,

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.904
then point me at 'em,
and I'll go put a needle in 'em.

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.909
Sounds good. Now let's‐‐

Perhaps humans
are not so hard to predict.

Hello, Miss, and fare thee well.

00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:49.642
The world must be free of bugs.

00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:52.102
Jill! Is there
anything you can do?

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.437
[JILL]
There's not.

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:56.857
Your avatar's gone offline,
I can't get you back into it.

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:59.819
Ah, shit! I have
to help Natsume!

00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.948
Huh? What was that?

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.866

Whoa. Look up.

What the hell is that?

This can't be right!

Hah! Looks like we
aren't done yet after all.
