WEBVTT

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:32.449
Hey, Muro!
Come here for a second!

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:33.909
I think we found something.

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:38.997
[MURO]
What is this?

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.542
So then, it's exactly
as you said.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.628
Yes, there's something
strange about our world.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.047
But it's hidden from us.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.924
[NATSUME]
Daddy!

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.760
Lookit this weird‐lookin'
thingy I just found!

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.639
Natsume!
How did you even get out here?

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.557
[NATSUME]
Uh...

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.767
I know. You stowed away
in the car, right?

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.145
[NATSUME]
Uh... I, uh, uh, um...

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.814
[IVAN laughs]

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.649
C'mon, cut her some slack.

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:07.150
You're the one who's
been telling her stories

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.111
about the surface every night.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.113
Of course she's
gonna wanna see it.

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.155
Right, kiddo?

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:15.534
Really...

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.204
Gadoll, right on us!

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.872
Hurry! Let's go!

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.207
[TACHITO]
Well, this sucks.

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:31.383
Crap, avispine!

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.302
[IVAN]
And it's gaining on us!

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.470
[MURO] Hold on, Natsume.
Don't let go!

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.180
[NATSUME]
Right!

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:38.140
[MURO gasps]

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.474
The Gears!

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.101
[IVAN]
Woo! We're saved!

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:42.519
[TACHITO]
We can still make it!

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.737
[NATSUME screams]

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.411
[IVAN yells]

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.246
[MURO]
Dammit! They got Ivan!

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:03.248
Take my daughter.
She's bleeding badly.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.374
[AID UNIT A]
Sir!

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.418
[MURO]
We've been overrun.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.670
Natsume! You with me?

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:09.671
Yeah.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.006
Stay strong, okay?

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:12.841
They're taking you
back to Deca‐Dence.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:16.261
So please, hang on.
Dad's gonna be home real soon.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:17.429
Wait for me.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:21.850
[MURO]
Get moving, now!

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.018
[AID UNIT A]
Yes, sir!

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.215
[CLASSMATE A] Long ago,
the mysterious creatures

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:57.135
called Gadoll emerged as
a dire threat to humanity.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:01.973
Over 90% of the human
population was eradicated.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.017
[CLASSMATE B] In the face of
this unprecedented threat,

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.977
the Gears, soldiers
of the anti‐Gadoll

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.063
combat force known as The Power,

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.773
combined their vast
knowledge to construct

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.442
the mobile fortress
we know as Deca‐Dence.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.280
[LINMEI] Powered by oxyone,
the energy coursing through

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.782
the veins of the Gadoll,

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:21.868
the fortress became
humanity's final bastion.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.537
The last living humans
were provided with

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.456
a habitat built into a
massive oxyone storage tank

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.792
aboard Deca‐Dence.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.503
And now, this place
is the only home

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.672
that humanity has left.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:37.217
In the centuries since then,
thanks to the Gears' protection,

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:41.138
Tankers like us have been
able to live in peace.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.515
As Tankers, our role
is to support the Gears

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.600
in their work,
and allow them to focus

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.812
all their energies on fighting.

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.313
[NATSUME]
After the Gears fight,

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.941
our job is to butcher
any Gadoll they kill.

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:56.945
If any armor has taken damage,
we're called on to repair it.

00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:59.322
And assisting the brave
Gears in this fashion

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.991
is the Tanker way of life.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.078
[DIRECTOR A]
A splendid recitation.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.164
Today, you will all
leave this facility.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.583
Maintain the Tanker ethos
as you transition

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.126
into your new jobs.

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:12.127
Now then.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.045
Linmei. Butchery.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:14.796
[LINMEI]
Yes!

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.631
[CLASSMATES gasp]

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.341
[DIRECTOR A]
Marco, weaponry.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.010
[MARCO]
Yes, sir.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.803
[DIRECTOR A]
Peth, dye worker.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.263
[PETH]
Yes, sir!

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.224
It was refused?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.851
What is that crap?!

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.561
It's not like there's
some rule against me

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.271
joining The Power!

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:32.481
No refusal.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.065
They didn't technically
turn you down;

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.484
they just didn't take you.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.361
Which is basically
the same thing.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.198
[DIRECTOR A] I'm sure
I don't need to tell you why.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.909
They need candidates sound
in mind and body.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.869
That goes for anybody
who wants to enlist

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.914
in The Power.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.499
You can't be a soldier.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.584
Get over it and
find another job.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.044
[NATSUME groans]

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.220
[sighs]

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.347
[FEI]
Hey, cheer up!

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:08.350
There's always next time, right?

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.851
We give our thanks.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.148
[NATSUME yells]

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.109
My bad, I thought you
were into stuff like that.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.320
I figured you might
need some cheering up

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.365
since The Power rejected your
enlistment and everything.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.325
Stop it, Linmei!

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.495
They didn't reject me;
they just didn't let me join up!

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:29.579
That's the same thing.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.956
[FRIENDS laugh]

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.666
And really, with that
arm of yours,

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.919
you'd be even more of
a chore to drag off the field.

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.755
You have no idea how
much I've been training!

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:41.466
I can pull more than
my weight, hear me?

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:44.427
[LINMEI]
Whatever you say! 'Kay, bye!

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.054
Who's gonna be laughing
when you're cutting up

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.889
my kills, ya stupid jerk?

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:57.816
[FEI]
You know,

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.861
to be honest,
I'm glad you didn't get in.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.779
[NATSUME]
Huh?

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.115
[FEI] I love that you
worked so hard for it,

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.992
but it's pretty rare
for a Tanker like you

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.952
to end up as a soldier.

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:10.912
And it's so dangerous!

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.707
Think about your dad.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.668
What I mean is, I really
want you to stay alive.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.213
Thanks for that.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:22.799
Whoa.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.760
See them?

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.096
Gears are so lucky.

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.639
It woulda been cool
to be born into

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.933
the badass warrior race.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.935
[FEI] But that's exactly why
we have to let them

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.438
be the ones who fight
the Gadoll, isn't it?

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.565
So that way, we can, uh...

00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:41.151
Wait, what are you going to do?

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.152
For your job.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:45.697
The director did find you
something, didn't he?

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.282
Oh, yeah, about that...

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:56.750
[NATSUME yells]

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.714
So high!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.215
[KABURAGI]
Hey.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.216
[NATSUME]
Excuse me.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.885
My name is Natsume.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.471
I'll be starting with the
Kaburagi team today.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.765
It's very good to meet you.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.767
Great. This way.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.690
[NATSUME]
Excuse me. Mister Kaburagi, sir?

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.943
Um, should I call you
"boss" or "chief" or...?

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:26.738
Sorry.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.867
[KABURAGI]
And you're off.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.577
[NATSUME screams]

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.916
You coulda said something first!

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.335
Nobody's gonna be holding
your hand out here.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.587
Scrub that gunk off the shell.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.880
[NATSUME]
Huh?

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.591
Oh, gross! What is this crap?

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.301
It's a big chunk of
flesh and mucus

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:51.262
someone blew off a Gadoll.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.015
The director said I was
gonna be repairing armor.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.226
[KABURAGI] That's after
the five years of cleaning.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.745
[NATSUME]
That's a Tanker search unit.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.706
I wonder if Kurenai's with them.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.584
[KABURAGI]
What're you doing?

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.128
It's not work.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.254
[NATSUME]
Sorry, sir!

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.343
[groans]

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.930
Five whole years of that?

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.394
[NATSUME snoring]

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:30.653
Hey, Boss, you eat the
same stuff every day.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.864
Don't you ever want
something different?

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:33.907
It's fine.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.619
So, um...

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.537
Is that some kind
of super‐nutritious‐‐

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.498
[KABURAGI]
It's just water. Now eat.

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:45.794
Why me?

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.009
[FENNEL]
Long day, huh?

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.636
[NATSUME yells]

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:56.638
Whoa, easy.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:59.015
Ah, hi there,
Mister Kennel, sir.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:02.310
That's Fennel, babe,
if you hadn't heard.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.645
So, how's work?

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:04.729
Great!

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.773
Well, I mean,
other than that part

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.109
where the boss barely
says a word to me.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.984
Yeah.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.320
Seems like he's been
that way since he was born.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.405
Prob'ly stay that way
till he dies too.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.532
So look.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.158
Why not forget about him?

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.244
Right? Let's grab a bite.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.870
No thanks.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.248
[FENNEL] We need to welcome you
to the crew anyway!

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.958
Not like you're
working tomorrow!

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.417
Yeah, even so.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.894
[knock on door]

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.521
[knocking continues]

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:52.485
[KABURAGI]
Stay quiet, bud.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:53.611
[knocking continues]

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.366
Good evening‐‐

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.745
C'mon, Boss, open up!

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.665
You're being way too rude!

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:08.459
Stop knocking with that!
What's the problem?

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.377
Just this.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.754
I found it at
the office earlier.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.256
Great.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.424
Wait!

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.845
So I was kinda hoping
that maybe you might

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.638
be willing to throw
a little welcoming party

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.140
for me?

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.558
Do what?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.185
[NATSUME]
We're off tomorrow, right?

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:28.438
And I've already got
the stuff for it, so...

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:30.023
[KABURAGI]
Pass.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.316
Would you stop that?

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.653
Look, Boss. You lost this thing.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.530
Didn't even notice.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:41.367
But lucky for you, I noticed
it and brought it to you.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:46.289
Way out here, by myself.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.092
So! The long and short of it is,

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.887
they didn't let me
enlist in The Power.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.850
Isn't that crap?!

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.853
And if you did end up a soldier,
what would you do then?

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.607
Need me to spell it out for ya?

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.525
I'd fight with
everything I have.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.319
To try to end this war.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.488
[KABURAGI]
Wouldn't have worked.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.698
There aren't even 200
Tankers in The Power,

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.201
but let's pretend you did
have what it takes.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.619
Ending the war with the Gadoll

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.537
would still be just
a pipe dream.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.248
You wanna die
out there for nothing,

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.375
or stay here and
work for the Gears?

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.585
But then, if everybody
accepted that,

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.629
there's no way things
would ever change!

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.382
Some things don't change
no matter what you do.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.133
Deal with it.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.427
[NATSUME] So many people
are telling me to deal with it

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:42.679
lately.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.348
Humans are pretty
much extinct out there.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.392
Is getting to live out
your whole natural life

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.727
here in peace really so bad?

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.104
Peace?

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.397
If the Gadoll were wiped out,

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.774
we could finally
live in real peace!

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.485
[KABURAGI] Look, your
dreams are your business.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:00.655
My business is to make sure
you get your job done.

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:04.075
And I'll give it
everything I have!

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:07.620
But still, no way I'm giving
up on being a soldier.

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:09.539
[KABURAGI] Sooner or later,
you'll have to accept your life

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.582
as an armor repairer.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.502
That's how it goes.

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:17.463
So you're saying that I
should have no ambitions?

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.132
If that's what you
really took from it,

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.216
then yeah.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.305
‐‐Huh? What was that?
‐‐Stop that!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.141
What?

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.852
Conversation's over. Get out.

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.021
[NATSUME]
Uh, shouldn't I clean up first?

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.647
[KABURAGI]
No, leave it.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.024
It's time for you to head home.

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.191
Go already.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.360
[PIPE yelps]

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.031
[NATSUME]
What is that thing?!

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.824
Oh, crap, is that a Gadoll?

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.951
Ah! How'd it get in here?!

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.831
Gotcha. Now stay right there!

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:56.502
Enough.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.212
Trust me, we're not in danger.

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:20.401
Where'd you get it? And how?

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.278
[KABURAGI]
Just found it on the job.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.322
What's its name?

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.281
[KABURAGI]
Never gave it one.

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:28.242
Huh? What's wrong with you?

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.664
[NATSUME]
Is this for me?

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.375
Gosh, aren't you sweet!

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.584
That settles it.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.586
Starting now, your name is Pipe.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:41.172
Who said you could name
it in the first place?

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.174
You like it, don't you, Pipe?

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.051
[laughs]

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.054
Weren't you orphaned
by the Gadoll?

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.723
[NATSUME] Yeah, but
this one seems different.

Kaburagi, your rates
of bug discovery

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.815
and recovery have been marginal.

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:42.650
Please redouble your efforts.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.903
Remember: "The world
must be free of bugs."

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.907
Kaburagi?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.160
[KABURAGI]
The world must be free of bugs.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:53.411
[HUGIN]
Acceptable.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.876
[NATSUME]
I'm just not okay with it.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.629
Boss, you told me
that I needed to give up

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.549
on my ambitions,
and maybe that really would

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.801
be the smartest thing to do.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.636
But I just don't think I can.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:14.015
It means I'd be
giving up on life itself.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.100
That's your call.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.185
