WEBVTT

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.351
Okay. Good.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.436
Hey, Boss,
I'm ready when you are.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.065
[NATSUME]
That looks fancy!

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.359
Look what your
daddy brought you!

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.694
[KABURAGI]
Dig in, bud.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:36.578
Bye, Pipe!
You hold down the fort.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.288
See ya.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:57.099
[GEARS yells]

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.642
[KURENAI]
Mister Kabu.

00:00:58.684 --> 00:01:02.729
What is this operation
you're planning with Natsume?

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:03.522
‐‐Because I could help‐‐

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.024
‐‐She's the only one who can go.
‐‐Because I could help‐‐

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.528
Sorry. I can't tell you
any more than that.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:11.697
[KURENAI]
Even after all these years,

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:15.117
you still keep the most
important things hidden from me.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:18.829
And I don't wanna
like that about you, but...

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.580
[gasps]

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.999
...I do!

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.047
[KABURAGI] It's time to go knock
down the walls of this hell.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.049
Stay alive till I get back.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.927
Not that you
need me to tell you.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.929
You're the baddest
damn woman alive.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.015
[gasps]

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:40.434
Oh, I can get a lot badder.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:44.104
I'll be your queen!

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.694
Okay.

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.404
We're through.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.284
[NATSUME]
Later, guys.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.927
[JILL] Since I'm sure you
weren't paying attention before:

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.138
There's an invisible security
barrier surrounding the

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.891
Gadoll factory that activates
on contact with a chip.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.102
Avatars are instantly
logged out of the game

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:48.478
if they attempt to pass,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.690
and a Tanker would just
keel over on the spot.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.401
But Kaburagi's avatar
doesn't have a working chip,

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.153
and neither does
his Tanker friend.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.988
Meaning they can get through.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.199
You think this scheme's
really gonna work?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.325
It'll be fine!

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.202
Worst case scenario,
they both die.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.912
Not helping.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.956
Now, once you two
have infiltrated the factory.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:11.877
Your objective will be to
locate and activate the G. G. S.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:16.089
Which will eliminate the entire
Gadoll species in one shot.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.842
So they're just gonna hit
the big red button, huh?

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.510
What a lame way to end it all.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.930
You say that like it's totally
different from our situation.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.682
Right now, there's nothing
stopping the system

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.685
from hitting our
switch. Anyway...

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.354
Our final objective will be
to destroy the reactor.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.856
That'll stop new Gadoll forming,

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:35.233
and it'll take a
long time to fix.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.736
Sounds like a cakewalk
hearin' you talk about it.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.488
[JILL]
I left out some details.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.616
Assuming they haven't screwed
us by upgrading the barrier.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.493
In all likelihood,
security's gonna realize

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.829
our team broke in well before
they're able to reach the G. G. S.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.457
Huh? So what if they get caught?

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.210
Kabu and his little buddy eat it
and the whole thing's shot?

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.586
Shut up.

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.588
[JILL]
No. Even from down here,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.465
I can think of more than
a few fun ways

00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:01.092
to mess up a Gadoll factory.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.428
You let me worry
about the arrangements.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.888
Kaburagi, you don't
need me to tell you

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.681
how to put a needle
through a target.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.225
So log in and gear up.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.184
[KABURAGI]
Yeah.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.937
It's kinda cute how
into this you are right now.

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:17.234
Ow!

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.527
Hey, cut that out!

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.278
Use your words, woman!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.571
[JILL sighs]

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:24.074
You realize there's no
preparing your human friend

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:26.159
for what she's about to learn.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.246
And no telling
what it'll do to her.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:32.916
[NATSUME]
Hey, Boss?

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.459
Is something bothering you?

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:39.089
No. I'm fine. Just thinking.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.262
All right, we're
on foot from here.

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:49.683
[NATSUME] Whoa!
Jeez, that lake is gigantic.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.774
Hold on just a minute.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.317
This place we're going.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.278
[NATSUME]
I know.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.822
We're heading for the real
Gadoll spawning ground.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.824
We can't afford
to lose focus now.

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.243
Yeah, but that's not
what I'm trying to say!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.454
My bad, Boss. What is it?

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:14.082
Uh! Are you feeling okay?

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.626
I was till you started
weirding me out.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.461
Come on, let's move.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.720
[JILL] It looks like you both
made it through the barrier.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:27.596
[KABURAGI]
Yeah.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:30.015
[JILL] From here on out,
just stick to the plan.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:30.557
Got it.

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.436

Well, it's fine.

[JILL] What the hell do you
think you're doing, moron?

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.325
You don't have time to be
screwing around!

Lemme have this!

gonna get to fight the Gadoll!

corroding your

Keep it together, Sark.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.548
We both need
our heads in the game

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.051
if we're gonna save our buddies.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.304
I could...

...be a hero.

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.266
Yeah, right.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.269
Something's coming
out of the vents.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.479
The hell. Is that‐‐

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.356
What about the bugs?

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.611
Oh, holy shit. Quick!
Seal the vents!

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:12.158
[SARKOZY]
Is the plan workin' out so far?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.369
[JILL]
Yeah, to the letter.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.080
The prison complex is
filling up with shit smoke,

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.289
and now the ventilation system

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.375
is pumping all that
caustic crap gas

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.419
straight into the lake above us.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.837
Gadoll are echinoderms,

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:27.007
and the factory uses that lake
as their growth medium.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.883
Right now, their bodies
should be soaking up

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:32.846
all this pollution like
a bunch of big ugly sponges.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.101
[JILL] And our
friends up in the factory

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:42.063
are probably having
a very unusual day at work.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:45.817
Ugh. Not here dammit!

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:46.776

Tell me what
the hell's going on!

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.322
Pollution levels in
the lake are spiking, sir!

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.366
Now we're getting
a stress response.

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.118
The Gadoll are
firing their zones!

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.245
Kill the zones,
turn 'em off remotely!

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:58.329
[SUBORDINATE A]
I could do that.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.998
But at the rate the
pollution is increasing,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.666
we would need a lot
of time to get it back to‐‐

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.918
[FACTORY MANAGER] I don't
need the details, just fix it!

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.674
Whoa.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.265
[KABURAGI] All right,
we've made it to the entrance.

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.142
Let's go.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.643
Roger that.

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.315
What's going on here?

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:26.816
It doesn't seem right.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:30.403
Boss, this is where the Gadoll
really come from, isn't it?

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.404
[KABURAGI]
It is.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.323
Whatever questions
you have right now,

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:34.574
you'll have time
to worry about them

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.868
once we've finished the mission.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.370
Stay alive, reach the target.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.997
Those five words
should be the only thoughts

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.583
going through your head, got it?

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:47.045
Got it. What?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.131
Keep close.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.765
[FACTORY WORKER A]
How long's it gonna take?

00:09:58.807 --> 00:09:59.891
Get rid of this zone!

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:00.934
[FACTORY WORKER B]
I'm trying to!

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.812
Dammit! What's going on here?

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.190
[WORKER A]
Why is there a zone?

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.567
[KABURAGI]
This way.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.694
[WORKER B]
This is not good!

[KABURAGI]
Perfect.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.534
Looks like security's
been dealt with.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.369
Should be a straight shot.

How the hell?

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.959
It would appear
you've allowed me

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.336
to get the drop on you, friend.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.427
What are you two doing here?

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.428
[HUGIN]
Stopping you.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.097
I would also note
that your physical body

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.474
is at imminent risk
of destruction.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.601
You really should be concerned.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.187
You really should kiss my ass.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.231
[HUGIN] I've finally seen
your pet Tanker.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:52.026
And indeed, it would appear
that the system still cannot.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.656
[HUGIN]
We both know how this will end.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:11:00.410
Because we both know
the world must be free of bugs.

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:06.749
Yeah, we got 'em,
like this, do it like this, see?

[BUGS cheer]

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:12.755
How can they cheer

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:16.426
standing knee‐deep
in an actual turd fire?

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:17.677
Either way, all that's left now

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:21.097
is for Kaburagi to finish
his part of the operation.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.017
It really looks
like they're pullin' it off!

[BUG G]
Who cares, the fight's over!

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.550
They're still breathing
in turd gas. They'll puke!

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:58.593
You punks think
we're scared of you?

Wait, take a closer look!

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.180
They're different from
the guys we fought before!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.599
More different than
you could have guessed.

You can expose their noses!

[JILL] The reinforcements
brought better equipment?

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.200
But that stuff shouldn't have
been ready for deployment yet!

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:23.493
Who snitched?

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:25.119
How... How could they?

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:26.871
It's a massacre.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.998
You said they'd be saved!

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.126
We didn't rat on Donatello
and Kaburagi for this!

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.295
And who exactly is "we"?

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:37.423
Sark, your guilty conscience
is your problem.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.385
But I... I was...

This isn't what I wanted.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.555
[TURKEY]
Listen. We helped the system,

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.934
and this is how
it restores order.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.477
You should be proud.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.938
You're not the bad guy here.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.189
But our friends...

[TURKEY]
We're the good guys.

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:58.486
Doing an ugly,

You understand, don't you?

And you did the right thing.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.203
Yeah, I did.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.705
'Cause it had to be done.

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:13.293
[TURKEY] Exactly. We start this
place over from a clean slate.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.712
That's best for everyone.

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:18.047
And you're gonna
be my number two.

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.675
Right, comrade?

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:26.180
You. Show us where
the bugs are logging in from.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:26.889
Yes, sir!

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.599
We can take you
straight to them.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.018
Hey, Sark, lead the way.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.561
[SARKOZY]
Sure thing, pal.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.858
The world's biggest asshole
and his drunken uncle.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.735
If the response team
manages to get in here,

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:42.155
this whole plan
is dead in the water.

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:44.365
I've got no choice.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.703
[DONATELLO] Hell yeah,
let's beat their asses!

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:52.582

You good?

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.424
I'll log out when the
hell I want, two‐eyes!

Plug me back in now!

any more pissed off, manchild!

'Kay?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.603
[JILL] Now either you can go put
that oversized toy of a body

to good use and
keep this operation alive,

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.108
or I can have some fun with it.

How much of you do
you suppose I can cut off

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.616

[DONATELLO]
Right, the operation.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.703
I should go help with that.

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:32.747
I'm gonna go help with that!

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:34.957
Yeah, thanks.

be standing there?

[NATSUME]
Boss!

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:55.895

[HUGIN
"Run," you say?

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.247
I cannot allow that.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.959
Bug eliminated.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.128
Now, onto the next.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.134
[KABURAGI] Cutting it
close there, aren't you, Jill?

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:27.885
What's all this?

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:31.264
[JILL] Yeah, well, that
one is on Turkey and Sark.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.307
You don't know how hard
it is to hack a game cop,

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.810
and that's without a
damn knife in your back.

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.937
So how about you
spare me your whining?

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:40.731
Nobody should be capable
of hacking our sight.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.609
It seems the bugs somehow
have a witch in their employ.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.903
Oh, yeah. It's crazy
what people just throw out

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.738
with the garbage sometimes.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.659
Yes, the sheer mockery.

His willful impudence!

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:56.664
We shan't abide
this transgression.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.878
Damn, this new security
agent they put in

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.088
is punching back pretty hard.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.472
Oh dear.

00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:13.431
[JILL]
The clock's ticking.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:15.266
They haven't gotten
to me and your body yet,

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:18.144
but there's nothing
holding them back anymore!

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:22.648
[KABURAGI]
Doesn't change anything.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.193
Just gotta push
myself to my limits!

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:33.868
Why are you stopping?

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.620
Get a move on, bug.

Nah. I can't do it fellas.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.792
I'm done. I don't got the heart.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:45.838
So, you're saying you plan to
impede us from restoring order.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.800

Ooh, me too!

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.220
I like the direction
we're goin'.

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:56.849
Damn!

End of the line, y'all.

Heh. Nice run,
but I'm callin' it here.

So we invite you to the party,

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.405
and you go and throw
another one for the guards.

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.074
I'm always looking
for new friends,

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.952
that's why I invited Hugin
along on the storage job.

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.912
[DONATELLO]
You conniving little bastard.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:18.704
Piss off!

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:21.874
The system works if you just
sit back and stop fighting it!

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.543
Hah! Might work for you.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:26.379
Doing what I please
is what works for me.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.630
Hey, that's fine.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.966
Knock yourself out,
it's your party.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.593
[DONATELLO]
I don't need your permission!

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.140
Smells like roast turds in here!

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.896
Die, die, die!

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.733
Get movin' or get dead!

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.741
What the hell are you?

Back him up, guys!

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.415

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:07.253
Turkey, my old pal. Heh...

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.547
They put a new hole in me.

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:10.923
But hey...

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.717
I'm still movin'.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:15.303
We got a chance of
gettin' outta this thing.

Heh. You rube.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:21.017
I already told you,
there is no "we."

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:21.851
What?

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.728
I'm the winner here.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.314
You're just dead weight.

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.190
You... You lied.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:32.862
You said we were gonna
make this place better!

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.780
Sounds about right to me!

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.657
I'd say it's the
best it's ever been.

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:39.577
All the shit's burning up and
I'm gettin' out with a pardon.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.245
That's two big improvements.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.748
This operation'll
be shutting down for sure.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:46.792
Might as well do the same,
for all the good you've done.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:52.715
"For all the good I've done"?

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.926
Not a lot I can say to that.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.470
What do I do, Kabu?

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:58.971
I guess I still ain't
got the hang of this

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:01.307
"doin' the right thing" deal.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.684
I dunno what the
right thing even is.

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:07.813
Hell, I don't know what I want.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.774
I'm just living scrap.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.199
But I'm not gonna stop
till I've pushed past my limits.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.159
So it's like that.

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:24.955
I'm scrap. But I'm still livin'.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:32.380
Yo.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:35.299
Leaving without sayin' goodbye?

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:39.220
This party sucks ass! Later!

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:50.106
I had a burner account
and some good booze.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.775
I didn't need anything else!

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.485
Well, you coulda told me.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.323
If you're that into
the shit they feed us,

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.242
why don't ya take a swim in it?

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:03.411
[TURKEY]
No!

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:12.962
Kabu. I've barely got
a damn thing in this world.

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.964
There's just one thing...

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:17.216
...I've held onto.

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.844
That nobody else could do.

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:24.306
My special reserve.

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:30.479
[screams]

00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:32.648
Hey, somebody help!

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.650
Sark, please!

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.403
This is what the hero
would do, isn't it?

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:40.823
Wait, Sark! Help me!
We can still get out!

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.586
Oh, come on.

00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:59.425
[SARKOZY]
Not a bad way to go.

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:15.399
We got the zone
response dealt with,

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:17.401
so what the hell is it now?

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.445
[SUBORDINATE A]
An explosion down below.

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.280
The reactor's disabled.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.532
Wait. It's melting down!

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.409
[FACTORY MANAGER ]
That can't be right!

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.711
The reactor was destroyed?

00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:38.506
Just how many allies
did you have in this?

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:39.924
Who could say?

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.759
[HUGIN] I can easily keep
you from ever connecting

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.470
‐‐to an avatar again.
‐‐[NATSUME] Boss! The water!

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.013
[HUGIN]
Hmm?

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:47.556
Shit!

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.771
Boss! You okay?

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:56.148
Yeah. Or not dead at least.

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:02.905
Activate the G. G. S.,
and the whole thing is over.

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:06.200
Damn. Ya done good, Sark.

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:07.618
Here's to you.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.209
[KABURAGI] All right,
we've reached the objective.

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:19.588
What is this?

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.465
Boss! Are you sure you're okay?

00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:23.133
Just try not to move!

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:24.760
[KABURAGI]
I'm fine.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.516
You take that one.

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.726
Yeah, I got it.

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:34.603
I'm gonna count down from three.

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:36.522
Then we both hit the plungers.

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:38.190
[NATSUME]
Yes, sir.

00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:47.116
On me. Three. Two. One.

00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:07.887
[KATOU]
That's not normal.

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:10.431
[ESSAM]
It's gotta be a bug, right?

00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:13.267
Natsume, you really did it.

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:16.020
[OPERATOR C]
Commander! The Gadoll are dying.

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:16.979
All of them!

00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:18.647
[OPERATOR A]
This is an extinction event!

00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:21.066
[OPERATOR B]
What's happening?

00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:22.818
You've ruined it!

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.157
What is this?

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:30.492
[KABURAGI] You need
to get out of here, Natsume.

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:31.952
[NATSUME]
This is wrong.

00:23:31.994 --> 00:23:34.580
How could the Gadoll
have come from here?

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:37.917
Why is their "nest" built out
of glass and concrete?

00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:39.585
Who was that man you fought?

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:42.504
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.382
Forgive me.

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:48.427
Everything about
the world you know...

00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:49.803
The Gadoll...

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:53.098
This body you see me in...

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.267
It's all manufactured.
