WEBVTT

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:13.096
[NATSUME] So if you're
telling me these "rules"

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:16.308
or whatever are the real enemy,
then point me at 'em,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.560
and I'll go put a needle in 'em.

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:21.605
[KABURAGI]
Hmm...

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:23.565
Sounds good. Now let's‐‐

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:25.526
Ugh!!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.407
[NATSUME]
Huh?

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.576
Boss!

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.414
I'm afraid you
won't be leaving here.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.167
For the world must be
free of bugs, you see.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:49.508
[OMEGA roaring]

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.482
[SONNY]
What the hell is that?

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.025
Did one of 'em survive?

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.818
Sure does look that way.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.321
'Cause I thought that
was literally impossible.

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:37.658
A new Gadoll.
Was it hidden somewhere?

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.867
No, there's no way.

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.160
But, sir.

00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:43.246
Every single Gadoll
was connected to the GGS.

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.874
It's hard‐coded into
all of their control chips.

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:49.044
Uh?! This thing
doesn't have an ID!

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.671
We have an unchipped Gadoll!

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.173
The system has
no way to control it!

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.342
[MINATO]
Put in a request for orders now!

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:58.387
In the meantime,
activate Deca‐dence!

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.765
Was that a Gadoll?

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:04.184
These bugs are multiplying.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.148
Yes, understood.
I'll take care of this.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.661
I've lost a great deal
of time to bugs lately.

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.913
So let's not draw this out.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:44.433
[KABURAGI]
Natsume! Natsume!

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.518
Hey. Are you still with me?

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:49.771
Natsume!

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.194
[NATSUME shrieks]

00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:00.240
Ah! What the hell? Wait, Boss!

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:03.034
Please, Boss! Open your eyes!

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.495
Please. Stay with me.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.831
Ugh.... You really
need to chill out.

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.584
Please, don't leave me.
Please, don't die!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.793
Back here.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.379
[gasps]

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:18.300
It's you, from before,
but what are you doing in here?

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.344
Keeping my old boss
from killing you.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.555
That was just the
body I'd been using.

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:27.893
Like I said, it's a
manufactured avatar. I'm fine.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.522
So you're telling me,
you're the "boss."

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.567
[KABURAGI] I can see how it'd
be confusing for you, but yeah.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.486
It's still Kaburagi in here.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.030
Now you are still
gonna help me, right?

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:43.033
It really is you.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.869
As long as I can punch you!

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.079
Was the one shot not enough?

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.962
[NATSUME]
Then that noise I heard before.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.839
[KABURAGI]
Yeah. One of them lived.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.927
Or rather. One was
spawned after the end.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.011
That's impossible;

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.180
Gadoll have no way
to reproduce on their own!

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:07.265
It couldn't have spawned
with the factory gone!

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.767
Feel free to go tell it that,

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.727
but I don't think it's
gonna be convinced.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.604
I'd need a sample to guess how,

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.815
but the thing's here
in front of us, right?

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.901
The Gadoll are manufactured
with a narrow set of behaviors.

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:21.571
They're barely autonomous,
to say nothing about free will.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.365
This could be a flash
mutation in response

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.659
to the prospect of extinction.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.827
Whatever happened, though,

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.746
to the system it's
just another bug.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:30.997
[KABURAGI]
Really?

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.417
A system this complex has
weak points and blind spots.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.211
The bugs will always
find their way in.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:39.464
It's hubris to think
you can keep them out.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.633
So this Gadoll is a bug.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.677
It's the same as me.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:52.143
Bye, Pipe. I'm sorry.

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.740
Now, let's go.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:06.992
Right.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.744
[OPERATOR A]
Halting Deca‐dence.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.377
[MINATO]
It's not attacking us.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.754
Does that mean it doesn't
have a target programmed?

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:20.839
[OPERATOR C]
Commander!

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.674
Orders've just come in
from the system.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.634
We are to engage and
destroy the novel Gadoll

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.012
now designated "Omega"
using Deca‐dence.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.598
Got it. Fire blood‐sucking
harpoons!

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.182
Target is Omega!

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.324
The breach in
the tank is still open,

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.284
so we can't charge
to full power.

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.661
Oxyone is at 58 percent!

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:52.954
But we can't wait.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.206
Fire when the charge
reaches 60 percent!

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:58.793
[OPERATOR B] Roger that, sir.
Igniting cannon!

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.593
[OPERATOR A]
Firing preparations complete.

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:11.389
In five, four, three, two, one!

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.016
Fire now!

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:26.696
There's no way.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.075
It caught us?

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.285
[OPERATOR C]
The armor has been damaged!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.249
[MINATO] Get clear. Retract
the arm at full speed now!

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.251
It's overpowering us!

[gasps]

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.617
What's going on out there?

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:20.250
Damage assessment!

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.252
[OPERATOR A] Movement
is 75 percent inoperative!

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.962
[MINATO]
Shit! Can we run?

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.797
[OPERATOR A]
Negative, sir!

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.424
[OPERATOR C]
Omega has gone silent!

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.093
It might be going dormant
to recover from the strike!

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.429
Commander. Incoming message!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.390
The system is launching a Solid
Cannon strike against Omega!

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:38.268
Ah... That at least
buys some time.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.936
Get a full sitrep now!

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.229
[OPERATORS]
Yes, sir!

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.113
Commander!

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:53.408
Omega's rate of cellular
division has started to spike!

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.493
So what now?

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.836
It just evolved?

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:14.179
System update, sir.
Solid Cannon online.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.805
Ready to fire!

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:20.602
[OPERATOR C]
Something's wrong.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.313
Omega is accumulating
oxyone energy!

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:24.814
Firing!

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.206
[CYBORG B]
What's going on?

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.667
Oh crap! What the hell is that?

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.549
Goodness me.
This is a surprise.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.718
[MUNIN]
Pi pa pi, pa!

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.137
[HUGIN]
Then the time has come?

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.138
Very well.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.142
It would seem my part in this
has at last reached its end.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:04.604
[MUNIN]
Pipa! Pipa pipa, pi pa.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.859
How can this be happening?

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:10.777
[OPERATOR C]
Commander!

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.196
Omega's cellular
division rate has crashed!

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:16.199
It appears to be sleeping!

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.992
Damage to headquarters
is unknown.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.620
But based on
the information we have.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.997
[MUNIN]
Commander Minato.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.916
Our sincerest thanks
to you and your staff

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.127
for many years
of exemplary work.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.629
A decision was made to
terminate the Deca‐dence service

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.131
until further notice.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.341
What?

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:36.177
[MUNIN] The Eurasian dome will
be closed, and its contents,

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.429
including Omega
and your facility,

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.474
will be reverted via the
Spatial Compression Device.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.611
The countdown sequence
has been initiated.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.655
Consult your
display for details.

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:59.367
In accordance with protocol,
all users must log out.

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:01.286
[GEAR A] You're telling us
to log out now?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.746
You just dropped a giant
Gadoll in front of us!

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.623
[GEAR C]
I figured it was all an event!

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.834
And are there any
new orders for the staff?

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.211
[MUNIN] As of this moment,
you have no orders.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.463
The company must
conduct itself as to facilitate

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.549
its continued operation.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.468
Accordingly, resources will be
expended as necessary

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.470
to preserve the system.

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.151
[NATSUME gasps]

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.279
No way. What is that?

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:40.491
[KABURAGI] Jill, do you copy?
What's going on?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.243
[MINATO]
Kabu. Can you hear me?

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.537
[KABURAGI] I'm here, Minato.
What's happening?

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:48.249
[MINATO] The endgame.
Deca‐dence is shutting down.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.586
[KABURAGI] What? Is that what
this timer's counting down to?

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.504
[MINATO]
Yeah. When it hits zero,

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.674
they're collapsing the dome,
and there's nothing we can do.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.968
[JILL] There is.
We've got the fortress.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.511
[KABURAGI]
Jill! You're okay?

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.222
[JILL]
Everything is fine here.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.974
We're all safe and
communications are back up.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.726
[MINATO]
Who are you exactly?

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:10.480
[JILL] Ah, that must be
Commander Minato, retired.

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:12.857
Don't mind me,
I'm just another bug.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.776
[KABURAGI] What were you
saying about the fortress?

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:17.695
[JILL] There's still one avatar
we could log in with.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.572
Deca‐dence itself.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:20.865
[MINATO]
That's ridiculous!

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.408
There's no way for
a cyborg to connect‐‐

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.993
[JILL]
Oh, there certainly is.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.079
Though it's not without risk.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.455
[KABURAGI]
You're sure of that?

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.833
[JILL] Very. I do know a fair
bit about Deca‐dence's core,

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.753
considering I was part of
the team that developed it.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.632
Our bodies are under
the control of the system,

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:41.010
but a cyborg's core operates
completely autonomously.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:43.388
One of us could link cores
directly with Deca‐dence

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.722
and take control.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.684
By "us," I mean "you,"
of course.

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:50.937
[KABURAGI]
I'll do it.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:51.854
[MINATO]
Even if she's right,

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.649
what's the point of hijacking
Deca‐dence now?

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.943
It's crippled,
you'd be a sitting duck!

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.237
[KABURAGI]
We have to take out this Gadoll.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.656
and this is the only option
we have right now.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.284
[MINATO] We don't...
Enough of these suicidal plans.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.161
Let it go and get clear
of the area already.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:08.204
[NATSUME gasps]

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.707
Boss. Come quick! Look at this!

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:12.667
The big Gadoll's got
a bunch of little Gadoll

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:13.710
crawling out of it.

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:17.714
and it's super, super gross,
but I can't turn away.

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:18.673
[KABURAGI]
We're out of time.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.300
Make it happen, Jill.

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:21.718
[JILL]
Understood.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:23.303
[MINATO]
Don't do this!

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.138
Bastard!

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:27.265
Boss. We gotta hurry!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.310
Go ahead. There's still
something I gotta take care of.

00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:33.521
Like what?
What could you possibly‐‐

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.829
You're really
gonna do this, huh?

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.582
There's one thing I don't get.

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:54.292
You're a bug.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.128
I dunno what there is to get.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.839
Someone wrote these
rules the system runs on.

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.675
And I did something that
someone wouldn't approve of.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.427
If you want the specifics,

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:07.597
I guess ya gotta ask the system.

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:10.141
Here's hopin' I get that chance.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.025
The Gadoll just disappeared
right in front of our eyes.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.985
So where the hell
did these come from?

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.278
Hey, how would I know?

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.155
We found out when you did.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:28.201
Makin' me leave halfway through
a perfectly good drink.

00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:30.536
All right, boys. Let's go!

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.123
[SOLDIER A]
Let's wreck 'em!

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.334
[SOLDIER B]
Watch it!

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.631
[KURENAI]
I gotta lie down.

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:43.216
Yeah, you were
going pretty hard.

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:44.717
Too hard.

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:51.974
[NATSUME]
Everyone okay?

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.394
[KURENAI] Yeah.
Is your boss out here with you?

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:57.605
He's taking care of a mission
that no one else can do.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:00.274
'Course he is.
And we've got a mission too.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.776
Let's get back to it!

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.361
[NATSUME]
Yes, ma'am!

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:10.410
[cheering]

00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.203
[KABURAGI]
How much longer?

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.163
[JILL]
We're almost there.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.916
Nobody's ever actually tried to
connect to Deca‐dence like this,

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.669
but it should work. In theory.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.130
You really are tough
to figure out.

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.381
You act cold and distant,

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.466
but you've done so
much for all of us.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.302
I can't tell which side
is really you.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.681
Well I am a bug.

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:32.849
[KABURAGI]
Jill?

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.102
[JILL] Bugs are a symptom
and a cause of uncertainty.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:37.520
We wanted a perfect system,

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:40.231
and we thought that
meant one without bugs.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.774
We were so scared of the unknown

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:45.194
that we lost sight of all
the possibilities it can hold.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:48.990
Sometimes you have to embrace
uncertainty to move forward.

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.785
It's a shame I couldn't
convince them back then.

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.496
You sound, um, happy?

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:56.622
You're all set.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.291
It'll be enabled
once you reboot,

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:00.793
then you're ready to plug
yourself into Deca‐dence.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:04.630
And remember: Whatever
happens next is on you.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:05.715
[KABURAGI]
Like I said,

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:07.675
I've made my choice.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:13.973
[JILL] I always wondered
what would happen

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:17.852
if someone set off
that bug I never reported.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.146
And now I get to find out.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:24.317
[KURENAI]
Hold the line!

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.986
We need to buy Deca‐dence
enough time to reactivate!

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:28.946
Don't let a single
enemy break through!

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.948
Yes, ma'am! You heard her.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.366
Hell yeah, we're ready!

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.826
Just another day at work!

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.329
You gonna let them show us up?

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.955
Let's go, boys!

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:43.753
[RANDOM GEAR]
Take it out!

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.857
[KABURAGI] See you on
the other side, Natsume.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.819
That was weird.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.812
[MINATO]
Kabu, wait!

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:44.605
[KABURAGI]
Minato?

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.898
[MINATO]
Enough already.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.234
We gotta get out of here, now.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.777
What would that do?

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.238
Where can we go after all this?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.240
[MINATO] We'll have time
to figure that out later.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.867
Please, we can still make it
out of here if we just‐‐

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.537
[KABURAGI] I'm sorry,
but I can't go with you now.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.998
You won't do anything
by dying here!

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.083
You can't win!

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.712
[KABURAGI] But I can't give up.
I have to try.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.423
For that Tanker, right?

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:13.009
For some leftover human?

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.846
[KABURAGI] This might
be a mistake. It's true.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.098
And that's why I have to do it.

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.686
You're insane!

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.981
Even in the middle of this,
you have zero doubts!

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.734
I don't understand
anything anymore.

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.277
I can't trust the system.

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.821
Or even myself.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:37.825
What do you do when
every option seems wrong?

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.744
I'm lost.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.708
[BUG A]
I love life on the outside!

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.002

[laughter]

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.340
Whoa. What're those?

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.842
And are they alive?
They're like toys.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.219
Huh?! Look! A Tanker!

00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:59.347
[BUG D]
Whoa, a Tanker in the flesh!

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.265
[RANDOM BUG G] Haven't seen
one of those in a while!

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.516
Looks like she's spooked!

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:04.268
Maybe she's broken.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.187
Well! What a surprise.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:08.272
So you're Natsume the human bug.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:11.400
Huh?! That one knows
my name somehow.

00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:12.693
Welcome to the party.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:14.862
We're Kaburagi's
partners in crime.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.281
You've probably seen
some of us in Gear form,

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.617
but our real bodies
look like this.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.619
Except the guy
who looks like this.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.120
[gasps]

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.997
Wait. So...

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:28.751
Then my boss has been a little
toy‐person like you all along?

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:32.963
[JILL] He and I are actually
a pretty similar form factor.

00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:34.882
[RANDOM BUG G] Who's this
"Boss" she's talkin' about?

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:35.883
Why'd she stop?

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:39.136
Hey! You're lucky
lookin's free lady!

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:44.809
Oh my gosh. That's adorable.

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:47.144
You guys are so cute!

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:48.813
She thinks we're cute?

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.231
[BUG I]
Apparently we're cute.

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:51.190
Am I cute?

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.566
Of course you're not!

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:54.193
Well, if you're friends
of the boss,

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.362
then I wanna be
friends with you!

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.239
It's good to meet everyone.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.324
The name's Natsume. How are you?

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:01.409
It's a pleasure. Hi there!

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.413
Suddenly it all makes sense.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:08.791
So you're feeling lost, huh?

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.459
I remember that.

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:11.252
For the longest time,

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:14.922
I was just going through the
motions, waiting to be scrapped.

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.633
Then I found a bug,
and that saved me.

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.343
[gasps]

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:23.139
The system demanded that I erase
the bug, but I disagreed.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.433
So I made a choice.

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.393
I did what I thought was right.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:30.146
Huh?

00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:32.356
I understand.

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.860
Minato.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:39.989
The way the plug's situated,
I can't actually do this alone.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.073
Could use your help.

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.575
[MINATO]
I know that's a lie.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.869
If I can't finish this thing,

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.247
everything is still gonna
be gone after the reversion.

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:53.544
[MINATO]
What was that? A threat?

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:57.006
If that's how it sounds,
then sure go with that.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.134
You knew I would
follow you to the core.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.136
You've been planning
this the entire time!

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.763
'Course I have.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:06.348
So you ready to
be partners again?

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:12.730
[laughs]

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:20.863
Thank you for this.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.783
I think it's fair to say I've
gone full bug at this point.

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.743
How's it feel?

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.578
Hard to say.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.372
My case isn't nearly
as advanced as yours.

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:43.219
Go time. Godspeed, Commander.

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.138
Yeah.

00:21:57.483 --> 00:21:59.068
We're approaching
the intercept point.

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.904
Time to show 'em
what a top rank means.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.573
We both know
what we're here to do.

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:18.170
Okay. Are you ready, Kabu?

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.303
Deca‐dence. Activate!
