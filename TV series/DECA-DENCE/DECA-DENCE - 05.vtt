WEBVTT

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.768
[MARCHEN] All right,
squad 6, eyes on me!

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.188
Let's take out Gadoll alpha
and blow this fog away!

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.564
The air here is thin.

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.525
We can't afford to waste energy.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.860
Do what you have to do,
but be efficient!

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:27.903
This is it.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:28.987
The final battle!

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.616
We'll complete this mission,
whatever it takes! Got that?

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.201
[GEARS]
Sir!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.496
That idiot!

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.460
Move out!

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.109
[GEAR A]
Eat this!

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.986
[GEAR B]
Toss me a weapon, someone!

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:35.155
[GEAR C]
Need heals!

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.366
[MARCHEN]
Don't stop, it's not our fight!

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:40.452
Gadoll alpha's location
is at ten o'clock!

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:43.205
I can barely see anything
through all the fog.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.623
Wait.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.086
Hey, Kurenai!

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.797
I'll see you on the other side!

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.715
[MINDY]
Is this a game to you, rook?

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.217
No, of course not.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.301
I was just‐‐

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.720
Best you stop
treating it like one.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.263
Losing means death.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.765
Right, sorry.

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.892
Think about nothing but winning.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.062
[NATSUME]
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:13.985
[DOTKIN] Seems like you
wanna taste, buddy!

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.487
Well since you asked nicely,

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.615
you get to become a notch
in the belt of the great Dotkin!

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.329
[laughs]

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.164
[ESSAM]
Honestly. I swear.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.624
Your lack of refinement...

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.626
...never fails to disgust me!

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.254
En garde!

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:37.759
Got 'em!

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.388
[ESSAM]
Oh, you are a dick and a half!

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.140
[DOTKIN]
Kill‐stealing asshole!

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.809
Damn, they're tearin' it up
like the fog's not even here.

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:49.271
Right? S‐rankers are sick!

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.439
Small fry.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.189
[beeping]

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.274
Huh?

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.483
Ain't that a shame.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.860
They're fighting alpha.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.320
And it's kicking their asses.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:58.488
[KATOU]
Wait, no joke?

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.241
That was a C‐rank mission.

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:02.492
This is weird.

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:15.505
[MENDY]
It's way too quiet.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.091
This is the right place,
so where's Gadoll alpha?

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:18.717
[MUNDY]
Hey.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.886
Maybe the Gears took
it down already.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.763
Sure would be nice
to walk right into that nest

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.848
without a scratch on us.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.144
[MARCHEN]
What's that?

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.527
Oh no. The Gears.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.709
We've located the target!

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.002
Complete the mission!

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.171
Kill Gadoll alpha!

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.134
This ends now!

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.228
The hell?

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.564
Gomez! You are
gonna pay for that!

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:21.655
What?

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.741
Hold on. There's no way!

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:27.077
It's aiming for our tanks!

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.496
Both of you. Fall back now!

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:30.205
[MENDY]
Mindy, wait!

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:31.748
[MINDY]
Just do it!

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.882
Natsume!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.476
Natsume!

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.526
Mindy!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.030
[NATSUME]
Why would you...?

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:06.116
You okay?

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.701
‐‐[NATSUME] Please.
‐‐[MENDY] Mindy!

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:10.287
[MINDY]
I've seen it too many times.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:12.122
Kids charging into death.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.915
I couldn't let it happen again.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.333
But I didn't...

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.003
None of this is on you, rookie.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:21.506
Don't slow down.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:25.385
I made my choice,
and I'll stick to it,

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:28.471
till the end, no matter what.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:40.567
We're screwed.

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:42.027
If this goes on...

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.487
...the whole squad'll
be wiped out.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.072
Hey, wait.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.700
What are you gonna do?

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:04.132
I'll make you bleed!

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.387
[roars]

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.805
Amazing.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.148
Oh no!

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.858
No way.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.070
[MUNDY]
It pulled the needle out!

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.489
But that can't be.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.033
What are you?

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.706
[KABURAGI]
Didn't I tell you?

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.625
You bit off more
than you can chew this time.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.251
[gasps]

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.254
Boss, you came?

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:57.769
[ANNOUNCER] The event
will begin in 15 minutes.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:58.895
All staff, please report

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:00.772
to your designated
stations immediately.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:01.648
You're kidding.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.608
She's going out there with them?

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.485
That little idiot!

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.904
[ANNOUNCER]
All staff, please report...

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:10.907
[KABURAGI]
Hey, Minato.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:13.702
That Gadoll that's
generating the fog barrier.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:14.577
No way it goes down

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:16.830
without the system
noticing, right?

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.416
[MINATO] What, that the
unkillable Gadoll got killed?

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.835
Yeah, should be a safe bet.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:24.671
[KABURAGI] Sorry, I guess that
was kind of a silly question.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.172
[MINATO]
What are you gearing up for?

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.842
I told you to lay low
till the event is over.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:31.553
[KABURAGI] Just wanna shake
the rust off real quick.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.096
The users'll go for it too.

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.056
[MINATO] The users? What
the hell's that supposed to‐‐?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.272
[NATSUME gasps]
Boss, you came?

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.565
Didn't I tell you?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.859
You bit off more than
you can chew this time.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.193
Oh. Well my mind kinda blanked

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:50.488
after I watched you jam
that needle into my tank.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:53.950
Right.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.244
Sorry, I guess that's on me!

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.176
[MENDY]
What happened?

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.844
Can't see anything!

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.929
[KABURAGI]
Come on!

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.515
[NATSUME]
Wait a sec, Boss!

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.353
My whole squad
is still back there.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.646
We can't run away!

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:24.731
We have to.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.483
I can't beat that Gadoll.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.276
[gasps]

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:30.653
Not even you.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.699
No, that's exactly why
we need to help them, Boss!

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.367
It'd be suicide.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.286
If you stay here, you'll die.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.496
Wait. We can‐‐

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.539
[KABURAGI]
We can't.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.800
I swore an oath to myself.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:56.721
That I'd push my limits and
smash every wall in my way!

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.099
I have to break
through this damn wall!

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.312
Your limits, huh?

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.396
Oh, man.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.565
That really does take me back.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.201
Even in this fog, that thing
knows exactly where we are.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.205
[MUNDY]
Dammit. Where'd it go?

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.875
Please. Forgive me for all this.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.377
[GOMEZ]
Reinforcements are coming.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:28.670
You have to get out.

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.463
Do we die here?

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:34.926
[NATSUME roars]

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.805
Over here, scumbag!

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:41.975
Now! Get moving!

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.437
Come on.
We gotta get to safety now!

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.647
Natsume? How did‐‐

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:50.066
[NATSUME]
I'll tell you later. Just go!

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:58.616
[MINATO]
What in the hell are you doing?

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.243
Stop fighting it!

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.038
[KABURAGI]
The plan's not gonna work.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.833
I can't just leave
them here to die.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:07.542
[MINATO]
What?

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:12.046
There's no way you're really
doing all this for some Tankers!

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.507
[KABURAGI]
If I leave, she's dead.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.259
[MINATO]
Have you lost your damn mind?

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:17.343
Just run!

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.012
The Gadoll won't chase you!

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:21.181
You can go back
to how things were!

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.516
You can still get out of this!

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.686
Are you gonna throw
that away over a Tanker?

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.771
[KABURAGI]
That girl is a bug.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.357
[KABURAGI] This world's
been trying her whole life

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.026
to kill her,

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.362
but she pushed through and
fought for what she believed in.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.239
She did what I couldn't!

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.910
[MINATO]
A limiter release?

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.786
Listen to me.
If that Gadoll dies,

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:46.331
the story goes
completely off the rails!

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.082
Kabu!

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.585
There's no coming
back from this!

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:54.505
Even so, I refuse
to just let that girl die!

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.467
I can't! She's a bug.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.260
[MINATO]
Stop!

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:02.430
And that bug saved me!

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.859
Wrong way.

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.147
[OPERATOR B]
Commander.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:57.110
It appears Gadoll alpha's
vital signs have disappeared.

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.486
That lunatic.

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.029
[OPERATOR C]
Air pressure control lost.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.156
Returning to normal levels!

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.700
Huh?

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:06.494
Team! Here comes the big one!

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.707
Doesn't seem like
the fog's letting up at all.

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:13.126
Which means we're stuck here.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.670
Okay, team, we've got no choice.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.423
What's that?

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.635
[KURENAI]
It must be the nest!

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.221
[TANKER A] That means
they beat Gadoll alpha!

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.472
[TANKER B]
They pulled it off!

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.559
We're up! Everyone
still in fighting shape.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.561
On me! Let's go!

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.938
[cheering]

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.940
[rumbling]

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.066
[TANKER C]
What is this?

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:37.942
[TANKER D]
What's happening?

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.569
[distant screaming]

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.529
[SOU]
What kinda scream is that?

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:48.328
[SOU] No. Uh‐uh.
There's no way that's real.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:51.039
It's real big,
and we pissed it off bad.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.624
Everyone! Take cover!

00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.672
[GEAR D]
What the hell is that?

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:24.364
That glow. Is it...?

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:25.573
[MENDY]
It's huge!

00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:26.657
And gross!

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.619
[MUNDY] What, we wake up
the Gadoll king or something?

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.704
[CYBORG A]
Oh jeez!

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:32.955
[CYBORG C]
What's going on?

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.415
[CYBORG B]
I'm scared!

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.837
Crap, crap, crap,
crap on a cracker!

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:40.880
This is bad.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.757
That build is not release‐ready!

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.175
Shut up!

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:46.803
You think freaking out's
gonna do anything for us?

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:49.514
Hey. Get that stargate
off the field, now!

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.515
Not how it works.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:51.516
Sorry 'bout ya!

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.644
Plus, all the players and the
Tankers have seen it already.

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.896
And they're losing their
whole friggin' minds over it.

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.065
You go worry about that!

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.818
[MINATO]
What?!

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.778
Deca‐dence. Activate!

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.197
Sir! But oxyone levels are low.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.282
The process will take
a bit longer than normal.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.325
[MINATO]
As fast as you can!

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.411
Fire blood‐sucking harpoons!

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.383
[OPERATOR A] The stargate
has deployed its zone!

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.014
[OPERATOR B]
Beginning oxyone transfer!

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:34.767
[OPERATOR A]
Still low, 42 percent capacity.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.186
Attention all warriors!

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:39.939
Your target is the
large‐size Gadoll, stargate!

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.984
Buy Deca‐dence enough time
to get into Intercept Form.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.027
This is an S‐rank mission!

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.612
I'm counting on you!

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.407
You sound way more
into this than usual.

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.409
Ha, I like that, Minato!

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.245
I'm gonna dance all
over these scrub‐lords!

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.830
[DOTKIN]
It's party time!

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.083
The war ends here.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.293
Let's go!

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.295
[GEARS cheer]

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.134
Is this what happens
when you break the story?

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:09.469
Unreal.

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:12.472
Hey, wait up!

00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:14.807
You're always
running off without me!

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.478
[HUGIN]
Yes. Gadoll alpha has fallen

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.230
at the hands of one
of our recovery agents.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:23.316
[MUNIN]
Pi‐pa‐pi‐pu‐pe!

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:24.317
Indeed.

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:27.361
This transgression
will not go unpunished.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:28.696
[DOTKIN, KATOU, ESSAM]
When you get to hell,

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.323
tell 'em who sent ya!

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:42.960
[KABURAGI]
What is that?

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.670
Ugh, it reeks!

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.719
[OPERATOR C] High‐density oxyone
energy signature detected

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.471
from the stargate!

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.070
Status report now!

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.113
[OPERATOR C] It appears
to have fired a pressurized jet

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.449
of raw oxyone
from its body, sir!

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.911
We'd taken a direct hit,
we'd all be dead right now!

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.829
That power's insane.

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.665
Was that blood?

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.832
That shot just winged us,

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.168
but it severed
the oxyone cables!

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.796
We're stuck at
66 percent capacity!

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:27.505
What now?

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.299
Do we call it in and ask them
to shut down the Gadoll?

00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:31.259
[MINATO]
No use.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.594
They wouldn't be able
to pull the plug in time.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.144
It wasn't out of
development yet.

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:43.980
[GEAR J]
Don't slow down!

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.401
If I can just bust that part.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:51.445
Hey, there, pal,

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:52.738
how bout ya lemme
borrow your piece.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.574
[GEAR J]
Huh? Bro, don't mess with me!

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:55.741
[KABURAGI]
Gimme it.

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:56.867
Boss, are you‐‐

00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:59.662
[GEAR J]
Thief!

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.497
[OPERATOR C]
Now connecting nerve cables!

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:09.797
[OPERATOR A]
Connection complete!

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:13.509
Deca‐dence Intercept Form,
ready to engage!

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:14.468
All ahead full.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.761
Get us within range.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.221
If we don't land
the kill shot now,

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.599
it's gonna blow us all away
with the counterstrike!

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.683
[OPERATOR B]
Sir!

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.184
[MINATO]
Ignite the Deca‐dence Cannon!

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.644
[OPERATOR A]
Yes, sir!

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:25.855
Energy signature's back.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.815
The stargate is
charging another shot!

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.025
[MINATO]
What?

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.067
[OPERATOR A]
We're not ready.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.278
The cannon won't ignite in time!

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.033
[GEAR F]
Here it comes!

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.075
[GEAR G]
Get clear!

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.503
[MINATO]
No!

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.105
Kabu.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.649
[OPERATOR B]
Deca‐dence fully anchored.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.735
Target is inside firing range!

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:15.279
[OPERATOR A]
Deca‐dence Cannon ignited!

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.533
Nasty.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.495
[MINATO]
Farewell, you grotesque monster.

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:27.708
Counterattack now!

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.126
Yes, sir!

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.426
[NATSUME]
It's beautiful.

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:21.053
[NATSUME]
What's up?

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:24.765
We won the final battle,
you can smile.

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:26.976
[KABURAGI]
Just hush.

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:29.395
[MINATO] Hey, Kabu,
way to step in it deep.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.564
[KABURAGI]
Sorry. What's gonna happen?

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:32.523
[MINATO]
No idea.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:33.232
I don't know if anyone's

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.568
ever just nuked a
storyline like that.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:36.819
But safe to say.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.821
They're gonna come down hard.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.198
I'm ready for whatever happens.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.176
Wait. Aren't those...?

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:02.011
No. No way.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:07.475
Looks like we
found the next stage.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.602
Cool, I needed a new challenge.

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:12.146
That's the least repugnant
thing I've heard you say.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.190
Wha...? What is this?

00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:18.027
But we won.
We wiped out the Gadoll.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.362
No. Did we...?

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.659
You won't succeed,

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:27.745
and the Gadoll aren't
going anywhere.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:31.916
It won't end. Tomorrow or ever.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:36.170
[NATSUME]
Boss, did you know that this‐‐

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.756
[KABURAGI]
Take good care of Pipe.

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:46.680
[NATSUME]
Boss?

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:57.191
You look quite well, Kaburagi.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:00.569
I trust that you already know
what brought about this meeting.

00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:01.737
[KABURAGI]
Yeah.

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.948
[HUGIN]
Repeat after me.

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:06.951
The world must be free of bugs.

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:14.959
The world will be free,
thanks to bugs.
