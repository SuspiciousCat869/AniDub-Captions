their devotion ran deep.

And to all of us,
at the cost of their own lives.

Even in the vastness

these warriors lived
fiercely and shone bright.

So let us take pride
in the way they lived,

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.960

Listen, Mikey.

What do you figure it's like
to have an arm ripped off?

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.378
Uh. Painful, I guess?

[TURKEY]
So yeah.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.559
If your avatar lost
an arm in a fight,

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.103
you'd get the sensory
feedback, and it'd hurt,

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.814
but your actual arm
would be totally fine, right?

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.399
Of course it'd be fine.

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.694
Nobody would play a game
that chops off their real limbs.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.697
But with your limiter released,
any damage taken by your avatar

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.575
would cause damage
to your real body too.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.911
Uh. Wouldn't that
be dangerous, though?

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:51.870
[TURKEY]
It is.

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:54.164
Screw up and you'll be
scrapped in a second.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.498
But at the same time,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.834
your avatar's restrictions
will be gone,

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:01.087
so its physical abilities
will get a huge boost.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.174
[MIKEY] Risk your body
and gain power in return.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.259
Yeah, that's the gist of it.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.469
This technique.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.428
You know it?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.513
[KABURAGI]
Nah. That's not my thing.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.099

by it, Mister Kaburagi!

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.768

I hear some freaks hacked it in

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.064
'cause they wanted more pain
than the game was givin' 'em.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.857
Screwin' around with that stuff.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.610
You'd have to be some
kinda nutjob or deviant.

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:24.611
Am I right?

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:26.821
[KABURAGI]
Sounds about right to me.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.115
[MINATO] Gentlemen,

and pretend
I didn't hear any of it.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.624

a top ranker means.

from the great Donatello.

all to shreds!

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.047

Hey, what's up Kaburagi?

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.222
Whoa, you got
the high‐grade oxyone!

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.473
Oh, hey there, Max.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.600
Looks like you're
jonesin' for some beams.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.311
Guess there's no
hidin' it from a top‐ranker.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.022
Think you could help me out?

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.482

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.442

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:49.029

I could get some oxyone too?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.322
[KABURAGI] Sorry but
that's gonna be a no‐go.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.920
Huh. Look, it's Mikey.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.007
It seems like he's been tearin'
up the rankings here lately.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.300
[KABURAGI]
Has he?

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:11.593
[MAX]
I mean obviously,

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.345
he's still nowhere close
to your level right now.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.014
Oh...

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.822
[KABURAGI]
Hmm.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.315
Hey. Sorry for
imposing on you like this.

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:09.567
[KABURAGI]
You're fine. Whaddya need?

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.570
[MIKEY] I feel like my progress
has been kinda slow lately,

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.906
and I was hoping you might
have some advice for me.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.409
Uh. You think this is slow?

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.121
Well. I came
pretty far, pretty fast,

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.455
but I kind of hit a plateau,

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:25.166
and I'm not sure
what's holding me back.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.712
Is there something wrong?

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.464
I get your point,

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.300
but I think you're better
off asking Donatello.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:36.803
Huh?

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.056
[MIKEY]
What's that on screen?

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.057
Forget it.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.100
I was right.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.227
You know the technique
to release the limiter!

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.979
You can teach me!

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.275
Tell me how!

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.735
You're a top‐ranking
player as it stands.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.405
You've got nothing
left to prove.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:57.198
[MIKEY]
There was a time

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.493
when I would have accepted
that without question.

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.911
That's what we are.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.621
The company's property.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:07.167
Interchangeable
pieces in a system.

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:08.084
I would have done my job

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:11.504
till I got scrapped like
we're all supposed to do.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.507
But then I made it
to the top ranks!

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.137
I can't go back now!

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.556
I refuse to be expendable!

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:27.812
But I know, at this rate,
I'm gonna lose my ranking.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.815
Do... Do you realize
you can't take it back?

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.150
[MIKEY]
I won't get caught!

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:35.111
There are plenty of players
getting away with it.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.863
[KABURAGI]
But we're the best of the best.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:38.156
It's different for us.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.199
If you get caught,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.159
you'll get written off
as a bug and scrapped.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.620
I have to break
through this damn wall!

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.496
[MIKEY]
Please!

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:46.873
I'm begging you.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.083
Help me take that step!

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.840
[KABURAGI]
Twenty percent and no more.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.092
Never exceed
the limiter's threshold

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.345
by more than 20 percent.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.598
That'll allow your body
to take a hit or two.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.310
Ah! Thank you so much, sir!

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.193
[DONATELLO]
The hell kinda face is that?

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.110
Cut it out.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.153
Hah, sorry.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:18.905
Just itchin' to get out there.

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:21.741
Are you thinking about
the fight or the rankings?

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.576
The fight, of course!

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:26.079
I'm really excited to be here!

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.164
[TURKEY]
If you say so.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.457
[MINATO]
Your attention, gentlemen.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.542
We're approaching
the intercept point.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.920
Get ready to do your thing.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.510
[MIKEY]
This is it.

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:41.844
More!

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.972
I need more!

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.777
[HUGIN]
The world must be free of bugs.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:01.698
[CYBORG C cries]
Mercy, please!

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.866
[MUNIN]
Pipa pipa, pipa!

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:07.036
[HUGIN] Violating
confidentiality is a major bug.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.746
We'll be repossessing this.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:11.666
It remains a valuable resource.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:18.089
[MUNIN]
Papi! Papi! Papi. Papi.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.426
Indeed. This matter
calls for decisive action.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.512
We can't abide cheating
in the top ranks.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.056
How horrible. Why?

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.766
Aww, Mikey.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:39.068
So. Spill it!
Who told him to do it?

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.320
Was it you, Turkey?

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.863
[TURKEY]
No! I swear!

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:43.948
[CYBORG E]
Back off, Donatello!

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.949
[CYBORG F]
Get off him!

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.326
[CYBORG H]
Stay out of this!

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.244
They're like children.

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:05.595
[HUGIN]
Kaburagi.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:08.056
Please pardon
the use of restraints.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.558
It has been deemed necessary
in light of recent actions

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.269
by your fellow top‐rankers.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.688
Why am I here?

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.648
Mikey was discovered
to have performed

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.652
a prohibited limiter release,
and accordingly, was scrapped.

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.905
Your team has been disbanded.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:26.532
The team? But they
had nothing to do with it!

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.703
[MIKEY] Risk your body
and gain power in return.

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:31.996
[KABURAGI]
I hear some freaks hacked it in

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:35.166
'cause they wanted more pain
than the game was givin' 'em.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.753
[HUGIN] From this exchange,
the system determined

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.256
that the issue will sow disorder
among ranking players.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.510
Going forward, you will
work to quell said disorder,

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.844
under our command.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:51.641
An armor repairer by day, and
then recovery agent by night.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:53.768
Recovering what?

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.938
[HUGIN]
A small, but significant portion

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:59.399
of the human population
may become capable

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.484
of bringing trouble
to our world.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:05.196
In simple terms, they're bugs.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.491
And I'm sure you're already
well aware of the danger

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:12.161
that a bug may pose
if left uncorrected.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.997
The system is tasked with
eliminating those bugs.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.041
You will be dispatched
to recover the chips

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.793
embedded in their bodies.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:20.503
You are also called
upon to discover

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:24.966
and report bugs
within the population.

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:27.677
Do you have reservations?

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:30.596
As you know, we're
both company property

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:33.057
if you wish to refuse.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.935
[KABURAGI] I don't intend
to fight the system.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.687
[HUGIN]
That's a good attitude.

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:40.606
Far better than Donatello
and the others.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.442
What does that mean?

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.235
[HUGIN]
They wouldn't see reason.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:47.363
They all refused to follow
the system's directives.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:51.200
We had no choice but to send
them away for corrections.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.244
Are you saying...

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.538
[HUGIN]
Now, repeat after me.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.584
"The world must be
free of bugs."

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.129
Yes, Kaburagi?

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:08.593
Tch. The world must
be free of bugs.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.396
Nah. That's for me to decide.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.233
Isn't that right, Mikey?

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.114
[NATSUME] I'm begging you,
teach me how to fight like that!

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.282
I have to join The Power.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.409
I need it more than anything!

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.244
[KABURAGI]
You're still on about that?

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:36.287
Look at Fennel.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.247
Do what he did
if you have any sense.

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:39.415
He got some work inside

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:41.000
'cause he's been terrified
to come out here

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.126
since the incident.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.129
I won't get killed,
and I won't give up.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.715
You won't convince me, either.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.050
[NATSUME]
If it's like that,

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:52.720
I'm really sorry, Boss, but
you've left me no other choice.

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.722
Please don't hate me for this!

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.600
[gasps] When did you...?

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:58.893
If you won't teach me to fight,

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.771
I'm telling
everybody about Pipe!

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.857
You'll be kicked off Deca‐dence
and left to the wasteland,

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:07.777
and cute little Pipe will
end up in someone's lunch!

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:08.861
Seriously?

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.530
You're gonna blackmail me?

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:13.824
If that's what you take away
from it, then, yeah.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.619
[KABURAGI]
Have fun.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:21.332
[NATSUME]
Sorry.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.042
I didn't mean all of that.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.586
I only took the
photo for myself.

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.755
But why won't you train me?

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.341
[KABURAGI]
I'm living in this cage now.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.469
My whole routine is
set until the day I die.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:38.891
[KABURAGI]
And we're not far from it now.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.316
[NATSUME]
Good evening!

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:49.360
Hi there!
Nice to see you, Natsume!

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.196
[NATSUME] The price has
gotten even higher!

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:55.283
[SHOP OWNER] We're not
seeing a steady supply lately.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.786
There goes all my cash.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.164
Okay, that's it!

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.586
Whoa.

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:07.962
Is that my boss?

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.590
Huh? Who, dear?

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:12.592
[SHOP OWNER]
Natsume!

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.176
What's the matter?

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.767
What the heck?
Where'd he go?

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.271
What's he doing out here?

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.572
No way!

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.076
Could he be...?

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:48.044
What do I do?
What do I do?

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.545
Boss!

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:53.633
You can't do things like this!

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:56.594
[KABURAGI]
Did you see me just now?

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.054
Really.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.931
For yours to be
the last chip I pull.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.808
Who would've guessed?

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.855
Hold on.

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.315
It's not processing you.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.360
Nothing you've said to me
makes a damn bit of sense, Boss!

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:13.277
But what's important here

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:16.739
is that you were pickpocketing
that passed‐out guy!

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:19.784
That can't be the kind of person
you truly are inside, can it?

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.286
I believe you're
stronger than that!

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.996
Even if you're feeling
caged right now.

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:26.082
You can't give up on yourself.

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:28.376
You gotta stay in the fight!

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:33.047
If you need money that bad,
then here, take this!

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:35.091
It's as much as I can give!

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:43.224
[laughs]

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.393
Don't you dare laugh at me!

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:48.020
Are you too good for
my pathetic life savings?

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:50.856
[KABURAGI] You win.
I've picked my last pocket.

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:51.607
Just go home already.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.193
[NATSUME] You're still
mocking me, you jerkwad!

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.114
[KABURAGI]
It makes no sense.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:01.033
All the humans are
managed through chips.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:03.077
She thought I was
pickpocketing the guy,

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.496
but she still should've
been processed.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:09.792
What?

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:12.128
How is that possible?

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.803
[gasps]

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:23.764
No way.

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:28.686
Does this mean that the system
doesn't recognize that girl?

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.438
A bug.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.940
So! The long and short of it is,

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:35.317
they didn't let me
enlist in The Power.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.528
Isn't that crap?

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:43.492
[KABURAGI]
Mikey. Listen. I think.

00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:55.296
That smile is
creepin' me out, kid.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:56.756
What exactly changed your mind

00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:59.216
about helping me
become a soldier?

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.428
[KABURAGI]
Good question.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.765
Guess I was curious about how a
bug could get by in this world,

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:07.725
if someone gave it a chance.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.311
Okay, and when you say bug...

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:12.354
[KABURAGI]
I mean you.

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:15.566
As in, a tiny, weak,
annoying creature.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.693
[NATSUME]
Can you stop being a jerk?

00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:20.321
[KABURAGI] Promise you won't
keep trying if you suck.

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:22.656
[NATSUME]
Uh! I refuse.

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.869
Wow, this place is awesome!

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.704
Uh‐huh. First time?

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:33.083
[NATSUME] I'm not in The Power,
so yeah, obviously.

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:38.881
[NATSUME gasps]
So this is the Gears' base!

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:42.510
It's like I've stepped
into another world!

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:47.264
This is so cool!

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.141
Skin shop?

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:51.143
Like, they sell skin?

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.854
Hey, wait a minute!

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:58.234
[KABURAGI] If the world
must be free of bugs,

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:01.195
she can't be allowed
to go on living.

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:05.616
[KABURAGI] If the world
must be free of bugs,

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.953
this girl's existence
is devoid of value.

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:12.581
[KABURAGI]
But in that moment,

00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:15.584
I know, without a doubt...

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.338
...she saved me.
