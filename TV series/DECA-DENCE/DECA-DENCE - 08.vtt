WEBVTT

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:15.474
I can't just give up and
let everyone die, right?

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:17.017
I have to fight!

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.783
You wanna destroy
the Gadoll factory?

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:33.992
The guy's lost it.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.161
You been huffing
Gadoll jenkem or what?

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.914
All of that build‐up
for that? Dumbass.

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:42.292
Jeez, Kaburagi, you back
there pregaming or something?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.544
Look around you.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.755
What's crazy is the system
that put us in here.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:49.299
The only sane thing is
to do what I please.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.217
[TURKEY]
Hmph!

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.135
You wanna get yourself
killed, go do it

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:53.762
and leave the rest
of us out of it.

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:55.806
[KABURAGI] We're more
than cogs in a machine,

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:58.767
and if the system refuses
to let us live free,

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.978
there's no reason
to let the system live.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:01.770
[gasps]

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.397
Wow, edgy.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.899
Shoulda found a deeper hole
to throw you down.

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.150
Right?

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:07.943
Wait, Boss?

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.945
[laughs]

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:12.197
Pickin' a fight with
the whole damn system.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.657
That sounds fun as hell!

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.284
Boss, just hold on a second.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.119
Going along with
this is suicide!

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.121
[DONATELLO]
Shut it, wimp!

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:23.792
We might not get another chance
to shake things up like this!

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:24.459
Hey, guys?

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.004
Hate to interrupt, but can
you think for a little bit?

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.465
We have absolutely no chance
of getting out of this prison.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:31.883
There's a lake above us.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.970
Climb the poop chutes and you
catch a payload on its way down.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:37.598
Take a personnel tunnel,
the game police catch you.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.225
So what exactly do you
think we're gonna do?

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.228
[KABURAGI]
We get in through the game.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.397
Everyone logs into Deca‐dence.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.609
We can use the avatars
to infiltrate the factory.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.737
Sorry to tell you, that's
not gonna work either.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.947
There's an invisible
barrier around the factory

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:55.532
to keep out the rank‐and‐file,

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:58.160
which activates when it comes
in contact with a chip.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.079
It instantly log us out
if we try to step across it,

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.291
and a Tanker would
drop dead on the spot.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.877
Screw it, we can just climb up
the tunnels from here!

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.129
Have you been paying
any attention?

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.380
[DONATELLO]
You sassin' me?

00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:13.383
What if I could get you
an unchipped avatar?

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:16.511
When a player gets banned
from Deca‐dence,

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.222
they terminate the account,
pull the avatar's chip,

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.350
and destroy the avatar itself.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.601
If you know that much,

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.562
I'm guessing you know that the
game police handle the disposal,

00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:28.273
and there's nothing
we can do to about them.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.901
That's true, once they've
picked up the body,

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:34.613
but there's one avatar
they never found.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.239
Mine's still in one piece.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.283
[DONATELLO]
What makes you so sure?

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.409
[KABURAGI] Minato and I
have known each other

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.619
for a long time.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.038
No way he's not keeping
it stashed somewhere.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.374
You mean, the commander
of Deca‐dence?

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.669
That seems like a pretty flimsy
rationale if you ask me.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.462
Nah, Minato would do that.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.547
Minato would definitely do that.

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.633
Uh... Uh?

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:55.467
For whatever reason,

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.178
you three all seem oddly
certain about this.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.346
[KABURAGI]
It's the truth.

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.098
But even so, that doesn't mean

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.809
he'll be willing to tell us
where he's hidden it.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.437
If he has it, then
finding it's no big deal.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.147
Fine, I'm in.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.400
Lemme go figure out
where your corpse is.

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.026
We're doing this.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.861
You wanna back out,
now's the time.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.488
Hah! Yeah, like hell.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.615
You know how much
I like to party!

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:22.077
It's not happening without me
anyway, so you're welcome.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.037
[sighs]

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.542
Well, knowing me, I'd just
be a liability out there.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.877
You think we're lettin'
you walk away from all this?

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:31.545
Huh?

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.965
Of course not, sir, I don't
know what came over me!

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.175
Your grip is very strong.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.388
Let's get my avatar back.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.612
[JILL]
Commander!

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:21.863
How ya been?

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:25.283
Hmm. Why am I getting
so many of these recently?

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.952
[JILL] So what's all this
I hear about you having

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.454
some decommissioned avatars
stashed somewhere?

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.705
[MINATO]
Hm?

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:31.748
Hmmmm...

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.916
How would I know?

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.001
If you wanna gossip,
you called the wrong guy.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.044
[JILL]
Don't be so cold,

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.880
I'm just trying to make some
friendly conversation‐‐

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.437
So predictable.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.357
[sighs] What were they
going for, anyway?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.483
Dammit.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.569
I should probably
shuffle things around

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.237
even if they were bluffing,

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.989
[buzzer]

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.283
It never ends!

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:10.537
Ah, Commander.

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.997
Pardon my intrusion.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:12.998
Oh?

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.667
[HUGIN] I realize you're
not on duty right now.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.337
However, a recent tip compels me
to impose on your time.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.380
With that said...

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.172
[MUGIN]
Pupipi.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.716
[HUGIN]
...please come with me.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.556
[JILL]
Okay, Try not to draw attention.

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:32.392
Act natural and do your best
to look like you belong.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.477
[DONATELLO] Listen up,
Sark, she's talkin' to you.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.313
[SARKOZY]
Uh. Sure thing, Boss!

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.647
[KABURAGI]
She's talking to you.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:38.690
[DONATELLO]
When I want your opinion,

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.150
I'll knock it outta yer face!

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.903
[TURKEY] Holy hell,
this was a terrible idea.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.865
Cool. Let's go, team.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.034
The gate just up ahead
of here will take us

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.577
to the storage facility.

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:51.828
[TURKEY]
Huh...

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.707
They really do not want
any randos walkin' in there.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.000
[DONATELLO]
So we're here.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:00.003
Now how do we get
through this thing?

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:01.880
Whoa. Hey!

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.298
[gasps]

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:06.885
How long are you all gonna
stand there staring?

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:07.886
I'm not being cute, fellas.

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.888
We've got places to be.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:18.229
[DONATELLO]
There's something goin' on here.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.819
[KABURAGI]
How do you know so much, Jill?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.488
Who are you?

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.032
Nobody. I'm just another bug.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:34.537
[HUGIN]
Commander.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.707
There's a rumor you're in
possession of certain contraband

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.460
and storing it in this facility.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.712
My investigation discovered
an access event

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:45.840
in the log that does
place you here recently.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:49.260
An in‐person investigation
will reveal the truth.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.679
Please do cooperate.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.056
Spare us both some trouble.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.896
[SARKOZY]
Ohohoho...

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.273
Good gravy, they forget
the ceiling and floor

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.191
when they built this place?

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.110
I never knew a
thing about all this.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.571
[DONATELLO laughs]
Fall down and you're real dead.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.115
[JILL]
What were you expecting?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.783
We're standing in
a room built to store

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.494
literally every single
functioning player character

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:15.662
in the entire game.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.122
Obviously it's gonna be big.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.707
Yeah, so, what makes you think

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.750
we're gonna find
the one we came for?

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.168
"Find's" not the right word.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.005
I already know exactly
where we're going.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.006
For the moment,

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:29.884
just step outside here and
get ready to hitch a ride.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.307
Sark, Turkey.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.767
Grab onto that, please.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.393
[SARKOZY]
Yeah.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.395
See, I got this thing with
high places where I kinda‐‐

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.479
Shut up and go, drunky!

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.231
[screams]

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.819
[DONATELLO]
Off to a great start.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.196
[JILL] It's going to stop when
you get to the next block.

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:53.074
Hop off and keep an eye on
the access room door above you.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.703
If anyone tries to get in our
way, that's where they'll be,

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.246
so tell me if you see anybody.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.956
Understood?

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:02.042
Yeah, got it.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.419
[JILL] I'm tracking all
the boxes within the facility.

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:07.505
Follow my lead and I'll
get you to Kaburagi's avatar.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:10.467
Stay sharp and listen close,
I'll tell you where to jump.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.260
That's gonna be
a pain in the ass.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:15.221
Isn't the whole point of this
thing to bring the boxes to you?

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.222
[JILL]
The whole point of our thing

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.141
is not to let them
know we're here.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:21.019
Leaving an access request
in the logs is a big tipoff.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.687
C'mon, like anyone's
reading the logs.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.147
[JILL]
You wanna hop off here.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.108
If you miss any of
my instructions,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.526
we're gonna lose a lot of time,

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.154
so please kindly refrain
from talking when I'm talking.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.072
Ha! Sounds like fun!

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.406
[JILL] Stick to that
scaffold for three blocks,

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:36.034
and grab the box you see
coming from your right.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.878
Just a nip. Here we go.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:54.552
[TURKEY]
We got company.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.555
Minato showed up, along
with frickin' Hugin himself.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:58.306
What gives?

00:09:58.348 --> 00:09:59.099
[KABURAGI]
We get made?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.392
[JILL] I didn't leave
anything for them to find.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.061
But either way, they're here.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.938
We have to pick up the pace.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:05.772
Next you need to go‐‐

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:06.815
[gasps]

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:07.857
[KABURAGI]
What is it?

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.193
[JILL] They must have just
called up our box, it's moving!

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.361
[KABURAGI]
Moving where?

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.029
[JILL] I've marked the target
and it should be tracking

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.239
in your visuals.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.492
We're improvising from here;
don't let it out of your sight!

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:18.326
[KABURAGI]
There it is.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.286
Damn!

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.164
[DONATELLO] All right, Kabu,
what the hell do we do now?

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:23.915
Stay on it.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.750
The plan falls apart without it.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.545
We have to get to that box
before it gets to them!

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.380
Hah! Sounds good!

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.305
[screams]

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.015
I heard a sound
I shouldn't have.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.351
I believe that calls
for an inspection.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:46.062
Mind the controls
until I return.

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:50.233
[caws]

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.319
Now, then...

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.604
Shut it now!

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:28.438
[SARKOZY]
Sorry.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:34.777
[muffled laughter]

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.989
Huh? Aww, I beefed
that one real bad.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.121
Nothing, but I'm sure I heard it
coming from somewhere close by.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.213
You've been a real pantload.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.173
Well that's dealt with!

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.593
[JILL] Good job,
we're almost home free.

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.470
You're in range of it now.

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:03.264
Hah! Don't sound so surprised!

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.768
[KABURAGI]
Good, now we need to secure it.

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.561
Is this a tutorial?

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:12.482
[JILL]
What happened?

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:14.317
[KABURAGI]
Donatello's out.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.944
‐‐[JILL] You gotta keep moving!
‐‐[DONATELLO ] Shit!

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.695
[KABURAGI]
I know.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.285
[JILL]
What's the problem now?

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:27.121
[KABURAGI]
Hugin is out here with me.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.082
[JILL groans]
We're running out of time!

00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:30.625
It's now or never, Kaburagi!

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:31.668
Do it!

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.134
We won't get another shot.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.106
[HUGIN]
Now then, Commander.

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:56.025
If you would be so kind
as to open that box.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.652
Of course.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:04.701
Right.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.995
Well, please keep
such indulgences private

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:09.122
and off the clock.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:10.957
What's going on?

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.293
[HUGIN] Sorry, I didn't
quite catch that.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:14.252
[MINATO]
Pardon me.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.005
I'm talking to myself.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.258
[DONATELLO] Man, you had me
losin' it at the end there,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.052
I gotta say.

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:32.979
So this liquor really is
all you're good for, huh?

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.981
Jeez, I'm really sorry you guys.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:37.692
The fact that Hugin showed up
there is cause for concern.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.986
Yeah, but he didn't
catch us, so screw it.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.613
Question is,
where we gonna go from here?

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.282
Kabu just walks up
into the factory

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:45.825
and starts needling stuff?

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:46.826
[JILL]
That won't work.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.370
He's gonna need at least
one more person with him.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.456
I got one.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.666
We're good.

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:59.005
Come on, Kurenai,
don't beat yourself up,

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.423
you're still new at this.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.799
I can't help it.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.217
Welding just isn't clicking,

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.887
and I'm really trying
as hard as I can.

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:06.971
I don't know how you got so good

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.640
at doing delicate work like that
with that right hand of yours.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.392
[NATSUME] The boss actually
modified it for me

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.394
and made it way more responsive.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:14.937
[KURENAI]
Did he really?

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.230
[KABURAGI]
Hey.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.734

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.462
[DONATELLO]
All right, maggots!

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.547
I thought it over and
decided we're gonna be

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.592
knockin' out that crap
factory way up above us.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.177
It'll be a blast!

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.970
And you're all gonna help.

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:49.097
So who's with me?

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:50.223
[CYBORG C]
Is he being serious right now?

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.474
Nah, there's no way in hell.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.517
[CYBORG E]
We need oxyone!

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.852
C'mon, guys, you're givin' it
way too much thought!

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.690
Look, we just gotta go in
and smash up the place!

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.984
[BUG] I don't want out
bad enough to die.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.653
[JILL]
Can everyone hear me?

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.822
I think you could
use some context.

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:06.989
You spend your days here

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.283
breaking up gigantic
heaps of Gadoll shit.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.160
And what do they do with it?

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.745
[CYBORG F]
Hey. Do we know that?

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:14.247
I think? Maybe?

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.498
[DONATELLO]
I mean, jeez, Jill.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.083
We've all heard that part.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.543
Wait, did we?

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.545
Yeah, back when
we first got here!

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:23.881
They use it as fuel to keep
the whole thing runnin', right?

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.383
That was a lie.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.260
You scoop the crap
into the churns,

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:29.887
the churns funnel the
crap paste to a refinery,

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.306
which distills the crap
into cheap oxyone,

00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:35.601
which they inject
into us every single day.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.437
What?

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:39.313

on dook juice?

You're kidding, right?

Sark's liquor's got poop in it?

[SARKOZY]
Huh?

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.406

But before I can let you go,

you and I need

the Gadoll come from?

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:44.045
[KABURAGI]
Yeah.

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.130
I've been searching
for it since that day.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.174
It wasn't easy,
but I tracked it down.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:51.260
So the end really
is in sight now!

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.095
We gotta go tell

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.472
Hold on!

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.724
The Gears are...

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.143
They won't be able to go.

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.479
It's just gonna be you and me.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.022
Please listen to me.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:04.690
Okay?

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.318
If we can pull this off,
there will be no more Gadoll.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.988
But that's a very big "if."

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.075
There's no guarantee
that either of us survives.

I'm not backing down.

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:42.937
So yeah, Boss, I'm in.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.855
Let's do this.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:50.069
[KABURAGI] All right.
You're amazing. Really.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.153
Uh?!

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:54.365
Huh? That came outta nowhere.

00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:56.409
Sorry, buddy.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.577
You wanna go outside
for a sec, hmm?

00:17:57.618 --> 00:17:58.536
[JILL]
Hey, Kaburagi.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.830
I hope I'm not catching
you at an awkward moment.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.832
[KABURAGI] What do you
think I'm here for exactly?

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:04.500
[JILL] You need to
get back immediately.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.669
Someone came to visit you.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:07.962
[KABURAGI]
They did?

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.467
[GUARD]
We've brought him.

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:14.427
[KABURAGI]
Minato?

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.053
Hey, took you long enough.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.764
Seriously, it was
a real pain getting here.

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:19.890
Yeah, sorry.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.601
But I was just, uh...

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:25.521
[MINATO]
So was this present from you?

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:26.397
[KABURAGI]
Yeah.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:29.567
Is that trying not to
make things harder for me?

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:30.610
You saved me.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:31.694
Thanks for that.

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.322
I tried to save you
and you threw it all away!

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:35.948
I'm here pulling
strings for you,

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.992
then you go and pull this crap!

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:39.660
[KABURAGI] I can't sit
back while the system

00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:41.078
jerks people around.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.913
We don't deserve that.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:43.706
And neither does she.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:46.917
Huh? Who is "she"?

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.669
The Tanker I told you about.

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:49.462
Really...

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:52.048
You're still hung up
on some Tanker?

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:55.176
Get your head on straight, Kabu.
She's just a bug!

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:56.927
[KABURAGI]
She's more than that to me.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:57.887
[MINATO]
Please, think!

00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:59.138
The system made us.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.348
It keeps us going.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:03.351
And it's telling you that kid is
a bug that could destroy it all!

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.478
[KABURAGI] That's what it's
been saying about me, too.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:06.854
[MINATO] Huh?
You know that isn't‐‐

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:09.315
[KABURAGI] Did you decide
to put my avatar on ice,

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.026
or was it the system's orders?

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.778
[MINATO]
Hmmm...

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:17.323
I wish I could understand
how you ended up this way.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:18.574
Once the factory's dead,

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.662
I'm going to deactivate the
system and shut the game down.

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:26.165
Are you hearing
yourself right now?

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:27.792
[KABURAGI] We've been
spending our whole lives doing

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.044
everything the system tells us,

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.588
and it doesn't
feel right anymore.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.300
Can you really
even call it living?

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:38.302
Seeing them makes me jealous.

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:40.805
They have to fight for
everything they've got,

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:43.057
but at least, nobody's
pulling their strings.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.017
They decide for
themselves what they want.

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:47.645
They decide for
themselves how to get it.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:48.771
Why couldn't we‐‐

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.231
[MINATO
"Live the way they do"?

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:52.900
You really believe
that would be better.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.568
I do.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.696
Please, Minato.

00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:58.989
Will you help me
make that happen?

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.245
[laughs]

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.705
Minato!

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:07.707
Huh? [sighs]

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:09.667
Seriously. Wow.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.836
You think you're just gonna
shut the whole thing down?

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:15.631
Set every cyborg free to seek
out their own destiny, right?

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:16.716
It would be chaos.

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:18.759
You'd be taking
everything from everyone.

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:20.886
I realize people need order,

00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:22.263
but still, for what
the system takes from us‐‐

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:24.682
[MINATO] There is
no order outside the system!

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.934
Think about how you got here.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.270
Now you're ready to blow up
the Gadoll factory,

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:32.189
end the world as we know it,
for this idea of "freedom"?

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.734
Doesn't that mean the
system is right about you?

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.403
[KABURAGI]
No! Please, listen!

00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:40.740
[MINATO] There are a million
ways this can go wrong for you

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.575
and one way it can go right.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.037
Give it up.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.581
[KABURAGI]
I can't.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.503
[KABURAGI] Are you gonna
turn me in to the system?

00:20:56.297 --> 00:21:00.176
[MINATO]
Is that what you want from me?

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.680
[MINATO] I thought we could
go back to how things were,

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:05.723
when we were partners,

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:09.560
with enough challenges in front
of us to keep us satisfied.

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.730
I had everything I needed, then.

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:16.567
[SARKOZY]
What?

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.361
No, no way I could do
everyone like that!

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.947
I'm not turning
my back on Kabu and them.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.449
Be reasonable, Sark.

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:25.659
I know you're smarter
than you let on.

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:26.827
Smart enough to recognize

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:29.079
that the system always
wins in the end.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.498
I also know that
this whole scheme

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:33.918
was guaranteed to crash and
burn before it ever got rolling.

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:37.046
'Cause from what I'm told,

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:39.548
the game police are
already on the move.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.468
Guess it's the
scrapheap for us, huh?

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.053
But you have a bargaining chip.

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:46.180
You're the only one
the guards will listen to.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:48.265
You point them to
Kaburagi and the boss,

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.351
they might be willing
to make a deal.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.937
That way nobody else
has to die, right?

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.897
But... Hey!

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:56.565
I think I got a better idea.

00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:59.735
We go tell Donatello the game
police are onto his plan!

00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:01.362
That'll make him back down!

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:02.822
[TURKEY]
Are you joking?

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.074
You know he'd let 'em scrap
everyone in this place

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.117
as long as he got to murk
a few on his way out!

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.577
Ah, so, then‐‐

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:10.037
There's no way around it, Sark.

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:11.539
It's just you and me.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.833
Nobody else can
save our friends.

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.292
What they need is a hero.

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:17.253
That has to be you.

00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:21.090
I could be...

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:22.424
...a hero?
