Repeat after me.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:16.517
The world must be free of bugs.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:24.525
The world will be free,
thanks to bugs.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.980
[gasps]

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.107
[HUGIN] You've certainly
made quite the mess

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.567
of things, Kaburagi.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:09.528
One that will take a great
deal of effort to clean up.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.405
Tell me, is Deca‐dence safe?

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:14.575
[HUGIN] Nobody would gain
anything from you knowing that.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:18.912
You and I have far more
pressing concerns right now.

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.748
I wouldn't take back any of it.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.585
Your "world free of bugs" sounds
completely miserable to me,

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.420
and I want no part of it.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.172
So instead, you've
chosen to become a bug.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.592
It's been right in
front of me all this time.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.927
How did I not see it before?

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.014
Maybe try taking off
those dumb shades?

[MUNIN]
Pipawk!

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.392
[HUGIN]
Well, no matter.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.561
It doesn't change
the obvious resolution

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:43.895
to the problem at hand.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.731
Then do it already.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.110
Pippa! Pippa, pippa, pippa.

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.612
[HUGIN]
That's unfortunate.

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:52.821
I believe that scrapping you

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:56.158
would be the company's
best course of action.

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.161
But a decision was
made to send you off

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.496
for bug correction instead.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.748
That doesn't make sense.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.002
Perhaps someone in some position
of influence feels otherwise.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:09.963
In any case, you've been
given another chance.

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.634
Make the most of it and
set your thinking straight.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.386
I look forward to meeting
you again someday.

[KABURAGI] I guess I
can't really call it hope.

Huh?

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:48.082
For us, it's never too late.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.503
But, truth is, for all I know,
this kid could've gotten killed

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.757
before they even
threw me in here.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.634
[SARKOZY]
Nah, she's fine.

00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:00.595
Oh yeah, seems like the Gadoll
aren't getting up to much.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.137
[KABURAGI]
What?

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.597
Uh! Don't freak out,

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.766
but the way I heard it is
they're docile right now

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:06.100
'cause of the tuning.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.519
The Gears are
gettin' pretty bored.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.147
Huh...

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.274
Hey, Sarkozy!

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:14.943
Where are you getting this info?

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.111
Now you didn't hear
about it from me,

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.529
but some of the
guys rigged up a way

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.074
to log into Deca‐dence
from down here.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:22.742
What'd you say?

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.452
Like this. And this.

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.537
Look at me. There.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.361
[SUBORDINATE]
Incoming, sir.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:12:59.821
New orders from the system.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:00.989
"Reports from all departments

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.865
indicate adjustments
are complete.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:06.286
Resume release of Gadoll
into the field immediately."

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:07.453
Sure took 'em long enough.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.330
Glad they got their
asses in gear.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.749
[SUBORDINATE] They had to build
a whole new update from scratch.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.627
I'll set the first wave
to release this afternoon.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.878
Sounds good to me.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.006
You ready to try again yet, huh?

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.008
You better catch it this time!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.305
I told you not to let it
bounce, you stupid insect!

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.519
[NATSUME]
You've known him longer.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.980
Where do you think he went?

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:39.527
[KURENAI]
Quiet, isn't it?

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:40.862
[NATSUME]
Miss Kurenai.

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.655
Good to see you.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:43.906
[KURENAI] This place
feels totally different

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.534
when there's no
fighting going on.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:47.702
What a sweet face!

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:48.578
Come here.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.538
Who's a good boy?

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.167
[KURENAI] Did you ever
track down your boss?

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.252
[NATSUME]
Uh, no.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:57.545
[KURENAI]
Hmm.

00:13:57.587 --> 00:14:00.298
I wonder where
he could have gone.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.592
Are you okay?

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:03.384
[NATSUME]
Huh?

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:04.218
Oh yeah!

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.971
Any day now, he's gonna
show up here like he never left.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.389
And I'm here ready to smack down

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.558
any Gadoll that
steps up till then!

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.809
[laughs]

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.020
I'm glad to hear it!

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.564
Oh, settle down
ya little sausage!

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.777
[SARKOZY] There's some
real nasty dudes in here.

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:23.321
"Scrap ya for lookin'
at 'em wrong" kinda nasty.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.572
Yeah?

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.240
That's how you react?

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.825
These are full‐blown badasses

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.036
even the guards
don't wanna mess with!

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.080
You should be scared of that!

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:32.830
Yeah, well.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.248
The point is, these
badasses of yours

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.169
have a way back into
Deca‐dence, don't they?

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.254
You're killin' me here.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.466
Buddy, they're not just
gonna let you use it.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:44.926
I haven't bothered keeping count

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.469
of the ones who've
gone to ask 'em.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.096
but I do know this!

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.931
For a fact!

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:51.974
Not a damn one of
'em ever came back!

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.101
Sarkozy.

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.519
Uh, yeah?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.271
I want you to
take me to these guys.

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:02.068
Let's go.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.905
Huuuuuuh?!

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.491
[TURKEY]
Why are you here, Sark?

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:12.245
We're set on hooch for the
month, so could you piss off?

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.788
[DONATELLO]
Let him through.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.164
Well thanks.

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:17.542
Hi there. Hey guys.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.626
What's up?

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.091
You're kiddin' me.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.138
Been a long damn time, pal.

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.806
What gives?

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:34.600
Did the golden boy
turn out to be a bug?

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.060
Donatello.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.895
Your new place stinks like hell.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.939
Shut your mouth,
you arrogant bastard!

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.023
[PUNK A]
You think you're funny?

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:41.816
[PUNK B]
You ready to die, pal?

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.734
[PUNK C]
We'll make you disappear, punk!

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.403
[DONATELLO]
Hold on a sec.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.906
What's a lapdog like you doin',
slummin' it with the strays?

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.701
I bet it's a funny story.

00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:54.662
I came here to
log into Deca‐dence.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.375
[SARKOZY]
Kabu, this is real bad.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.169
See.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.300
From where I sit,

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.135
it looks like you sold
yourself to the system

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:11.053
and let 'em stick you
in an armor repair job

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.514
'cause you were
scared of this place.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.975
You knuckled
under like a coward.

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.977
You wanna ask me for a favor?

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.354
An ass‐beating's
all you deserve.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.486
[KABURAGI] I'm not
an armor repairer anymore.

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:28.029
I'm the same as you.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.655
I'm a bug.

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.991
[laughs]

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:36.412
And what for?

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.707
Why are you so
desperate to get back in?

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.168
There's a certain Tanker
I wanna talk to.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.378
[PUNK D]
For a damn Tanker!

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.756
[PUNK E]
Get a load of this moron!

00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:49.383
[DONATELLO] Look. This place
has rules you gotta respect,

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:50.676
and I know you've
licked enough boot

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:52.762
to understand how that works.

00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:55.264
So how bad you
wanna play, lapdog?

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:59.560
You miss your Tanker buddy
enough to wager your life?

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:02.438
[KABURAGI]
I'll do whatever I have to.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.859
If betting my life is what it's
gonna take, then yeah, I'm game.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:08.277
Heh...

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.738
Everyone hear that?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.324
It's time to party!

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.034
You total imbeciles.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:18.579
[PUNKS] Death Dive! Death Dive!
Death Dive! Death Dive!

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.039
Death Dive!

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.165
[TURKEY]
If you're pumped for this,

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:24.418
let me hear it,
you crazy bastards!

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.920
That's right, suckers.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.172
Time for Death Dive!

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.341
Once again, we've got
another dumbass cyborg

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.469
willing to throw his life
away for a chance to log in!

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:37.765
And that dumbass will
be our first contestant!

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:38.933
A pawn of the system,

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.851
prepared to die horribly
for your amusement

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.771
so he can go see
his favorite Tanker.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:47.233
Kaburagi!

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:50.528
And now, your champion is
making his way to the ring!

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.865
For him, life's a game, and
he's going all in every round!

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.701
Reining king of
the Death Dive ring.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:18:00.246
Dauntless, peerless, shoots
to kill and nothing less!

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.249
Donatello!

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.461
[DONATELLO]
This is a whole 'nother game.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.755
No avatars, just us.

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:12.925
You better make it
fun for me, Kabu.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:15.177
Now here are the rules.

00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:17.263
And don't worry,
we just got two of 'em.

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.889
Those shovels are
the only weapons!

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.266
Whichever one of
you knocks the other

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:21.809
into the tank is the winner.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:22.602
That's it!

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:23.769
Got it? Good!

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:28.107
The rules don't say the loser
has to die, but gravity does!

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:32.069
Okay! Fighters.
Let's get started!

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.738
Prepare to Death Dive!

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.239
Ready.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.158
Go!

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:45.416
Kabu! No!

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.846
[DONATELLO]
Ya havinâ€™ fun, bud?

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.265
Do it!
Toss that trash into the hole!

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.225
Is this really all you got, huh?

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.019
You make me wanna puke!

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:07.355
If you can't even take a swing,

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.148
you'll get knocked out!

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:12.151
Dammit!

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.616
[KABURAGI] No way I'm
gonna go down like this!

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.244
Come on. You look like
a punk bitch right now!

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:29.710
Hey. Leggo! Get off me!
You little‐‐

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:34.423
[KABURAGI]
Don't move!

00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:36.967
[gasping]

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.512
So what do I look like
to you now, Donatello.

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.055
Still a punk?

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.099
[DONATELLO]
Hmm...

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.268
More like an
oversized cockroach.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.479
Who's gonna die!

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:50.106
Game over!

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.191
We're both going down!

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.610
That's how it is, Kabu!

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:59.115
We can finish
this fight in hell!

00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:02.993
Donatello!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.123
He's gone.

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:08.374
That can't be!

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.292
No way!

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.086
Oh, Kabu.

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:14.797
Huh?

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:18.592
Could that be...?

00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:27.309
[DONATELLO]
Bastard.

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:29.979
You brought working
jets into the fight.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.858
[KABURAGI] Yeah, but I didn't
use 'em until it was over.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.569
Hmph! We smell like ripe ass.

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:37.778
He's nuts.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.779
Holy crap!

00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:39.947
They lived?

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:41.699
[sighs]

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:46.996
[DONATELLO barfs]

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:51.959
[DONATELLO]
Why?

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:53.461
I can't say.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:57.757
Just feels like the guy
I wanna be would do what I did.

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:03.387
Kaburagi!

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:04.513
Filthy cheater!

00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:06.098
I'll kill you!

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:13.397
That's enough outta you, Turkey.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:15.566
But... But he...!

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:19.236
You tryin' to
embarrass me or what?

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:22.198
Uh. No, Boss.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:23.908
[KABURAGI]
You had a gun the whole time?

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.494
And I didn't use it
till we were done.

00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:27.912
You kept your word.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:29.997
We'll do the same.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.499
Come with me.

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:34.919
[JILL] You made sure
to scrub the doodoo slurry

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.755
off the soles of your feet?

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.007
[DONATELLO] I scrubbed
everywhere, I told you!

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:42.134
[KABURAGI]
Didn't expect this.

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.761
Woohoo!

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.262
[JILL] Now to be clear,
you're not going to be

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.890
accessing your
old account from here.

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.309
You're going to have
to build a new avatar.

00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:51.727
Your human friend
won't know it's you

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:53.479
when they see you.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:54.480
[KABURAGI]
Understood.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.856
I'll deal with it.

00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:59.068
You really think this was
worth risking your life?

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:00.444
Yeah.

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.946
Hey, your call.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.989
Anyway, you won.

00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.699
[JILL]
All right, we're ready to go.

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.827
[DONATELLO]
Okay. Then do it

00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:09.829
Already was, thank you.
