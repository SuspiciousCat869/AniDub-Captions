WEBVTT

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.932
Okay. Are you ready, Kabu?

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:23.315
Deca‐dence... Activate!

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.613
[MINATO] What's wrong? Why
isn't anyone listening to me?

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:32.407
[OPERATOR C] Commander!
You're here in person?

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:33.867
It's not safe, sir!

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.495
[MINATO]
Hmm...

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.914
Hang on, what's this?

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:41.708
Did someone log
in as Deca‐dence?

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.293
It says the
connection's complete!

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:44.670
Is that possible?

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.547
But it doesn't wanna activate.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.090
What's our plan of action?

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:51.301
We can do something,
but it has to be now!

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.803
Yes, sir!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.471
So what's the deal here?

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:57.516
Ah, crap. Deca‐dence
is just sittin' there!

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:58.892
[NATSUME]
But why?

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.979
I'm not sure, but I do know
Kaburagi's connected to it.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.482
He's gonna have to figure out
for himself how to control it.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:06.650
Connected?

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:10.153
Where exactly is he right now?

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.155
Right in front of us.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.241
Uh?!

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:17.286
[JILL] Kaburagi connected
his core to Deca‐dence.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:18.745
That metal monstrosity is,

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:21.790
for all intents and
purposes, your boss.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:30.507
[shrieks]

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.760
It's not Deca‐dence now.
It's Kabu‐dence.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.220
Awesome name!

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.930
Nice one, Jill!

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:38.140
Eh?!

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.641
Does that mean...

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:41.643
Go ahead.

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:44.104
There's still something
I gotta take care of.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.442
[NATSUME] I swear, that
jerkwad does this every time.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:49.860
Huh?

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.697
He goes off and does his own
thing without saying a word.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.617
[BUG J] But how's he
gonna fight that Gadoll?

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.994
There's chunks
of him everywhere!

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:02.164
I know. We'll make a weapon!

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:02.789
Huh?

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.583
Like a Kabu‐dence Cannon!

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.336
We can build a new arm just
like the one he did for me!

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.338
It can be his weapon!

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.881
[JILL] It's nice that
you're trying to think,

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.050
but the scale here
is a little different.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.010
Well, sure, but it's
still a metal arm.

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:16.136
If they were
smart like the boss,

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:18.347
they'd make all the
parts interchangeable.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.265
Look, you're missing the point!

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.227
You might have tripped
over an idea.

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:26.313
[BUG G]
What's this now?

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:27.230
‐‐[BUG L] What's she doing?
‐‐[BUG H] Do you know?

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.066
[RANDOM BUG C]
Take a guess.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.610
[JILL] So we take the
old pieces lying around.

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:32.903
I could figure out
a usable build,

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.863
but how do we assemble it?

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.532
Oh right,
we turn off the gravity!

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.662
It could work.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.121
What could?

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.832
That goofy idea you
just pulled out of your ass.

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.627
We might be able
to make it happen.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.545
But it'll only
last for one shot.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.673
Well, that'll be enough
for the boss!

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.550
[RANDOM BUG D]
Yeah, we're doin' this!

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.885
[RANDOM BUG E]
Wait. What're we doin'?

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.387
[RANDOM BUG F]
This, dummy!

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.349
Status report.

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:04.351
[OPERATOR C] The reboot
has completed successfully.

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:06.311
[OPERATOR A]
I can't find the issue!

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:07.521
[OPERATOR B]
Low‐level noise.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.523
The system might still be
interfering through hooks

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.441
left in the OS.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:12.859
[MINATO]
Naturally.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:13.735
[OPERATOR B]
What now?

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.946
At this point,
it's out of our hands.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.906
All we can do is trust in him.

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:18.323
[beeping]

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.408
Huh?

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.409
[JILL]
I have an urgent message

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.828
for one Commander
Minato, Retired.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.121
[MINATO]
Huh?

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.752
[pants]

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.129
Was that the last of 'em?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.505
Seems that way.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.590
How utterly anticlimactic.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.217
[KATOU]
Don't lie.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.971
[MINATO] Warriors.
This will be your final mission.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:41.722
[KATOU]
Final?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.265
[ESSAM]
I'm listening.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.766
[MINATO]
Bring up your maps.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:45.642
I've marked the locations

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.311
of several discarded
Deca‐dence parts.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.064
You're to find them
and fill them with oxyone.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.984
These parts will form a
new weapon for Deca‐dence.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:58.572
That'll give me a single shot,
and I swear it will strike true.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.699
I ask this of you, warriors.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:04.119
For the very future
of Deca‐dence.

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:05.954
That sounded
like genuine concern.

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.581
Yeah, that's new.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.082
[RANDOM GEAR AA]
This kicks ass!

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.500
[RANDOM GEAR A]
Let's do it!

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.294
Hold on. What are you doing?

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:12.961
Huh?

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.005
Where are they goin'
all of a sudden?

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:19.092
[KURENAI]
What got into the Gears?

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.385
[DONATELLO]
Hey, lady!

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.053
Huh?

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.556
Are you guys gonna
go back 'em up or what?

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.308
Back 'em up? How?

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.478
On the mission!

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.897
[RANDOM CYBORG A]
Did everyone hear?

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.940
They're about to shut down
Deca‐dence for good!

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.150
[CYBORG A]
They opened the final mission!

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.027
Oh crap, I'm gonna miss it!

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.737
‐‐I'm logging in!
‐‐Me too!

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.489
[RANDOM CYBORG B]
Let's go!

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.159
[SULLY]
Whoa!

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:47.746
Holy craparoni! That's a
crappin' crapton of logins!

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:50.707
Cut the crap!
We just said to log out!

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.793
Why are these schmucks
doing the exact opposite?

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.003
[SULLY]
Crap, that's cool!

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:31.581
Nice! Exactly where
I thought it would be.

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.125
Turn your mission
sideways and cram it.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:38.255
I ain't a scrap digger!
I'm a hunter, baby!

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:41.842
And I got one bigass
trophy in my sights!

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.846
Gotta find the next one.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:46.555
Whoa.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.806
What's going on?

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.267
How is it happening this fast?

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.601
I think we're getting
a sudden rush of players

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:54.396
logging into inactive accounts!

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:55.814
That's great?

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:56.940
All for one!

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:58.316
Last chance we get!

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.818
Join the party!

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.611
Sounds like it's
gonna work out, then.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:02.696
Even if we build the weapon,

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.073
Kabu‐dence has
to work out how to use it,

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.326
so if he can't activate,
this whole area goes squish.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.203
[NATSUME]
What do you mean "goes squish?"

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.580
[JILL]
Imagine us, and your boss,

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.498
and the Gadoll and
everything else around here

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.293
being stuffed into
literally no space.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.086
[NATSUME]
Hmm...

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.922
Okay then.
So why can't he activate?

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.215
Hey, don't ask me.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:23.508
No one's ever even attempted

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.678
to log into Deca‐dence
this way before.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.931
[NATSUME]
Hang on, Boss.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.986
Sorry about that!
I gotta go, guys!

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:49.743
[RANDOM BUG G]
What the hell?

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.120
[RANDOM BUG H]
Is she insane?

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.458
[laughs]

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.001
I think we might
have found someone

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.086
even buggier than Kaburagi!

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.218
‐‐Whoa.
‐‐It's moving again.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.804
Oh dear. Nap time is over.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.730
[KABURAGI]
Where am I?

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.441
[MUNIN] It's outside
the Deca‐dence dome.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.151
One of the many cities
humans built

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:25.570
and subsequently destroyed.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:26.279
In their wake,

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.783
they left a dead zone where
no organic life can survive.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.785
This is where I came into being.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.244
[KABURAGI]
What?

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:35.705
[MUNIN]
To avoid repeating

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:40.293
humanity's many catastrophic
errors, a new entity was needed.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:47.050
[MUNIN] A universal,
independent governing system.

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:48.927
You were the system all along?

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.221
[MUNIN] The Hugin and
Munin forms are merely agents

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.640
used to enact
the system's orders.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.643
The system itself
is not a physical object.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:57.644
[KABURAGI]
What do you want?

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:58.812
[MUNIN]
Only for you to relent

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.272
in this fruitless
expenditure of energy.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.858
Deca‐dence cannot
defeat Gadoll Omega,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.986
as you've surely
determined for yourself.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.405
If I'm dead either way,
then why give up?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.241
Now quit wasting time
and give me admin!

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.250
You won't surrender to a bug?

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.670
[MUNIN] In fact, the presence of
bugs is entirely accounted for

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.005
in the system's design.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:25.714
[KABURAGI]
Since when?

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.590
[MUNIN] The interplay
between the bugs that emerge

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.510
and the entities designated
to eliminate them is,

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:34.556
in itself, a core aspect
of the system's functionality.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.933
Through thorough analysis
of these interactions.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.936
the system devises
robust countermeasures.

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.105
In the aftermath of
a cataclysmic event,

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.481
the system will incorporate

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.609
all new countermeasures
into an upgrade.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:49.571
This is the latest
of many such cycles.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.032
The series of occurrences
you've set in motion,

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.700
and your decision to do so,

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:56.453
are simply steps
in this grand process.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.913
And the cataclysm that
will trigger the next upgrade

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.457
is now imminent.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.876
Indeed, in trying
to subvert the system,

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.587
your actions will
ultimately make it stronger.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.672
You and the resources
you would employ remain

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.299
within the system's control.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.177
The grand process will not slow.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.013
Is that true?
'Cause I think you're scared.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:16.139
[MUNIN]
Hm?

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:16.973
Look here.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.392
I chose to push myself
beyond my limits,

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.895
and I could give a damn
what the system wants!

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:22.896
Hey, Boss!

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.939
You can hear me, can't you?

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.608
Don't you dare give up now!

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.485
We all need you!

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.154
[KABURAGI
'Cause the human who saved me.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.948
Natsume has lived
her whole life like that.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.118
And your system
has never saved anyone.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.578
You say you're in control,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.915
but all you do is react when
you feel your grip coming loose!

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.583
No matter what you say.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.919
Wake up, now!

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.670
[KABURAGI]
I'm gonna do this!

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.512
So shut up and watch me!

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.056
[MUNIN] In every outcome,
you end up dead.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.225
Whatever world
you think you're making,

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.352
you will not be part of it.

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:04.062
Truly a pity.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.440
[gasps]

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.113
[OPERATOR B] All clear! The
interference is gone, Commander.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.864
We have control!

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:24.165
He's awake!
Good to see you again, Boss!

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:27.001
[MINATO]
So nice of you to join us, Kabu.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:30.964
[KABURAGI]
Hey. Deca‐dence... Activate!

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.223
Deca‐dence... Activate!

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.644
[MINATO] Okay. Do you
have what you need, Kabu?

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:47.564
[KABURAGI] Somewhere. I'll need
a minute to find it though.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.315
This is a lot of info.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.235
Focus on the markings
on your map.

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:54.529
I can see you marked
the parts sitting in the desert.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.364
I'm starting to get the idea.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.449
[MINATO] Great. We're gonna
need you to grab 'em.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.576
[KABURAGI]
Understood.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.703
First things first,
let's pop that zone!

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.789
Yes, sir! Launch harpoons now!

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.926
[OPERATOR A]
Gadoll Omega's zone is active!

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:20.054
Ah! Whoa. Hold on!

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.390
[KABURAGI]

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.358
[OPERATOR C]
The light‐guiding pseudo fibers.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.819
They're moving
like living things.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:38.865
[NATSUME screams]

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.450
What is that?

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.703
[JILL] Can all you idiots
please sit still for one second?

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:55.673

This is so sick!

Whoa. The parts

Awesome.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.392
It's true. We can
make this work!

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:13.107
So this is Deca‐dence.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:19.364
Omega's moving!

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.366
It's preparing

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.326
This soon? Kabu!

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:26.579
[KABURAGI] Power's tapped out;
I can't work any faster!

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:30.333

Isn't that Dotkin?

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:52.939
What's he even trying to do?

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.065
Crap, it's the boss!

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.608
That's what happens

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.565
Take care, Natsume.

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:24.330
[DONATELLO]
Under here?

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.415
[MINATO]
Yeah. This is the place.

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:28.584
[DONATELLO]
All right.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.294
Yeah, that's him.

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.380
[NATSUME]
Thank you very much.

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.217
Sorry, Boss.

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:37.843
I kinda flipped out
towards the end

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.054
and broke the arm
you made for me.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.098
But that's okay,
'cause you made it

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.433
so I could change out the parts.

00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:47.853
So just, please know...

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.033
I will always be grateful.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:21.429
[MINATO]
Sorry about the wait.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.140
[JILL]
Wow! You actually found it, huh?

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.101
Yeah, we managed to dig it out
from under some of the wreckage.

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:29.103
That sounds like
a whole barrel of fun.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.104
Not a big deal.

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.064
You're dealing
with the hard part here.

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:34.275
It's what I'd be
doing anyway.

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:35.693
Studying bugs is my thing,

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:38.571
and our interests
happened to coincide.

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:40.865
How's the
Supreme Administrator gig?

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.950
[MINATO] I'm learning
all kinds of things.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.160
Mainly all the
different problems

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.828
I can't do anything about.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.705
Just gotta keep
updating the new system

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.749
and improving it
one step at a time.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.043
How about helping those
two help me help us?

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:56.839
I'd rather shovel shit.

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.883
It was worth a try.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.593
By the way,
you've sure got a lot of that

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:02.803
whatever‐you're‐
looking‐at‐there.

00:21:02.845 --> 00:21:03.971
What are you looking at?

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:05.931
[JILL]
A big hodgepodge of random data.

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:07.933
Breakdown of Gadoll
fecal composition,

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:11.228
a recipe for oxyone booze,
how to train your new Donatello,

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.565
and so on and
so forth, blah, blah.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:15.733
[MINATO]
What's this?

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:19.320
Huh. Yeah, good question.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.363
Come to think of it,
when I was upgrading Kaburagi,

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:23.949
I also grabbed some data
to make a backup of...

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:25.910
Of his core.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:38.464
[NARRATOR]
Welcome to Deca‐dence City.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:42.092
A revolutionary civilization‐
building entertainment facility.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.761
Customize a farming tool

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.514
to your specifications
in the farming area.

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:50.643
And help raise a bumper crop
along with our Tanker allies!

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.603
Then, head to
the attraction area

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.314
in the former core
of the fortress.

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:59.235
Feel the gravity‐defying rush
of a dynamic new sport.

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.569
Core Ball!

00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:01.737
[laughs]

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:04.073
Not bad, girl!

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.991
Yeah, bring it!

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.410
[NARRATOR] And the spirit
of Deca‐Dence lives on.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.746
Experience the thrill of combat

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:13.499
in the battle area's
ultimate fighting event!

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:16.752
It's so creamy and sweet,
you can't even taste the Gadoll!

00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:17.378
Hey!

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:19.380
There's actual work to do!

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:22.967
[NARRATOR] And now,
you can observe your favorite

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:27.054
former Deca‐dence foes without
danger in the Gadoll area.

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:30.099
And even take one home
to raise for your own!

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.810
Oh my gosh. Don't do that!

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:34.353
[laughs]

00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:35.479
They like you!

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:37.815
[NARRATOR] And in the open
and airy residential district,

00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:40.734
the Tanker spirit shines
through brighter than ever!

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:43.320
In a bustling city where
Tankers and Cyborgs

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:46.824
can live and work side by side!

00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:47.950
Beyond the walls,

00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:50.661
you and your friends can
make new memories together,

00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:53.330
by forging into
the uncharted surface

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:55.708
lands on a field expedition!

00:23:16.854 --> 00:23:18.314
[GIRL]
Bye‐bye, miss!

00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:20.566
[BOY] That was fun!
We'll be back soon!

00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:22.443
Thanks! Later, guys.

00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:24.278
See ya next time!

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:28.574
[NATSUME] Ahh, man. That's one
more day in the books, right?

00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:50.596
[gasps]
