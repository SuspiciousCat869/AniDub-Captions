00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:13.514
[NATSUME]
What exactly changed your mind

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.641
about helping me
become a soldier?

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.975
[KABURAGI]
Good question.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:20.187
Guess I was curious about how
a bug could get by in this world

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:22.147
if someone gave it a chance.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.942
Does this mean
that girl's a bug?

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.453
So please, hang on.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.205
Dad's gonna be home real soon.

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:39.623
Wait for me.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.710
[MURO]
Get moving, now!

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.295
[AID UNIT]
Yes, sir!

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.591
[MEDIC A] She needs a
transfusion! Get her more blood!

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.136
[MEDIC B]
Why is there a kid here?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.015
[MEDIC A]
Shit, no pulse!

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.230
[MEDIC A]
Pushing two cc's epinephrine!

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:05.065
Hang in there, kid!

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:08.777
[gasps]

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:09.486
Yes!

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:11.113
[MEDIC B]
We got her back!

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.406
[MEDIC A]
She's a tough one.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:13.782
[MEDIC B]
Thank goodness!

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:19.621
[KABURAGI] So she made it back,
but her chip stayed dead.

00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:58.220
[NATSUME] Huh? We're jumping
straight into an actual fight?

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.389
[KABURAGI] That's the
fastest way to go about it.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.891
I can't guarantee
you'll get into The Power.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:06.395
But I can at least teach you to
keep yourself alive in battle...

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.730
...if you can handle it.

00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:11.274
[NATSUME]
Yeah? Well bring it on!

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:14.861
What's that doing here?

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:15.862
All right.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.740
Spoonwormers are pretty weak
and completely edible,

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.909
the perfect training target.

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.954
Lots of Gears start with these.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.122
Is that so?

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:28.083
Step one. You need to make
the Gadoll deploy its zone

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.001
when you're ready
to start the fight.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.508
Boss, I'm not ready.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.468
Can't we slow down a little?

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.178
[KABURAGI]
Do you know about zones?

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.805
Cool, guess not.

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:44.766
Zones. They're like
the Gadoll's shields, right?

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.435
[KABURAGI sighs]

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.937
The Gadoll do use them
to defend themselves,

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.814
but there's more
to it than that.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.482
Inside the zone is
a magnetic field

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.609
that makes gravity unstable.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.237
Uh! No, no, no, wait!

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.412
What's this weird light?

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:06.955
[KABURAGI]
See the magnetic waves?

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:07.873
Maybe.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.916
Is that what the
little sparklies are?

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.917
That's right.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.837
And these tanks allow us
to ride on the waves.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.798
I see. What's that?

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.717
[KABURAGI]
Those are the arteries

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.802
that pump oxyone
through its body.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.262
[NATSUME]
Oxyone.

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.972
Gadoll blood, right?

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:25.390
[KABURAGI]
Exactly.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.767
It's the fuel that
drives everything,

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.102
including Deca‐dence itself.

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:31.438
You need oxyone
to fire your weapons.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.399
You also need it to ride
the magnetic waves.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:38.320
If you run out, you got no
defense and no movement.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.238
In other words, you're screwed.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.866
So never let your tank run dry.

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:45.577
Lucky for you,
staying close to loose oxyone

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:49.206
will siphon it up
automatically into the tank.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.916
Great, understood.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.543
[KABURAGI] Mid‐size Gadoll
regenerate their health quickly.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.171
To take 'em down,
you have to get 'em bleeding.

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:59.758
But if we try to hit
one from this distance,

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.095
we're not gonna
reach the arteries.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.183
[gasps]

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:09.893
It can transform!

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.107
So we can't strike
from a distance,

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.193
and it regrows lost limbs.

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:20.320
Gotta get in
and smack it around.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:21.279
Best of luck.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.697
Huh?

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.246
Just relax your body
and ride the waves.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:30.747
Concentrate.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.251
It's no real danger
to you except for its tail.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:35.752
Hit the arteries.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.170
Hey, are you listening to me?

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.214
How am I alive?

00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:41.132
[gurgles]

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.136
[KABURAGI]
Watch.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.810
[KABURAGI]
Here!

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:06.199
[KABURAGI] Fighting Gadoll
is about efficiency.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.367
You're trying to bleed them dry

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.620
using as little of your own
energy as possible.

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.289
[NATSUME]
Got it, Boss.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.460
[NATSUME]
I don't feel so good.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.629
[KABURAGI]
No whining allowed.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:20.839
I wasn't.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.550
I was just letting you know.

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.635
Hey. Do you see that?

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:26.177
[NATSUME]
Huh?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.514
Over there.
It had a friend nearby.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.518
[screams]
What's the deal with this place?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.771
I guess we must be near a nest.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:40.066
Or a tutorial zone,
depending on who's asking.

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:43.695
Huh?

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.614
Next one's all yours, kid.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.658
Now step up and
show me what you can do.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.037
[gasps]

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.497
Huh? Someone's training you?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.625
Yeah, it seemed like
the right time to start.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.501
The Gadoll are being quiet.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.795
[FEI] And the oxyone's
getting low too.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.756
Man, I am so sore.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.633
It's tough, for real.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.593
But I can't stop pushing myself.

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:10.388
If I get into The Power,
it'll all be worth it!

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:11.848
[FEI]
Please stop.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.850
Huh?

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:17.646
[FEI] Tankers should stay inside
Deca‐dence where it's safe.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.731
I just saw the outside
for the first time

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:23.068
when I went for butchery
duty after a battle.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.486
It's hell out there.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:28.156
I don't see how any of us could
survive in a place like that.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.367
The Gears are natural warriors.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.911
Even they were
dying by the dozen.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:35.121
Natsume, if you
go out there to fight,

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.248
you won't come back alive.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.292
Was losing that arm not enough?

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.002
Huh?

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.046
[FEI]
I didn't mean...

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.340
[NATSUME]
I should probably turn in soon.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.300
I've got training tomorrow.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.474
I don't get it.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:09.364
[yells]

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:23.712
[sighs]

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.672
Every part of me is in pain.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.882
[KABURAGI]
Uh...

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.385
I know they're bred
to fight and all, but still...

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:33.179
...it's insane how easy
the Gears make it look.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.807
You don't know how hard
it is until you've tried it.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:36.808
[KABURAGI]
If you asked one of them,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.351
they'd say it's insane
that there's Tankers

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.186
who want to fight the Gadoll.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.313
Would they?

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.691
I mean there are already
Tanker forces in The Power,

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.276
aren't there?

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.111
[KABURAGI] There are some
Tankers who have authorization

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.571
to fight with them,

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.907
but the force as a
whole is almost all Gears.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:57.912
Getting authorization puts them
a step ahead of me, I suppose.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:01.166
I always wanted to be just
like Kurenai when I grew up.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.959
[KABURAGI]
Hmm?

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.045
[NATSUME]
The Tankers' greatest champion.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.880
Queen of the battlefield.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:09.799
She's been my idol ever
since I was little.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.553
Beautiful, crazy powerful,
and a natural born leader.

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.221
Everything I wanna be.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.557
So you wanna fight
alongside Kurenai?

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:18.892
[gasps]

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:19.976
[KABURAGI]
You know you don't have to join

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:23.146
The Power to take
part in the battle.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:26.483
I'm not sure I have
what it takes.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.568
Are you giving up?

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.367
[GEAR A] Pulled the
trigger on a new piece.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:39.704
[GEAR B] Nice. Can't wait
to get out there again.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:43.708
No way.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.168
I'm going to join The Power.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.629
And I'll do whatever it takes!

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.382
No more whining from now on.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.842
Sir!

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.557
[KABURAGI] Your body's
gotta get used to floating!

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.435
And it's never gonna happen
if you stay that tense!

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:07.148
[KABURAGI] Relax and let
yourself ride the waves!

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.652
[KABURAGI]
Quick and smooth.

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:11.820
No wasted motion.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:15.657
Keep doing it until you can load
the needle cleanly every time.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:18.535
The regulator lets you throttle
the flow of your oxyone.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.912
Crucial for navigation
and evasion.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.348
I got it. Look, Boss!

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.267
I got the Spoonwor‐‐

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.855
[KABURAGI]
Situational awareness.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.940
Don't drop your guard.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.493
[HUGIN]
Kaburagi.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.622
For 13 days,
five hours, and 28 minutes.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:48.291
You have performed
no recovery work.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.877
Because you haven't
been giving me any leads.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.755
It would seem you've
misunderstood your function.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:55.256
Recovery agents are expected

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.009
to actively seek out
and report bugs.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.053
Notwithstanding the
peculiar circumstances

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.638
of your employment.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:05.433
Would you assert that there
are no bugs around you?

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:06.726
[KABURAGI]
Guess so.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:07.977
[HUGIN]
You would be incorrect.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:08.937
Now, reassess.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.522
Find the bugs
and eliminate them.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.236
[HUGIN]
You've yet to understand

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:19.447
why the world must
be free of bugs.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.991
Bugs are a threat to order.

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:25.578
Long ago, the humans
failed to maintain order,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.997
and their folly
brought them to ruin.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.874
[MUNIN]
Pepeke, pepeke!

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.961
We exist for the system's
sake and none other.

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:35.338
Do not forget that.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.676
For the world
must be free of bugs.

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:42.470
[KABURAGI]
The world must be free of bugs.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.065
[ANNOUNCER] In the latter
half of the 25th century,

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.525
the pollution in the
earth's atmosphere

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:59.028
reached a critical point,
leaving the planet

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.031
at risk of becoming
completely uninhabitable.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.868
[ANNOUNCER] The concept of the
nation‐state was abandoned,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.578
and transnational firms capable

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.456
of cyborg development
consolidated their power.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.167
As the human population
spiraled toward extinction,

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.878
the cyborg population exploded.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.756
In order to protect our position
as global market leaders,

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.425
we at Solid Quake
acquired the rights

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.885
to the remainder
of the human species,

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:25.471
enclosing a vast tract
of the Eurasian landmass

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.473
in a dome to use
as their habitat.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.685
Giving rise to our cutting‐edge
entertainment experience.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.103
Deca‐dence.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.980
To mitigate the
existential threat

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.940
humankind posed to itself,

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:39.861
our company introduced a fully
autonomous system of governance

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:43.364
able to respond impartially
to all situations.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:46.117
The system determines the most
productive course of action,

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:49.162
which individual units
then carry out.

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.330
Within this framework,

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:54.167
a harmonious and prosperous
new society has formed.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.168
That is all.

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:57.170
Have a profitable day.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.607
‐‐[knocking]
‐‐Huh?

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.317
[NATSUME]
Hey, Boss!

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.320
Come on, rise and shine!

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.197
What for?

00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:25.865
[NATSUME]
Sorry, I know it's your day off,

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.451
but there's something
I wanted to‐‐

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:33.956
[NATSUME]
Pipe! I'm so glad you remember‐‐

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.958
He just wants to get out.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.544
That's actually perfect.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.671
Guess what I brought with me?

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:43.674
Tada!

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:47.303
It looks great and it's
exactly the right size!

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:48.763
What's your game, here?

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.766
You said that you didn't want
anything for yourself, right?

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.060
So you made
whatever that thing is?

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.479
It's a disguise so
Pipe can go outside.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.106
[KABURAGI]
Hm.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:58.856
What?!

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.650
Yeah! It'll be fine.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:04.737
Nobody'll think anything of it.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.155
[KABURAGI]
Stop. Shut that door!

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:07.865
Hey, get back here!

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:15.123
[laughs]
Isn't this fun, Pipe?

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:17.834
[KABURAGI] Do they understand
each other because they're bugs?

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.503
[NATSUME]
Look at that smile!

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.005
[KABURAGI]
Ugh!

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:26.342
[laughs]

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:27.260
Great.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:29.554
Does this mean you
got what you came for?

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.390
Uh... Well, not quite.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.101
[KABURAGI]
That's true.

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:36.936
Wasn't sure you noticed.

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.020
[NATSUME]
Yeah.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:38.938
When the moment comes,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.692
I'm always a little bit slow
on the control lever, right?

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.402
[KABURAGI] And that
little bit could get you killed

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.487
in a real fight.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.157
[NATSUME] I know.
Problem is, trying to use

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:52.160
the weapon with my
right hand would be worse.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:54.495
How do I put it?

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:57.457
My life would be so much
harder without this,

00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:59.459
I know I'm lucky to have it.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.879
Really, my arm's a blessing.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.256
I treasure it.

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:08.176
But sometimes.

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.094
I can't help feeling
like it's also the thing

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.596
that's holding me back.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:15.057
Just a big metal weight
that I can't get rid of.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:20.563
Then I start feeling
guilty, y'know?

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.732
It deserves better than that.

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:28.362
Sorry, Boss. Guess
I lost my train of thought.

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:30.281
[KABURAGI]
Come with me.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.742
[NATSUME] Uh.
Wait, where are we going?

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:40.791
Boss. Are we in danger?

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.877
'Cause this place is
sketching me out bad.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.462

Well, hey, there!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.523
There's a rare sight.

Kaburagi with company.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.901
And even a pet? Who knew?

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.448
Hm? What's that arm?

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.575
Looks like a pretty old model.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:15.826
Bring it here, lemme see.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.538
Uh... Don't get any funny ideas.

All right. We'll be in the back.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.997
Bugged.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.208
I should report this,
shouldn't I?

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:57.024
Welcome to your
new home, little buddy.

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.280
Be careful.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.617
They say the world must
be free of bugs, you know?

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:11.372
[KABURAGI]
Shit!
