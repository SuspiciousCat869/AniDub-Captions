00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] Never thought
I'd do waterfall meditation

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
from the comfort
of my own home.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Ema, how did
you pull this off?

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
[EMA] How do you think?
By using an Artifact, of course.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] This is the first I've
heard of an Artifact like that.

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
Okay, the time
has arrived, ladies!

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
Brace yourselves and let
the training commence!

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Mm?

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
Right! Let's do it to it!
Ready Muffy?

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
[EMA] I find your fiery
passion most admirable!

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
Feels kind of nice.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center
Definitely much better
than I imagined it would.

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
It does not!

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
[EMA] The pressure of the
waterfall is not the only thing

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
you should be feeling.

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50% align:center
Meditate and focus on the
magic flowing through you

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
much like the water
flowing over you.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI, KANA]
Okay.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
Seems you've adjusted.
More quality H2O!

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
I-It's way too strong!

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
Hey, come on! Ease up!

00:09:56.846 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Ema! Please!
This really hurts! A lot!

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'll be able to
stand this for very much longer!

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center
I can't take it anymore!

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Such beautiful, sisterly love!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
As tender as this moment is,

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
it will not exempt you from the
intense trial you must endure!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:30.255 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI, KANA gasp, grunt]

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
Destiny... is not
something one can fight.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI, KANA groan]

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
Oh, my! What a sight I've
been blessed with this day!

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness I denied Master
Makoto's request to join us!

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
Huh...? What? Gimme a break!

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunts]

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:07.208 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hey! You're done already?

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
So, how was it?

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
Well I... am most satisfied
with their results!

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
I'm happy for you,

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:17.218 position:50% align:center
though I wish I could've
experienced it, too.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI gasps]

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
No way in a million years
will that ever happen!

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
That training is off-limits
to you, Makoto! I mean it!

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] So sleepy.
Don't wanna go to school.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
That's what happens
when you stay up late,

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
despite being worn out.
It's just unhealthy.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
No joke. Not getting an adequate
amount of sleep is awful.

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
You're so right.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:50.502 position:50% align:center
Ugh. I need sleep to fix this.
Good nigh--er, morning.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
Good nothing! You really think
I'll let you play hooky?

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
It's not considered "hooky"

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
if it's for health reasons.

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
Please bear in mind Lady
Yumemi's decision to stay up

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
late was less about school
and more about practicing.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
She was creating Artifacts.

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
If that's true she's
overexerting herself!

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
You should look in a mirror
when you say that.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? And what would
the point of that be?

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb!

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
We all know you've been running
drills with Muffy nonstop!

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
You've even been talking
to yourself lately,

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
saying things like "Spear Form"
or "Shield Form!"

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
Uh. I figured coming up with
form names would be easier.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
Numbered commands
were kinda tricky.

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.543 position:50% align:center
[EMA] You need to study
more than Artifact making.

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
But... I do. And I'm good at it.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
Then why so tired?

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
They cover the importance
of sleep in health class.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI gasps]
Low blow.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
Amazing.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
Ah. That's right.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
This is the first time you've
seen how my Artifact functions.

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
Seems like it comes in handy.

00:12:56.735 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Yes. It certainly does.
And it's very important to me.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
Well. I have student council
business I must attend to today.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:08.705 position:50% align:center
I'll be leaving ahead of you,

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
but may our paths
quickly reconvene.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
And, if possible,

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
please take good care of your
sister in my stead, Lady Kana.

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
Sure! Done and done!

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE PA VOICE A] Attention
passengers on Windsor Airlines

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
flight four-one-seven
to Paris, France...

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
Hello and welcome to Japan.
We have been expecting you.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Come on, Muffy!

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
Holding three fingers up
means Command Three!

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
Why is this so hard?

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
If I say Command Three, that's
your cue to turn into a sword!

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Everyone... We have
received some visitors.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.251 position:50% align:center
Please come to the
reception room.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.129 position:50% align:center
May I present mister
Gregory Camelot.

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
He is a longtime friend of
my mother, Morrigan Lároutir.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Next to him we have...

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
Hello, my name is Dina Camelot.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
The two of them aren't
from Japan, so they'll be living

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
at the mansion for the
duration of their stay.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
I trust you'll be hospitable.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center
What makes you think you decide
who stays and goes around here?

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
Be at ease, Lady Kana.

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
Your grandmother is not the only
acquaintance Master Camelot

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
has among the members
of your family.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
He is here as a guest
of Master Mamoru.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
[EMA] You are in the presence of
the man who taught your father

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
how to perform magic.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
You're his teacher?
Then that means... Are you?!

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.547 position:50% align:center
Sir Camelot?!

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
Wow! I can't believe it!

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:46.011 position:50% align:center
The greatest illusionist in
all of Britain. Right here!

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
The Queen, herself is the one
who granted him the title "sir"!

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
That vanishing trick,
the Miracle of Big Ben?

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
It's still legendary!

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
Dear boy, that was ages ago.

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
I wanna be just like you!
An absolute master of my craft!

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
A magician who can thrill
and delight any audience!

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
You're the best of the best!

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
Not sure if it shows,
but I'm a big fan.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
Never knew the volume
control for Makoto's voice

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.872 position:50% align:center
could get that loud.
He's pretty excited.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll say.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh... sorry.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
I see. So you're the lad
that Mamoru decided

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.172 position:50% align:center
to take on as an apprentice.

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, sir! My name's
Makoto Shiranui.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
Well, you've probably
already surmised as much,

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
but Sir Camelot came as a favor.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
He's here to teach Makoto
at Mamoru's request.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
Mamoru has nothing
to do with it.

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:38.980 position:50% align:center
Maeve is the one who insisted I
stop by, and it just so happens

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
I have an upcoming
performance in Japan.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
Yes, but the reason my
sister asked that of you

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
was because her husband
asked that of her.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful, sir. Thank you.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
I agreed to provide you
with some useful advice.

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
That said...

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
Pardon me.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
I was fast asleep for the
entire flight and regrettably

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
missed out on the lunch
they offer to passengers.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
I hate to be the one to ask,

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
but could you serve
my master some food

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
before any further discussions?

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.431 position:50% align:center
Feels like he's constantly
hungry because everything

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
he eats goes straight
through him.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
What a delicious meal.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
The kind of food that makes any
journey well worth the effort.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
Truly, sir. You're too kind.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY] I suppose I should
pick up where I left off.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
So you chose to seek out
Mamoru for instruction, yes?

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
Right there.
That's your first mistake.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
He is an unworthy
pupil and has no right

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
to train you in anything.
Is that understood?

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
Uh... Sure.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.675 position:50% align:center
I know why he wants
me to take you on.

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
However, I am a very
busy man these days.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
I already have one apprentice,

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
and I lack the time
needed for two.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
Why burden yourself by teaching
a boy you don't have time for?

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
Besides, I had to beg you for
years before you finally 

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
decided to let me be
your apprentice, uncle!

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
Hmph.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:06.860 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Um, if I may,

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
being a magician has never been
a question of "if" for me.

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
And I think I'm ready to
take it to the next level.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
So please help me
get there, Sir Camelot!

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
Calm down, young man.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
We magicians can't afford to
get worked up, now can we?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
Losing your composure means
someone is influencing you.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
Yet we are the ones who must
influence and inspire others.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
And, as is the case with Dina, 

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center
you may address
me more casually.

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.471 position:50% align:center
You don't have to call
me uncle, by any means.

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
But Gregory will do just fine.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
I could do that.
Master Gregory, then.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
He's not your master yet.
He's debating what to do.

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center
All I can say is don't
get your hopes up.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
Dina.

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:50.362 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY] I still don't know
much about you, Makoto Shiranui.

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
Let's change that by
having you show me

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
one of your magic tricks.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
Oh! Right!

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
As soon as I turn around,
pick a card,

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center
and I need you
to memorize it.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
On my honor as a magician,
I won't peek.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Hmm. It's memorized.

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Perfect! Next, put the
card back in the deck

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
and shuffle it until
you feel content.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Set them on the
table when you're ready.

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Hm.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Okay!

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Now move!

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Tell me, miss.
Is this your card?

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! It is!

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
That trick was
super amazing, Makoto!

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
So, uh. What did you think?

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
Unimpressive.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh...

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
And yet...

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
Master! Why're you
still considering him?

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
His skills are nowhere
near your caliber!

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
You can't even classify
what he did as magic!

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You can too classify
what he did as magic!

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
It was great!

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
No it wasn't. I assure you.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you just need a
proper demonstration of magic

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
to know the difference.

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
I would be more than happy
to enlighten you ladies.

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
[DINA] Remember which
card you've picked,

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
then put it back in the
deck anywhere you'd like.

Ladies, hold your hands
out in front of you.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
[DINA] Those are
your cards, are they not?

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
Whoa. He's right!

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
But, wait! We're not done yet!

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center

[MAKOTO gasps]
That's my card, all right.

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
It's cute how
impressed you all look.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
Especially when you
realize how easy

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
that particular
trick actually is.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
So then, Miss Kana, you still
think what he did is "great"?

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
And that was nothing
compared to what my uncle

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
and mister Mamoru can do!

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
Bravo. Are you happy, Dina?

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.392 position:50% align:center
I think I shall take my leave
and retire to my room.

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
Traveling certainly has
a way of wearing one out.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY] Oh, and I
will be in the country

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
for a few weeks, boy.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
I expect to see a little
more magic before I go.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
Use that time to
hone your skills 

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
and prepare the best trick
you've ever performed.

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
Uh! Right!

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] Makoto's apprenticeship
was just one reason

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
I gathered you here.

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
There's another, more serious
matter we need to discuss.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
The safety and
lifestyle of the family

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
is the village's top priority.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
The only thing that comes close
to that level of significance 

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
is preventing the
misuse of Artifacts.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.189 position:50% align:center
That's why...
it hardly makes sense 

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
for a couple of inexperienced
children to possess such items.

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
Your safety is what's
most important,

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
yet you have danger magnets
everywhere you go.

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
But we still--

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
Don't bother arguing. I need
you to return the Artifacts

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
that are currently
in your care.

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center

place to call home

Telling us to hand over our
Artifacts is one thing,

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
but taking the
mansion is insane!

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.884 position:50% align:center
What makes you think we'd agree?

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
Because it's what
Morrigan Lároutir decided.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
She is the village elder.
If you live in this mansion,

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
you have no choice
but to obey her.
